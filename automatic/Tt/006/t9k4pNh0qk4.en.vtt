hey everyone losing a stave here and
today<00:00:03.300> I'm<00:00:03.419> going<00:00:03.570> to<00:00:03.629> show<00:00:03.780> you<00:00:03.810> how<00:00:03.990> to

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.419 
today I'm going to show you how to
create<00:00:04.440> a<00:00:05.029> pop<00:00:06.029> art<00:00:06.509> photo<00:00:07.290> using<00:00:07.830> Corel

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
create a pop art photo using Corel

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.959 
create a pop art photo using Corel
PaintShop<00:00:08.790> Pro<00:00:09.030> I've<00:00:09.809> seen<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.050> lot<00:00:10.260> using

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:10.969 
PaintShop Pro I've seen a lot using

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:12.950 
PaintShop Pro I've seen a lot using
Photoshop<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.300> can<00:00:12.750> certainly

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
Photoshop and you can certainly

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.090 
Photoshop and you can certainly
translate<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:14.540> commands<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.780> effects<00:00:16.260> but

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
translate the commands and effects but

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.179 
translate the commands and effects but
it<00:00:17.460> would<00:00:17.550> be<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.670> lot<00:00:17.820> easier<00:00:17.850> if<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.660> could

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
it would be a lot easier if you could

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.220 
it would be a lot easier if you could
watch<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.490> video<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.060> do<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:21.449> way<00:00:21.660> I've

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
watch this video and do it this way I've

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.689 
watch this video and do it this way I've
already<00:00:22.590> opened<00:00:22.710> up<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.100> image<00:00:23.310> I've<00:00:23.490> already

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
already opened up the image I've already

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.250 
already opened up the image I've already
duplicated<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.359> layer<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.080> other

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
duplicated the layer and the other

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.130 
duplicated the layer and the other
things<00:00:25.619> you'll<00:00:25.920> need<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.189> do<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.699> put<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.689> layer

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
things you'll need to do is put a layer

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.040 
things you'll need to do is put a layer
in<00:00:28.470> between<00:00:28.529> there<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:30.090> regular

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
in between there that is a a regular

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.350 
in between there that is a a regular
raster<00:00:31.740> layer<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.730> bucket<00:00:33.090> filled

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
raster layer that you bucket filled

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.020 
raster layer that you bucket filled
white<00:00:34.230> okay<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.130> I'll<00:00:35.219> explain<00:00:35.640> why<00:00:35.820> that's

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
white okay and I'll explain why that's

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.209 
white okay and I'll explain why that's
there<00:00:36.300> for<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.649> minute

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
there for in a minute

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.729 
there for in a minute
make<00:00:38.910> sure<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.239> copy<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.750> background<00:00:40.260> is

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
make sure the copy of background is

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.910 
make sure the copy of background is
selected<00:00:41.700> though<00:00:41.850> first<00:00:42.440> all<00:00:43.440> right<00:00:43.590> now<00:00:43.860> you

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
selected though first all right now you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.729 
selected though first all right now you
want<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.340> go<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.640> adjust<00:00:45.600> brightness<00:00:46.289> and

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
want to go to adjust brightness and

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.260 
want to go to adjust brightness and
contrast<00:00:48.140> threshold<00:00:49.140> threshold

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
contrast threshold threshold

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.510 
contrast threshold threshold
the<00:00:51.270> higher<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.440> number<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.890> threshold

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
the higher the number of the threshold

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.540 
the higher the number of the threshold
the<00:00:54.120> black<00:00:54.360> Creek<00:00:54.600> gets<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.949> less<00:00:55.980> detail

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the black Creek gets and the less detail

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.330 
the black Creek gets and the less detail
you<00:00:56.670> have<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.420> lower<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.840> number<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.379> more

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
you have the lower the number the more

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.119 
you have the lower the number the more
white<00:00:59.520> the<00:01:00.030> less<00:01:00.210> detail<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.230> we<00:01:01.440> want<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.010> keep

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
white the less detail so we want to keep

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.620 
white the less detail so we want to keep
it<00:01:02.309> at<00:01:02.399> about<00:01:02.840> 91<00:01:03.860> 91<00:01:04.860> looks<00:01:05.220> good<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:06.240> want<00:01:06.450> a

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
it at about 91 91 looks good you want a

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.190 
it at about 91 91 looks good you want a
stark<00:01:07.320> black-and-white<00:01:08.250> contrast<00:01:09.240> image<00:01:09.840> and

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
stark black-and-white contrast image and

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.300 
stark black-and-white contrast image and
so<00:01:11.150> that's<00:01:12.150> what<00:01:12.510> you're<00:01:12.750> getting<00:01:12.900> there<00:01:13.619> I'm

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
so that's what you're getting there I'm

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.240 
so that's what you're getting there I'm
gonna<00:01:14.549> go<00:01:14.790> ahead<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:16.320> save<00:01:16.590> time<00:01:16.920> I'm

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
gonna go ahead and to save time I'm

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.810 
gonna go ahead and to save time I'm
going<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.700> erase<00:01:18.619> where<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.830> pupils<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
going to erase where the pupils of the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.899 
going to erase where the pupils of the
eyes<00:01:21.119> would<00:01:21.780> be<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.409> there's<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.189> reason<00:01:23.640> for

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
eyes would be and there's a reason for

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.770 
eyes would be and there's a reason for
that<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:25.890> I'll<00:01:26.040> show<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:27.420> minute

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
that and I'll show you in a minute

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.560 
that and I'll show you in a minute
in<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.259> tutorial<00:01:28.579> make<00:01:29.579> sure<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.240> real

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.550 

low<00:01:34.570> setting<00:01:34.990> on<00:01:35.140> there

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
low setting on there

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.620 
low setting on there
erase<00:01:36.340> it<00:01:36.899> do<00:01:38.549> try<00:01:39.549> a<00:01:39.579> little<00:01:39.820> thick<00:01:40.210> there<00:01:40.509> we

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
erase it do try a little thick there we

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.800 
erase it do try a little thick there we
go

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
go

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.609 
go
now<00:01:43.810> again<00:01:44.469> erase<00:01:44.890> that<00:01:45.579> it's<00:01:46.539> probably<00:01:46.869> again

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
now again erase that it's probably again

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.959 
now again erase that it's probably again
a<00:01:47.649> little<00:01:48.100> too<00:01:48.670> much<00:01:50.069> make<00:01:51.069> a<00:01:51.100> mistake<00:01:51.759> hit

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
a little too much make a mistake hit

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:56.219 
a little too much make a mistake hit
ctrl<00:01:52.450> Z<00:01:52.719> or<00:01:53.189> if<00:01:54.189> it<00:01:54.640> using<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.509> eraser<00:01:55.959> you

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
ctrl Z or if it using the eraser you

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.050 
ctrl Z or if it using the eraser you
always<00:01:56.469> right-click<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:57.369> go<00:01:57.490> back<00:01:57.640> over<00:01:57.819> that

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
always right-click and go back over that

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.179 
always right-click and go back over that
spot<00:01:58.390> so<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:02.110> is<00:02:02.380> what<00:02:02.530> our<00:02:02.619> image<00:02:02.950> looks

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
spot so this is what our image looks

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.449 
spot so this is what our image looks
like<00:02:03.399> let<00:02:03.700> me<00:02:04.170> actually<00:02:05.170> do<00:02:05.770> that<00:02:05.979> a<00:02:06.039> little

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
like let me actually do that a little

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:13.770 
like let me actually do that a little
more<00:02:09.780> ok<00:02:10.780> so<00:02:11.670> this<00:02:12.670> is<00:02:12.970> really<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.420> kind<00:02:13.569> of

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
more ok so this is really the kind of

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.630 
more ok so this is really the kind of
image<00:02:14.260> we're<00:02:14.440> going<00:02:14.680> for<00:02:14.920> now<00:02:15.190> what<00:02:15.489> we're

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
image we're going for now what we're

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
gonna do since we've done the threshold

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.280 
gonna do since we've done the threshold
we're<00:02:17.890> gonna<00:02:17.980> go<00:02:18.160> to<00:02:18.220> effects<00:02:19.290> artistic

images<00:02:28.120> I<00:02:28.660> mean<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:29.019> you<00:02:29.170> find<00:02:29.470> and<00:02:30.329> they<00:02:31.329> are

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
images I mean that you find and they are

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.740 
images I mean that you find and they are
circles<00:02:32.680> they're<00:02:33.190> just<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:33.430> bunch<00:02:34.090> of<00:02:34.329> circles

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
circles they're just a bunch of circles

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.710 
circles they're just a bunch of circles
that's<00:02:35.620> what<00:02:35.860> this<00:02:36.010> does<00:02:36.250> with<00:02:36.519> this<00:02:36.760> image<00:02:37.180> it

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
that's what this does with this image it

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.809 
that's what this does with this image it
turns<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.350> into<00:02:40.709> one<00:02:41.709> of<00:02:41.829> those<00:02:42.010> images

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
turns it into one of those images

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.360 
turns it into one of those images
essentially<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.989> higher<00:02:44.200> size<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:45.160> bigger

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
essentially the higher size the bigger

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.340 
essentially the higher size the bigger
the<00:02:45.579> circles<00:02:46.030> are<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:48.100> smaller<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.639> size<00:02:49.350> the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
the circles are the smaller the size the

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.349 
the circles are the smaller the size the
smaller<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.980> circles<00:02:51.519> but<00:02:51.760> also<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.180> more

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
smaller the circles but also the more

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.110 
smaller the circles but also the more
the<00:02:52.540> circles<00:02:52.959> you<00:02:53.139> get<00:02:53.380> so<00:02:53.880> we're<00:02:54.880> gonna<00:02:55.000> leave

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
the circles you get so we're gonna leave

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.550 
the circles you get so we're gonna leave
this<00:02:55.269> it<00:02:55.540> I<00:02:56.459> think<00:02:57.459> to<00:02:57.819> for<00:02:58.180> now

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
this it I think to for now

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.410 
this it I think to for now
by<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.620> way<00:03:00.770> the<00:03:00.920> reason<00:03:01.190> you<00:03:01.310> put<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.910> raster

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
by the way the reason you put the raster

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.330 
by the way the reason you put the raster
layer<00:03:02.599> there<00:03:02.870> was<00:03:03.080> because<00:03:03.319> when<00:03:03.709> you<00:03:03.860> erased

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
layer there was because when you erased

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.180 
layer there was because when you erased
the<00:03:04.880> copy<00:03:05.150> of<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.390> background<00:03:05.800> that<00:03:06.800> white

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
the copy of the background that white

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.800 
the copy of the background that white
raster<00:03:07.730> layer<00:03:07.910> is<00:03:08.120> showing<00:03:08.390> through<00:03:08.630> where

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
raster layer is showing through where

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.990 
raster layer is showing through where
you<00:03:08.930> erased<00:03:09.290> that's<00:03:09.920> just<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.550> rationale

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
you erased that's just the rationale

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.880 
you erased that's just the rationale
behind<00:03:11.120> that<00:03:11.540> now<00:03:12.260> we've<00:03:12.440> got<00:03:12.590> everything

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
behind that now we've got everything

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.410 
behind that now we've got everything
that<00:03:12.920> we<00:03:13.069> need<00:03:13.370> now<00:03:13.910> we're<00:03:14.090> going<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.239> ready

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
that we need now we're going to ready

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.550 
that we need now we're going to ready
start<00:03:14.660> painting<00:03:15.110> we're<00:03:15.980> going<00:03:16.250> to<00:03:17.500> go<00:03:18.500> to

make it darken pick a flesh tone which

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.040 
make it darken pick a flesh tone which
I've<00:03:25.910> already<00:03:26.030> picked<00:03:26.390> out<00:03:28.720> actually<00:03:29.720> no<00:03:30.019> I

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
I've already picked out actually no I

I've already picked out actually no I
didn't<00:03:30.370> pick<00:03:31.370> a<00:03:31.610> flesh<00:03:31.970> tone<00:03:32.300> which<00:03:32.540> I've

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
didn't pick a flesh tone which I've

of<00:03:37.100> the<00:03:37.190> brush<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:38.360> bigger<00:03:39.280> they<00:03:40.280> are<00:03:40.310> the

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
of the brush the bigger they are the

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.030 
of the brush the bigger they are the
better<00:03:40.819> and<00:03:41.180> then<00:03:41.870> if<00:03:42.019> you<00:03:42.170> want<00:03:42.440> to<00:03:42.709> you<00:03:42.890> can

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
better and then if you want to you can

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.030 
better and then if you want to you can
try<00:03:43.280> to<00:03:43.400> go<00:03:44.390> around<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.810> eyes<00:03:44.989> a<00:03:45.019> little<00:03:45.500> bit

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040

it<00:03:46.819> won't<00:03:47.150> hurts<00:03:47.420> too<00:03:47.630> bad<00:03:47.709> if<00:03:48.709> you<00:03:48.920> go<00:03:49.069> over

that's okay it'll work anti-alias is

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.930 
that's okay it'll work anti-alias is
checked<00:05:41.889> and<00:05:42.889> I'll<00:05:43.370> show<00:05:43.580> you<00:05:43.669> all<00:05:43.729> those

checked and I'll show you all those

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.530 
checked and I'll show you all those
settings<00:05:44.180> here<00:05:44.570> in<00:05:44.660> a<00:05:44.720> minute<00:05:44.870> all<00:05:45.680> right

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.840 
so there we go all those now on that
peach<00:05:53.340> layer<00:05:53.610> hit<00:05:53.880> delete<00:05:54.300> and<00:05:54.560> then<00:05:55.560> on<00:05:55.920> your

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
peach layer hit delete and then on your

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.610 
peach layer hit delete and then on your
copy<00:05:57.210> of<00:05:57.540> background<00:05:58.200> hit<00:05:58.530> delete

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
copy of background hit delete

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
copy of background hit delete
essentially<00:06:01.620> what<00:06:01.740> that<00:06:01.770> does<00:06:02.070> is<00:06:02.250> the<00:06:02.430> same

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640 
essentially what that does is the same

later then I did I should have done it
all<00:06:10.200> at<00:06:10.290> the<00:06:10.350> same<00:06:10.470> time<00:06:10.790> now<00:06:11.790> we're<00:06:12.060> going<00:06:12.240> to

doesn't like blue I go to about 11 on
here<00:06:26.810> when<00:06:27.810> I've<00:06:27.900> got<00:06:28.080> this<00:06:28.590> size<00:06:29.120> and<00:06:30.710> make

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
here when I've got this size and make

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.230 
here when I've got this size and make
sure<00:06:31.920> you're<00:06:32.070> on<00:06:32.160> the<00:06:32.190> right<00:06:32.310> layer<00:06:32.610> you're

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
sure you're on the right layer you're

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.540 
sure you're on the right layer you're
gonna<00:06:33.360> be<00:06:33.570> on<00:06:33.720> this<00:06:33.990> layer<00:06:34.230> again<00:06:34.620> you<00:06:35.130> can<00:06:35.340> use

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
gonna be on this layer again you can use

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.060 
gonna be on this layer again you can use
different<00:06:35.790> layers<00:06:36.180> for<00:06:36.720> this<00:06:36.930> and<00:06:37.710> make<00:06:37.860> sure

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
different layers for this and make sure

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.530 
different layers for this and make sure
you've<00:06:38.220> selected<00:06:38.520> nothing<00:06:39.590> selections<00:06:40.590> none

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.540 
you've selected nothing selections none

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.040 
you've selected nothing selections none
that<00:06:42.540> way<00:06:42.660> that's<00:06:42.900> not<00:06:43.110> select<00:06:43.440> anymore<00:06:43.910> also

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
that way that's not select anymore also

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.050 
that way that's not select anymore also
like<00:06:46.050> I<00:06:46.080> said<00:06:46.140> you<00:06:46.380> can<00:06:46.530> do<00:06:46.680> different<00:06:47.060> colors

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
like I said you can do different colors

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.060 
like I said you can do different colors
on<00:06:48.240> different<00:06:48.540> layers<00:06:48.660> but<00:06:49.230> I<00:06:49.530> do<00:06:49.590> them<00:06:49.920> all<00:06:50.040> on

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.070 
on different layers but I do them all on

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.970 
on different layers but I do them all on
the<00:06:50.310> same<00:06:50.520> layer<00:06:50.900> it's<00:06:51.900> just<00:06:52.200> simpler<00:06:52.680> for<00:06:52.950> me

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:52.980 
the same layer it's just simpler for me

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:57.530 
the same layer it's just simpler for me
easier<00:06:53.370> for<00:06:54.030> me<00:06:54.180> and<00:06:55.430> there<00:06:56.430> you<00:06:56.700> go<00:06:56.910> that<00:06:57.360> is

easier for me and there you go that is

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.990 
easier for me and there you go that is
