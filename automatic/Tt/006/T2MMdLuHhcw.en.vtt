foundation<00:02:29.900> bit<00:02:30.080> of<00:02:30.200> fun<00:02:30.410> that<00:02:30.680> this<00:02:30.830> brush<00:02:31.190> is

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
foundation bit of fun that this brush is

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.449 
foundation bit of fun that this brush is
the<00:02:31.489> best<00:02:31.910> for<00:02:32.390> this<00:02:32.510> foundation<00:02:33.380> so<00:02:33.769> now<00:02:34.099> I

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
the best for this foundation so now I

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.460 
the best for this foundation so now I
just<00:02:34.849> go<00:02:35.090> ahead<00:02:35.269> and<00:02:35.480> apply<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:36.080> little<00:02:36.380> bit

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
just go ahead and apply a little bit

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.410 
just go ahead and apply a little bit
more<00:02:36.709> concealer<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.459> my<00:02:37.670> nose<00:02:37.910> because<00:02:38.269> I

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
more concealer to my nose because I

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.390 
more concealer to my nose because I
always<00:02:38.660> feel<00:02:39.050> like<00:02:39.080> my<00:02:39.290> nose<00:02:39.350> needs<00:02:39.860> a<00:02:40.100> little

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
always feel like my nose needs a little

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.690 
always feel like my nose needs a little
bit<00:02:40.610> more<00:02:40.760> coverage<00:02:41.350> there<00:02:42.350> it<00:02:43.280> always<00:02:43.430> seems

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
bit more coverage there it always seems

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.190 
bit more coverage there it always seems
like<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.940> foundation<00:02:44.450> doesn't<00:02:44.630> last<00:02:44.930> as<00:02:45.170> long

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
like the foundation doesn't last as long

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.020 
like the foundation doesn't last as long
I<00:02:45.590> guess<00:02:45.769> because<00:02:46.069> your<00:02:46.250> nose<00:02:46.400> is<00:02:46.549> kind<00:02:46.790> of<00:02:46.880> out

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
I guess because your nose is kind of out

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.240 
I guess because your nose is kind of out
there<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:47.720> you<00:02:47.930> touch<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.350> a<00:02:48.410> lot<00:02:48.620> so<00:02:49.040> I'm<00:02:49.130> just

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
there and you touch it a lot so I'm just

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.190 
there and you touch it a lot so I'm just
going<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.430> blend<00:02:49.640> this<00:02:49.730> out<00:02:49.970> on<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:51.019> nose<00:02:51.170> with

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
going to blend this out on the nose with

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.710 
going to blend this out on the nose with
the<00:02:52.840> f-86<00:02:53.840> brush<00:02:54.459> okay<00:02:55.459> next<00:02:55.700> if<00:02:55.940> I<00:02:56.090> have<00:02:56.330> any
