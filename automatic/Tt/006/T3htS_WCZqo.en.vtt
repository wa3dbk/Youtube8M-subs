you want me to go over that dog walk

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.330 
you want me to go over that dog walk
bang<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:08.840> going<00:01:09.020> over<00:01:09.110> to<00:01:09.170> dog<00:01:09.380> walk<00:01:09.560> she

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
bang and going over to dog walk she

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.960 
bang and going over to dog walk she
flies<00:01:10.790> over<00:01:11.410> so<00:01:12.410> the<00:01:12.920> trick<00:01:13.520> with<00:01:13.550> her<00:01:13.730> is<00:01:13.940> like

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
flies over so the trick with her is like

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.510 
flies over so the trick with her is like
control<00:01:14.480> to<00:01:14.630> go<00:01:14.720> out<00:01:14.810> to<00:01:14.870> slow<00:01:15.050> down<00:01:15.520> so

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
control to go out to slow down so

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.340 
control to go out to slow down so
because<00:01:16.790> dogs<00:01:17.420> are<00:01:17.570> so<00:01:17.660> different<00:01:17.870> to<00:01:18.050> think

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
because dogs are so different to think

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.500 
because dogs are so different to think
about<00:01:18.470> safety<00:01:18.800> for<00:01:18.950> your<00:01:19.010> dog<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:19.430> that's<00:01:20.360> why

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
about safety for your dog and that's why

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.000 
about safety for your dog and that's why
I<00:01:20.780> am<00:01:20.990> going<00:01:21.170> to<00:01:21.230> build<00:01:21.320> this<00:01:21.470> that<00:01:21.710> it<00:01:21.830> goes<00:01:21.950> to

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
I am going to build this that it goes to

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.070 
I am going to build this that it goes to
a<00:01:22.100> maximum<00:01:22.310> height<00:01:22.640> of<00:01:22.700> 2<00:01:22.910> 4<00:01:23.650> so<00:01:24.650> I<00:01:24.980> if<00:01:25.730> you<00:01:26.720> want

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
a maximum height of 2 4 so I if you want

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.010 
a maximum height of 2 4 so I if you want
the<00:01:27.530> other<00:01:27.620> kind<00:01:27.830> of<00:01:27.920> regulation<00:01:28.790> size<00:01:29.020> which

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
the other kind of regulation size which

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.550 
the other kind of regulation size which
part<00:01:30.770> is<00:01:30.860> about<00:01:30.980> 6<00:01:31.790> foot<00:01:31.940> in<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.180> air<00:01:32.560> you

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
part is about 6 foot in the air you

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.030 
part is about 6 foot in the air you
might<00:01:33.680> want<00:01:33.890> to<00:01:34.120> get<00:01:35.120> a<00:01:35.330> bit<00:01:35.510> thicker<00:01:35.750> wood

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
might want to get a bit thicker wood

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.430 
might want to get a bit thicker wood
something<00:01:37.040> that<00:01:37.160> maybe<00:01:37.340> comes<00:01:37.850> late<00:01:38.030> to<00:01:38.120> here

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
something that maybe comes late to here

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.630 
something that maybe comes late to here
and<00:01:39.460> then<00:01:42.040> yeah<00:01:43.040> that's<00:01:43.280> kind<00:01:43.430> of<00:01:43.460> what<00:01:43.550> you

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
and then yeah that's kind of what you

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.280 
and then yeah that's kind of what you
want<00:01:43.790> whenever<00:01:44.330> you<00:01:44.390> think<00:01:44.570> about<00:01:44.750> when<00:01:45.140> you

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
saw some Tyrael for me these two bits of

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.890 
saw some Tyrael for me these two bits of
wood

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900

perfect so the first thing you're going
to<00:01:52.340> do<00:01:52.430> is<00:01:52.790> gonna<00:01:52.880> find<00:01:53.180> the<00:01:53.270> center<00:01:53.830> that's<00:01:55.750> 78

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
to do is gonna find the center that's 78

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.380 
to do is gonna find the center that's 78
inches<00:01:57.520> sent<00:01:58.520> here

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
so once you have the same for the plank

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:09.359 
so once you have the same for the plank
we're<00:02:03.460> gonna<00:02:03.610> go<00:02:03.700> ahead<00:02:03.790> go<00:02:04.210> it<00:02:04.300> in<00:02:04.390> half<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:08.369> so

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
we're gonna go ahead go it in half so so

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.000 
we're gonna go ahead go it in half so so
we're<00:02:09.520> done<00:02:09.780> protip<00:02:10.780> don't<00:02:11.500> do<00:02:11.650> this<00:02:11.800> with<00:02:11.980> a

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
we're done protip don't do this with a

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.420 
we're done protip don't do this with a
regular<00:02:12.190> handsaw<00:02:12.790> it<00:02:13.780> sucks<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:17.680> what's<00:02:18.310> all

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
regular handsaw it sucks so what's all

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.090 
regular handsaw it sucks so what's all
cutting<00:02:18.640> off<00:02:19.500> there's<00:02:20.500> neither<00:02:20.680> on<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.920> grass

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
cutting off there's neither on the grass

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.980 
cutting off there's neither on the grass
I<00:02:21.430> lined<00:02:22.180> up<00:02:22.330> like<00:02:22.480> this<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:25.690> is<00:02:25.870> going

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
I lined up like this and this is going

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.630 
I lined up like this and this is going
to<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.170> bottom<00:02:26.320> of<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:27.070> you<00:02:27.220> can<00:02:27.340> see<00:02:27.430> here

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
to the bottom of it so you can see here

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.670 
to the bottom of it so you can see here
this<00:02:27.820> site<00:02:28.030> is<00:02:28.180> goalies<00:02:28.510> like<00:02:28.690> impurities<00:02:29.440> and

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
this site is goalies like impurities and

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.650 
this site is goalies like impurities and
marks<00:02:30.550> all<00:02:30.670> over<00:02:30.700> it<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:31.060> this<00:02:31.390> will<00:02:31.540> be<00:02:31.600> the

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
marks all over it so this will be the

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.940 
marks all over it so this will be the
bottom<00:02:31.930> two<00:02:32.110> dogs<00:02:32.260> aren't<00:02:32.440> gonna<00:02:32.590> walk<00:02:32.800> on

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
bottom two dogs aren't gonna walk on

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.800 
bottom two dogs aren't gonna walk on
this<00:02:33.040> side<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:34.120> other<00:02:34.150> side's<00:02:34.420> much<00:02:34.600> better

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
this side the other side's much better

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.520 
this side the other side's much better
much<00:02:34.990> smoother<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:37.330> that's<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.870> safer<00:02:38.170> City<00:02:38.350> for

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
much smoother so that's a safer City for

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.840 
much smoother so that's a safer City for
dogs<00:02:38.709> to<00:02:38.800> walk<00:02:38.980> on<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:39.459> that's<00:02:39.520> going<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.730> be

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
dogs to walk on so that's going to be

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.790 
dogs to walk on so that's going to be
the<00:02:39.940> top<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:41.260> what<00:02:41.410> we're<00:02:41.530> doing<00:02:41.560> is<00:02:41.739> were

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
the top so what we're doing is were

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.900 
the top so what we're doing is were
working<00:02:41.830> on<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.160> bottom<00:02:42.310> at<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.550> minute

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
working on the bottom at the minute

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.600 
working on the bottom at the minute
get<00:02:43.360> your<00:02:43.510> hinge<00:02:44.100> you're<00:02:45.100> gonna<00:02:45.250> join<00:02:45.400> two

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
get your hinge you're gonna join two

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.229 
get your hinge you're gonna join two
pieces<00:02:45.640> together

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
pieces together

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.840 
pieces together
and<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:46.989> want<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.320> have<00:02:47.920> it<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.070> it<00:02:48.430> folds<00:02:48.640> in

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
and you want to have it that it folds in

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.570 
and you want to have it that it folds in
completely<00:02:49.390> when<00:02:49.690> you<00:02:49.750> do<00:02:49.870> that<00:02:50.520> Saturday<00:02:51.520> you

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
completely when you do that Saturday you

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.750 
completely when you do that Saturday you
want<00:02:51.790> it<00:02:51.880> screwing<00:02:52.920> so<00:02:53.920> that's<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.400> screw<00:02:54.640> that

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
want it screwing so that's it screw that

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.250 
want it screwing so that's it screw that
in<00:02:55.709> so<00:02:56.709> put<00:02:57.090> only<00:02:58.090> screw<00:02:58.420> in<00:02:58.540> one<00:02:58.720> screw<00:02:59.020> on

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
in so put only screw in one screw on

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.979 
in so put only screw in one screw on
each<00:02:59.530> side<00:02:59.739> first<00:03:00.239> do<00:03:01.239> a<00:03:01.270> quick<00:03:01.480> test<00:03:01.630> to<00:03:01.870> make

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
each side first do a quick test to make

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.520 
each side first do a quick test to make
sure<00:03:02.050> it's<00:03:02.260> all<00:03:02.350> lined<00:03:02.380> up<00:03:02.680> properly<00:03:04.530> that's

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
sure it's all lined up properly that's

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.100 
sure it's all lined up properly that's
pretty<00:03:05.680> good<00:03:08.910> so<00:03:09.910> yeah<00:03:10.450> it's<00:03:10.690> a<00:03:10.720> lot<00:03:10.810> easier<00:03:10.959> to

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
pretty good so yeah it's a lot easier to

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.320 
pretty good so yeah it's a lot easier to
adjust<00:03:11.260> it<00:03:11.590> any<00:03:12.070> two<00:03:12.310> screws<00:03:12.610> in<00:03:12.760> as<00:03:13.030> opposed

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
adjust it any two screws in as opposed

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.570 
adjust it any two screws in as opposed
to<00:03:13.450> when<00:03:13.900> there's<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:14.140> more<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:15.070> can<00:03:15.190> obviously

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
to when there's a more you can obviously

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.729 
to when there's a more you can obviously
this<00:03:16.420> will<00:03:16.630> swivel<00:03:16.900> around<00:03:17.049> and<00:03:17.440> line<00:03:17.560> up

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
this will swivel around and line up

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:18.090 
this will swivel around and line up
properly

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
properly

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.509 
properly
yeah<00:03:18.400> just<00:03:19.269> one<00:03:19.420> screw<00:03:19.660> in<00:03:19.690> it<00:03:19.900> so<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:24.190> once

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
yeah just one screw in it so so once

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:25.710 
yeah just one screw in it so so once
you're<00:03:24.640> finished<00:03:24.730> screwing<00:03:25.360> in<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.570> hinge

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
you're finished screwing in the hinge

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:34.800 
you're finished screwing in the hinge
give<00:03:26.620> it<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.709> quick<00:03:26.860> test<00:03:33.269> so<00:03:34.269> as<00:03:34.540> you<00:03:34.660> can<00:03:34.750> see

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
give it a quick test so as you can see

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.979 
give it a quick test so as you can see
the<00:03:35.500> idea<00:03:35.739> is<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:37.209> two<00:03:37.420> ends<00:03:37.570> will<00:03:37.660> meet<00:03:37.810> up<00:03:37.900> in

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
the idea is the two ends will meet up in

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:44.759 
the idea is the two ends will meet up in
the<00:03:38.019> middle<00:03:41.880> so<00:03:42.880> protip<00:03:43.480> measure<00:03:44.110> planks

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
the middle so protip measure planks

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.350 
the middle so protip measure planks
before<00:03:45.040> you<00:03:45.100> start<00:03:45.340> because<00:03:45.549> one<00:03:46.000> could<00:03:46.209> be<00:03:46.330> a

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
before you start because one could be a

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:59.430 
before you start because one could be a
lot<00:03:46.660> longer<00:03:46.930> than<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:47.440> other

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.309 

Hey

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.440 

so<00:04:03.890> the<00:04:04.010> next<00:04:04.159> thing<00:04:04.280> to<00:04:04.400> do<00:04:04.489> is<00:04:04.760> based<00:04:05.209> at<00:04:05.329> your

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
so the next thing to do is based at your

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:13.479 
so the next thing to do is based at your
steps<00:04:05.659> on<00:04:06.409> the<00:04:06.560> ramp<00:04:06.709> up<00:04:11.890> so<00:04:12.890> once<00:04:13.250> you<00:04:13.310> got<00:04:13.400> the

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
steps on the ramp up so once you got the

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.129 
steps on the ramp up so once you got the
steps<00:04:13.730> done<00:04:14.319> on<00:04:15.319> both<00:04:15.500> sides<00:04:16.930> flip<00:04:17.930> it<00:04:18.079> over

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
steps done on both sides flip it over

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.319 
steps done on both sides flip it over
and<00:04:18.530> eat<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.340> nails<00:04:19.519> in<00:04:19.759> the<00:04:19.820> other<00:04:19.910> side<00:04:20.120> say

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
and eat the nails in the other side say

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:41.650 
and eat the nails in the other side say
C<00:04:38.349> so<00:04:39.349> once<00:04:39.770> you've<00:04:39.889> made<00:04:40.009> a<00:04:40.070> safe<00:04:40.660> alternative

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
C so once you've made a safe alternative

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.870 
C so once you've made a safe alternative
you<00:04:42.229> to<00:04:42.470> find<00:04:43.009> nail<00:04:43.160> plate<00:04:43.430> of<00:04:43.550> it

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
you to find nail plate of it

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.779 
you to find nail plate of it
put<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:44.870> tape<00:04:45.020> over<00:04:45.169> them<00:04:45.440> you<00:04:46.430> just<00:04:46.639> use

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
put the tape over them you just use

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:53.560 
put the tape over them you just use
shorter<00:04:47.210> nails<00:04:50.080> what<00:04:51.080> you<00:04:51.259> mean<00:04:51.800> it's<00:04:51.889> if<00:04:52.570> on

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
shorter nails what you mean it's if on

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.900 
shorter nails what you mean it's if on
both<00:04:53.780> sides<00:04:54.110> obviously<00:04:55.039> check<00:04:55.460> the<00:04:55.580> nails<00:04:55.820> you

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
both sides obviously check the nails you
