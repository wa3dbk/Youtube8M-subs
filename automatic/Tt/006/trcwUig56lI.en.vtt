there are two charging cables provided
which<00:00:53.610> are<00:00:53.730> quite<00:00:53.879> short<00:00:54.149> which<00:00:54.329> works<00:00:54.570> well

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
which are quite short which works well

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.080 
which are quite short which works well
but<00:00:55.710> feels<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.219> can<00:00:56.370> just<00:00:56.520> win<00:00:56.640> them<00:00:56.879> around

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
but feels you can just win them around

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.119 
but feels you can just win them around
underneath<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.989> underside<00:00:58.649> I'll<00:00:58.800> show<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.039> a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
underneath the underside I'll show you a

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.849 
underneath the underside I'll show you a
different<00:00:59.219> view<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.760> as<00:00:59.850> well<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.859> it

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
different view of that as well and it

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.369 
different view of that as well and it
reduces<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.879> amount<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.210> socket<00:01:04.170> see<00:01:04.290> you

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
reduces the amount of socket see you

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.750 
reduces the amount of socket see you
need<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.619> use<00:01:04.769> instead<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.309> having<00:01:05.460> four

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
need to use instead of having four

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.100 
need to use instead of having four
sockets<00:01:05.970> taken<00:01:06.390> up<00:01:06.479> by<00:01:06.510> four<00:01:06.810> separate

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
sockets taken up by four separate

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.480 
sockets taken up by four separate

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
devices from one area it's also pretty

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.840 
devices from one area it's also pretty
energy-efficient<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.710> what<00:01:23.250> happens<00:01:23.549> when<00:01:23.790> I

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
energy-efficient so what happens when I

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.880 
energy-efficient so what happens when I
turn<00:01:23.939> on<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:24.900> see<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.110> each<00:01:25.740> of

everything will be fully charged will
turn<00:01:39.090> itself<00:01:39.299> off<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.810> will<00:01:39.900> conserve<00:01:40.229> power

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
turn itself off and will conserve power

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.179 
turn itself off and will conserve power
it'll<00:01:42.030> also<00:01:42.180> turn<00:01:43.020> itself<00:01:43.229> off<00:01:43.409> if<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.920> detects
