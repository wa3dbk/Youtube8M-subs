but I thought today we would make a

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.560 
but I thought today we would make a
little<00:00:17.289> puffy<00:00:17.830> balloon<00:00:18.610> like<00:00:18.910> style<00:00:19.300> bunny

little puffy balloon like style bunny
and<00:00:20.050> for<00:00:20.710> this<00:00:20.800> project<00:00:21.070> you<00:00:21.370> need<00:00:21.550> one<00:00:21.760> piece

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
and for this project you need one piece

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.630 
and for this project you need one piece
of<00:00:22.210> origami<00:00:22.600> paper<00:00:22.720> and<00:00:23.530> let<00:00:24.100> me<00:00:24.190> start<00:00:24.490> off<00:00:24.580> by

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
of origami paper and let me start off by

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.850 
of origami paper and let me start off by
putting<00:00:25.060> some<00:00:25.510> creases<00:00:25.750> in<00:00:26.110> my<00:00:26.230> paper<00:00:26.440> I'm

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
putting some creases in my paper I'm

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.760 
putting some creases in my paper I'm
going<00:00:26.980> to<00:00:27.100> put<00:00:27.340> fold<00:00:28.260> paper<00:00:29.260> in<00:00:29.470> half<00:00:31.770> both

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
going to put fold paper in half both

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:39.960 
going to put fold paper in half both
vertically<00:00:33.340> and<00:00:33.579> horizontally<00:00:38.579> then<00:00:39.579> I<00:00:39.640> go

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
vertically and horizontally then I go

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.660 
vertically and horizontally then I go
ahead<00:00:40.060> and<00:00:40.680> make<00:00:41.680> sure<00:00:41.860> my<00:00:42.010> color<00:00:42.280> side<00:00:42.550> is

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
ahead and make sure my color side is

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.610 
ahead and make sure my color side is
facing<00:00:42.820> down<00:00:43.090> and<00:00:43.810> I'm<00:00:44.110> gonna<00:00:44.200> put<00:00:44.470> the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
facing down and I'm gonna put the

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:55.590 
facing down and I'm gonna put the
diagonal<00:00:45.190> folds<00:00:45.489> in<00:00:45.640> here<00:00:45.880> as<00:00:45.970> well<00:00:54.480> then<00:00:55.480> you

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
diagonal folds in here as well then you

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.840 
diagonal folds in here as well then you
should<00:00:55.780> be<00:00:55.930> able<00:00:56.050> to<00:00:56.380> fairly<00:00:56.590> easily<00:00:56.920> pinch

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
should be able to fairly easily pinch

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.709 
should be able to fairly easily pinch
and<00:00:58.239> let's<00:00:58.870> bring<00:00:59.140> it<00:00:59.350> to<00:00:59.380> a<00:01:00.420> triangular<00:01:01.420> shape

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
and let's bring it to a triangular shape

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.229 
and let's bring it to a triangular shape
here<00:01:02.219> make<00:01:03.219> a<00:01:03.250> good<00:01:03.550> crease<00:01:03.790> down<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.089> middle

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
here make a good crease down the middle

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.309 
here make a good crease down the middle
and<00:01:04.600> the<00:01:04.719> size<00:01:06.479> we<00:01:07.479> want<00:01:07.749> to<00:01:08.020> do<00:01:08.139> is<00:01:08.229> we're

00:01:08.309 --> 00:01:08.319 
and the size we want to do is we're

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:10.139 
and the size we want to do is we're
going<00:01:08.409> to<00:01:08.469> go<00:01:08.649> ahead<00:01:08.740> and<00:01:09.039> bring<00:01:09.310> these<00:01:09.670> tips

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
going to go ahead and bring these tips

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.370 
going to go ahead and bring these tips
up<00:01:10.450> to<00:01:11.109> the<00:01:11.350> top<00:01:11.950> of<00:01:12.189> this<00:01:12.780> triangle<00:01:13.780> here<00:01:14.079> and

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
up to the top of this triangle here and

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.389 
up to the top of this triangle here and
get<00:01:14.709> a<00:01:14.740> good<00:01:14.799> crease<00:01:16.889> and<00:01:17.889> do<00:01:18.009> that<00:01:18.159> for<00:01:18.369> both

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
get a good crease and do that for both

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:25.740 
get a good crease and do that for both
sides

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.360 

and<00:01:26.750> then<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:27.320> want<00:01:27.500> to<00:01:27.530> go<00:01:27.650> ahead<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:28.100> bring

and then you want to go ahead and bring

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:35.980 
and then you want to go ahead and bring
in<00:01:28.610> these<00:01:29.390> sides<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.500> center<00:01:34.660> and<00:01:35.660> do<00:01:35.840> that

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
in these sides to the center and do that

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.210 
in these sides to the center and do that
for<00:01:36.200> this<00:01:36.290> side<00:01:36.500> as<00:01:36.650> well<00:01:40.540> and<00:01:42.100> then<00:01:43.100> we're

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
for this side as well and then we're

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.040 
for this side as well and then we're
going<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.430> take<00:01:43.580> this<00:01:43.760> tip<00:01:44.210> and<00:01:44.510> what<00:01:44.720> we<00:01:44.840> want

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
going to take this tip and what we want

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.719 
going to take this tip and what we want
to<00:01:45.140> do<00:01:45.290> is<00:01:45.470> we're<00:01:45.620> going<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:45.830> put<00:01:46.070> it<00:01:46.160> inside

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
to do is we're going to put it inside

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.730 
to do is we're going to put it inside
this<00:01:47.150> pocket<00:01:47.750> didn't<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:48.200> see<00:01:48.410> here<00:01:49.450> and<00:01:50.740> push

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
crease there do that for the other side

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:09.400 
crease there do that for the other side
as<00:01:57.920> well

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.350 

you<00:02:10.070> show<00:02:10.310> something<00:02:10.520> that<00:02:10.670> looks<00:02:10.940> like<00:02:11.030> this

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
you show something that looks like this

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.660 
you show something that looks like this
we're<00:02:12.110> going<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.350> turn<00:02:12.590> it<00:02:12.650> over<00:02:12.860> we're<00:02:13.580> going

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
we're going to turn it over we're going

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.000 
we're going to turn it over we're going
to<00:02:13.730> fold<00:02:14.000> up<00:02:14.180> our<00:02:14.360> flaps<00:02:14.690> to<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.140> tip<00:02:15.380> here<00:02:15.830> as

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
to fold up our flaps to the tip here as

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:25.660 
to fold up our flaps to the tip here as
well<00:02:16.400> in<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.700> back<00:02:18.610> both<00:02:19.610> sides<00:02:20.000> do<00:02:20.300> that<00:02:24.670> now

well in the back both sides do that now

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.100 
well in the back both sides do that now
what<00:02:25.790> we<00:02:25.910> want<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.210> do<00:02:26.330> here<00:02:26.570> rather<00:02:26.810> than

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
what we want to do here rather than

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.020 
what we want to do here rather than
repeating<00:02:27.710> this<00:02:27.890> steps<00:02:28.160> we've<00:02:28.340> just<00:02:28.670> done<00:02:28.880> on

over and then bring this to the middle

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.340 
over and then bring this to the middle
here<00:03:06.970> fold<00:03:07.970> it<00:03:08.090> back<00:03:08.270> do<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.960> same<00:03:09.140> thing<00:03:09.290> on

put just give a little puff of air into

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.690 
put just give a little puff of air into
that<00:03:25.970> it<00:03:26.240> should<00:03:26.510> expand<00:03:29.200> like<00:03:30.200> so<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:30.920> then

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
that it should expand like so and then

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.280 
that it should expand like so and then
you<00:03:32.120> can<00:03:32.300> gently<00:03:33.160> shape<00:03:34.510> this<00:03:36.520> to<00:03:37.520> be<00:03:37.700> more

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
you can gently shape this to be more

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.949 
you can gently shape this to be more
cubical<00:03:39.290> or<00:03:39.770> you<00:03:39.980> can<00:03:40.160> keep<00:03:40.310> it<00:03:40.570> round<00:03:41.570> if<00:03:41.840> you

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959
