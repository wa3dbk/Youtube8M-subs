right<00:01:48.840> there<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.369> let's<00:01:50.369> take<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.549> quick<00:01:50.850> look

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
right there and let's take a quick look

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.600 
right there and let's take a quick look
at<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.780> size<00:01:52.020> here<00:01:52.500> let's<00:01:53.100> see<00:01:53.250> how's<00:01:53.430> that

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
at the size here let's see how's that

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.660 
at the size here let's see how's that
jack<00:01:53.850> full-size<00:01:54.659> USB<00:01:54.929> 2.0<00:01:55.649> port<00:01:55.920> very<00:01:56.399> nicely

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
jack full-size USB 2.0 port very nicely

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.840 
jack full-size USB 2.0 port very nicely
done<00:01:57.000> there<00:01:57.200> micro<00:01:58.200> HDMI<00:01:58.799> out<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.189> that's<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
done there micro HDMI out and that's the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.100 
done there micro HDMI out and that's the
power<00:02:00.060> jack<00:02:00.270> right<00:02:00.450> there<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:00.780> now<00:02:00.899> not

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
power jack right there so now not

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.230 
power jack right there so now not
charging<00:02:01.590> through<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.069> micro<00:02:02.399> USB<00:02:02.429> but<00:02:03.030> going

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
charging through the micro USB but going

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.830 
charging through the micro USB but going
with<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> separate<00:02:04.729> power<00:02:05.729> adapter<00:02:06.179> at<00:02:06.659> the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
with a separate power adapter at the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.370 
with a separate power adapter at the
bottom

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
bottom

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.009 
bottom
you'd<00:02:07.619> get<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:08.119> couple<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.209> docking<00:02:09.569> ports<00:02:09.899> so

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
you'd get a couple of docking ports so

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.780 
you'd get a couple of docking ports so
that's<00:02:10.170> where<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.470> put<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.769> device<00:02:11.009> into<00:02:11.549> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
that's where you put the device into the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.550 
that's where you put the device into the
keyboard<00:02:12.180> dock<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:12.840> on<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.410> right<00:02:13.530> side

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
keyboard dock and on the right side

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.440 
keyboard dock and on the right side
you'll<00:02:14.069> end<00:02:14.280> up<00:02:14.430> with<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.700> micro<00:02:15.090> USB<00:02:15.420> port

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
you'll end up with a micro USB port

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.479 
you'll end up with a micro USB port
right<00:02:15.690> there<00:02:15.870> plus<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.620> volume<00:02:16.739> rocker<00:02:17.160> and

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
right there plus the volume rocker and

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.660 
right there plus the volume rocker and
the<00:02:18.450> power<00:02:18.690> button<00:02:19.019> up<00:02:19.980> top<00:02:20.040> there's<00:02:20.489> pretty

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
the power button up top there's pretty

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.370 
the power button up top there's pretty
much<00:02:20.730> nothing<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.660> all<00:02:21.810> let's<00:02:21.989> look<00:02:22.170> at<00:02:22.290> the

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
much nothing and all let's look at the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.500 
much nothing and all let's look at the
back<00:02:22.560> then<00:02:22.860> let's<00:02:23.370> just<00:02:23.519> tell<00:02:23.760> me<00:02:23.880> if<00:02:24.209> this

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
back then let's just tell me if this

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.449 
back then let's just tell me if this
reminds<00:02:24.989> you<00:02:25.079> of<00:02:25.110> something<00:02:25.380> yes<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.280> looks

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
reminds you of something yes it looks

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.490 
reminds you of something yes it looks
like<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.670> galaxy<00:02:27.180> s5<00:02:27.540> for<00:02:27.810> example<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.349> has

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
like a galaxy s5 for example so it has

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.289 
like a galaxy s5 for example so it has
this<00:02:28.650> dimpled<00:02:29.099> pattern<00:02:29.430> which<00:02:29.880> actually

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
this dimpled pattern which actually

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.240 
this dimpled pattern which actually
looks<00:02:30.510> pretty<00:02:30.569> nice<00:02:30.930> on<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.200> 10-inch<00:02:31.739> device<00:02:31.860> in

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
looks pretty nice on a 10-inch device in

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.130 
looks pretty nice on a 10-inch device in
this<00:02:32.430> case<00:02:32.670> they've<00:02:33.180> even<00:02:33.420> copied<00:02:33.870> little

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
this case they've even copied little

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.729 
this case they've even copied little
design<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.110> speaker<00:02:37.440> grills

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
design of the of the speaker grills

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.220 
design of the of the speaker grills
there<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:38.280> those<00:02:38.640> look<00:02:38.880> like<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.450> back<00:02:39.630> of<00:02:39.930> the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
there so those look like the back of the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.550 
there so those look like the back of the
galaxy<00:02:40.620> s5<00:02:40.950> -<00:02:41.790> again<00:02:42.750> that's<00:02:42.989> a<00:02:43.079> 5<00:02:43.260> megapixel

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
galaxy s5 - again that's a 5 megapixel

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.259 
galaxy s5 - again that's a 5 megapixel
camera<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.190> if<00:02:44.340> we<00:02:44.459> open<00:02:44.700> up<00:02:44.760> this<00:02:44.910> flap

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
camera and if we open up this flap

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.500 
camera and if we open up this flap
that's<00:02:45.720> where<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.410> micro<00:02:46.890> SD<00:02:47.160> card<00:02:47.430> goes<00:02:48.150> in

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
that's where the micro SD card goes in

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.590 
that's where the micro SD card goes in
the<00:02:49.140> micro<00:02:49.530> or<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.950> simple<00:02:50.400> Micro<00:02:51.150> SIM<00:02:51.329> card

the micro or the simple Micro SIM card

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.030 
the micro or the simple Micro SIM card
slot<00:02:51.840> right<00:02:52.049> there<00:02:52.380> for<00:02:53.250> your<00:02:53.340> 3G<00:02:53.639> modem<00:02:54.180> so

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
slot right there for your 3G modem so

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.789 
slot right there for your 3G modem so
you<00:02:56.040> also<00:02:56.370> get<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.910> an<00:02:57.359> optional<00:02:57.840> keyboard<00:02:58.680> to

you also get a an optional keyboard to
keep<00:02:59.040> your<00:02:59.190> keyboard<00:02:59.609> is<00:02:59.730> 40<00:03:00.120> euros<00:03:00.630> if<00:03:00.840> you

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
keep your keyboard is 40 euros if you

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.319 
keep your keyboard is 40 euros if you
buy<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.290> tablet<00:03:01.680> by<00:03:01.980> itself<00:03:02.310> or<00:03:02.670> in<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:03.000> package

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
buy the tablet by itself or in a package

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:04.520 
buy the tablet by itself or in a package
deal<00:03:03.510> it's<00:03:03.750> probably<00:03:04.019> going<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.230> be<00:03:04.319> a<00:03:04.350> bit

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
deal it's probably going to be a bit

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.640 
deal it's probably going to be a bit
cheaper<00:03:05.239> it<00:03:06.239> feels<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.780> bit<00:03:06.810> flimsy<00:03:07.139> but<00:03:07.500> these

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
cheaper it feels a bit flimsy but these

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.310 
cheaper it feels a bit flimsy but these
are<00:03:07.829> still<00:03:07.950> three<00:03:08.280> production<00:03:08.730> models

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
are still three production models

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.010 
are still three production models
it<00:03:10.620> has<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:11.190> clickable<00:03:11.610> keyboard<00:03:12.210> and<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.780> just

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
it has a clickable keyboard and it just

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.510 
it has a clickable keyboard and it just
folds<00:03:13.260> like<00:03:13.560> this<00:03:13.740> in<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.010> back<00:03:14.160> so<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.400> can

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
folds like this in the back so you can

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.110 
folds like this in the back so you can
pull<00:03:15.270> it<00:03:15.420> up<00:03:15.510> like<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:17.370> make<00:03:17.550> it<00:03:17.700> stand<00:03:18.000> up

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
pull it up like to make it stand up

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.370 
pull it up like to make it stand up
straight<00:03:18.450> there's<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.750> bunch<00:03:18.930> of<00:03:19.020> different

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
straight there's a bunch of different

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.740 
straight there's a bunch of different
versions<00:03:19.650> of<00:03:19.980> holding<00:03:20.370> this<00:03:20.490> up<00:03:20.670> so<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:21.510> think

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
versions of holding this up so I think

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.230 
versions of holding this up so I think
my<00:03:22.230> colleague<00:03:22.620> justice<00:03:23.010> that<00:03:23.460> and<00:03:23.820> that's<00:03:24.060> the

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
my colleague justice that and that's the

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.600 
my colleague justice that and that's the
other<00:03:24.600> way<00:03:24.990> of<00:03:25.200> folding<00:03:25.440> this<00:03:25.740> up<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.370> if<00:03:26.490> you

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
other way of folding this up and if you

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.520 
other way of folding this up and if you
want<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.850> take<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.150> out<00:03:27.300> just<00:03:27.750> fold<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.440> whole

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
want to take it out just fold the whole

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.740 
want to take it out just fold the whole
thing<00:03:28.800> together<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.400> you're<00:03:29.940> ready<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.180> go<00:03:30.390> so

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
thing together and you're ready to go so

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.480 
thing together and you're ready to go so
that's<00:03:30.960> look<00:03:31.170> looks<00:03:31.830> like<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.010> pretty<00:03:32.310> decent

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
that's look looks like a pretty decent
