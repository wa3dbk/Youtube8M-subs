00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:14.940
 another nice hello from 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.650
 tells of the so bold and I want 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.270
 you again a little 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.340
 video highlight 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.990
 Once again, imagine the two 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.800
 small change is and the new graphics cards 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.369
 Had presented 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.560
 that is the z box idea 89 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.380
 probably not until the beginning of may and that 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.629
 also wants to come market 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.890
 is characteristic of this time bock 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:38.750
 that we also have a desktop cdu here 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.870
 set a cross as if in 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.190
 In this case, it is the 25th 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.190
 make a quick start 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.120
 see how counterproductive the times opened 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.340
 maybe 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.140
 show again here we have one 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.500
 desktop 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.120
 not the variant of the cdu as before with 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.460
 the mobile variants now have one 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.079
 desktop series 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.280
 This has never made us a child 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.090
 value 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.310
 as I said as ksv 25 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:14.820
 iz box is once as a plus variant 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:17.600
 come means with 500 gb hdd and 4 gb 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.600
 the 50 workers the and 4 gb ram 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.090
 but also as advertising variant what I 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.530
 to the readers who can lay their hands on 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.410
 because there the few have the opportunity 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.330
 to upgrade flexibility as he does 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.730
 but now likes a harley d mark or 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.670
 maybe even a ssd 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.440
 in a minimum of effort without the tools 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.940
 gear up 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.470
 and 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.230
 then 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.810
 Many rich uses in the home in 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.350
 the wilderness 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.350
 a room 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.690
 with the performance of a chorus like qype 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.200
 is the mapbox perfect 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.600
 you can actually do it for everyday use 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.770
 want 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.409
 use any kind of tasks 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.640
 a special feature is, for example, too 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.730
 the dual lan 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.690
 the dual lan feature which you also use 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.490
 can and maybe your own celebration 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.900
 firewalls adjust or in the dose 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.880
 of an area of 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.770
 big with count 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.670
 that is the beautiful thing comes as I said 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.670
 early May 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.790
 very close to the heart
