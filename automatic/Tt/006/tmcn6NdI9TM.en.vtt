00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.040
 Hello my dear, today there is one 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.370
 very tasty fresh cheese tomato arugula 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.509
 herbs beat me dead cream cheese 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.049
 spread as already said fresh cheese yes 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.970
 he's awesome to grilled on 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.279
 black bread on baguette totally 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.859
 versatile you can potatoes them 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.350
 So it fits perfectly in the fish 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.779
 upcoming spring barbecue season 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.970
 grilling and go totally easy 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.099
 i'm not innovative and i had 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.719
 two more tomatoes and knew 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.590
 The last three days have nothing to do with it 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.780
 to begin 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.540
 That's why I thought I was doing 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.700
 today the delicious spread and there he 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.860
 I just wanted to do this for you 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.690
 I absolutely need to show my recipe 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.370
 some herbs from my garden 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.140
 I have chives and arugula 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.260
 right now that's why I use the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.480
 Of course you also get for 79 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.100
 cent even at Kaufland with fresh cheese 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.410
 I like to take the double frame 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.510
 Cream cheese because he is very sunny 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.579
 there is the tomato more I do here 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.909
 not a pure one to garnish this 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.979
 a clove of garlic reaches three to four 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.110
 tablespoon of milk you have to look 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.299
 how much that is but I explain it 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.409
 again lemon salt and pepper 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.659
 and that's it 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.330
 I do not wash my herbs at least 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.460
 not the ones from my own garden 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.409
 jamie oliver does not come either 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.630
 have ever mentioned it in a video 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.250
 that just waters down the herbs and 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.840
 somehow changes the taste 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.850
 negative so i do not like it 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.100
 I cut the herbs with one 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.600
 sharp kitchen knife relative to a 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.630
 relatively small 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.009
 you can see it here it goes rucki zucki 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.750
 chive is very easy to 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.820
 Everyone should chop that too 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.740
 realize that it is a wonderful 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.140
 Onion flavor has me here already 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.790
 I'll make an onion 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.200
 here is not purely just because of it 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.240
 Chives like a nice onion 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.369
 brings flavor and I have the onion 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.920
 not peel big big advantage 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.810
 then I give the cream cheese from the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.939
 Pack in a bowl and give it already 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.950
 a little milk to the whole thing 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.640
 to stir and thus also supple 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.310
 close 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.439
 the consistency of this cream cheese 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.660
 or you can spread this completely 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.009
 I decide for myself if I like it 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.290
 there was something else stuck 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.390
 has time and if it is still a bit 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.040
 yes, if you can do it nicely and it 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.680
 So then I also do not like it 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.209
 fluent but the consistency you can 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.010
 determine yourself by adding one more 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:29.129
 a little more or less milk 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:31.440
 to give or to leave you see here 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.930
 her consistency is really nice and sunny 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.000
 and creamy as it liked to have put the 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.579
 Now I just briefly to the side and dedicate 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.040
 me the tomato the tomato I throw 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:44.879
 quick in rough pieces in my quick 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.319
 boss next does not even get yes 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.090
 definitely in this little one 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.159
 wreckage i take the very small one 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.019
 that 's perfect if not for each 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.459
 have a knife here too can 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.299
 your consistency again 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.030
 influence 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.069
 I draw about ten times and then they are 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.349
 still small coarse pieces with 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.139
 I like it that way if you stay longer 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.970
 it gets more free as i say i 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.950
 Of course, then it can be very good 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.720
 but I also like it 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.489
 if you still tomaten pieces out 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.159
 tastes that then gives you to 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.799
 cream cheese as well as the herbs and 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.569
 the remaining ingredients as there would be salt 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.449
 pepper lemon juice and the 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.220
 garlic clove pressed and then miss 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:25.530
 I like the whole thing and taste it again 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.079
 and that was all the magic 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.150
 I love that fruity aroma 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.730
 this cream cheese then spread with 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.980
 it brings and the herbal note is yes 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.900
 insanely present I just like that 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.030
 because it's totally refreshing and still 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.160
 you can be fruity again 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.959
 Add a pinch of sugar with it 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.079
 you strengthen the tomato taste 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.209
 just tried the ingredients 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:50.430
 other herbs take her 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.889
 can also take city tomato zucchini 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.419
 or what he has just because of that 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.190
 It's so nice and it makes me feel so 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:57.900
 Huge fun you can do it yourself here 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.419
 Try it and I love it 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.889
 just then really everything really 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:04.799
 only in a nice bowl 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:06.299
 and garnish with a few flowers out there 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.650
 I also got out of the garden today 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.720
 taken daisies and 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.280
 pansy 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.690
 if you have one or the other flowers 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.430
 it is not a part of eating either 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.430
 broken leg because these flowers are edible 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.669
 Now I hope you have my video 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.530
 We liked it today and would like to ask you 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.419
 always give feedback if you have it 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.250
 because you did that too 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.560
 as many others as possible are still reading this 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.330
 You can always do that 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.669
 very important and of course for me 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.930
 Your feedback is very important and me 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.910
 I would be glad if you too 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:45.250
 Thank you again for next time 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.250
