00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.160
 hello again with a technical video of 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.740
 the fujimoto network today we are going to talk about 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.169
 shock absorbers let's learn how to 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.910
 diagnose the shock absorbers and let's 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.580
 to solve the problems that 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.080
 we found in the suspension ok one of 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.690
 the main things that we should 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.070
 to do is review the suspension of 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.129
 vehicle let's do an inspection 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.290
 visual, the first thing we should see is 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.500
 if the shock absorbers are stained 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.640
 oil or dripped another thing is to review 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.170
 the height of the vehicle 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.180
 we also have to review the 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.950
 components which cushions 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.350
 is rubbers and boots thereof 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.900
 are all in place and one of the 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.829
 things we should do is check if 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.710
 if they have followed the spirals or if 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.590
 we have some kind of broken component of 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.220
 the suspension after that we're going to do 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.380
 a road test 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.390
 a basic test that we should do in 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.480
 the suspension in every vehicle that enters 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.300
 The workshop is to review how is the 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.030
 rebound of the suspension we make some 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.730
 how many compressions and we try to 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.550
 to see that the vehicle is not followed 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:34.030
 moving by itself if the vehicle does not 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.190
 does a single bounce but it continues 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.900
 dancing or doing several times is 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.910
 this movement means that the 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.040
 suspension is definitely more the 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.390
 shock absorbers you have to change them 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.910
 you have to check the height of the vehicle 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.280
 this is very important you have to review 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.050
 the height of the fender fender 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.080
 towards the rim in this case in 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.690
 particular this car is a bit high and 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.550
 we see that the height is correct 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.560
 we have to review let's say also what 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.080
 which is the chassis against the floor and 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.759
 check that the height is the same in 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.830
 each side that is very important 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.110
 we also have to check that the 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.209
 height is not in the wrong one of the 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.130
 back against the front if the 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.290
 We have tilted him in any way 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.640
 of these four points possibly 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.380
 we have a problem in the 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.470
 dampers or in some component of 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.780
 the suspension 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.970
 this at the end of the video but for 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.250
 review let's touch the points that 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.290
 we have seen one we have to do the 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.150
 visual impression in this inspection 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.070
 visual remember that there are several steps 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.530
 we have what it is to verify if the 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.540
 shock absorbers are wet or 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.790
 dripping we have to see the height of the 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.680
 vehicle see the components if they are not 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.800
 broken and if the boots are in place 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.110
 for the shock absorbers we also have 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.100
 to do the driving inspection 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.100
 we have to see the condition of the 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.390
 tires and finally remember that 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.090
 we have to do an inspection of 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.280
 bounce to see if the vehicle is still 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.800
 bouncing or have the same condition of 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.330
 the original suspension with this 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.580
 we conclude the video and remember 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.770
 visit us on the web page 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.730
 fujimoto can see us on youtube as 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.269
 red fujimoto greetings 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.269
 ah 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.530
 Y
