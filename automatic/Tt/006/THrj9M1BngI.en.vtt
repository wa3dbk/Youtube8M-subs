00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
her ass now Huck he's making the same

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.199 
her ass now Huck he's making the same
mistakes<00:03:47.920> we<00:03:48.069> saw<00:03:48.250> him<00:03:48.459> make<00:03:48.640> in<00:03:48.849> the<00:03:48.940> first

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
mistakes we saw him make in the first

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.020 
mistakes we saw him make in the first
game<00:03:49.480> he<00:03:49.930> was<00:03:50.380> ahead<00:03:50.670> realistically<00:03:51.670> he

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
game he was ahead realistically he

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.610 
game he was ahead realistically he
cannot<00:03:52.390> be<00:03:52.540> attacked<00:03:52.810> by<00:03:52.900> just<00:03:53.140> a<00:03:53.230> few<00:03:53.380> siege

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
cannot be attacked by just a few siege

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.559 
cannot be attacked by just a few siege
tanks<00:03:53.920> and<00:03:54.040> Marines<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:54.819> he<00:03:55.000> should<00:03:55.030> have<00:03:55.420> gone

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
tanks and Marines so he should have gone

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.900 
tanks and Marines so he should have gone
ahead<00:03:55.750> and<00:03:55.900> taken<00:03:56.140> another<00:03:56.830> base<00:03:57.099> but<00:03:57.400> right

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
ahead and taken another base but right

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.370 
ahead and taken another base but right
now<00:03:58.030> it<00:03:58.180> looks<00:03:58.299> like<00:03:58.420> he<00:03:58.660> is<00:03:58.690> panicking<00:03:59.260> a

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
now it looks like he is panicking a

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.589 
now it looks like he is panicking a
little<00:03:59.410> warping<00:03:59.920> even<00:04:00.220> more<00:04:00.400> zealots<00:04:00.849> I<00:04:01.090> think

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
little warping even more zealots I think

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.199 
little warping even more zealots I think
he<00:04:01.690> wants<00:04:01.900> to<00:04:01.930> try<00:04:02.140> to<00:04:02.200> finish<00:04:02.440> loner<00:04:02.829> off<00:04:03.209> the

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
he wants to try to finish loner off the

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.880 
he wants to try to finish loner off the
problem<00:04:04.450> though<00:04:04.690> is<00:04:04.870> that<00:04:04.900> loners<00:04:05.530> just<00:04:05.739> not

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
problem though is that loners just not

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.860 
problem though is that loners just not
going<00:04:06.070> to<00:04:06.130> budge<00:04:06.340> loner<00:04:07.120> made<00:04:07.239> one<00:04:07.420> attack<00:04:07.720> and

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
going to budge loner made one attack and

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.940 
going to budge loner made one attack and
he's<00:04:07.959> like<00:04:08.079> alright<00:04:08.260> I'm<00:04:08.380> going<00:04:08.530> to<00:04:08.620> sit<00:04:08.769> back

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
he's like alright I'm going to sit back

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.130 
he's like alright I'm going to sit back
and<00:04:09.220> actually<00:04:09.730> he's<00:04:10.329> like<00:04:10.450> a<00:04:10.510> big<00:04:10.630> trapdoor

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
and actually he's like a big trapdoor

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.930 
and actually he's like a big trapdoor
spider<00:04:11.500> just<00:04:11.739> waiting<00:04:12.100> for<00:04:12.280> you<00:04:12.700> know<00:04:12.760> Huck<00:04:12.910> to

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
spider just waiting for you know Huck to

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.880 
spider just waiting for you know Huck to
get<00:04:13.180> close<00:04:13.359> to<00:04:13.540> him<00:04:13.630> and<00:04:13.840> then<00:04:14.170> of<00:04:14.290> course<00:04:14.319> Huck

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
get close to him and then of course Huck

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.979 
get close to him and then of course Huck
realizes<00:04:15.400> oh<00:04:15.549> I<00:04:15.609> made<00:04:15.880> a<00:04:15.910> huge<00:04:16.150> mistake<00:04:16.269> now

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
realizes oh I made a huge mistake now

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.380 
realizes oh I made a huge mistake now
the<00:04:17.410> S&amp;ED<00:04:17.650> is<00:04:17.829> scouting<00:04:18.130> around<00:04:18.340> he<00:04:19.030> does<00:04:19.209> know

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
the S&amp;ED is scouting around he does know

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.029 
the S&amp;ED is scouting around he does know
that<00:04:19.419> in<00:04:19.690> fact<00:04:19.870> there's<00:04:20.140> no<00:04:20.289> expansion<00:04:20.739> here

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
that in fact there's no expansion here

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:23.580 
that in fact there's no expansion here
that<00:04:21.519> means<00:04:21.789> that<00:04:22.030> um<00:04:22.180> right<00:04:23.050> now<00:04:23.080> we're

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
that means that um right now we're

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.529 
that means that um right now we're
getting<00:04:23.800> much<00:04:24.310> more<00:04:24.520> even<00:04:24.760> with<00:04:25.330> loner

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
getting much more even with loner

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.570 
getting much more even with loner
slightly<00:04:26.020> ad<00:04:26.169> yeah<00:04:26.860> I<00:04:26.919> think<00:04:27.070> that's<00:04:27.310> going<00:04:27.490> to

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
slightly ad yeah I think that's going to

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.940 
slightly ad yeah I think that's going to
be<00:04:27.669> a<00:04:27.700> big<00:04:28.300> big<00:04:28.810> bunch<00:04:29.380> of<00:04:29.500> pressure<00:04:29.710> off

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
be a big big bunch of pressure off

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.230 
be a big big bunch of pressure off
loners<00:04:30.310> shoulders<00:04:30.610> because<00:04:30.760> the<00:04:31.000> fact<00:04:31.180> that

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
loners shoulders because the fact that

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.029 
loners shoulders because the fact that
there<00:04:31.419> is<00:04:31.600> no<00:04:31.930> expansion<00:04:32.410> in<00:04:32.650> sight<00:04:32.889> it<00:04:33.010> looks

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
there is no expansion in sight it looks

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.730 
there is no expansion in sight it looks
like<00:04:33.400> there<00:04:33.880> is<00:04:33.910> the<00:04:34.840> range<00:04:35.020> going<00:04:35.380> down<00:04:35.560> on

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
like there is the range going down on

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.680 
like there is the range going down on
the<00:04:35.830> Colossus<00:04:36.310> and<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.490> very<00:04:36.789> far<00:04:37.150> top<00:04:37.389> right

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
the Colossus and the very far top right

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.540 
the Colossus and the very far top right
we<00:04:37.810> see<00:04:37.960> loner<00:04:38.169> just<00:04:38.410> leaving<00:04:38.680> a<00:04:38.740> medevac<00:04:39.100> with

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
we see loner just leaving a medevac with

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.430 
we see loner just leaving a medevac with
only<00:04:39.820> three<00:04:40.360> Marines<00:04:40.750> and<00:04:41.020> I<00:04:41.080> think<00:04:41.260> that's<00:04:41.380> a

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
only three Marines and I think that's a

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.560 
only three Marines and I think that's a
very<00:04:41.620> very<00:04:41.889> good<00:04:42.220> way<00:04:42.490> to<00:04:42.550> just<00:04:42.729> force<00:04:43.210> hook<00:04:43.450> to

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
very very good way to just force hook to

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.540 
very very good way to just force hook to
keep<00:04:43.750> three<00:04:44.410> stalkers<00:04:44.740> in<00:04:44.919> the<00:04:45.190> back<00:04:45.340> of<00:04:45.490> the

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
keep three stalkers in the back of the

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.010 
keep three stalkers in the back of the
base<00:04:45.639> which<00:04:45.880> we<00:04:46.000> do<00:04:46.150> see<00:04:46.330> there<00:04:46.539> so<00:04:46.720> again<00:04:46.990> a

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
base which we do see there so again a

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.810 
base which we do see there so again a
nice<00:04:47.289> little<00:04:47.470> transition<00:04:47.680> to<00:04:48.100> Colossus<00:04:48.610> but

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
nice little transition to Colossus but

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.200 
nice little transition to Colossus but
is<00:04:49.000> it<00:04:49.510> too<00:04:49.690> early<00:04:49.720> is<00:04:50.260> it<00:04:50.530> I<00:04:50.710> mean

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
is it too early is it I mean

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.719 
is it too early is it I mean
a<00:04:51.240> third<00:04:52.199> expansion<00:04:52.560> before<00:04:53.340> he<00:04:53.460> gets<00:04:53.639> the

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
a third expansion before he gets the

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.689 
a third expansion before he gets the
Colossus<00:04:54.210> I<00:04:54.419> think<00:04:55.410> so<00:04:55.590> Dana<00:04:55.919> and<00:04:56.460> I<00:04:56.550> also

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
Colossus I think so Dana and I also

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.129 
Colossus I think so Dana and I also
think<00:04:56.970> he<00:04:57.120> should<00:04:57.300> not<00:04:57.419> have<00:04:57.479> been<00:04:57.720> attacking

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
think he should not have been attacking

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.680 
think he should not have been attacking
so<00:04:58.500> many<00:04:58.680> times<00:04:58.860> while<00:04:59.160> ahead<00:04:59.449> really<00:05:00.449> Huck

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
so many times while ahead really Huck

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.450 
so many times while ahead really Huck
needs<00:05:01.050> to<00:05:01.229> get<00:05:01.349> that<00:05:01.470> third<00:05:01.740> base<00:05:01.949> out<00:05:02.220> the

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
needs to get that third base out the

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.550 
needs to get that third base out the
Costas<00:05:02.849> is<00:05:02.970> such<00:05:03.180> an<00:05:03.330> expensive<00:05:03.660> unit<00:05:04.139> and<00:05:04.380> you

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
Costas is such an expensive unit and you

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.010 
Costas is such an expensive unit and you
need<00:05:04.740> a<00:05:05.009> lot<00:05:05.370> of<00:05:05.729> fodder<00:05:06.060> in<00:05:06.419> front<00:05:06.690> of<00:05:06.780> it<00:05:06.870> and

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
need a lot of fodder in front of it and

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.110 
need a lot of fodder in front of it and
sell<00:05:07.349> offs<00:05:07.560> that<00:05:07.830> stalkers<00:05:08.400> and<00:05:08.430> centuries

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
sell offs that stalkers and centuries

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.659 
sell offs that stalkers and centuries
and<00:05:09.360> without<00:05:10.139> that<00:05:10.199> he's<00:05:11.160> going<00:05:11.370> to<00:05:11.460> be<00:05:11.550> at

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
and without that he's going to be at

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.760 
and without that he's going to be at
loners<00:05:12.000> mercy<00:05:12.479> on<00:05:12.660> a<00:05:12.690> map<00:05:12.960> where<00:05:13.229> he<00:05:13.349> can<00:05:13.470> micro

so easily against us via clauses which

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:17.749 
so easily against us via clauses which
really<00:05:16.410> needs<00:05:16.500> a<00:05:16.830> Terran<00:05:17.069> army<00:05:17.280> to<00:05:17.340> be<00:05:17.430> clumped

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
up but one huge thing to note if we go

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.100 
up but one huge thing to note if we go

back into loners base at his top
barracks<00:05:22.500> there<00:05:22.650> is<00:05:22.770> combat<00:05:23.250> shield<00:05:23.520> just<00:05:23.940> now

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
researching so that is going to

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.520 
researching so that is going to
definitely<00:05:26.280> put<00:05:26.789> a<00:05:26.820> damper<00:05:26.910> on<00:05:27.240> loners<00:05:28.110> timing

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
definitely put a damper on loners timing

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.290 
definitely put a damper on loners timing
he<00:05:28.650> absolutely<00:05:29.130> wants<00:05:29.490> to<00:05:29.669> wait<00:05:29.820> for<00:05:30.000> that<00:05:30.120> as
