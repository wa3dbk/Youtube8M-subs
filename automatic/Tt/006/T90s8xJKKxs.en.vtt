00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 nice guys almost between hd and welcome to 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.710
 this new weekly section calls 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.080
 as fares benches on demolition in 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.309
 determined but today the first map in 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.400
 I'll give you this video tutorial 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.379
 standoff as the main mode 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.289
 precisely demolition here I enjoy so much 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.810
 to make numerous kill is other 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.090
 scores then today I will try to be 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.810
 in fact it is clear to all intents and purposes 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.730
 tell you clearly the points has i 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.470
 limits not to be exceeded 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.360
 I chose this piece of clip or note 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.420
 to make you have to see how many killers yes 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.950
 they do if respected precisely to the maximum 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.559
 the performance of all the rules 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.480
 just to be able to do sponky ed 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.300
 then I bring the video a little forward into 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.190
 where we are here just see how 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.530
 the enemies are born I have chosen precisely also 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.199
 this piece of clip to let people know 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.390
 that again and maybe at the first bases on 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.329
 black ops two does not know what it means 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.550
 maybe the term stalking 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.090
 as you can see I will do a series of killings 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.510
 and the game will end 57 16 if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.830
 and I will go fairly positively 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.340
 then to be able to apply this 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.340
 technique 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.810
 the rules are many the most important is 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.270
 that of being able to play with one 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.030
 good team and above all that has the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.460
 microphone at least someone be in 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.080
 group of 6 and at least one team 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.390
 listen, and I do in this case 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.790
 communicated the limits not to have 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.030
 overcome now let's get into mode 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.900
 free and I'll show you the points is the sport 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.579
 micop robberies 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.829
 let's go straight away then I'll go in fact 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.509
 in their sport it is as I think you have 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.460
 noticed from the beginning their shores 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.560
 this now I'll show you maybe I do 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.220
 go the video ahead i will show you how 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.680
 enemies are born a moment a little 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.680
 patience and you will see what will happen 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.249
 here it is now, dates look contains 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.000
 then the main points are born 

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:09.119
 features are either this or at worst 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.459
 of the hypotheses that this really is 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.840
 it involves a bit of difficulty but 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.060
 this also 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.910
 so guys the main points are 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.160
 precisely these in which you see me 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.970
 I'll fix in this case look here 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.310
 behind or even behind the wagon 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.220
 armed and I'll be able to do a good part 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:34.209
 killings then what happens 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:37.090
 if we exceed the limits set the limits 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.420
 and not having to overcome it was done now 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.860
 which makes it difficult to enter too much 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.739
 in their spoon and if not what 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.420
 it will happen now I will bring you the 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.160
 video later and I'll show you that 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.099
 what will happen are in this case I am 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.870
 entered too much in their spawn though 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:57.010
 I did some killing while 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.019
 now look, here's what happens 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.150
 if you get too close to them spawn 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.540
 will change in effect and there will be 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.340
 precisely the spawn will be born on this side 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.170
 now I don't remember the precise point 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:13.680
 but you will risk being hit 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:17.169
 from an enemy is like the first post here 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.389
 I finish this part directing us there 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:21.280
 we will direct in the second part 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:24.669
 in which there will be interval and exchange 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.260
 of position here we are now you 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:28.180
 I will show the second point of 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.480
 shores when there has been precisely 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.849
 interval is now I'll show you precisely 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.560
 the point also because we don't say done 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.630
 a couple of spa splits as well as the even 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.720
 because it is quite difficult to succeed in 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:44.769
 block it push this side then 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.049
 Head immediately in the free mode 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:50.049
 same thing just the same rules that 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:53.739
 approached first now I'll show you the 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:56.410
 most enemy banks then 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.590
 of points where enemies are born 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.019
 it is in this shed house like it 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.549
 you want to define right now I will send 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.329
 the video forward I will show you that 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.329
 what will happen 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:17.350
 so here we are, the spawn can also be 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.450
 from these in this data though 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.180
 precisely in most of the 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:26.110
 hypothesis will happen inside that cottage e 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.870
 Now here it is precisely that I will show you 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:32.110
 look here the enemies will be born here 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.370
 look at how many are born then i 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:40.000
 these are the limits to be avoided 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.620
 you will have to put yourself here always repaired 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.220
 here because otherwise then me 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:48.130
 they will kill or here you can put 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.500
 here with the character then the video can 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.150
 add term one feels maybe 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.250
 with the second episode the week 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.810
 next if you like write below the 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.670
 name of the map you want to see 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.240
 this video tutorial feels beautiful 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.240
 boys
