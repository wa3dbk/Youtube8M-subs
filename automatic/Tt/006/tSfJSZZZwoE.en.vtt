take a look at is one that's going to be

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.130 
take a look at is one that's going to be
perfect<00:02:33.250> for<00:02:33.610> our<00:02:33.730> goalie<00:02:34.000> here<00:02:34.360> as<00:02:34.480> you<00:02:34.989> can

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
perfect for our goalie here as you can

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.110

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
playing surface so this would be the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.590 
playing surface so this would be the
right<00:02:38.680> paddle<00:02:38.950> length<00:02:39.220> for<00:02:39.430> him<00:02:39.580> now<00:02:40.239> keep<00:02:40.450> in

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
right paddle length for him now keep in

for a goalie stick so you're going to

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.589 
for a goalie stick so you're going to
get<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.709> realistic<00:02:45.160> size<00:02:45.640> of<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.120> goalie<00:02:46.300> stick

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
get a realistic size of the goalie stick

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.690 
get a realistic size of the goalie stick
that<00:02:46.720> you<00:02:46.840> need<00:02:47.050> and<00:02:47.440> also<00:02:48.250> with<00:02:48.400> goalie<00:02:48.640> stick

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
that you need and also with goalie stick

that you need and also with goalie stick
there's<00:02:49.090> going<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:49.269> be<00:02:49.330> two<00:02:49.600> main<00:02:49.930> types<00:02:50.230> of

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
there's going to be two main types of

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.960 
there's going to be two main types of
curves<00:02:50.620> out<00:02:50.920> there<00:02:51.130> there's<00:02:51.640> gonna<00:02:51.760> be<00:02:51.850> the

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
curves out there there's gonna be the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.300 
curves out there there's gonna be the
mid<00:02:52.209> curve<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.840> heel<00:02:53.140> curve<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:54.069> mid

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
mid curve and the heel curve the mid

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.130 
mid curve and the heel curve the mid
curve<00:02:54.610> is<00:02:54.790> going<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.000> be<00:02:55.090> better<00:02:55.269> for<00:02:55.540> cradling

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
curve is going to be better for cradling

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.229 
curve is going to be better for cradling
the<00:02:56.319> puck<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:56.709> playing<00:02:57.400> at<00:02:57.610> kind<00:02:57.819> of<00:02:57.850> longer

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
the puck and playing at kind of longer

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.720 
the puck and playing at kind of longer
distances<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.019> the<00:02:59.680> heel<00:02:59.950> curve<00:03:00.220> is<00:03:00.400> usually

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
distances and the heel curve is usually

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.979 
distances and the heel curve is usually
going<00:03:00.819> to<00:03:00.880> be<00:03:00.940> a<00:03:01.000> little<00:03:01.180> bit<00:03:01.360> straighter<00:03:01.660> and

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
going to be a little bit straighter and

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.720 
going to be a little bit straighter and
a<00:03:02.380> little<00:03:02.560> bit<00:03:02.650> better<00:03:02.799> for<00:03:03.040> controlling<00:03:03.610> the

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
a little bit better for controlling the

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.960 
a little bit better for controlling the
puck<00:03:03.910> and<00:03:04.209> doing<00:03:04.690> crisp<00:03:05.019> passes<00:03:05.500> on<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.739> ice

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
puck and doing crisp passes on the ice

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.280 
puck and doing crisp passes on the ice
so<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:07.120> was<00:03:07.209> just<00:03:07.360> a<00:03:07.450> quick<00:03:07.600> look<00:03:07.900> here<00:03:07.930> how
