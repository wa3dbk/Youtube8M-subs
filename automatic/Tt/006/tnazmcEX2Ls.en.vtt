00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
from the muscles actually the little

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.600 
from the muscles actually the little
connective<00:01:05.470> tissue<00:01:05.680> gets<00:01:05.950> pulled<00:01:06.189> away<00:01:06.310> from

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.009 
get the right spot they get me to
breathe<00:02:05.080> properly<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.920> relax<00:02:06.250> and<00:02:06.780> they<00:02:07.780> count

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
breathe properly to relax and they count

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.949 
breathe properly to relax and they count
for<00:02:08.140> me<00:02:08.439> you<00:02:09.069> had<00:02:09.220> one<00:02:09.489> to<00:02:09.819> breathe<00:02:10.509> in<00:02:10.720> and

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
for me you had one to breathe in and

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.050 
for me you had one to breathe in and
breathe<00:02:11.230> out

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
breathe out

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.820 
breathe out
couple<00:02:12.510> times<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:13.080> then<00:02:13.230> they<00:02:13.349> prepare<00:02:13.709> you

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
couple times and then they prepare you

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.340 
couple times and then they prepare you
for<00:02:13.860> when<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.430> actually

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350

and<00:02:21.860> then<00:02:22.040> one<00:02:22.310> by<00:02:22.340> one<00:02:22.700> they'd<00:02:22.969> squeeze<00:02:23.329> it

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
and then one by one they'd squeeze it

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.649 
and then one by one they'd squeeze it
some<00:02:24.739> of<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:24.920> skin<00:02:25.189> together<00:02:25.370> with<00:02:26.180> a<00:02:26.209> where

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
some of the skin together with a where

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.390 
some of the skin together with a where
they<00:02:26.750> marked<00:02:27.049> out<00:02:27.200> where<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:27.799> puck<00:02:27.950> was<00:02:27.980> going

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
they marked out where the puck was going

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.429 
they marked out where the puck was going
in<00:02:28.549> and<00:02:28.790> then<00:02:29.780> they're<00:02:29.989> talking<00:02:30.349> you<00:02:30.379> through

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:30.439 
in and then they're talking you through

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:32.349 
in and then they're talking you through
a<00:02:30.739> couple<00:02:30.890> breathing<00:02:31.430> techniques<00:02:31.909> to<00:02:32.180> get

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:32.359 
a couple breathing techniques to get

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:37.089 
a couple breathing techniques to get
relaxed<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.650> then<00:02:35.349> once<00:02:36.349> I've<00:02:36.530> breathed<00:02:36.829> then

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
relaxed and then once I've breathed then

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.220 
relaxed and then once I've breathed then
they<00:02:37.280> put<00:02:37.519> the<00:02:37.670> hook<00:02:38.030> in<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.810> then<00:02:39.019> breathe

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
they put the hook in and then breathe

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.020 
they put the hook in and then breathe
out<00:02:39.439> and<00:02:39.620> so<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:39.980> hook<00:02:40.129> was<00:02:40.280> in<00:02:40.430> there<00:02:40.609> and<00:02:40.819> it

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
out and so the hook was in there and it

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.380 
out and so the hook was in there and it
was<00:02:41.150> really<00:02:41.510> fast<00:02:41.890> well<00:02:42.890> lubricated<00:02:43.189> too<00:02:43.790> and

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
was really fast well lubricated too and

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.839 
was really fast well lubricated too and
then<00:02:45.230> they<00:02:45.379> just<00:02:45.590> basically<00:02:45.890> went<00:02:46.430> down<00:02:46.609> that

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
then they just basically went down that

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.420 
then they just basically went down that
process<00:02:47.319> until<00:02:48.319> all<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.650> hooks<00:02:48.829> ring

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
process until all the hooks ring

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.420 
process until all the hooks ring
and<00:02:49.579> then<00:02:50.469> where<00:02:51.469> the<00:02:51.590> pulley<00:02:51.799> was<00:02:52.010> I<00:02:52.159> had<00:02:52.400> a

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
and then where the pulley was I had a

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.030 
and then where the pulley was I had a
few<00:02:52.639> minutes<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:53.409> relax<00:02:54.409> until<00:02:54.709> though

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
few minutes to relax until though

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.500 
few minutes to relax until though
everything<00:02:55.519> was<00:02:55.549> set<00:02:55.849> up<00:02:55.879> with<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.299> pulley

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
everything was set up with the pulley

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.949 
everything was set up with the pulley
and<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.079> ropes<00:02:57.290> and<00:02:57.799> I<00:02:58.430> was<00:02:58.579> took<00:02:59.419> the<00:02:59.599> table

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
and the ropes and I was took the table

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.339 
and the ropes and I was took the table
over<00:03:00.079> underneath<00:03:00.560> that<00:03:00.769> and<00:03:02.049> lay<00:03:03.049> down<00:03:03.079> my

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
over underneath that and lay down my

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.640 
over underneath that and lay down my
stomach<00:03:03.739> again<00:03:03.859> and<00:03:04.189> then<00:03:04.340> they<00:03:04.549> started<00:03:04.970> to

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
stomach again and then they started to

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.409 
stomach again and then they started to
hook<00:03:06.650> up<00:03:06.829> the<00:03:07.010> hooks<00:03:07.459> to<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.730> rope<00:03:07.849> in<00:03:08.299> the

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:08.419 
hook up the hooks to the rope in the

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:08.740 
hook up the hooks to the rope in the
pulley

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
pulley

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.270 
pulley
one<00:03:09.139> by<00:03:09.319> one<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:10.569> get<00:03:11.569> a<00:03:11.599> spiritual<00:03:12.280> type
