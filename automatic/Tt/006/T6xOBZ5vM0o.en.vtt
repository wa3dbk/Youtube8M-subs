00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.649
 unchanged sponsor mary kay 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.660
 every person has a favorite 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.230
 color in which he is ready to dress with legs 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.719

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.309
 I personally have a favorite color green but he 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.350
 unfortunately not in fashion 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.350
 and if your favorite color is yellow you 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.500
 incredibly lucky he is the trend of this 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.500
 season 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.810
 yellow is one of the brightest and 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.410
 sunny colors and picks it 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.000

 activity and constant movement 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.489
