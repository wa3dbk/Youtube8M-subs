three levels of stress low medium and

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.050 
three levels of stress low medium and
high<00:03:00.910> as<00:03:02.290> we're<00:03:03.290> using<00:03:03.519> prosperity<00:03:04.519> thinking

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
high as we're using prosperity thinking

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.140 
high as we're using prosperity thinking
we<00:03:05.570> know<00:03:05.870> that<00:03:06.320> we<00:03:06.530> can<00:03:06.830> reduce<00:03:07.340> those<00:03:07.820> stress

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
we know that we can reduce those stress

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.960 
we know that we can reduce those stress
levels<00:03:08.860> so<00:03:09.860> let's<00:03:10.100> talk<00:03:10.340> about<00:03:10.400> what<00:03:10.820> it's

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
levels so let's talk about what it's

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.229 
levels so let's talk about what it's
like<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:11.480> be<00:03:11.510> under<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:12.019> lot<00:03:12.290> of<00:03:12.590> stress<00:03:13.239> when

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
we're talking about dysfunctional that

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.860 
we're talking about dysfunctional that
means<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:25.220> we're<00:03:25.400> not<00:03:25.430> functioning<00:03:26.180> at<00:03:26.480> the

tend to be very emotional during this

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.880 
tend to be very emotional during this
time<00:03:32.299> when<00:03:32.750> we're<00:03:32.930> under<00:03:33.170> a<00:03:33.200> high<00:03:33.440> level<00:03:33.709> of

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
time when we're under a high level of

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.789 
time when we're under a high level of
stress<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.519> many<00:03:35.360> of<00:03:35.570> us<00:03:35.780> know<00:03:36.230> that<00:03:36.260> we're<00:03:36.769> a

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
stress and many of us know that we're a

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.860 
stress and many of us know that we're a
little<00:03:37.190> more<00:03:37.459> confused<00:03:38.060> when<00:03:38.360> we're<00:03:38.510> under

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
little more confused when we're under

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.630

more stress and of course we're more at
disease<00:03:43.640> and<00:03:44.090> that<00:03:45.049> means<00:03:45.350> that<00:03:45.590> we're<00:03:45.799> not<00:03:45.829> as

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
disease and that means that we're not as

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.350 
disease and that means that we're not as
feeling<00:03:48.079> is<00:03:48.170> easy<00:03:48.410> in<00:03:48.620> our<00:03:48.709> life<00:03:48.890> as<00:03:49.400> we're

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
using prosperity thinking we know that

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.300 
using prosperity thinking we know that
we<00:03:53.030> can<00:03:53.239> reduce<00:03:53.420> it<00:03:53.810> so<00:03:54.320> let's<00:03:54.530> talk<00:03:54.769> about<00:03:54.950> a

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
we can reduce it so let's talk about a

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.150 
we can reduce it so let's talk about a
medium<00:03:55.880> level<00:03:56.090> of<00:03:56.360> stress<00:03:56.799> here's<00:03:57.799> where<00:03:58.040> we

medium level of stress here's where we

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.870 
medium level of stress here's where we
have<00:03:58.400> a<00:03:58.430> bit<00:03:58.790> more<00:03:58.840> awareness<00:03:59.840> and<00:04:00.640> we're<00:04:01.640> more
