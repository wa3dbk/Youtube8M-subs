00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We could go somewhere

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.024
Where do you wanna go?

00:00:03.024 --> 00:00:04.048
The sea?

00:00:04.048 --> 00:00:05.357
You wanna take me to the sea?

00:00:05.357 --> 00:00:06.028
Yeah

00:00:06.028 --> 00:00:07.377
Why?

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.020
To be with you on the beach

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.780
I see

00:00:10.368 --> 00:00:12.368
And what would we do on the beach?

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.300
We could hold each other, just lay there

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.755
All right

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.001
And what beach did you have in mind?

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.760
The one you prefer

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.900
Let's go to the south it's better there is more sun

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.460
It's far isn't it?

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.040
A few hours in a train or a car and we're there

00:00:30.577 --> 00:00:32.577
It's true that it's been while since we havn't been away together

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.380
That's why

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.760
We could rest

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.820
We could walk around

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.380
We would play games

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.400
Exactly

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.955
We could talk

00:00:42.332 --> 00:00:43.232
Other things too...

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.460
Arthur: okay cut, cut, cut, STOP!

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.480
Lucas I think we can see the boom at one point

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.320
Arthur: It wasn't good

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.120
Seb: They were rehearsing right?

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.095
It wasn't a rehearsal for me 

00:01:00.103 --> 00:01:02.103
Joachim you're not...

00:01:02.103 --> 00:01:04.060
You want me to put more...

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.080
It just feels like you don't really believe in what you're saying

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.020
I thought he kind of believed...

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.020
Sarah: What did I do?  

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.840
Sarah: I thought I was tactile

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.580
Seb: We're pannicking

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.420
Seb: I'm sorry you ask for the planning so let me tell you that you have 7 minutes left for the take.6 now

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.520
Julia: Can I have my timecode?

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.620
Arthur: Can I give it to you later?

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.500
Julia: No you're gonna forget

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.180
Arthur: I'm in the middle of a hard negociation with the annoying assistant

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.340
Seb: Excuse me? I'm just doing my job

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.820

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.700

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.460
Arthur: Okay so we have 6 minutes so let's do this now 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.100

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.955

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.020
Sarah: But you liked the dialogues?

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.215
Arthur: You did great Sarah

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.900
Joachim: Come on! She wasn't in love enough

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.060
It felt like she didn't care. Don't say that she did great, it's too easy!

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.360
Arthur: Don't take it the wrong way

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.720
Arthur: You were good too

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.940
Arthur: But I think you can do even better

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.060
We're doubling it right? She's good but we double it?

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:17.982
Arthur: Mmmmh yes we can say that 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.016
Sarah: We can make some small changes

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.020
Arthur: Action!

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.200
Arthur: Lucas! Okay, Lucas you need to be ready

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.320
Lucas: I'm sorry you were talking that's why

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.200
Arthur: Yes but when I stop talking you need to be ready

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.460
Lucas: It hurts my arm

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.360
Seb: 4 minutes!

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.420

Joachim: Whenever you want boss

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.875
Arthur: It's "recording"

00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:37.417
Arthur: If you don't say "It's recording" I don't understand

00:02:37.417 --> 00:02:38.577
Lucas: Yeah it's recording

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.360
What do you wanna do this week-end?

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.687
Arthur: I didn't say "Action!"

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.300
Arthur: Is everyone focused?

00:02:48.546 --> 00:02:50.546
Lucas: It's recording

00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:52.628
Arthur: Action!

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.780
What do you wanna do this week-end?

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.705
I wanna go to the beach with you 

00:02:56.705 --> 00:02:57.825
Arthur: You need to articulate Joachim

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:58.700
Joachim: I'm sorry, I'm sorry

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.640
Arthur: Swallow your saliva 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.960
Joachim: You're right, you're right

00:03:01.975 --> 00:03:02.815

00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:07.571
Joachim: Can you start?

00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:09.195
What do you wanna do this week-end?

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.289
We could go to the beach together?

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.940
You wanna go to the beach? What beach?

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.558
Maybe a beach in the south?

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.140
But it's far!

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.540
Yes but it's sunny

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.735
That's true

00:03:20.415 --> 00:03:22.415
And how long do you wanna stay?

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.060
As long as you want

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.520
Arthur: Yeah but touch her breast when you say that

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.540
Lucas: Hummm

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.520
Arthur: Lucas, now is really not the time to be annoying

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.380
Sarah: I'm not really into that idea either

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.940
Julia: Is it cut?

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.260
Arthur: Oh shit it's cut 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.360
