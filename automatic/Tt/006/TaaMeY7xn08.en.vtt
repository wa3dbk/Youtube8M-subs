00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello everyone welcome for the 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:08.160
 third or second video so I 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.840
 search information about skylander 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.340
 on the internet the information 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.590
 I needed I did not find them 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.379
 so I decided to make the video for 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.789
 explain it here is the box sold in 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.230
 big surfaces me I asked him the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.260
 question of how does it work 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.970
 and so I bought myself finally redeem 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.380
 for our sons but I still have to 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:32.369
 with skylanders then in the case 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.719
 you have three figurines you have the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.430
 portal and you have the cd you can 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.120
 also buy 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.440
 regardless of the figurines apart so 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.129
 I think it still costs enough 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.000
 dear it's 10 euros a figurine so 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.760
 it's quite consistent 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.260
 so I present you the different 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:01:01.680
 figurines and three that are put into 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.519
 the lot then the one from the top is called 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.920
 tiger you have the second spiro and the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.340
 last patrick grenthe and you can 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.310
 in there is a flop so your children 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:20.580
 will be delighted if we launched 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:23.520
 the installation so the cd for valid 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.570
 you have connected the xbox console to 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.659
 xi'an who has for several xbox consoles 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:37.909
 ps3 the wii is also the choice that at the 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.909
 so never the cd I think the portal 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.410
 I do not have the info I like 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.350
 find explanations so I wanted 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.710
 give 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.400
 so I'm going to wear it I'm looking for a 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:56.930
 USB port 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:02:00.110
 I plug or even msb do not try 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:05.570
 scripted in the hookup so here 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:09.560
 me first is my controller and the 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.740
 second is the portal that is pretty 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.459
 nice you see they change color 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.050
 pink purple 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.510
 it's very fun for kids 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.600
 and in my opinion they are very happy 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.640
 no, so the time we proceed as they 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.280
 tell us you press play from 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.780
 the snow legally they know that by 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.040
 heart but you as a parent you 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.170
 the misfits of knowing 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.970
 ah I was going to forget your system 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.790
 will probably give the update so 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.260
 it will restart your console based 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.550
 of the seniority that she wanted 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.380
 let it go but it's all done 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.620
 rightness that offers you to launch the 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:48.459
 game with the play mode so really 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:50.709
 two adventures at the skylands I valid 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:56.120
 start a new game 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:58.810
 here I am taking a city part of 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.850
 valves it is now we will see 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:08.080
 how does it work? 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.880
 so now I 'm taking a figurine 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.270
 has passed 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.430
 so there the system asks you players 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:20.360
 a thank you placed to its dealers on the 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:23.770
 portal I take the figurine I the 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:28.910
 removal on the portal 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:30.120
 he's being the figurine 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.840
 [Music] 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.840
 I am going to do the same thing 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:40.390
 I withdraw ok I take the next 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.480
 on his beautiful but kid my opinion 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.970
 they will be able to have fun 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.220
 and then it's very playful it's very 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:56.640
 easy to use 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.640
 I take off the hero people many others 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.140
 here 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.620
 you see it's super great for 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.150
 kids and it's in the form of comics then 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.870
 the bus is low and break everything to 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.870
 recover coins 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.019
 here 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:20.310
 then each hero the provisions 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:23.860
 physical do not know others 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:28.840
 so the goal broke there I'm going 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:31.570
 break the barrel in hockey that's it 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:36.270
 hope pieces and that's it and find 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:38.680
 the keys to play very easy to use 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.780
 characters are relatively expensive 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.280
 expensive but in my opinion once you 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.110
 will have exploited between the children will have 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.030
 theirs and the ability of each 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.759
 character they will be able to exchange them 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.970
 exchange with small bodies a good 60 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:53.669
 euros the console the portal easy 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.340
 of use 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.780
 I was expecting something from 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.660
 complicated but in fact it's very simple 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:06.840
 my kids this is a great gift from 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.840
 christmas thank you dad for the sweet car
