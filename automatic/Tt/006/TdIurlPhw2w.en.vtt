00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.030 
speaker okay okay cool cool so you got a
little<00:01:31.510> bit<00:01:31.630> more<00:01:32.050> controlled<00:01:32.560> there<00:01:32.830> and

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
little bit more controlled there and

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.190 
little bit more controlled there and
then<00:01:33.640> going<00:01:34.210> on<00:01:34.330> mixed<00:01:34.600> sound<00:01:34.690> I<00:01:34.780> guess<00:01:34.930> we<00:01:35.050> get

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
then going on mixed sound I guess we get

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.190 
then going on mixed sound I guess we get
daisy-chain<00:01:36.040> speaker<00:01:36.550> exactly<00:01:37.030> okay<00:01:37.210> cool<00:01:38.020> so

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
daisy-chain speaker exactly okay cool so

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.750 
daisy-chain speaker exactly okay cool so
