00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
yeah so I I would refer back to the

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.190

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
method of centering prayer which is my

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.930 
method of centering prayer which is my
sort<00:00:07.770> of<00:00:07.830> contemplative<00:00:08.400> prayer<00:00:08.610> of<00:00:08.730> choice

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:10.940 
sort of contemplative prayer of choice

centering<00:00:11.940> prayer<00:00:12.150> incorporates<00:00:13.820> silent

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
centering prayer incorporates silent

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.080 
centering prayer incorporates silent
solitude<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.630> stillness<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.910> some<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.000> the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
solitude and stillness and some of the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.250 
solitude and stillness and some of the
other<00:00:18.330> prayer<00:00:18.900> practices<00:00:19.500> may<00:00:20.460> include<00:00:21.260> one

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
other prayer practices may include one

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.590 
other prayer practices may include one
or<00:00:22.529> two<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:23.070> those<00:00:23.189> elements<00:00:23.400> but<00:00:24.090> centering

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
or two of those elements but centering

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.300 
or two of those elements but centering
prayer<00:00:24.779> includes<00:00:25.170> all<00:00:25.320> three<00:00:25.560> which<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.039> find

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
prayer includes all three which I find

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.390 
prayer includes all three which I find
to<00:00:26.460> be<00:00:26.490> really<00:00:26.910> important<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:28.400> silent

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
to be really important and silent

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.679 
to be really important and silent
solitude<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.849> stillness<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.330> think<00:00:30.510> have<00:00:30.660> a

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
solitude and stillness I think have a

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.030 
solitude and stillness I think have a
way<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.949> connecting<00:00:31.949> us<00:00:32.309> with<00:00:32.730> Christ<00:00:33.540> and

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
way of connecting us with Christ and

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.139 
way of connecting us with Christ and
identifying<00:00:35.040> with<00:00:35.250> Christ<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.850> certain

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
identifying with Christ in certain

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.729 
identifying with Christ in certain
aspects<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:37.879> particularly<00:00:38.879> on<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.210> cross<00:00:39.739> in

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
aspects of particularly on the cross in

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.920 
aspects of particularly on the cross in
his<00:00:40.910> abandonment<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.149> powerlessness<00:00:42.690> and

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
his abandonment and powerlessness and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.700 
his abandonment and powerlessness and
that<00:00:43.800> type<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.040> things<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.460> centering<00:00:45.149> prayer

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
that type of things so centering prayer

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.520 
that type of things so centering prayer
is<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.829> really<00:00:47.460> simple<00:00:47.730> method<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.960> silent

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
is a really simple method of silent

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.680 
is a really simple method of silent
prayer<00:00:50.059> but<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.329> difficult<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.170> us<00:00:52.550> so<00:00:53.690> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
prayer but it is difficult for us so the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.029 
prayer but it is difficult for us so the
basic<00:00:55.309> steps<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.699> are<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.570> just<00:00:58.230> come<00:00:58.859> into

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
basic steps of it are to just come into

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.470 
basic steps of it are to just come into
a<00:00:59.250> quiet<00:00:59.879> space<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.719> if<00:01:01.170> you've<00:01:01.770> got<00:01:02.190> that

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
a quiet space and if you've got that

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.830 
a quiet space and if you've got that
privilege<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.750> then<00:01:03.930> sit<00:01:04.970> in<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.090> chair<00:01:06.390> or

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
privilege and then sit in a chair or

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.859 
privilege and then sit in a chair or
maybe<00:01:07.439> on<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> floor<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.939> idea<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.479> find<00:01:09.659> a

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
maybe on the floor the idea is to find a

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.580 
maybe on the floor the idea is to find a
comfortable<00:01:10.229> but<00:01:10.530> attentive<00:01:11.040> posture<00:01:11.760> so

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
comfortable but attentive posture so

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.880 
comfortable but attentive posture so

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
typically feet on the floor just flat on

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.249 
typically feet on the floor just flat on
the<00:01:17.100> floor<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.790> back<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.210> it's<00:01:18.840> straight

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
the floor and the back is it's straight

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.980 
the floor and the back is it's straight
against<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.740> back<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.130> chair<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.990> and

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
against the back of the chair and and

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.649 
against the back of the chair and and
then<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.740> just<00:01:22.950> gently<00:01:23.310> introduce<00:01:24.180> a

as<00:02:09.379> as<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.800> symbol<00:02:10.399> to<00:02:10.670> consent<00:02:11.239> to<00:02:11.599> the

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
as as a symbol to consent to the

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.440 
as as a symbol to consent to the
presence<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:12.800> action<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.280> God<00:02:13.459> within<00:02:13.730> me<00:02:13.940> and

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
and the concept behind the prayer draws

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.009 
and the concept behind the prayer draws
from<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:18.080> Christian<00:02:18.890> theology<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:20.019> that

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
from the Christian theology that that

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.589 
from the Christian theology that that
Christ<00:02:21.470> dwells<00:02:21.799> within<00:02:22.069> us<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.700> so<00:02:23.420> what

space<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.930> connect<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.730> presence<00:02:29.090> of<00:02:29.180> God

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
space to connect to the presence of God

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.369 
space to connect to the presence of God
within<00:02:29.660> us<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:31.069> as<00:02:31.700> I<00:02:32.019> introduce<00:02:33.019> that

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379
