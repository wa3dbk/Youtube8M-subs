have notebooks that you don't go through
very<00:00:18.510> often<00:00:19.220> or<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.640> don't<00:00:20.820> use<00:00:21.029> up<00:00:21.060> too

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
very often or that you don't use up too

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.620 
very often or that you don't use up too
quickly<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:22.910> to<00:00:23.910> use<00:00:24.330> 12<00:00:25.019> by<00:00:25.170> 12<00:00:25.410> papers<00:00:25.859> to

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
quickly is to use 12 by 12 papers to

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.910 
quickly is to use 12 by 12 papers to
jazz<00:00:27.630> them<00:00:27.900> up<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.140> little<00:00:28.230> bit<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.710> I'm<00:00:28.800> going

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
jazz them up a little bit and I'm going

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.290 
jazz them up a little bit and I'm going
to<00:00:28.980> show<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.250> how<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.519> do<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:29.970> it's<00:00:30.179> very

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
to show you how to do that it's very

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.020 
to show you how to do that it's very
very<00:00:31.019> simple<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.460> beauty<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.880> this

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
very simple and the beauty of this

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.380 
very simple and the beauty of this
method<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:34.260> don't<00:00:34.440> actually<00:00:35.390> it's

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
method is that you don't actually it's

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.139 
method is that you don't actually it's
not<00:00:36.570> permanent<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.260> you're<00:00:37.920> not<00:00:38.010> changing<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
not permanent so you're not changing the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.680 
not permanent so you're not changing the
cover<00:00:39.570> you're<00:00:40.410> just<00:00:40.620> making<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.280> slipcover<00:00:41.690> so

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
cover you're just making a slipcover so

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.150 
cover you're just making a slipcover so
the<00:00:42.809> first<00:00:43.020> thing<00:00:43.200> you'll<00:00:43.350> need<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.739> some<00:00:43.770> 12

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the first thing you'll need is some 12

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.610 
the first thing you'll need is some 12
by<00:00:44.340> 12<00:00:44.579> paper<00:00:44.879> I've<00:00:45.420> chosen<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:46.050> one<00:00:46.320> because

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
by 12 paper I've chosen this one because

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
by 12 paper I've chosen this one because
it's<00:00:46.739> going<00:00:46.890> on<00:00:47.010> my<00:00:47.190> writing<00:00:47.640> book<00:00:49.039> and<00:00:50.039> you

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
it's going on my writing book and you

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.750 
it's going on my writing book and you
want<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.910> decide<00:00:51.270> whether<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.840> want<00:00:52.760> which

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
want to decide whether you want which

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.090 
want to decide whether you want which
section<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.660> paper<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.260> want<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.829> do<00:00:56.010> you

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
section of the paper you want so do you

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.260 
section of the paper you want so do you
want<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.610> top<00:00:56.940> half<00:00:57.239> or<00:00:57.719> bottom<00:00:57.840> bit<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:59.270> think

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
want that top half or bottom bit I think

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.529 
want that top half or bottom bit I think
I<00:01:01.430> think<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.520> like<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.789> bottom<00:01:03.149> bit<00:01:03.359> actually

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
I think I like the bottom bit actually

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.929 
I think I like the bottom bit actually
the<00:01:03.870> bottom<00:01:04.019> bit<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:05.040> top<00:01:05.400> part<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> bit

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
the bottom bit is this top part is a bit

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:06.649 
the bottom bit is this top part is a bit
too<00:01:06.210> busy

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
too busy

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.679 
too busy
unlike<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.409> bottom<00:01:07.740> bit<00:01:07.890> with<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.130> letters

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
unlike the bottom bit with the letters

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.200 
unlike the bottom bit with the letters
so<00:01:09.950> that's<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.159> bit<00:01:11.280> I'll<00:01:11.400> need<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.760> trim<00:01:12.030> off

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
so that's the bit I'll need to trim off

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.149 
so that's the bit I'll need to trim off
and<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.659> want<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.900> trim<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.170> off<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.560> 21

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
and you want to trim it off to 21

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.840 
and you want to trim it off to 21
centimeters<00:01:15.000> tall<00:01:15.320> that<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:17.130> over<00:01:17.640> eight

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
centimeters tall that is just over eight

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:28.070 
centimeters tall that is just over eight
inches<00:01:21.170> let<00:01:22.170> me<00:01:22.290> look<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:27.080> eight

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
inches let me look on here it is eight

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
inches let me look on here it is eight
and<00:01:28.439> two<00:01:28.650> eighths<00:01:28.860> inches<00:01:32.689> so<00:01:33.689> I'm<00:01:33.810> going<00:01:34.020> to

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
and two eighths inches so I'm going to

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.580 
and two eighths inches so I'm going to
trim<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.159> off<00:01:38.630> probably<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:40.259> try<00:01:40.409> that

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
trim that off probably just try that

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.420 
trim that off probably just try that
again

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:02:00.250 

so<00:01:47.030> 21<00:01:47.900> centimeters<00:01:58.360> nice<00:01:59.360> and<00:01:59.600> simple<00:02:00.020> first

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
so 21 centimeters nice and simple first

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.720 
so 21 centimeters nice and simple first
thing<00:02:00.440> we're<00:02:00.560> going<00:02:00.680> to<00:02:00.770> do<00:02:00.950> is<00:02:01.160> fold<00:02:01.490> it<00:02:01.670> in

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
thing we're going to do is fold it in

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:23.770 
thing we're going to do is fold it in
half<00:02:15.400> give<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.460> a<00:02:16.490> good<00:02:16.640> crease<00:02:22.660> then<00:02:23.660> we're

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
half give it a good crease then we're

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.770 
half give it a good crease then we're
going<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.020> measure<00:02:24.350> from<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.730> center<00:02:25.910> point

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.210 

mark<00:02:29.780> that<00:02:30.050> with<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.230> pen<00:02:31.100> just<00:02:31.400> so<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:31.820> can<00:02:31.970> see

that<00:03:10.040> side<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:11.110> eleven<00:03:12.110> and<00:03:12.200> a<00:03:12.290> quarter<00:03:12.500> this

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
that side and eleven and a quarter this

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.140 
that side and eleven and a quarter this
side<00:03:14.500> that<00:03:15.500> just<00:03:15.709> allows<00:03:15.980> for<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:16.970> wrap

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
side that just allows for the wrap

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.030 
side that just allows for the wrap
around<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.570> spine<00:03:17.900> expanding<00:03:18.739> of<00:03:18.800> the<00:03:18.860> book

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
around the spine expanding of the book

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.190 
around the spine expanding of the book
and<00:03:19.310> so<00:03:19.370> on<00:03:21.190> this<00:03:22.190> is<00:03:22.400> for<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.870> Midori

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
and so on this is for the Midori

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.960 
and so on this is for the Midori
standard<00:03:24.769> obviously<00:03:25.220> you<00:03:25.370> would<00:03:25.489> want<00:03:25.519> to<00:03:25.850> do

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
standard obviously you would want to do

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:33.690 
standard obviously you would want to do
it<00:03:26.090> different<00:03:27.050> size<00:03:27.230> for<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.910> smaller<00:03:28.910> one

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.130 

and<00:03:34.700> we're<00:03:35.060> going<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.239> score<00:03:35.660> that<00:03:35.870> line

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
and we're going to score that line

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.180 
and we're going to score that line
across<00:03:37.630> I'm<00:03:38.630> using<00:03:38.959> a<00:03:39.140> quilting<00:03:39.620> ruler<00:03:39.950> so<00:03:40.160> I

across I'm using a quilting ruler so I

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.190 
across I'm using a quilting ruler so I
don't<00:03:40.400> need<00:03:40.549> to<00:03:40.670> score<00:03:40.940> it<00:03:41.090> on<00:03:41.180> both<00:03:41.330> sides<00:03:41.750> but

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
don't need to score it on both sides but

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.509 
don't need to score it on both sides but
you<00:03:43.840> can<00:03:44.840> I<00:03:45.080> don't<00:03:45.620> need<00:03:45.739> to<00:03:45.860> mark<00:03:46.040> it<00:03:46.280> on<00:03:46.370> both

you can I don't need to mark it on both

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:52.760 
you can I don't need to mark it on both
sides<00:03:46.940> but<00:03:47.269> you<00:03:47.390> can<00:03:47.540> do<00:03:47.690> that<00:03:47.810> if<00:03:47.930> you<00:03:47.989> want<00:03:48.170> to

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
on this side I just popped a tiny piece

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.780 
on this side I just popped a tiny piece
of<00:05:14.230> vellum<00:05:14.440> tape<00:05:14.860> on<00:05:15.160> the<00:05:15.310> top<00:05:15.490> and<00:05:15.670> bottom

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.240 
of vellum tape on the top and bottom
just<00:05:16.150> to<00:05:16.270> stop<00:05:16.540> it<00:05:16.690> flapping<00:05:17.050> about<00:05:17.140> now<00:05:18.040> this

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
just to stop it flapping about now this

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.520 
just to stop it flapping about now this
one<00:05:18.490> isn't<00:05:18.880> so<00:05:18.940> bad<00:05:19.180> it's<00:05:19.630> not<00:05:19.840> it<00:05:20.230> doesn't

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.930 
one isn't so bad it's not it doesn't
look<00:05:20.650> like<00:05:20.680> it's<00:05:21.010> gonna<00:05:21.100> do<00:05:21.340> it<00:05:21.490> but<00:05:21.610> I'll<00:05:21.700> show

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
look like it's gonna do it but I'll show

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.240 
look like it's gonna do it but I'll show
you<00:05:21.970> what<00:05:22.180> I've<00:05:22.300> done<00:05:22.330> anyway<00:05:22.900> so<00:05:23.860> I<00:05:23.890> just<00:05:24.100> took

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
you what I've done anyway so I just took

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.580 
you what I've done anyway so I just took
some<00:05:24.310> vellum<00:05:24.730> tape<00:05:25.120> this<00:05:25.390> is<00:05:25.570> a<00:05:25.600> scotch<00:05:26.230> vellum

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
some vellum tape this is a scotch vellum

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.190 
some vellum tape this is a scotch vellum
tape<00:05:26.830> it's<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:27.880> clear<00:05:28.270> see-through<00:05:28.630> one<00:05:29.020> and

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
tape it's the clear see-through one and

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.070 
tape it's the clear see-through one and
you<00:05:29.290> can<00:05:29.410> actually<00:05:29.560> remove<00:05:29.920> it<00:05:30.370> so<00:05:31.300> you<00:05:31.870> could

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
you can actually remove it so you could

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.750 
you can actually remove it so you could
use<00:05:32.260> washi<00:05:32.530> as<00:05:32.890> well<00:05:33.070> or<00:05:33.310> something<00:05:33.610> like<00:05:33.700> that

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
use washi as well or something like that

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.360 
use washi as well or something like that
if<00:05:34.060> you<00:05:34.150> want<00:05:34.300> to<00:05:34.360> secure<00:05:34.660> it<00:05:34.840> a<00:05:34.900> bit<00:05:35.050> better

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
if you want to secure it a bit better

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.580 
if you want to secure it a bit better
now<00:05:36.370> don't<00:05:36.880> just<00:05:37.210> open<00:05:37.420> it<00:05:37.690> out<00:05:37.870> and<00:05:38.110> stick<00:05:38.380> it

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
now don't just open it out and stick it

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.430 
now don't just open it out and stick it
because<00:05:38.950> you'll<00:05:39.190> push<00:05:39.850> the<00:05:40.060> cover<00:05:40.270> out<00:05:40.600> so

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
because you'll push the cover out so

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.500 
because you'll push the cover out so
it's<00:05:41.620> not<00:05:41.740> flush<00:05:42.040> with<00:05:42.280> the<00:05:42.400> edge<00:05:42.520> you<00:05:43.270> want<00:05:43.450> to

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
it's not flush with the edge you want to

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.580 
it's not flush with the edge you want to
push<00:05:43.720> it<00:05:43.900> down<00:05:44.170> that<00:05:44.980> way<00:05:45.280> and<00:05:45.640> stick<00:05:46.090> it

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
push it down that way and stick it

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.720 
push it down that way and stick it
otherwise<00:05:47.590> you<00:05:47.800> won't<00:05:47.890> be<00:05:48.010> accounting<00:05:48.580> for

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
otherwise you won't be accounting for

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.100 
otherwise you won't be accounting for
the<00:05:48.820> spine<00:05:49.090> and<00:05:49.270> when<00:05:49.390> you<00:05:49.450> close<00:05:49.720> it<00:05:49.750> it<00:05:49.960> will

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
the spine and when you close it it will

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.650 
the spine and when you close it it will
be<00:05:50.200> too<00:05:50.350> tight<00:05:50.620> so<00:05:52.050> push<00:05:53.050> it<00:05:53.080> in<00:05:53.380> and<00:05:54.450> pop<00:05:55.450> your

be too tight so push it in and pop your

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.130 
be too tight so push it in and pop your
stick<00:05:55.900> yeah

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.360 

same<00:06:00.140> at<00:06:00.290> the<00:06:00.380> top<00:06:00.410> you<00:06:00.800> don't<00:06:00.920> need<00:06:01.130> much<00:06:01.340> to

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
same at the top you don't need much to

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.690 
same at the top you don't need much to
hold<00:06:01.850> it<00:06:02.920> because<00:06:03.920> it's<00:06:04.100> only<00:06:04.190> holding<00:06:04.610> the

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
hold it because it's only holding the

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:10.780 
hold it because it's only holding the
flap<00:06:04.910> in<00:06:05.150> that's<00:06:05.390> all<00:06:08.620> if<00:06:09.620> you<00:06:09.800> want<00:06:09.980> to<00:06:10.190> go

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:10.790 
flap in that's all if you want to go

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.310 
flap in that's all if you want to go
over<00:06:10.940> it<00:06:11.180> with<00:06:11.270> your<00:06:11.420> nail<00:06:11.630> that'll<00:06:12.050> make<00:06:12.200> the

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 
over it with your nail that'll make the

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.200 
over it with your nail that'll make the
tape<00:06:12.500> virtually<00:06:13.160> invisible<00:06:13.400> you<00:06:13.790> won't<00:06:13.970> see

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
tape virtually invisible you won't see

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.590 
tape virtually invisible you won't see
it<00:06:14.390> I<00:06:14.690> suggest<00:06:15.440> leaving<00:06:15.950> the<00:06:16.250> bat<00:06:16.430> loose<00:06:16.910> so

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 
it I suggest leaving the bat loose so

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.060 
it I suggest leaving the bat loose so
that<00:06:17.630> it's<00:06:17.870> still<00:06:18.140> got<00:06:18.350> some<00:06:18.530> room<00:06:18.710> to<00:06:18.950> move

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
that it's still got some room to move

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.720 
that it's still got some room to move
otherwise<00:06:19.520> your<00:06:20.270> your<00:06:21.040> front<00:06:22.040> cover<00:06:22.490> will

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:22.730 
otherwise your your front cover will

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.420 
otherwise your your front cover will
start<00:06:23.030> popping<00:06:23.540> up<00:06:23.870> when<00:06:24.320> you<00:06:24.560> open<00:06:24.800> it

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
start popping up when you open it

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.920 
start popping up when you open it
because<00:06:25.700> it<00:06:25.790> will<00:06:25.880> be<00:06:25.940> too<00:06:25.970> tight<00:06:26.390> and<00:06:26.720> then

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
because it will be too tight and then

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.770 
because it will be too tight and then
too<00:06:27.110> loose<00:06:27.320> and<00:06:27.940> it<00:06:28.940> won't<00:06:29.180> have<00:06:29.390> room<00:06:29.420> for

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
too loose and it won't have room for

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.990 
too loose and it won't have room for
expansion<00:06:30.110> so<00:06:30.680> if<00:06:31.070> you<00:06:31.250> leave<00:06:31.400> the<00:06:31.550> back<00:06:31.700> cover

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
expansion so if you leave the back cover

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.970 
expansion so if you leave the back cover
loose<00:06:32.240> then<00:06:32.630> the<00:06:33.140> the<00:06:33.590> book<00:06:33.770> will

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:33.980 
loose then the the book will

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.310 
loose then the the book will
automatically<00:06:34.730> expand<00:06:35.180> with<00:06:35.450> you<00:06:35.630> and<00:06:36.050> of

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
automatically expand with you and of

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.310 
automatically expand with you and of
course<00:06:36.350> because<00:06:36.800> this<00:06:37.760> paper<00:06:38.000> is<00:06:38.420> only<00:06:38.630> very
