that'll stop the muffler from sliding up
we'll<00:02:08.720> put<00:02:08.750> some<00:02:08.959> silicone<00:02:09.170> in<00:02:09.470> here<00:02:09.679> we'll

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
we'll put some silicone in here we'll

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.580 
we'll put some silicone in here we'll
put<00:02:10.190> this<00:02:10.340> on<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:11.110> then<00:02:12.110> we'll<00:02:12.350> take<00:02:12.440> our

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
muffler put the clamp around it and then

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.900 
muffler put the clamp around it and then
we'll<00:02:18.320> put<00:02:18.530> it<00:02:18.620> up<00:02:18.709> here<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.190> tighten<00:02:19.820> it<00:02:19.880> down

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
that part okay as you see now as we

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.500 
that part okay as you see now as we
explained<00:02:25.489> we<00:02:25.610> got<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:25.910> on<00:02:26.060> we<00:02:26.209> have<00:02:26.360> the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
explained we got that on we have the

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.990 
explained we got that on we have the
sleeve<00:02:27.200> on<00:02:27.350> there<00:02:27.680> we<00:02:28.190> got<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:30.730> RTV<00:02:31.730> in<00:02:31.850> there

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
sleeve on there we got the RTV in there

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.640 
sleeve on there we got the RTV in there
so<00:02:32.239> it's<00:02:32.360> sealed<00:02:32.570> in<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.989> clamp<00:02:33.230> so<00:02:33.410> this<00:02:33.530> is

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
so it's sealed in the clamp so this is

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.259 
so it's sealed in the clamp so this is
nice<00:02:33.799> and<00:02:33.980> secure<00:02:34.340> so<00:02:34.519> the<00:02:34.820> next<00:02:35.000> thing<00:02:35.180> we

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
nice and secure so the next thing we

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.750 
nice and secure so the next thing we
need<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.450> do<00:02:35.570> is<00:02:35.660> grab<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:35.870> heat<00:02:36.080> shield<00:02:36.760> just

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
need to do is grab the heat shield just

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.949 
need to do is grab the heat shield just
two<00:02:37.910> brackets<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:40.280> bar<00:02:40.489> and<00:02:40.519> the

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
two brackets and the bar and the

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.310 
two brackets and the bar and the
necessary<00:02:41.959> bolt<00:02:42.739> so<00:02:43.040> what's<00:02:43.250> gonna<00:02:43.430> happen<00:02:43.519> is

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
necessary bolt so what's gonna happen is

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.840 
necessary bolt so what's gonna happen is
we're<00:02:45.320> gonna<00:02:45.440> take<00:02:45.650> these<00:02:45.799> two<00:02:46.610> pieces

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
we're gonna take these two pieces

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.910 
we're gonna take these two pieces
they're<00:02:47.600> gonna<00:02:47.690> go<00:02:47.870> around<00:02:48.140> on<00:02:48.410> either<00:02:48.620> side

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
they're gonna go around on either side

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.240 
they're gonna go around on either side
like<00:02:49.100> this<00:02:50.590> then<00:02:51.590> we're<00:02:51.680> going<00:02:51.799> to<00:02:51.830> determine

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
like this then we're going to determine

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.380 
like this then we're going to determine
where<00:02:52.370> we<00:02:52.489> want<00:02:52.640> this<00:02:52.820> this<00:02:53.030> is<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.239> help

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
where we want this this is to help

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.780 
where we want this this is to help
support<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:53.900> weight<00:02:54.080> so<00:02:54.769> this<00:02:55.370> is<00:02:55.519> the<00:02:55.580> part

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
support the weight so this is the part

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.460 
support the weight so this is the part
that<00:02:55.970> you're<00:02:56.120> gonna<00:02:56.269> have<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.570> customize<00:02:56.989> for

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
that you're gonna have to customize for

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.930 
that you're gonna have to customize for
your<00:02:57.590> application<00:02:58.160> so<00:02:58.670> we're<00:02:58.790> going<00:02:58.880> to

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
your application so we're going to

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.070 
your application so we're going to
figure<00:02:59.090> out<00:02:59.299> where<00:02:59.450> we<00:02:59.570> want<00:02:59.690> this<00:02:59.840> on<00:02:59.989> the

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
figure out where we want this on the

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.550 
figure out where we want this on the
rack<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:01.459> then<00:03:02.120> we're<00:03:02.269> gonna<00:03:02.440> want<00:03:03.440> we're

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
rack and then we're gonna want we're

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.289 
rack and then we're gonna want we're
gonna<00:03:03.620> cut<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:03.920> off<00:03:04.130> and<00:03:04.700> then<00:03:04.820> it<00:03:04.850> comes<00:03:05.090> with

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
gonna cut it off and then it comes with

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.300 
gonna cut it off and then it comes with
the<00:03:05.739> these<00:03:06.739> pieces

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
the these pieces

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.530 
the these pieces
we'll<00:03:07.580> put<00:03:07.760> it<00:03:07.850> around<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.150> rack<00:03:08.299> and<00:03:08.450> then

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
we'll put it around the rack and then

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.930 
we'll put it around the rack and then
we'll<00:03:08.690> secure<00:03:08.989> it<00:03:09.049> here<00:03:09.320> and<00:03:09.700> then<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.790> heat

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
we'll secure it here and then the heat

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.930 
we'll secure it here and then the heat
shield<00:03:11.209> gets<00:03:12.200> secured<00:03:12.620> through<00:03:12.980> this<00:03:13.700> hole

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
shield gets secured through this hole

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.690 
shield gets secured through this hole
and<00:03:13.970> this<00:03:14.360> hole<00:03:14.420> on<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:14.780> bottom<00:03:15.489> so<00:03:16.489> we'll<00:03:16.580> go

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
and this hole on the bottom so we'll go

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.100 
and this hole on the bottom so we'll go
ahead<00:03:16.850> and<00:03:16.940> do<00:03:17.030> that<00:03:17.060> show<00:03:17.450> you<00:03:17.510> what<00:03:17.900> it<00:03:17.989> looks

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
ahead and do that show you what it looks

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.000 
ahead and do that show you what it looks
like<00:03:18.200> when<00:03:18.350> it's<00:03:18.470> done

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.830 

okay<00:03:21.610> as<00:03:21.700> you<00:03:21.790> can<00:03:21.819> see<00:03:21.940> we've<00:03:22.209> got<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.660> heat

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
okay as you can see we've got the heat

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.839 
okay as you can see we've got the heat
shield<00:03:23.080> now<00:03:23.200> mounted<00:03:23.590> on<00:03:23.680> again<00:03:24.250> it's<00:03:24.520> secured

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
shield now mounted on again it's secured

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.309 
shield now mounted on again it's secured
around<00:03:25.150> here<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.599> through<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:25.870> bottom<00:03:26.200> and

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
around here and through the bottom and

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.440 
around here and through the bottom and
then<00:03:26.709> we<00:03:26.800> had<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:26.980> cut<00:03:27.160> this<00:03:27.310> bracket<00:03:27.790> off<00:03:27.910> it

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
then we had to cut this bracket off it

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.630 
then we had to cut this bracket off it
cut<00:03:28.690> off<00:03:28.810> about<00:03:29.050> two<00:03:29.319> inches<00:03:29.560> or<00:03:29.709> so<00:03:29.860> depending

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
cut off about two inches or so depending

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.979 
cut off about two inches or so depending
on<00:03:30.700> where<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.180> want<00:03:31.330> it<00:03:31.390> to<00:03:31.480> be<00:03:31.599> on<00:03:31.690> your<00:03:31.720> rack

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
on where you want it to be on your rack

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.960
