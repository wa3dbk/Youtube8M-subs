this<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.510> pine<00:00:27.810> pitch<00:00:28.080> glue<00:00:28.470> we<00:00:29.279> showed<00:00:29.580> how<00:00:29.730> to

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
this is pine pitch glue we showed how to

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.830 
this is pine pitch glue we showed how to
make<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.359> an<00:00:30.449> earlier<00:00:30.630> video<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:32.660> it<00:00:33.660> has<00:00:33.809> a

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
make it in an earlier video and it has a

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.260 
make it in an earlier video and it has a
lot<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.410> uses<00:00:34.620> it's<00:00:35.010> usually<00:00:35.160> used<00:00:35.550> just<00:00:36.120> to

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
lot of uses it's usually used just to

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.920 
lot of uses it's usually used just to
affixed<00:00:36.719> arrowheads<00:00:37.290> or<00:00:37.680> spear<00:00:38.160> heads<00:00:38.930> but

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
affixed arrowheads or spear heads but

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.840 
affixed arrowheads or spear heads but
there's<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:40.950> many<00:00:41.040> things<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:41.700> do

there's so many things that you can do
with<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.290> would<00:00:43.890> like<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.100> reinvent

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
with it and so I would like to reinvent

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.840 
with it and so I would like to reinvent
it<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.420> speak<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.960> show<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.680> how<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.610> use

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
it so to speak and show you how to use

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.880 
it so to speak and show you how to use
it<00:00:48.059> how<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.360> warm<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.780> up<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.079> some<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
it how to warm it up and some of the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
it how to warm it up and some of the
things<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.340> do<00:00:50.460> with<00:00:50.610> it

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
things you can do with it

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.819 
things you can do with it
well<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.329> warm<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.780> up<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.170> use<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:52.649> gonna

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
well we warm this up for use it's gonna

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.840 
well we warm this up for use it's gonna
become<00:00:53.129> very<00:00:53.160> malleable<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:55.610> that's<00:00:56.610> where

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
become very malleable and that's where

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.760 
become very malleable and that's where
we<00:00:57.030> can<00:00:57.210> sort<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.570> take<00:00:58.140> back<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.590> word

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
we can sort of take back the word

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.979 
we can sort of take back the word
plastic<00:00:59.510> today<00:01:00.510> plastic<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.859> know<00:01:02.010> is

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
plastic today plastic you know is

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.370 
plastic today plastic you know is
synonymous<00:01:03.989> with<00:01:04.379> cheap<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.540> delicate<00:01:06.540> but

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
synonymous with cheap and delicate but

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.820 
synonymous with cheap and delicate but
an<00:01:07.770> earlier<00:01:08.250> meaning<00:01:09.020> refers<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.170> something

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
an earlier meaning refers to something

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.750 
an earlier meaning refers to something
that<00:01:10.939> can<00:01:11.939> be<00:01:12.119> molded<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:13.490> that's<00:01:14.490> what<00:01:14.640> this

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
that can be molded and that's what this

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.429 
that can be molded and that's what this
is<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.150> can<00:01:15.240> be<00:01:15.330> molded<00:01:15.540> into<00:01:15.840> all<00:01:16.020> sorts<00:01:16.380> of

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
is it can be molded into all sorts of

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.640 
is it can be molded into all sorts of
nice<00:01:16.619> shapes<00:01:17.330> so<00:01:18.330> first<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.810> all<00:01:18.960> we<00:01:19.290> have<00:01:19.439> to

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
nice shapes so first of all we have to

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.870 
nice shapes so first of all we have to
warm<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.070> up<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:22.159> there's<00:01:23.159> basically<00:01:23.549> three

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
warm it up and there's basically three

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.109 
warm it up and there's basically three
ways<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:25.080> usually<00:01:25.409> do<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:26.850> first

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
ways that I usually do that the first

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.170 
ways that I usually do that the first
and<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:28.229> won't<00:01:28.380> work<00:01:28.439> today<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:29.130> if<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.939> have<00:01:30.150> a

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
and it won't work today is if you have a

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.440 
and it won't work today is if you have a
really<00:01:30.750> hot<00:01:30.930> day<00:01:31.880> ninety<00:01:32.880> Fahrenheit<00:01:33.420> or

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
really hot day ninety Fahrenheit or

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.609 
really hot day ninety Fahrenheit or
above<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:35.000> direct<00:01:36.000> sunlight<00:01:36.290> because<00:01:37.290> it's

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
above and direct sunlight because it's

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.340 
above and direct sunlight because it's
black<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.850> gonna<00:01:38.970> warm<00:01:39.390> up<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.110> set

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
black this is gonna warm up if you set

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.550 
black this is gonna warm up if you set
it<00:01:40.380> out<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.220> become<00:01:41.490> malleable<00:01:42.380> just<00:01:43.380> by

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
it out and become malleable just by

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.770 
it out and become malleable just by
letting<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.100> sit<00:01:44.250> out<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.610> Sun<00:01:44.820> for<00:01:44.850> 15-20

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
letting it sit out in the Sun for 15-20

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.929 
letting it sit out in the Sun for 15-20
minutes<00:01:46.049> right<00:01:46.860> now<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:48.950> rock<00:01:49.950> hard<00:01:49.979> it's

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
minutes right now it's rock hard it's

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.399 
minutes right now it's rock hard it's
probably<00:01:51.630> about<00:01:51.840> 75<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.590> cloudy<00:01:53.280> today<00:01:54.409> up

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
probably about 75 and cloudy today up

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.630 
probably about 75 and cloudy today up
another<00:01:55.680> way<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.880> heat<00:01:57.060> up<00:01:57.090> your<00:01:57.979> glue<00:01:58.979> for<00:01:59.430> use

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
another way to heat up your glue for use

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.709 
another way to heat up your glue for use
that's<00:02:00.299> just<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.570> set<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.780> next<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.439> fire

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.349 

don't<00:02:05.590> want<00:02:05.740> it<00:02:05.799> so<00:02:05.979> close<00:02:06.670> that<00:02:06.700> it's<00:02:07.149> going

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:07.359 
don't want it so close that it's going

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:12.240 
don't want it so close that it's going
to<00:02:07.479> melt<00:02:07.810> it<00:02:09.060> but<00:02:10.739> just<00:02:11.739> close<00:02:11.950> enough<00:02:11.980> that

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
to melt it but just close enough that

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.070 
to melt it but just close enough that
it's<00:02:12.550> going<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.700> warm<00:02:13.000> it<00:02:13.090> up<00:02:13.209> until<00:02:13.900> it's

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
it's going to warm it up until it's

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:23.000 
it's going to warm it up until it's
malleable

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.990 

or<00:02:23.489> remember<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.239> it's<00:02:24.360> waterproof<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:25.170> you

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
or remember that it's waterproof and you

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.570 
or remember that it's waterproof and you
can<00:02:27.000> put<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.390> into<00:02:28.069> boiling<00:02:29.069> or<00:02:29.190> very<00:02:29.370> hot

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
can put it into boiling or very hot

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.339 
can put it into boiling or very hot
water<00:02:30.290> another<00:02:31.290> great<00:02:31.590> way<00:02:31.769> to<00:02:31.799> soften<00:02:32.159> it<00:02:32.400> up

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
water another great way to soften it up

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.289 
water another great way to soften it up
and<00:02:34.349> alternately<00:02:35.159> you<00:02:35.400> can<00:02:35.549> just<00:02:35.730> rotisserie

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
and alternately you can just rotisserie

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:42.080 
and alternately you can just rotisserie
it<00:02:37.430> over<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.549> hot<00:02:38.730> flames<00:02:40.580> again<00:02:41.580> making<00:02:41.970> sure

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
it over the hot flames again making sure

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.619 
it over the hot flames again making sure
it<00:02:42.209> doesn't<00:02:42.480> melt<00:02:44.120> but<00:02:45.120> letting<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.510> get

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
it doesn't melt but letting it get

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:54.950 
it doesn't melt but letting it get
malleable

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.290 

you<00:02:55.530> can<00:02:55.680> also<00:02:55.860> warm<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.460> up<00:02:56.520> in<00:02:56.670> your<00:02:56.820> mouth<00:02:56.970> if

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
you can also warm it up in your mouth if

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.470 
you can also warm it up in your mouth if
you<00:02:57.360> don't<00:02:57.420> mind<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.840> taste<00:02:59.120> let's<00:03:00.120> talk<00:03:00.360> it

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
you don't mind the taste let's talk it

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.290 
you don't mind the taste let's talk it
between<00:03:00.750> your<00:03:00.870> cheek<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.170> your<00:03:01.290> government

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
between your cheek and your government

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.250 
between your cheek and your government
eventually<00:03:03.300> it'll<00:03:03.690> be<00:03:03.840> ready

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260

of course the normal way to use this is
to<00:03:07.800> actually<00:03:07.980> heat<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.460> up<00:03:08.550> over<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.090> flame

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
to actually heat it up over the flame

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.490 
to actually heat it up over the flame

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:31.860 
conditions
so<00:05:30.490> there<00:05:30.669> you<00:05:30.819> have<00:05:30.849> it<00:05:31.060> the<00:05:31.389> stuff<00:05:31.629> can<00:05:31.810> be

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
so there you have it the stuff can be

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.489 
so there you have it the stuff can be
formed<00:05:32.289> in<00:05:32.409> any<00:05:32.590> shape<00:05:32.919> that<00:05:32.949> you<00:05:33.159> want<00:05:34.499> as

00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:35.499 
formed in any shape that you want as

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:37.140 
formed in any shape that you want as
long<00:05:35.740> as<00:05:35.919> the<00:05:36.039> temperature<00:05:36.219> is<00:05:36.610> cool<00:05:36.849> enough

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
long as the temperature is cool enough

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.129 
long as the temperature is cool enough
it'll<00:05:38.080> be<00:05:38.169> nice<00:05:38.349> and<00:05:38.590> hard<00:05:38.800> and<00:05:40.139> it's

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
it'll be nice and hard and it's

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:46.649 
it'll be nice and hard and it's
waterproof<00:05:41.710> and<00:05:43.469> extremely<00:05:44.469> flammable<00:05:45.659> so

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:46.659 
waterproof and extremely flammable so

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:51.089 
waterproof and extremely flammable so
from<00:05:46.990> there<00:05:48.449> use<00:05:49.449> your<00:05:49.479> creativity<00:05:50.169> really

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099 
from there use your creativity really

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:54.119 
from there use your creativity really
your<00:05:51.310> imagination<00:05:52.029> is<00:05:52.210> the<00:05:52.240> only<00:05:52.979> thing<00:05:53.979> that

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:54.129 
your imagination is the only thing that

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:57.899 
your imagination is the only thing that
will<00:05:54.249> limit<00:05:54.430> the<00:05:54.669> use<00:05:54.789> of<00:05:54.819> this<00:05:56.129> all<00:05:57.129> kinds<00:05:57.819> of

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:57.909 
will limit the use of this all kinds of

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:02.610 
will limit the use of this all kinds of
fun<00:05:58.180> bushcraft<00:05:58.749> and<00:05:59.139> survival<00:06:00.930> uses<00:06:01.930> now<00:06:02.439> this

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
fun bushcraft and survival uses now this

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.540 
fun bushcraft and survival uses now this
is<00:06:02.800> not<00:06:03.039> the<00:06:03.639> perfect<00:06:03.939> substance<00:06:04.629> of<00:06:05.020> course

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
is not the perfect substance of course

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.550 
is not the perfect substance of course
it<00:06:06.550> is<00:06:06.849> really<00:06:07.360> useful<00:06:07.509> for<00:06:07.900> a<00:06:07.960> lot<00:06:08.020> of<00:06:08.289> things

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
it is really useful for a lot of things

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.249 
it is really useful for a lot of things
and<00:06:08.860> probably<00:06:09.490> its<00:06:09.909> biggest<00:06:10.270> liability<00:06:10.659> is

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:11.259 
and probably its biggest liability is

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:16.350 
and probably its biggest liability is
that<00:06:12.099> as<00:06:13.000> it<00:06:13.240> gets<00:06:13.419> colder<00:06:14.069> it<00:06:15.270> tends<00:06:16.270> to

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
that as it gets colder it tends to

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.390 
that as it gets colder it tends to
fracture<00:06:16.900> along<00:06:17.020> these<00:06:17.770> little<00:06:17.979> planes<00:06:18.219> of

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
fracture along these little planes of

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.110 
fracture along these little planes of
fracture<00:06:18.789> and<00:06:19.479> so<00:06:20.699> if<00:06:21.699> you're<00:06:21.819> gonna<00:06:21.909> make

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
fracture and so if you're gonna make

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.429 
fracture and so if you're gonna make
something<00:06:22.449> like<00:06:23.229> a<00:06:24.120> snare<00:06:25.120> trigger<00:06:25.479> make<00:06:26.259> sure

00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:26.439 
something like a snare trigger make sure

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:29.399 
something like a snare trigger make sure
that<00:06:26.589> it's<00:06:26.770> using<00:06:27.129> thick<00:06:27.909> enough<00:06:28.180> and<00:06:28.409> high

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:29.409 
that it's using thick enough and high

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:32.489 
that it's using thick enough and high
quality<00:06:29.469> enough<00:06:30.370> glue<00:06:30.749> that<00:06:31.749> it's<00:06:32.139> not<00:06:32.349> gonna

00:06:32.489 --> 00:06:32.499 
quality enough glue that it's not gonna

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:34.379 
quality enough glue that it's not gonna
break<00:06:32.830> when<00:06:33.099> it's<00:06:33.279> really<00:06:33.490> cold<00:06:33.639> it's

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:34.389 
break when it's really cold it's

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:35.730 
break when it's really cold it's
obviously<00:06:34.719> a<00:06:34.779> snare<00:06:35.020> is<00:06:35.169> gonna<00:06:35.319> have<00:06:35.500> to<00:06:35.620> have

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
obviously a snare is gonna have to have

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.219 
obviously a snare is gonna have to have
some<00:06:35.979> tension<00:06:36.279> involved<00:06:36.969> otherwise<00:06:37.779> this<00:06:38.080> is

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:38.229 
some tension involved otherwise this is

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:40.439 
some tension involved otherwise this is
great<00:06:38.500> stuff<00:06:38.860> I'd<00:06:39.339> love<00:06:39.669> to<00:06:39.819> hear<00:06:39.969> what<00:06:40.180> you<00:06:40.300> do

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:40.449 
great stuff I'd love to hear what you do

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:45.959 
great stuff I'd love to hear what you do
with<00:06:40.599> it<00:06:40.919> it's<00:06:43.050> fun<00:06:44.050> it's<00:06:44.889> useful<00:06:45.279> has<00:06:45.639> a<00:06:45.669> lot

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:45.969 
with it it's fun it's useful has a lot

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:50.700 
with it it's fun it's useful has a lot
of<00:06:46.000> cool<00:06:46.210> properties<00:06:47.399> so<00:06:48.689> make<00:06:49.689> some<00:06:49.960> play

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:50.710 
of cool properties so make some play

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.100 
of cool properties so make some play
around<00:06:50.919> with<00:06:51.129> it<00:06:51.339> and<00:06:51.629> let<00:06:52.629> me<00:06:52.659> know<00:06:52.870> what<00:06:53.020> you

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.110 
around with it and let me know what you

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.439 
around with it and let me know what you
