thing is the mixing and when we're using

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.820 
thing is the mixing and when we're using

very upright or a glossy leafed plant

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.860 
very upright or a glossy leafed plant
sometimes<00:01:12.140> what<00:01:12.500> happens<00:01:12.800> is<00:01:12.980> that<00:01:13.100> round

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
sometimes what happens is that round

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.540
