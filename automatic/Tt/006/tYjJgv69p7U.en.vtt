00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
master's in 2007 a little while back now

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.220 
master's in 2007 a little while back now
and<00:00:21.430> was<00:00:22.180> a<00:00:22.210> Fulbright<00:00:22.540> Scholar

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.529 

I<00:00:27.320> got<00:00:27.830> into<00:00:28.070> four<00:00:28.820> or<00:00:28.850> five<00:00:28.970> different<00:00:29.119> law

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
I got into four or five different law

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.229 
I got into four or five different law
schools<00:00:30.130> and<00:00:31.130> then<00:00:31.369> I<00:00:31.400> think<00:00:31.730> it<00:00:31.880> was<00:00:32.000> just<00:00:32.180> a

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
schools and then I think it was just a

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.390 
schools and then I think it was just a
matter<00:00:32.390> of<00:00:32.509> you<00:00:33.230> know<00:00:33.350> where<00:00:33.650> I<00:00:34.010> would<00:00:34.250> have

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
matter of you know where I would have

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.140 
matter of you know where I would have
the<00:00:34.670> best<00:00:34.850> faculty<00:00:35.329> to<00:00:35.840> student<00:00:36.170> ratio<00:00:36.200> and

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
the best faculty to student ratio and

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.490 
the best faculty to student ratio and
what<00:00:38.150> campus<00:00:38.600> would<00:00:38.750> be<00:00:38.809> you<00:00:39.199> know<00:00:39.290> most

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
what campus would be you know most

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.049 
what campus would be you know most
welcoming<00:00:39.949> and<00:00:40.250> still<00:00:40.610> close<00:00:40.820> to<00:00:40.940> New<00:00:41.030> York

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
welcoming and still close to New York

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.390 
welcoming and still close to New York
City<00:00:41.180> I<00:00:41.510> guess<00:00:42.290> the<00:00:42.379> factor<00:00:42.739> made<00:00:42.980> me<00:00:43.070> decide

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
City I guess the factor made me decide

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.270 
City I guess the factor made me decide
for<00:00:43.730> Cornell<00:00:44.269> is<00:00:44.720> a<00:00:44.780> mix<00:00:45.110> between<00:00:45.170> so<00:00:45.890> is<00:00:46.040> a<00:00:46.070> mix

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
for Cornell is a mix between so is a mix

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.860 
for Cornell is a mix between so is a mix
I<00:00:46.370> think<00:00:46.400> between<00:00:46.670> faculty<00:00:47.500> financial<00:00:48.500> and

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
I think between faculty financial and

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.990 
I think between faculty financial and
campus<00:00:50.870> I<00:00:51.110> wants<00:00:51.620> to<00:00:51.710> be<00:00:51.830> on<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:52.400> real<00:00:52.519> campus

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
campus I wants to be on the real campus

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.910 
campus I wants to be on the real campus
because<00:00:53.329> I'd<00:00:53.480> lived<00:00:53.720> in<00:00:54.019> a<00:00:54.079> city<00:00:54.320> for<00:00:54.530> four

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
because I'd lived in a city for four

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.850 
because I'd lived in a city for four

five or six years and Cornell has a

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.390 

not<00:01:12.690> really<00:01:12.900> because<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.320> mean<00:01:13.740> as<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> Fulbright

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
Fulbright Scholar that's kind of

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.780 
Fulbright Scholar that's kind of
difficult<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.159> they<00:01:29.340> kind<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.550> had<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
difficult and they kind of had the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.280 
difficult and they kind of had the
question<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> next<00:01:30.750> two<00:01:30.840> years<00:01:31.050> you<00:01:31.110> have

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
question for the next two years you have

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.710 
question for the next two years you have
to<00:01:31.409> go<00:01:31.530> back<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.770> your<00:01:31.860> home<00:01:32.040> country<00:01:32.149> so<00:01:33.149> I

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
to go back to your home country so I

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.930 
to go back to your home country so I
mean<00:01:34.140> my<00:01:34.259> goal<00:01:34.409> was<00:01:34.590> always<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.920> go<00:01:35.399> there<00:01:35.640> and

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
mean my goal was always to go there and

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.910 
mean my goal was always to go there and
really<00:01:36.780> learn<00:01:36.990> about<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.350> American<00:01:37.530> legal

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
really learn about the American legal

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.460 
really learn about the American legal
system<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.340> then<00:01:38.460> come<00:01:38.670> back<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.170> maybe<00:01:40.170> go

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
system and then come back and maybe go

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.050 
system and then come back and maybe go
back<00:01:40.649> there<00:01:40.950> after<00:01:41.280> two<00:01:41.310> or<00:01:41.549> three<00:01:41.610> years

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.880 

probably<00:01:46.689> the<00:01:46.780> hardest<00:01:47.079> part<00:01:47.110> of<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.799> whole

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
probably the hardest part of the whole

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.859 
probably the hardest part of the whole
process<00:01:48.159> is<00:01:48.399> to<00:01:48.520> finance<00:01:48.880> him<00:01:49.060> because<00:01:49.360> you

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
process is to finance him because you

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:50.880 
process is to finance him because you
know<00:01:49.990> studying<00:01:50.320> in<00:01:50.439> America<00:01:50.530> is<00:01:50.829> very

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
know studying in America is very

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.499 
know studying in America is very
expensive<00:01:51.460> especially<00:01:51.670> when<00:01:52.060> your<00:01:52.329> your

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
expensive especially when your your

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.469 
expensive especially when your your
opinion<00:01:52.869> you<00:01:52.960> don't<00:01:53.020> really<00:01:53.350> get<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:54.220> whole

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
opinion you don't really get the whole

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.149 
opinion you don't really get the whole
picture<00:01:55.479> until<00:01:56.229> you<00:01:56.320> get<00:01:56.500> there

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
picture until you get there

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.639 
picture until you get there
you<00:01:57.399> know<00:01:57.490> whether<00:01:57.700> fees<00:01:58.119> or<00:01:58.420> living<00:01:59.229> costs

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
you know whether fees or living costs

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.950 
you know whether fees or living costs
are<00:01:59.740> very<00:02:00.130> high<00:02:00.299> maybe<00:02:01.299> a<00:02:01.390> little<00:02:01.509> less<00:02:01.659> so<00:02:01.869> if

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
are very high maybe a little less so if

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.359 
are very high maybe a little less so if
you<00:02:02.049> live<00:02:02.200> outside<00:02:02.409> of<00:02:02.710> big<00:02:02.830> city<00:02:03.009> but<00:02:03.340> it's

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
you live outside of big city but it's

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.060 
you live outside of big city but it's
still<00:02:03.670> very<00:02:03.729> expensive<00:02:04.439> coming<00:02:05.439> from<00:02:05.590> Belgium

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
still very expensive coming from Belgium

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.830 
still very expensive coming from Belgium
who<00:02:06.939> say<00:02:07.149> it's<00:02:07.270> probably<00:02:07.600> even<00:02:07.659> more

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
who say it's probably even more

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.690 
who say it's probably even more
difficult<00:02:08.259> because<00:02:08.349> scholarships<00:02:08.679> are<00:02:09.250> very

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
difficult because scholarships are very

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.380 
difficult because scholarships are very
scarce<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.560> outside<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:12.730> know<00:02:12.819> Fulbright

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
scarce and outside you know Fulbright

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.150 
scarce and outside you know Fulbright
and<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:15.010> budgin<00:02:16.110> basf<00:02:17.110> things<00:02:17.470> cold<00:02:17.769> it's

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
and the budgin basf things cold it's

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.650 
and the budgin basf things cold it's
very<00:02:18.370> hard<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.790> get<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.120> scholarship<00:02:19.330> very

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
very hard to get a scholarship very

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.539 
very hard to get a scholarship very
limited<00:02:19.989> opportunities<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:20.950> really<00:02:21.280> need<00:02:21.430> to

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
limited opportunities so really need to

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.690 
limited opportunities so really need to
work<00:02:21.760> for<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.030> I<00:02:23.190> think<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.220> got<00:02:24.250> really<00:02:24.459> lucky

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
work for it I think I got really lucky

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.280 
work for it I think I got really lucky

a small you know funding from my school

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.080 
a small you know funding from my school

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.850 
scholarship the big chunk of my of my
financing<00:02:36.549> but<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.090> would<00:02:37.269> say<00:02:37.680> start<00:02:38.680> very

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
financing but I would say start very

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.300 
financing but I would say start very
early<00:02:39.040> I<00:02:39.580> think<00:02:39.849> is<00:02:40.030> very<00:02:40.209> important<00:02:40.690> I<00:02:40.840> mean

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
early I think is very important I mean

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.470 
early I think is very important I mean
when<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.430> start<00:02:42.640> looking<00:02:42.760> for<00:02:43.060> schools<00:02:43.239> you
