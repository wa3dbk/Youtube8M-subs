00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580 
foot foot number 10 for the Bernina is a

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.940 
foot foot number 10 for the Bernina is a
foot<00:01:01.880> I<00:01:02.030> use<00:01:02.210> all<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:02.540> time<00:01:02.809> but<00:01:03.290> in<00:01:03.710> a<00:01:03.739> pinch

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
foot I use all the time but in a pinch

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.650 
foot I use all the time but in a pinch
if<00:01:04.160> I<00:01:04.250> don't<00:01:04.460> have<00:01:04.640> that<00:01:04.790> foot<00:01:05.059> and<00:01:05.300> I'm<00:01:05.390> not

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
if I don't have that foot and I'm not

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.600 
if I don't have that foot and I'm not
doing<00:01:06.350> Center<00:01:06.740> needle<00:01:06.920> position<00:01:07.100> because

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
doing Center needle position because

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.100 
doing Center needle position because
that<00:01:07.640> blade<00:01:08.060> goes<00:01:08.300> all<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:08.510> way<00:01:08.720> down<00:01:08.870> through

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
that blade goes all the way down through

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.690 
that blade goes all the way down through
the<00:01:09.229> foot<00:01:09.470> so<00:01:09.979> it's<00:01:10.100> not<00:01:10.190> ideal<00:01:10.369> for

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
the foot so it's not ideal for

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.030 
the foot so it's not ideal for
everything<00:01:11.180> but<00:01:11.450> I<00:01:11.540> can<00:01:11.720> cheat<00:01:11.990> just<00:01:12.470> a<00:01:12.740> little

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
everything but I can cheat just a little

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.380 
everything but I can cheat just a little
bit<00:01:13.220> what<00:01:13.580> I'm<00:01:13.700> going<00:01:13.850> to<00:01:13.880> do<00:01:13.970> is<00:01:14.090> put<00:01:14.270> the

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
bit what I'm going to do is put the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.150 
bit what I'm going to do is put the
blade<00:01:14.690> so<00:01:14.990> it's<00:01:15.110> sitting<00:01:15.410> right<00:01:15.619> in<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:15.860> seam

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
blade so it's sitting right in the seam

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.530 
blade so it's sitting right in the seam
that<00:01:16.190> I<00:01:16.400> just<00:01:16.610> did<00:01:16.850> I'm<00:01:17.150> gonna<00:01:17.300> take<00:01:17.509> a

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
that I just did I'm gonna take a

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.090 
that I just did I'm gonna take a
straight<00:01:17.960> stitch<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:18.530> move<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.070> needle

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
straight stitch and move the needle

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.600 
straight stitch and move the needle
position<00:01:19.369> to<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.330> far<00:01:20.979> left<00:01:21.979> so<00:01:22.280> that<00:01:22.430> little

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
position to the far left so that little

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.700 
position to the far left so that little
dot<00:01:22.880> is<00:01:23.030> hanging<00:01:23.330> underneath<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.990> zero<00:01:24.320> for

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
dot is hanging underneath the zero for

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.740 
dot is hanging underneath the zero for
the<00:01:24.770> stitch<00:01:25.009> width<00:01:25.310> do<00:01:25.910> some<00:01:26.119> top<00:01:26.300> stitching

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
the stitch width do some top stitching

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.170 
the stitch width do some top stitching
I'm<00:01:27.320> going<00:01:27.470> to<00:01:27.530> go<00:01:27.619> ahead<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:28.340> lengthen<00:01:28.850> out

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
I'm going to go ahead and lengthen out

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.370 
I'm going to go ahead and lengthen out
the<00:01:29.360> stitch<00:01:29.570> length<00:01:29.720> if<00:01:29.930> you<00:01:29.960> don't<00:01:30.229> those

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
the stitch length if you don't those

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.840 
the stitch length if you don't those
stitches<00:01:30.560> start<00:01:30.860> to<00:01:31.009> look<00:01:31.160> a<00:01:31.250> little<00:01:31.369> small

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
stitches start to look a little small

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.340 
stitches start to look a little small
and<00:01:32.240> all<00:01:32.540> I'm<00:01:32.690> doing<00:01:32.899> is<00:01:32.990> just<00:01:33.140> kind<00:01:33.259> of

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
and all I'm doing is just kind of
