00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.200
 are here in the stairwell in the berliner 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.400
 Street 15 and I go through it now 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.250
 the flat just to see what 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.070
 How it looks like here 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:23.340
 are and should be made as 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:25.619
 So lets the entrance door and then 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.160
 Let's get in here on the left 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.160
 a room 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.160
 here the wallpapers are torn off 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.360
 that does not have to be the walls in the first place 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.480
 and just need to cover everything 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.790
 Please bring new windows 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.690
 we will come too 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.770
 and here you could for example now 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:55.260
 also red reinstellen the depletion to 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:56.699
 Notice my table is here now 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.890
 go right to the other side 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.170
 Goal be weird but hit where we are 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.670
 easy peter kratz and 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.670
 nature was wallpapered 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:18.240
 Here is the first bathroom the shower so 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.960
 Here we have considered, I know 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.600
 Everything out here on objects and deserves 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.130
 Remove floor tiles 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.450
 but the others are flowing as legally 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.950
 stable and for the sake of simplicity that 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.350
 we proved here with white 30-60 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:41.580
 Decide and the room is not big 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.770
 enough that only want to have a shower 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.650
 without any shower tray so that 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.650
 conclusion here simply in the ground is that 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.619
 It was really that must tackle because 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.940
 In the ground, a drain will be made 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.210
 is probably quite simple here 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.650
 but here and we have strange paragraph 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.880
 here already something in the ground tricked 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.860
 is now probably one 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.380
 estrich are good 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.140
 we then have this black fine stone 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.690
 tiles come on arch I know 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.010
 but sixties and one always turn 30 times 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.650
 60 30 flying gloss 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.180
 Well then let's go today 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.410
 through the hallway 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.049
 Here we see it here 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.970
 Living room and from this hallway to have 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.160
 special wooden ceiling seems relative 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.260
 to be massive boards here because of the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.940
 Brightness is here in any case 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.060
 fill in to make it and 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.870
 wallpaper white with raufaser 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:47.930
 that we all leave his job 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:50.070
 We first as an advocate is the hiking 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.769
 we want to do the same thing me 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:57.330
 remove the floor tiles objects everything 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.680
 get out the table on the tiles are 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.209
 also really stable 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.810
 and for the sake of simplicity, that's exactly me 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.110
 that simple people play overflowing with 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.170
 3 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.480
 about 60 proven and here in the sun 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.870
 we have already ordered just gets 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.850
 a new walk will be so acrylic if 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.400
 Including solid thing that one here 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.670
 just adjusted relatively easily 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.890
 can build and what to do in general 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.140
 So there are the fittings 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.460
 So everything builds objects completely 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.890
 principle as well as the radiators all 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.170
 radiator in seven pieces in total of 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.870
 buderus appoints the loss also had 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.490
 be replaced in size so 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.440
 pretty much all identical offenders put 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:47.550
 these boats are household body 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:51.239
 with a smooth surface the parquet 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.310
 Head of remains should relative state 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:57.300
 merger agreed and maybe again 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.190
 to be resealed or overtaken like 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.930
 always another time 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.160
 room 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.860
 There is a new radiator 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.590
 exchange 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.250
 the whole thing had been missed 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.250
 just everything in white 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.049
 then it's here that you 're the choirist 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.049
 room that the living room 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:31.940
 there is an interesting paragraph 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.650
 and everything stays there are weird 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.630
 Beschalung we wondered that 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.350
 but it looks like this 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.480
 heating pipes because he is on plaster and 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.470
 To hide this one has this 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.380
 holzinger built 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.760
 but since the parquet not special 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.440
 we need to continue the things 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.860
 also let and yes there but really 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.510
 because he can actually shut up too 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:58.120
 So, in four weeks, you'll earn all 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.120
 completely replaced new windows 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:09.379
 Now we come here for passage 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:13.090
 that is , so to speak, but his 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:16.009
 open kitchen which is quite large 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.439
 and there we thought but 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:20.509
 actually moved here in the wall 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:23.870
 So it's supposed to be built only 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:28.969
 a little bit a bigger part 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:30.860
 which for its double becomes that 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:33.159
 then virtually the wall raves that one there 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.210
 no longer sees this bar above 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:39.529
 just as we have here at some point a 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:41.240
 Door over papered must also raus 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:43.490
 The whole thing has to be smoothed out 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.229
 then we will go to the others 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.090
 side that sees the old order 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:49.009
 then catastrophically out of the wall would have to 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.469
 so to speak, that one will continue 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.919
 only smooth wall with its passage 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:57.460
 So it's different here too 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:06:01.099
 appears and becomes smooth with rain 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.089
 we have his socket of the 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:05.870
 ever understood the tiles 

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:07.719
 knocked off the floor is so linoleum 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.979
 or below are on tiles 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:11.389
 Since we have now discovered here there 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:13.400
 It also weird develop this leave 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:15.259
 on-wall pipe that's pretty 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.139
 grisly part of what somehow here 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:20.659
 they had to come up with something 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:21.710
 Let's do that best on the ground 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:23.990
 we thought in any case 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:28.060
 the 30 times 60 he glossed in 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:34.610
 black and just flow on it 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:37.729
 july get away just do it let 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:40.419
 the wooden strips wants to do away with that 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:40.419
 will be black too 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:46.639
 the whole why will be on this anyway 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.729
 it is the catastrophes that have to hear 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:52.099
 For example, this is her high simplest 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:53.870
 of course look very much 

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:55.729
 interesting from here we come with it 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:59.330
 the tile second cm what 's up 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:07:01.160
 nix it only needs to be plastered and 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:06.020
 we know we will not be tiling 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.440
 thus making the wars in principle agree so 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.490
 far 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:15.889
 There is one last thing 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:18.289
 task the terrace not straight sven 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:20.870
 but the demand must be in principle 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:23.150
 to be rehabilitated on the sides break there 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.949
 already the or is already pretty 

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.889
 lazy me that is actually all 

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:30.199
 tile down then probably one 

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:33.110
 new and even the gutters 

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:39.610
 why must be made so too 

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:39.610
 renovate friezes he knows his new roof
