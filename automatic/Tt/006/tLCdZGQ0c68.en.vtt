00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.679 
another two months of practicing at home
I<00:01:20.400> still<00:01:20.790> wouldn't<00:01:21.030> feel<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.540> was

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
prepared because i haven't raced so I

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.980 
prepared because i haven't raced so I
don't<00:01:23.549> know<00:01:23.700> what<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.880> expect<00:01:24.000> Ivan<00:01:24.509> racing<00:01:24.810> so

was the best thing for me and you know
ultimately<00:02:21.910> i<00:02:22.330> think<00:02:23.070> you<00:02:24.070> know<00:02:24.100> i<00:02:24.220> made<00:02:24.490> a

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
ultimately i think you know i made a

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.160 
ultimately i think you know i made a
decision<00:02:24.760> i<00:02:25.000> wanted<00:02:25.270> a<00:02:25.330> race<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.810> i<00:02:25.930> was<00:02:26.050> going

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
decision i wanted a race and i was going

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.590 
decision i wanted a race and i was going

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
to go racing one way or another and I

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.210 
to go racing one way or another and I
think<00:02:29.020> that<00:02:29.320> was<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.470> best<00:02:29.710> fit<00:02:29.890> for<00:02:29.950> me<00:02:30.160> at

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
think that was the best fit for me at

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.580 
think that was the best fit for me at
the<00:02:30.310> time<00:02:30.490> and<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:31.780> know<00:02:32.320> a<00:02:32.380> little<00:02:32.500> bit

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
things like that so it is a little bit

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.960

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
different being on an independent team

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.630 
different being on an independent team
at<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.210> same<00:02:52.420> time<00:02:52.920> you<00:02:53.920> know<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.130> just<00:02:54.430> learn

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
at the same time you know you just learn

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.370 
at the same time you know you just learn
to<00:02:54.670> adjust<00:02:54.850> I<00:02:55.240> mean<00:02:55.360> it's<00:02:55.480> not<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.660> sort<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.230> big

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
to adjust I mean it's not a sort of big

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.740 
to adjust I mean it's not a sort of big
deal<00:02:56.560> it's<00:02:56.680> just<00:02:56.710> different<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.600> but<00:02:58.600> you

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
deal it's just different and but you
