00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
and I know I said I wasn't going to make

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.970 
and I know I said I wasn't going to make
another<00:00:06.029> cheese<00:00:06.750> kind<00:00:07.109> of<00:00:07.230> help<00:00:07.470> guide<00:00:07.710> for

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
another cheese kind of help guide for

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.440 
another cheese kind of help guide for
these<00:00:08.099> because<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.700> hard<00:00:08.910> mode<00:00:09.090> read<00:00:09.269> was

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
these because the hard mode read was

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.759 
these because the hard mode read was
going<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.630> be<00:00:09.690> coming<00:00:09.870> out<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.290> they<00:00:10.559> probably

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
going to be coming out and they probably

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.620 
going to be coming out and they probably
wouldn't<00:00:11.340> be<00:00:11.490> up<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.790> date<00:00:11.969> once<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.450> patch

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
wouldn't be up to date once the patch

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.810 
wouldn't be up to date once the patch
came<00:00:12.900> out<00:00:13.049> but<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:14.099> know<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.460> lot<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:14.700> people

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
came out but I know a lot of people

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.700 
came out but I know a lot of people
haven't<00:00:15.389> really<00:00:15.599> been<00:00:15.719> able<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.109> do<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.529> death

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
haven't really been able to do the death

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.920 
haven't really been able to do the death
singer<00:00:17.100> or<00:00:17.520> they<00:00:17.940> just<00:00:17.970> kind<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.300> jump<00:00:18.630> over

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
singer or they just kind of jump over

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.390 
singer or they just kind of jump over
him<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.260> figured<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.770> because<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.189> might

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
him and I figured that because it might

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.490 
him and I figured that because it might
actually<00:00:20.939> drop<00:00:21.600> something<00:00:21.869> during<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.260> hard

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
actually drop something during the hard

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.810 
actually drop something during the hard
raid<00:00:22.710> like<00:00:22.890> maybe<00:00:23.100> it'll<00:00:23.310> always<00:00:23.490> drop<00:00:23.789> a

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
raid like maybe it'll always drop a

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.730 
raid like maybe it'll always drop a
weapon<00:00:24.210> or<00:00:24.269> something<00:00:24.630> I'd<00:00:25.350> probably<00:00:25.529> be<00:00:25.710> a

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
weapon or something I'd probably be a

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.170 
weapon or something I'd probably be a
good<00:00:25.800> idea<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.220> get<00:00:26.430> out<00:00:26.580> there<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:26.939> at<00:00:27.060> least

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
good idea to get out there and at least

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.300 
good idea to get out there and at least
show<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.689> good<00:00:27.960> method<00:00:28.170> for<00:00:28.470> doing<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.890> so

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
show you a good method for doing it so

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.279 
show you a good method for doing it so
you'll<00:00:29.490> be<00:00:29.580> able<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.820> modify<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.359> later<00:00:30.570> but

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
you'll be able to modify it later but

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.900 
you'll be able to modify it later but
anyways<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.949> has<00:00:32.160> several<00:00:32.430> different<00:00:32.730> parts

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
anyways it has several different parts

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:33.979 
anyways it has several different parts
to<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.090> first<00:00:33.360> thing<00:00:33.540> you're<00:00:33.690> going<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.899> have

two different wizards they spawn simply

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.440 
two different wizards they spawn simply
by<00:00:37.920> running<00:00:38.340> into<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.610> room<00:00:38.850> all<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.360> to
