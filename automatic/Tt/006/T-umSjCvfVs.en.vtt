00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
doing it now I think that there's

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.060 
doing it now I think that there's
everyone<00:04:27.340> has<00:04:27.460> a<00:04:27.490> different<00:04:27.760> idea<00:04:28.060> for<00:04:28.659> how

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
everyone has a different idea for how

think<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.400> best<00:04:32.700> solution<00:04:32.820> is<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:33.960> have<00:04:34.200> as

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
think the best solution is to have as

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.240 
think the best solution is to have as
many<00:04:35.060> different<00:04:36.060> avenues<00:04:36.210> as<00:04:36.840> you<00:04:37.200> can<00:04:37.470> for
