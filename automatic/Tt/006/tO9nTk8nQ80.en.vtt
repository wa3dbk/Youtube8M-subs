unit<00:00:13.309> 8<00:00:13.549> question<00:00:14.830> 27<00:00:16.720> the<00:00:17.720> experiment

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:18.349 
unit 8 question 27 the experiment

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.429 
unit 8 question 27 the experiment
depicted<00:00:18.890> in<00:00:19.460> Figure<00:00:20.150> whoa<00:00:20.270> okay<00:00:20.720> so<00:00:20.779> it<00:00:21.200> just

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
depicted in Figure whoa okay so it just

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:22.929 
depicted in Figure whoa okay so it just
has<00:00:21.529> some<00:00:21.710> cheetahs<00:00:22.130> that<00:00:22.160> are<00:00:22.460> not<00:00:22.610> siblings

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
has some cheetahs that are not siblings

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.260 
has some cheetahs that are not siblings
little<00:00:23.750> some<00:00:24.259> words<00:00:24.529> and<00:00:24.910> basically<00:00:25.910> this<00:00:26.119> is

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
little some words and basically this is

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.139 
little some words and basically this is
a<00:00:26.300> great<00:00:26.660> diagram<00:00:27.579> you<00:00:28.579> know<00:00:28.669> who's<00:00:28.849> showing

00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:29.149 
a great diagram you know who's showing

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:32.260 
a great diagram you know who's showing
you<00:00:30.140> know<00:00:30.230> basically<00:00:30.739> uh<00:00:30.770> you<00:00:31.399> know<00:00:32.029> the

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
you know basically uh you know the

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.840 
you know basically uh you know the
different<00:00:32.630> forms<00:00:33.020> of<00:00:33.250> transplantations<00:00:34.250> you

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
different forms of transplantations you

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.330 
different forms of transplantations you
have<00:00:34.969> that<00:00:35.120> cheetah<00:00:35.420> one<00:00:35.719> cheetah<00:00:36.380> two<00:00:36.680> you

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
have that cheetah one cheetah two you

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.360 
have that cheetah one cheetah two you
have<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:37.579> allograph<00:00:38.800> which<00:00:39.800> is<00:00:39.980> clearly

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
have the allograph which is clearly

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.550 
have the allograph which is clearly
coming<00:00:41.150> from<00:00:41.510> a<00:00:41.810> non<00:00:42.650> genetically<00:00:43.550> identical

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
coming from a non genetically identical

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.950 
coming from a non genetically identical
organism<00:00:45.560> but<00:00:45.710> it's<00:00:45.830> the<00:00:45.950> same<00:00:46.160> species<00:00:46.960> you

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
organism but it's the same species you

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.050 
organism but it's the same species you
know<00:00:48.079> so<00:00:48.290> saying<00:00:48.950> that<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.400> donor<00:00:49.670> is<00:00:49.910> the

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 
know so saying that the donor is the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.420 
know so saying that the donor is the
same<00:00:50.270> same<00:00:50.870> species<00:00:51.200> so<00:00:52.010> it's<00:00:52.160> called<00:00:52.340> an

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
same same species so it's called an

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.130 
same same species so it's called an
allograft<00:00:52.880> or<00:00:53.239> it<00:00:53.630> could<00:00:53.780> be<00:00:53.870> called<00:00:54.020> a

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
allograft or it could be called a

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.120 
allograft or it could be called a
homograph<00:00:54.680> and<00:00:55.300> and<00:00:56.300> then<00:00:56.989> you<00:00:57.110> also<00:00:57.290> have<00:00:57.560> an

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
homograph and and then you also have an

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.979 
homograph and and then you also have an
autograph<00:00:58.730> which<00:00:58.970> is<00:00:59.120> from<00:00:59.480> the<00:00:59.750> same

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
autograph which is from the same

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.250 
autograph which is from the same
organism<00:01:00.829> and<00:01:01.070> you<00:01:01.550> see<00:01:01.730> the<00:01:01.970> healing<00:01:02.270> whether

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
organism and you see the healing whether

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.049 
organism and you see the healing whether
it<00:01:03.440> be<00:01:03.649> from<00:01:03.950> the<00:01:04.040> autograph<00:01:04.820> where<00:01:05.000> the

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
it be from the autograph where the

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.060 
it be from the autograph where the
autograph<00:01:05.420> seems<00:01:05.659> to<00:01:05.840> be<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.049> same<00:01:06.290> it's<00:01:06.890> not

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
autograph seems to be the same it's not

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.719 
autograph seems to be the same it's not
significantly<00:01:07.790> different<00:01:07.880> in<00:01:08.509> any<00:01:08.780> way<00:01:09.729> and

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
significantly different in any way and

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.480 
significantly different in any way and
and<00:01:11.299> these<00:01:11.479> types<00:01:11.780> of<00:01:12.049> these<00:01:12.920> types<00:01:13.280> of

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
and these types of these types of

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.440 
and these types of these types of
transplants<00:01:14.270> just<00:01:14.450> incidentally<00:01:15.219> you<00:01:16.219> know

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
transplants just incidentally you know

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.910 
transplants just incidentally you know
allograft<00:01:17.450> transplants<00:01:18.259> of<00:01:18.380> course<00:01:18.649> you've

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
allograft transplants of course you've

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.669 
allograft transplants of course you've
heard<00:01:19.539> have<00:01:20.539> been<00:01:20.659> done<00:01:20.810> for<00:01:20.990> heart<00:01:21.259> alone

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
heard have been done for heart alone

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:27.160 
heard have been done for heart alone
liver<00:01:23.020> transplants<00:01:24.020> etc<00:01:24.579> and<00:01:25.579> then<00:01:26.450> you<00:01:26.929> see

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
liver transplants etc and then you see

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.590 
liver transplants etc and then you see
the<00:01:27.289> domestic<00:01:27.770> cat<00:01:28.069> you<00:01:29.060> know<00:01:29.179> having<00:01:29.539> a

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
the domestic cat you know having a

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.020 
the domestic cat you know having a
transplant<00:01:30.049> as<00:01:30.829> well

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
transplant as well

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.969 
transplant as well
skin<00:01:32.539> transplant<00:01:33.109> and<00:01:33.499> that's<00:01:33.679> called<00:01:33.889> the

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
skin transplant and that's called the

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.580 
skin transplant and that's called the
xeno<00:01:34.459> graft<00:01:35.209> because<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:36.049> transplant<00:01:36.499> is

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
xeno graft because the transplant is

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.870 
xeno graft because the transplant is
coming<00:01:36.859> obviously<00:01:37.130> from<00:01:37.609> a<00:01:37.670> different

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
coming obviously from a different

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.279 
coming obviously from a different
species<00:01:38.350> and<00:01:39.759> just<00:01:40.759> as<00:01:41.090> an<00:01:41.509> aside<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.899> future

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
species and just as an aside the future

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.800 
species and just as an aside the future
of<00:01:42.619> course<00:01:42.920> you<00:01:43.789> know<00:01:43.880> what<00:01:44.090> what<00:01:44.479> is<00:01:44.600> being

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
of course you know what what is being

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.209 
of course you know what what is being
worked<00:01:45.020> on<00:01:45.229> is<00:01:45.529> is<00:01:45.770> to<00:01:46.459> take<00:01:48.009> organs<00:01:49.009> from

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
worked on is is to take organs from

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.849 
worked on is is to take organs from
other<00:01:49.549> species<00:01:49.880> like<00:01:50.060> pig<00:01:50.810> or<00:01:51.049> baboon<00:01:51.590> and

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859 
other species like pig or baboon and

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.129 
other species like pig or baboon and
then<00:01:52.399> to<00:01:52.700> genetically<00:01:53.149> alter<00:01:53.299> them<00:01:53.779> so<00:01:53.990> that

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:54.139 
then to genetically alter them so that

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:56.529 
then to genetically alter them so that
it<00:01:54.799> tricks<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.249> patient's<00:01:55.849> immune<00:01:56.119> response

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
it tricks the patient's immune response

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.379 
it tricks the patient's immune response
to<00:01:56.659> accept<00:01:57.079> it<00:01:57.229> but<00:01:58.039> here<00:01:58.459> this<00:01:58.819> is<00:01:58.880> clearly

00:01:59.379 --> 00:01:59.389 
to accept it but here this is clearly

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:01.749 
to accept it but here this is clearly
not<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.689> case<00:01:59.959> and<00:02:00.279> and<00:02:01.279> this<00:02:01.490> is<00:02:01.579> you<00:02:01.670> know

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
not the case and and this is you know

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.899 
not the case and and this is you know
graph<00:02:01.969> was<00:02:02.389> rejected<00:02:03.109> it<00:02:03.229> was<00:02:03.319> completely

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
graph was rejected it was completely

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.760 
graph was rejected it was completely
rejected<00:02:06.189> so<00:02:07.189> then<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.459> experiment<00:02:08.349> asks<00:02:09.349> the

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
rejected so then the experiment asks the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.220 
rejected so then the experiment asks the
most<00:02:10.039> significant<00:02:10.729> difference<00:02:11.360> was<00:02:11.870> shown<00:02:12.110> an

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
most significant difference was shown an

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.140 
most significant difference was shown an
experiment<00:02:12.709> allograph<00:02:13.220> versus<00:02:13.940> non

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
experiment allograph versus non

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.500 
experiment allograph versus non
transplanted<00:02:14.870> tissue<00:02:15.190> autograph<00:02:16.510> allograft

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
transplanted tissue autograph allograft

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.110 
transplanted tissue autograph allograft
versus<00:02:17.780> autograph

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
versus autograph

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
versus autograph
look<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.569> most<00:02:20.810> significant

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
look the most significant

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.430 
look the most significant
this<00:02:22.650> whole<00:02:23.040> passage<00:02:23.970> showed<00:02:24.750> was<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.170> you

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
this whole passage showed was that you

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.960 
this whole passage showed was that you
got<00:02:25.590> complete<00:02:26.069> rejection<00:02:26.670> with<00:02:26.850> the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
got complete rejection with the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.380 
got complete rejection with the
xenograft<00:02:27.569> and<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:28.500> got<00:02:29.060> acceptance<00:02:30.060> with

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
xenograft and you got acceptance with

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.230 
xenograft and you got acceptance with
the<00:02:30.480> autograph<00:02:30.900> for<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.230> allograph<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:32.240> that

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
the autograph for the allograph and that

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.930 
the autograph for the allograph and that
is<00:02:33.420> not<00:02:33.600> mentioned<00:02:33.870> in<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.319> answer<00:02:34.650> choices

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940
