neck is down like that obviously and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.610 
neck is down like that obviously and
then<00:01:12.410> you<00:01:12.680> have<00:01:12.860> this<00:01:13.100> soft<00:01:14.080> synthetic<00:01:15.080> hair

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
then you have this soft synthetic hair

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.240

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
you can use it for full coverage

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.560 
you can use it for full coverage
foundation<00:01:21.380> if<00:01:22.310> you<00:01:22.400> use<00:01:22.610> mineral<00:01:22.910> foundation

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
foundation if you use mineral foundation

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.440 
foundation if you use mineral foundation
or<00:01:24.140> you<00:01:24.680> can<00:01:24.860> use<00:01:25.040> it<00:01:25.070> with<00:01:25.310> blush<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:25.940> bronzer

or you can use it with blush and bronzer
I've<00:01:26.690> actually<00:01:26.870> by<00:01:27.470> my<00:01:27.800> photon<00:01:28.400> today<00:01:28.730> using

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
I've actually by my photon today using

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.960 
I've actually by my photon today using
this<00:01:29.330> brush<00:01:29.600> and<00:01:30.050> it<00:01:30.800> works<00:01:31.040> really<00:01:31.400> well<00:01:31.550> and

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
this brush and it works really well and

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.630 
this brush and it works really well and
it<00:01:32.240> really<00:01:32.600> blended<00:01:33.170> it<00:01:33.290> out<00:01:33.640> perfectly

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
it really blended it out perfectly

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.150 
it really blended it out perfectly
absolutely<00:01:35.420> ideal<00:01:35.690> of<00:01:36.050> your<00:01:36.320> hammer<00:01:36.560> next

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
absolutely ideal of your hammer next

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.820 
absolutely ideal of your hammer next
thing<00:01:37.370> of<00:01:37.640> course<00:01:37.940> is<00:01:38.210> photon<00:01:39.110> which<00:01:39.470> already

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
thing of course is photon which already

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.540 
thing of course is photon which already
is<00:01:40.160> quite<00:01:40.460> famous<00:01:40.730> now<00:01:41.720> I'm<00:01:41.960> huge<00:01:42.560> fan<00:01:42.920> of<00:01:43.220> bare

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
is quite famous now I'm huge fan of bare

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.670 
is quite famous now I'm huge fan of bare
minerals<00:01:44.000> blushes<00:01:44.540> and<00:01:44.690> bronzers<00:01:44.750> I<00:01:45.410> think

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
minerals blushes and bronzers I think

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.250 
minerals blushes and bronzers I think
that<00:01:45.860> really<00:01:46.160> smooth<00:01:46.700> they<00:01:47.330> love<00:01:47.630> stall<00:01:48.020> day

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
that really smooth they love stall day

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.250 
that really smooth they love stall day
they<00:01:48.920> give<00:01:49.550> good<00:01:49.880> color<00:01:50.210> payoff<00:01:50.540> they<00:01:50.930> last

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
they give good color payoff they last

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.340 
they give good color payoff they last
forever<00:01:51.590> so<00:01:52.300> I<00:01:53.300> don't<00:01:54.020> think<00:01:54.140> I'd<00:01:54.320> ever

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
forever so I don't think I'd ever

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.400 
forever so I don't think I'd ever
complain<00:01:54.980> about<00:01:55.130> them<00:01:55.490> I<00:01:55.730> really<00:01:56.690> love<00:01:56.870> warmth

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
complain about them I really love warmth

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.470 
complain about them I really love warmth
which<00:01:57.740> I<00:01:57.890> need<00:01:58.100> some<00:01:58.400> people<00:01:58.760> do<00:01:58.910> like

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
which I need some people do like

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.680 
which I need some people do like
because<00:01:59.720> it<00:01:59.990> does<00:02:00.200> run<00:02:00.500> almost<00:02:01.130> a<00:02:01.730> bit<00:02:01.880> OMG<00:02:02.420> of

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
because it does run almost a bit OMG of

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.560 
because it does run almost a bit OMG of
the<00:02:02.900> way<00:02:03.050> it<00:02:03.260> works<00:02:03.710> with<00:02:04.040> blushes<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:04.880> just

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
the way it works with blushes and just

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.480 
the way it works with blushes and just
really<00:02:05.750> animates<00:02:06.320> my<00:02:06.620> face<00:02:06.890> so<00:02:07.190> I<00:02:07.220> use<00:02:07.460> that

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
really animates my face so I use that

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.780 
really animates my face so I use that
very<00:02:08.000> regularly<00:02:08.480> this<00:02:09.200> photon<00:02:09.770> is<00:02:10.430> actually

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
very regularly this photon is actually

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.540 
very regularly this photon is actually
quite<00:02:10.970> different<00:02:11.630> from<00:02:11.780> warmth<00:02:12.290> it's<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:13.280> lot

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
quite different from warmth it's a lot

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.370 
quite different from warmth it's a lot
