00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.090
 almost with everything only that there is 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.519

 As you can see, almost all the 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.120

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.550

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.329
 put them in the oven comes the preparation 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.510
 for the cream of cheese and the adornment comes 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.820
 which is white chocolate flakes in my 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.190
 case as I want them to have more colorful 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.770
 I will use another type of ornaments 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.600
 apart from the chocolate the scales of 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.030
 chocolate first thing we're going to 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.430
 prepare are the muffins and for that 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.980
 we put the preparation in the bowl that 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.230
 we have there then we will beat a 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.080
 little the game and we add it to the preparation 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.040
 we move a little with the rods and 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.410
 we cast the 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.570
 we remove again so that he leaves 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.880
 integrating everything 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.880
 and then we throw the milk 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.350
 and we will beat the fort so that 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.350
 everything is well mixed 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.530
 now we put the molds in a tray 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.640
 of oven and we are throwing the mixture in 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.950
 they 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.340
 we are throwing two tablespoons in each 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.340
 mold 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.650
 and now we'll put them in the oven about 25 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.650
 150 degrees minutes 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.420
 once we have taken out in our 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.400
 muffins from the oven we put them in a 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.310
 surface a grid what you have to 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.709
 hand to cool them and we will have them 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.349
 10 or 15 minutes meanwhile 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:24.360
 we will take advantage to prepare our 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:26.310
 cream we toss the cheese into a bowl and the 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.980
 butter that we have already softened 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.709
 previously we stir well so that it 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.170
 we mix the cheese and the butter already 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.299
 then we will take the package 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.370
 prepared that we also had in the 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.370
 box and we mix everything well 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.300
 once everything has been mixed well we throw 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:03:00.130
 our prepared in a pastry bag 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.130
 and we're going to decorate our muffins 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.310
 and in my case I'm going to decorate a few 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.209
 with the pastry bag you see what 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.220
 pretty are left and the others I'm going to 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.500
 Take a little cream and I'll 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.150
 smooth with a spoon because if not 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.459
 you have manga at home you can do 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.629
 They also do not look so pretty but 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.629
 they are equally rich 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.790
 once we have finished taking our 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.239
 cream we are going to decorate with our 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.239
 shavings 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.099
