designer of classic space is are the
scientists<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> scientist

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
scientists so this is a scientist

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.889 
scientists so this is a scientist
spaceman<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:53.039> he<00:00:53.699> has<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.969> old<00:00:54.210> design<00:00:54.570> for

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
spaceman and he has that old design for

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:55.970 
spaceman and he has that old design for
a<00:00:54.930> lot<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.230> people<00:00:55.530> who<00:00:55.590> can't<00:00:55.829> tell<00:00:55.920> a

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
a lot of people who can't tell a

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.010 
a lot of people who can't tell a
difference<00:00:56.039> like<00:00:56.579> between<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.180> helmets<00:00:57.510> this

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
difference like between the helmets this

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.569 
difference like between the helmets this
is<00:00:58.140> actually<00:00:58.410> not<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.800> same<00:00:58.980> helmet<00:00:59.309> design

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
is actually not the same helmet design

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.369 
is actually not the same helmet design
as<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.210> modern<00:01:00.570> helmet<00:01:00.840> designs<00:01:01.079> because<00:01:01.320> it

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
as the modern helmet designs because it

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.630 
as the modern helmet designs because it
doesn't<00:01:01.590> have<00:01:01.680> those<00:01:01.829> little<00:01:01.920> indents<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
doesn't have those little indents on the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.579 
doesn't have those little indents on the
side<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.210> put<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.449> visor<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.470> has<00:01:04.559> a

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
side to put the visor and it has a

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.289 
side to put the visor and it has a
little<00:01:04.710> bit<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.979> wider<00:01:05.220> opening<00:01:06.210> right

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
little bit of a wider opening right

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.630 
little bit of a wider opening right
there<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.659> middle<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.280> that<00:01:08.280> works<00:01:08.490> out

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
there in the middle and that works out

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.750 
there in the middle and that works out
quite<00:01:08.909> well<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.330> looks<00:01:09.390> great<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.760> of

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
quite well and it looks great and of

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.190 
quite well and it looks great and of
course<00:01:11.939> they<00:01:12.000> discontinued<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.720> particular

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
course they discontinued this particular

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.039 
course they discontinued this particular
helmet<00:01:13.560> design<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:14.010> 1988<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:15.930> see

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
helmet design in 1988 and you can see

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.510 
helmet design in 1988 and you can see
his<00:01:16.439> head<00:01:16.680> piece<00:01:16.920> right<00:01:17.100> there<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.369> also

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
his head piece right there is also

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.219 
his head piece right there is also
different<00:01:17.880> because<00:01:17.970> nowadays<00:01:18.900> you'd<00:01:19.080> have

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
different because nowadays you'd have

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.380 
different because nowadays you'd have
that<00:01:19.350> little<00:01:19.590> indent<00:01:19.979> inside<00:01:20.430> but<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:21.180> one

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
that little indent inside but this one

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.080 
that little indent inside but this one
is<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:21.990> has<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> stud<00:01:22.860> popping<00:01:23.310> out<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.520> top<00:01:23.700> so

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
is just has a stud popping out on top so

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.149 
is just has a stud popping out on top so
that's<00:01:24.390> pretty<00:01:24.630> cool<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.740> course<00:01:25.920> he<00:01:26.070> has

don't<00:01:28.080> make<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.320> piece<00:01:28.680> anymore<00:01:29.250> at<00:01:29.430> least

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
don't make that piece anymore at least

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.670 
don't make that piece anymore at least
commonly<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.270> new<00:01:30.509> sets<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.409> think<00:01:31.619> they

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
commonly in new sets and I think they

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.109 
commonly in new sets and I think they
put<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:31.979> space<00:01:32.189> place<00:01:32.460> three<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:32.970> not

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
put in space place three so it's not

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.999 
put in space place three so it's not
totally<00:01:33.570> phased<00:01:33.990> out<00:01:34.170> but<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.560> hasn't<00:01:34.770> been<00:01:34.890> in

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
totally phased out but it hasn't been in

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.649 
totally phased out but it hasn't been in
set<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.340> little<00:01:35.549> while<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.939> also<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.570> got

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
set in a little while and also you got

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.240 
set in a little while and also you got
that<00:01:36.810> nice<00:01:36.990> printing<00:01:37.500> on<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.710> front<00:01:38.130> of

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
that nice printing on the front of

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.679 
that nice printing on the front of
course<00:01:38.280> no<00:01:38.579> printing<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.000> back<00:01:39.180> because

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
course no printing on the back because

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.600 
course no printing on the back because
back<00:01:40.320> then<00:01:40.350> they<00:01:40.619> didn't<00:01:40.829> even<00:01:40.920> put<00:01:41.250> any<00:01:41.280> back

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
back then they didn't even put any back

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.730 
back then they didn't even put any back
printing<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.000> torsos<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:43.409> rest<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
printing on torsos and the rest of the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.170 
printing on torsos and the rest of the
set<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.070> just<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.460> little<00:01:44.610> vehicle<00:01:45.030> right

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
design like how I came out and it's very

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.280 
design like how I came out and it's very
simple<00:02:02.850> but<00:02:03.030> yet<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> very<00:02:03.540> effective<00:02:03.869> build

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
simple but yet a very effective build

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.340 
simple but yet a very effective build
and<00:02:04.549> for<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.700> little<00:02:05.820> probe<00:02:06.540> vehicle<00:02:07.170> right

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
and for the little probe vehicle right

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.260 
and for the little probe vehicle right
here<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:08.250> got<00:02:08.399> this<00:02:08.580> nice<00:02:08.759> piece<00:02:09.060> which

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
here you got this nice piece which

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.150 
here you got this nice piece which
hasn't<00:02:09.780> appeared<00:02:09.959> in<00:02:10.110> many<00:02:10.289> recent<00:02:10.739> steps<00:02:11.069> I

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
hasn't appeared in many recent steps I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.199 
hasn't appeared in many recent steps I
think<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.370> hasn't<00:02:11.489> appeared<00:02:11.730> actually<00:02:12.060> in<00:02:12.150> a

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
think it hasn't appeared actually in a

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.670 
think it hasn't appeared actually in a
set<00:02:12.540> since<00:02:12.750> 2000<00:02:13.319> so

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
set since 2000 so

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.410 
set since 2000 so
it<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.099> kind<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.459> PC<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.849> never<00:02:15.090> had<00:02:15.299> before

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
it is kind of a PC I never had before

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.209 
it is kind of a PC I never had before
until<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:15.840> got<00:02:15.959> this<00:02:16.140> set<00:02:16.379> and<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.010> got<00:02:17.129> the

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219 
until I got this set and you got the

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.640 
until I got this set and you got the
probe<00:02:17.489> on<00:02:17.760> front<00:02:18.269> right<00:02:18.510> here<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:18.989> you<00:02:19.530> could

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
probe on front right here and you could

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.869 
probe on front right here and you could
just<00:02:19.859> kind<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.069> pull<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.280> out<00:02:20.519> it's<00:02:20.760> only

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
just kind of pull it out it's only

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.369 
just kind of pull it out it's only
really<00:02:21.150> held<00:02:21.359> in<00:02:21.510> by<00:02:21.689> this<00:02:21.750> little<00:02:21.989> Technic

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
really held in by this little Technic

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.780 
really held in by this little Technic
pin<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.709> even<00:02:22.890> then<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.069> doesn't<00:02:23.340> snap<00:02:23.549> in

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
pin and even then it doesn't snap in

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.929 
pin and even then it doesn't snap in
because<00:02:24.269> this<00:02:24.359> is<00:02:24.420> just<00:02:24.719> a<00:02:24.840> hole<00:02:25.079> part<00:02:25.519> but<00:02:26.519> the

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
because this is just a hole part but the

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:28.250 
because this is just a hole part but the
probe<00:02:27.180> itself<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.689> a<00:02:27.719> little<00:02:27.989> bit<00:02:28.079> like<00:02:28.230> a

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
probe itself is a little bit like a

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.440 
probe itself is a little bit like a
rocket<00:02:28.739> or<00:02:29.159> it<00:02:29.310> is<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.459> rocket<00:02:29.909> and<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.329> could

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
rocket or it is a rocket and you could

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.089 
rocket or it is a rocket and you could
move<00:02:30.689> it<00:02:30.840> up<00:02:31.049> if<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.349> want<00:02:31.530> like<00:02:31.709> that<00:02:31.889> by

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
move it up if you want like that by

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.800 
move it up if you want like that by
pushing<00:02:32.340> down<00:02:32.549> on<00:02:32.579> this<00:02:32.790> little<00:02:32.939> hinged<00:02:33.329> piece

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
pushing down on this little hinged piece

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.940 
pushing down on this little hinged piece
right<00:02:33.959> there<00:02:34.139> or<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.319> can<00:02:34.409> move<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.650> all<00:02:34.829> the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
right there or you can move it all the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.500 
right there or you can move it all the
way<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.069> this<00:02:35.189> side<00:02:35.250> like<00:02:35.609> that<00:02:35.819> so<00:02:36.329> it's<00:02:36.450> a

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
way to this side like that so it's a

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.879 
way to this side like that so it's a
cute<00:02:36.750> little<00:02:36.810> build<00:02:37.109> not<00:02:37.379> really<00:02:37.680> much<00:02:37.859> else

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:37.889 
cute little build not really much else

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:40.459 
cute little build not really much else
to<00:02:38.129> it<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.609> course<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.299> could<00:02:39.420> put<00:02:39.659> the

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469 
to it of course you could put the

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:44.509 
to it of course you could put the
spaceman<00:02:40.950> on<00:02:41.219> the<00:02:41.489> side<00:02:41.670> right<00:02:41.849> here<00:02:41.909> and<00:02:43.519> you

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
spaceman on the side right here and you

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.429 
spaceman on the side right here and you
could<00:02:44.609> have<00:02:44.730> him<00:02:44.879> go<00:02:45.030> exploring<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.750> the

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:46.439 
could have him go exploring and the

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.020 
could have him go exploring and the
wheels<00:02:46.620> on<00:02:46.829> the<00:02:46.919> bottom<00:02:47.040> are<00:02:47.340> actually<00:02:47.849> that

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
wheels on the bottom are actually that

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.580 
wheels on the bottom are actually that
old<00:02:48.269> design<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:48.959> we<00:02:49.049> really<00:02:49.349> don't<00:02:49.470> see

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
old design that we really don't see

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.440 
old design that we really don't see
anymore<00:02:49.919> if<00:02:50.129> those<00:02:50.280> little<00:02:50.400> metal<00:02:50.669> parts

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
anymore if those little metal parts

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.240 
anymore if those little metal parts
inside<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:51.989> it's<00:02:52.109> kind<00:02:52.260> of<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.379> modified<00:02:52.799> plate

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
inside so it's kind of a modified plate

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.520 
inside so it's kind of a modified plate
which<00:02:54.239> is<00:02:54.419> kind<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:54.870> refreshing<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.379> see<00:02:55.409> that
