00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
your looks using the scissor lock or the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.420 
your looks using the scissor lock or the
interlocking<00:01:07.090> method<00:01:07.510> this<00:01:08.350> is<00:01:08.590> a<00:01:08.979> yarn

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
interlocking method this is a yarn

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.270 
interlocking method this is a yarn
needle<00:01:09.520> and<00:01:10.000> it<00:01:10.659> has<00:01:10.840> been<00:01:11.140> shaved<00:01:11.530> down<00:01:11.830> a<00:01:11.890> bit

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
needle and it has been shaved down a bit

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.640 
needle and it has been shaved down a bit
just<00:01:12.549> to<00:01:12.909> make<00:01:13.060> it<00:01:13.210> easier<00:01:13.600> I<00:01:13.840> find<00:01:14.380> it<00:01:14.500> this

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
just to make it easier I find it this

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.399 
just to make it easier I find it this
short<00:01:14.950> of<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.310> yarn<00:01:15.700> needle<00:01:16.000> is<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:17.080> easier

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
short of the yarn needle is the easier

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:24.680 
short of the yarn needle is the easier
it<00:01:17.470> is<00:01:17.619> to<00:01:17.680> quickly<00:01:18.310> retwist<00:01:19.090> my<00:01:19.479> locs

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.480 

but<00:01:25.690> there<00:01:25.900> are<00:01:26.020> lots<00:01:26.260> of<00:01:26.380> other<00:01:26.590> methods<00:01:26.980> and

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
but there are lots of other methods and

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.450 
but there are lots of other methods and
ways<00:01:27.670> to<00:01:27.730> create<00:01:28.420> locks<00:01:28.660> one<00:01:29.500> of<00:01:29.590> them<00:01:29.800> is<00:01:30.070> pon

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
ways to create locks one of them is pon

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.270 
ways to create locks one of them is pon
rolling<00:01:30.940> the<00:01:31.360> other<00:01:31.480> one<00:01:31.720> is<00:01:31.960> twisting<00:01:32.650> with

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
rolling the other one is twisting with

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.810 
rolling the other one is twisting with
your<00:01:33.490> fingers<00:01:34.000> two<00:01:34.900> strand<00:01:35.500> twisting<00:01:36.010> single

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
your fingers two strand twisting single

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.100 
your fingers two strand twisting single
braiding<00:01:37.300> and<00:01:37.510> there's<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.690> bunch<00:01:37.960> of

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
braiding and there's a bunch of

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.240 
braiding and there's a bunch of
different<00:01:38.260> ways<00:01:38.710> so<00:01:39.340> if<00:01:39.670> you<00:01:40.000> don't<00:01:40.270> want<00:01:40.510> to

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
different ways so if you don't want to

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.700 
different ways so if you don't want to
use<00:01:42.250> this<00:01:42.520> method<00:01:42.910> to<00:01:43.120> start<00:01:43.479> them<00:01:43.750> you<00:01:44.500> can

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
use this method to start them you can

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.500 
use this method to start them you can
use<00:01:44.890> a<00:01:44.920> more<00:01:45.160> traditional<00:01:45.700> way<00:01:45.880> which<00:01:46.210> is<00:01:46.390> what

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
use a more traditional way which is what

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.990 
use a more traditional way which is what
I<00:01:46.540> did<00:01:46.810> I<00:01:46.990> use<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:47.200> traditional<00:01:47.530> way<00:01:47.979> to<00:01:48.250> start

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
I did I use a traditional way to start

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.690 
I did I use a traditional way to start
my<00:01:49.150> locks<00:01:49.420> but<00:01:49.900> now<00:01:50.110> I<00:01:50.140> used<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.710> tool<00:01:50.830> to

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
my locks but now I used the tool to

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.030 
my locks but now I used the tool to
retwist<00:01:52.330> and<00:01:52.630> retighten<00:01:53.050> them<00:01:53.290> because<00:01:54.010> I

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
retwist and retighten them because I

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.580 
retwist and retighten them because I
find<00:01:54.430> that<00:01:54.610> it's<00:01:55.210> way<00:01:55.570> faster<00:01:56.200> than<00:01:57.509> manually

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
find that it's way faster than manually

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.780 
find that it's way faster than manually
retwisting<00:01:59.590> my<00:01:59.800> locks<00:02:00.040> with<00:02:00.250> my<00:02:00.400> fingers

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
retwisting my locks with my fingers

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.630 
retwisting my locks with my fingers
another<00:02:01.600> thing<00:02:01.960> that<00:02:02.350> is<00:02:02.470> really<00:02:02.830> useful

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
another thing that is really useful

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:11.280 
another thing that is really useful

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.650 

so<00:02:22.700> my<00:02:22.850> three<00:02:23.090> tips<00:02:23.450> for<00:02:23.569> this<00:02:23.870> video<00:02:24.380> are

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
so my three tips for this video are

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.300 
so my three tips for this video are
getting<00:02:26.660> locks<00:02:26.990> are<00:02:27.260> not<00:02:27.470> as<00:02:27.620> stressful<00:02:27.980> as

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
getting locks are not as stressful as

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.990 
getting locks are not as stressful as
people<00:02:28.880> make<00:02:29.090> it<00:02:29.270> sound<00:02:29.600> and<00:02:30.050> seem<00:02:30.670> it's<00:02:31.670> sort

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
people make it sound and seem it's sort

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.160 
people make it sound and seem it's sort
of<00:02:32.060> sometimes<00:02:32.750> it's<00:02:33.520> taken<00:02:34.520> too<00:02:34.640> seriously

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
of sometimes it's taken too seriously
