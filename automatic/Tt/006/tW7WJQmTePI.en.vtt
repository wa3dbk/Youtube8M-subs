for<00:00:05.580> comet<00:00:05.910> ison<00:00:06.359> this<00:00:07.200> was<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:08.340> charts<00:00:08.760> where

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
for comet ison this was the charts where

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.499 
for comet ison this was the charts where
comet<00:00:09.809> ison<00:00:10.139> should<00:00:10.800> have<00:00:10.920> been<00:00:11.160> passed<00:00:12.090> earth

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
comet ison should have been passed earth

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.369 
comet ison should have been passed earth
at<00:00:12.809> this<00:00:13.019> point<00:00:13.759> but<00:00:14.759> as<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.360> broke<00:00:15.839> up<00:00:16.080> its

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
at this point but as it is broke up its

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.790 
at this point but as it is broke up its
tail<00:00:17.190> did<00:00:17.520> not<00:00:17.670> point<00:00:17.970> away<00:00:18.210> from<00:00:18.560> the<00:00:19.560> Sun

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
tail did not point away from the Sun

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.390 
tail did not point away from the Sun
exactly<00:00:21.500> how<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.560> was<00:00:22.680> supposed<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.279> did

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
exactly how it was supposed to it did

into a huge fee and spanned out and turn
it<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.449> just<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.869> huge<00:00:31.349> massive<00:00:32.390> debris<00:00:33.390> field

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
it to just a huge massive debris field

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.729 
it to just a huge massive debris field
as<00:00:36.170> you<00:00:37.170> can<00:00:37.320> see<00:00:37.559> here<00:00:38.750> Ison<00:00:39.750> should<00:00:40.230> be<00:00:40.379> upon

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
as you can see here Ison should be upon

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.560 
as you can see here Ison should be upon
us<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.370> debris<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.530> we're<00:00:44.059> crossing<00:00:45.059> it's

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
us the debris and we're crossing it's

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.069 
us the debris and we're crossing it's
inbound<00:00:46.260> path<00:00:46.770> when<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.700> came<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.780> any

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
inbound path when it came in so any

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.770 
inbound path when it came in so any
debris<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.530> was<00:00:49.770> there<00:00:50.070> then<00:00:50.660> we<00:00:51.660> are

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
debris that was there then we are

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.020 
debris that was there then we are
intersecting<00:00:52.440> as<00:00:52.530> well<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.820> so-called

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
intersecting as well so the so-called

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.639 
intersecting as well so the so-called
double<00:00:54.780> dusting<00:00:55.350> from<00:00:55.890> Comet<00:00:56.610> Ison<00:00:56.789> is

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
double dusting from Comet Ison is

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.889 
double dusting from Comet Ison is
probably<00:00:58.649> taking<00:00:59.010> place<00:00:59.190> right<00:00:59.309> now<00:00:59.789> I<00:01:00.420> would

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
probably taking place right now I would

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.660 
probably taking place right now I would
say<00:01:01.079> some<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.500> these<00:01:01.590> meteors<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.219> fireballs

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
say some of these meteors and fireballs

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.340 
say some of these meteors and fireballs
probably<00:01:03.239> related<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:06.020> there's<00:01:07.020> no<00:01:07.140> one

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
probably related to that there's no one

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.160 
probably related to that there's no one
can<00:01:07.500> tell<00:01:07.680> exactly<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.610> size<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:09.240> any<00:01:10.020> of

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
can tell exactly the size of any of

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.530 
can tell exactly the size of any of
these<00:01:10.290> parts<00:01:10.680> because<00:01:11.010> they're<00:01:11.939> not<00:01:12.060> tracking

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
these parts because they're not tracking

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.090 
these parts because they're not tracking
them<00:01:12.659> all<00:01:12.840> these<00:01:13.200> people<00:01:13.409> were<00:01:13.590> reporting

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
them all these people were reporting

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.740 
them all these people were reporting
them<00:01:14.220> NASA's<00:01:14.729> not<00:01:14.880> picking<00:01:15.180> them<00:01:15.330> up<00:01:15.479> and

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
them NASA's not picking them up and

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.550 
them NASA's not picking them up and
they're<00:01:16.380> seeing<00:01:17.210> massive<00:01:18.210> reports<00:01:18.840> all<00:01:19.140> over
