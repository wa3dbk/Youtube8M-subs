you're<00:01:30.100> thinking<00:01:30.520> about<00:01:30.609> how<00:01:31.179> you<00:01:31.240> can

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
you're thinking about how you can

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.989

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:33.999 
strategically adjust what's happening in

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:39.370 
strategically adjust what's happening in
front<00:01:34.240> of<00:01:34.359> you

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.260 

throughout<00:01:40.040> the<00:01:40.219> game<00:01:40.340> it<00:01:40.520> actually<00:01:40.820> upgrades

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
throughout the game it actually upgrades

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.240 
throughout the game it actually upgrades
as<00:01:41.450> Tanner<00:01:41.689> becomes<00:01:42.229> stronger<00:01:42.560> first<00:01:43.070> thing

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
as Tanner becomes stronger first thing

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.340 
as Tanner becomes stronger first thing
is<00:01:43.340> that<00:01:43.369> the<00:01:44.210> shift<00:01:44.450> itself<00:01:44.840> becomes<00:01:45.200> more

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
is that the shift itself becomes more

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.069 
is that the shift itself becomes more
powerful<00:01:45.530> so<00:01:45.979> we<00:01:46.460> can<00:01:46.610> pull<00:01:46.880> further<00:01:47.509> up<00:01:47.899> and

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
powerful so we can pull further up and

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.560 
powerful so we can pull further up and
see<00:01:48.649> more<00:01:48.890> of<00:01:49.039> the<00:01:49.130> city<00:01:49.159> more<00:01:49.729> of<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:49.970> car

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
see more of the city more of a car

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.560 
see more of the city more of a car
that<00:01:52.140> changes<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:53.070> kind<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.340> mission<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:54.300> can

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
that changes the kind of mission we can

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.090 
that changes the kind of mission we can
do<00:01:54.750> with<00:01:54.960> shift<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.590> we<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:55.890> create

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
do with shift so we can create

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.890 
do with shift so we can create

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
cop car this is dispatch we have a 207

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.810 
cop car this is dispatch we have a 207
in<00:02:10.259> progress<00:02:10.619> near<00:02:10.860> City<00:02:11.100> Hall<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.550> need<00:02:11.670> to

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
in progress near City Hall you need to

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.210 
in progress near City Hall you need to
catch<00:02:12.240> him<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:13.200> would<00:02:13.350> use<00:02:13.530> shift<00:02:13.980> either

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
catch him so you would use shift either

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.040 
catch him so you would use shift either
to<00:02:14.580> take<00:02:14.730> another<00:02:14.940> car<00:02:15.209> which<00:02:15.360> is<00:02:15.390> faster<00:02:15.810> to

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
to take another car which is faster to

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.440 
to take another car which is faster to
get<00:02:16.560> him<00:02:16.740> or<00:02:17.190> take<00:02:17.850> something<00:02:18.000> in<00:02:18.209> oncoming

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
get him or take something in oncoming

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.520 
get him or take something in oncoming
traffic<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.990> pro<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.709> into<00:02:20.580> your<00:02:20.700> target<00:02:21.000> down

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
traffic and pro it into your target down

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.290 
traffic and pro it into your target down
then<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.680> completely<00:02:23.250> designed<00:02:23.520> around<00:02:23.880> shift

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
then is completely designed around shift

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.699 
then is completely designed around shift
so<00:02:24.540> it's<00:02:24.660> not<00:02:24.750> like<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.930> cheat<00:02:25.230> it's<00:02:25.410> not<00:02:25.560> like

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
so it's not like a cheat it's not like

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.060 
so it's not like a cheat it's not like
it's<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:26.040> unlimited<00:02:26.760> ability<00:02:26.910> it's<00:02:27.239> actually

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
it's a unlimited ability it's actually

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.820 
it's a unlimited ability it's actually
integral<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.310> gameplay<00:02:30.650> one<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.770> the

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
integral to the gameplay one of the

integral to the gameplay one of the
first<00:02:32.070> upgrades<00:02:32.520> that<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:33.209> we<00:02:33.270> have<00:02:33.420> is

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
first upgrades that that we have is

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.110 
first upgrades that that we have is
orbital<00:02:33.840> rapid<00:02:34.170> ship<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:35.040> if<00:02:35.160> you're<00:02:35.310> too<00:02:35.820> pops

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
orbital rapid ship so if you're too pops

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.820 
orbital rapid ship so if you're too pops
in<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.660> cop<00:02:36.840> chase<00:02:37.050> trying<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.350> take<00:02:37.500> down<00:02:37.530> and

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
in a cop chase trying to take down and

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.590 
in a cop chase trying to take down and
get<00:02:37.920> away<00:02:38.010> one<00:02:38.790> push<00:02:38.970> of<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.180> button<00:02:39.209> and<00:02:39.480> you

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
get away one push of a button and you

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.810 
get away one push of a button and you
can<00:02:39.660> rapidly<00:02:40.350> shift<00:02:40.800> between<00:02:41.010> those<00:02:41.400> two<00:02:41.580> cop

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
can rapidly shift between those two cop

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.479 
can rapidly shift between those two cop
