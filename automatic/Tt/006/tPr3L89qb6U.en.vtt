00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.410 
I really really love how that looks it
I'm<00:00:10.380> coming<00:00:10.830> in<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.429> camera<00:00:11.759> but<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.269> a

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
I'm coming in the camera but it is a

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.320 
I'm coming in the camera but it is a
really<00:00:13.019> really<00:00:13.380> cool<00:00:14.130> looking<00:00:14.610> model<00:00:15.830> it<00:00:17.330> it

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
really really cool looking model it it

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.300 
really really cool looking model it it
would<00:00:18.869> do<00:00:18.990> my<00:00:19.140> favorite<00:00:19.529> if<00:00:19.650> not<00:00:19.859> for<00:00:20.130> it

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
would do my favorite if not for it

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.300 
would do my favorite if not for it
constantly<00:00:20.820> falling<00:00:21.119> apart<00:00:21.720> if<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.949> would

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
constantly falling apart if I would

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.130 
constantly falling apart if I would
definitely<00:00:23.519> have<00:00:23.850> this<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.269> glass<00:00:24.539> clay

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
definitely have this in a glass clay

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.310 
definitely have this in a glass clay
case<00:00:25.769> stored<00:00:26.340> up<00:00:26.490> above<00:00:27.090> something<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.199> my

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
case stored up above something in my

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.299 
case stored up above something in my
room<00:00:29.390> but<00:00:30.390> arms<00:00:31.170> basically<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.009> don't<00:00:32.099> want

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
room but arms basically you don't want

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.650 
room but arms basically you don't want
to<00:00:32.369> move<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.550> arms<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:32.940> much<00:00:33.149> these

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
to move the arms that much these

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.299 
to move the arms that much these
actually<00:00:34.079> do<00:00:34.230> move<00:00:34.410> out<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.710> side<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.250> you

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
actually do move out to the side so you

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.000 
actually do move out to the side so you
can<00:00:35.809> move<00:00:36.809> your<00:00:36.870> arms<00:00:37.200> around<00:00:37.320> but<00:00:37.680> there's

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
can move your arms around but there's

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.500 
can move your arms around but there's
not<00:00:38.129> too<00:00:38.309> much<00:00:38.430> articulation<00:00:38.760> with<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.270> arms

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
not too much articulation with the arms

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.450 
not too much articulation with the arms
now<00:00:39.660> they<00:00:40.350> won't<00:00:40.559> go<00:00:40.800> all<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.070> way<00:00:41.100> they

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
now they won't go all the way they

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.860 
now they won't go all the way they
probably<00:00:41.730> will<00:00:42.000> go<00:00:42.149> all<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.300> way<00:00:42.390> around<00:00:42.540> I

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
probably will go all the way around I

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.240 
probably will go all the way around I
don't<00:00:43.110> recommend<00:00:43.379> turn<00:00:43.739> them<00:00:43.920> all<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.129> way

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
don't recommend turn them all the way

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.430 
don't recommend turn them all the way
around<00:00:44.930> pieces<00:00:45.930> will<00:00:46.050> probably<00:00:46.289> start

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
around pieces will probably start

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
around pieces will probably start
falling<00:00:46.800> off<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.309> whatnot<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.239> i<00:00:49.460> really

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
falling off and whatnot but i really

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.779 
falling off and whatnot but i really
really<00:00:51.059> love<00:00:51.449> how<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.620> can't<00:00:53.100> say<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.399> not<00:00:53.610> I

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
really love how I can't say it not I

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.639 
really love how I can't say it not I
really<00:00:54.030> love<00:00:54.149> how<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.570> looks<00:00:57.350> let's<00:00:58.350> see<00:00:58.500> in
