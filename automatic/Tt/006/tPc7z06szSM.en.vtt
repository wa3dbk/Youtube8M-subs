think we got one for 10 k 1 for 11 k and

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.870 
think we got one for 10 k 1 for 11 k and
yeah<00:01:31.770> we<00:01:31.890> can<00:01:32.009> make<00:01:32.130> some<00:01:32.280> nice<00:01:32.430> profit<00:01:32.820> on

yeah we can make some nice profit on
these<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.420> case<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.869> guy<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.229> had<00:01:34.320> been

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
these so this case the guy that had been

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.310 
these so this case the guy that had been
training<00:01:34.799> with<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.040> most<00:01:37.909> he's<00:01:39.020> very<00:01:40.020> good<00:01:40.290> to
