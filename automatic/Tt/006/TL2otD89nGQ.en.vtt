so important in fact that the FDA has

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:12.859 
so important in fact that the FDA has
mandated<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:11.700> all<00:00:11.759> processed<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.570> packaged

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
that looks something like this so next

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.770 
that looks something like this so next
time<00:00:18.120> you're<00:00:18.240> wandering<00:00:18.570> through<00:00:18.720> the

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:18.780 
time you're wandering through the

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.780 
time you're wandering through the
grocery<00:00:19.140> store<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:20.010> pick<00:00:20.160> up<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.430> box<00:00:20.610> of

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:20.790 
grocery store and you pick up a box of

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.940 
grocery store and you pick up a box of
food<00:00:21.000> what<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.690> need<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:21.990> look<00:00:22.110> for<00:00:22.170> first<00:00:22.830> of

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
food what you need to look for first of

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.400 
food what you need to look for first of
all<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.400> serving<00:00:23.790> size<00:00:24.200> serving<00:00:25.200> size

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
all is the serving size serving size

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.620 
all is the serving size serving size
here<00:00:25.650> would<00:00:25.800> be<00:00:25.950> one<00:00:26.190> cup<00:00:26.520> and<00:00:26.790> then<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
here would be one cup and then the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.000 
here would be one cup and then the
servings<00:00:27.990> per<00:00:28.050> container<00:00:28.200> which<00:00:28.740> would<00:00:28.890> be

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
servings per container which would be

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.240 
servings per container which would be
about<00:00:29.100> 15<00:00:29.730> all<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:31.110> nutrient<00:00:31.560> information<00:00:32.129> is

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
about 15 all the nutrient information is

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.460 
about 15 all the nutrient information is
based<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.820> one<00:00:33.210> half<00:00:33.420> cup<00:00:33.900> serving<00:00:34.260> size

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
based on that one half cup serving size

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.590 
based on that one half cup serving size
so<00:00:35.250> then<00:00:35.400> when<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.579> look<00:00:35.730> at<00:00:35.880> calories<00:00:36.120> in

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
so then when you look at calories in

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.380 
so then when you look at calories in
this<00:00:37.079> particular<00:00:37.410> box<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.980> cereal<00:00:38.160> it'd<00:00:38.730> be<00:00:38.970> 60

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
this particular box of cereal it'd be 60

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.830 
this particular box of cereal it'd be 60
calories<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:40.260> half<00:00:40.410> half<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.100> cup<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.430> cereal

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
calories for half half a cup of cereal

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.300 
calories for half half a cup of cereal

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
here we have zero milligrams so this

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.030 
here we have zero milligrams so this
would<00:01:24.630> be<00:01:24.720> considered<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:25.260> cholesterol<00:01:25.799> free

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
would be considered a cholesterol free

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.899 
would be considered a cholesterol free

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
food then it has levels for sodium

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.370 
food then it has levels for sodium
potassium<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.409> total<00:01:31.890> carbohydrate<00:01:33.380> the
