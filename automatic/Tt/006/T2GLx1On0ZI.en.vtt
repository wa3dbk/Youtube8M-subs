00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.969
 The harvest is great And there are few workers 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:52.889
 Pray to the Lord of the harvest To send more laborers 

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:55.809
 Who wants to help? 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:05.199
 The master is calling Have work to do 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:20.259
 Under the sun and rain The hard journey will be 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:32.310
 Let's join our strength Arm, hand, heart 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.939
 I looked up and saw The white fields are 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:51.650
 Men are this field Where we have to work 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:02:12.030
 And whoever in the plow picks Do not look back 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:03:42.010
 Who leaves walking and crying In the time of sowing 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:04:02.360
 Will come back with much joy And bundles to show.
