00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
and then here I'm taking a smaller

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.229 
and then here I'm taking a smaller
blending<00:02:37.989> brush<00:02:38.230> or<00:02:38.590> definer<00:02:39.190> brush<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.849> I'm

blending brush or definer brush and I'm

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.729 
blending brush or definer brush and I'm
using<00:02:40.480> that<00:02:40.690> to<00:02:40.870> define<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.349> crease<00:02:41.530> with

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
using that to define the crease with

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.910 
using that to define the crease with
some<00:02:41.920> black<00:02:42.040> eyeshadow<00:02:43.440> this<00:02:44.440> will<00:02:44.590> also<00:02:44.770> help

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
some black eyeshadow this will also help

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.979 
some black eyeshadow this will also help
to<00:02:45.190> smudge<00:02:45.670> out<00:02:45.940> some<00:02:46.209> of<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.390> black<00:02:46.569> eyeliner

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
to smudge out some of the black eyeliner

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.510 
to smudge out some of the black eyeliner
that<00:02:47.230> is<00:02:47.319> still<00:02:47.470> underneath<00:02:47.800> because<00:02:48.160> it's<00:02:48.430> a

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
that is still underneath because it's a

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.120 
that is still underneath because it's a
very<00:02:48.550> densely<00:02:49.180> packed<00:02:49.660> brush<00:02:52.860> now<00:02:53.860> that<00:02:54.040> I've

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
very densely packed brush now that I've

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.949 
very densely packed brush now that I've
applied<00:02:54.340> that<00:02:54.550> black<00:02:54.760> eyeliner<00:02:55.209> eyeshadow<00:02:55.420> I

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
applied that black eyeliner eyeshadow I

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.449 
applied that black eyeliner eyeshadow I
noticed<00:02:56.319> that<00:02:56.410> it<00:02:56.620> needed<00:02:56.770> a<00:02:56.920> little<00:02:57.040> bit<00:02:57.250> more

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
noticed that it needed a little bit more

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.070 
noticed that it needed a little bit more
depth<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:58.000> I'm<00:02:58.120> going<00:02:58.330> in<00:02:58.420> with<00:02:58.480> that<00:02:58.690> darker

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
depth so I'm going in with that darker

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.870 
depth so I'm going in with that darker
brown<00:02:59.319> shadow<00:02:59.650> and<00:03:00.010> lightly<00:03:00.250> blending<00:03:00.760> that

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
brown shadow and lightly blending that

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.449 
brown shadow and lightly blending that
into<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.360> crease<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:01.959> trying<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.069> stay<00:03:03.250> away

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
into the crease and trying to stay away

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.160 
into the crease and trying to stay away
from<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.790> eye<00:03:03.819> brow<00:03:04.090> bones<00:03:04.360> just<00:03:04.690> into<00:03:05.050> the

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
crease and then slightly blending
