00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.470
 do not 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.320
 two 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:23.020
 hello how about welcome to a new 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.840
 delivery of weapons guide in the achieved and 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:29.050
 Well, this time to share the 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.700
 duck weapon the most despised weapon 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.310
 and hopefully they will claim with 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.530
 you because this one would be gentlemen my 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.020
 fourth weapon in preference that is the 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.059
 last to which I am behind no longer not 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.640
 Well, this alarm is rifle type 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:46.160
 I do not know why I have these 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.350
 terrible references what was good 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.629
 if you like this weapon how to improve 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.309
 force better kind of personalization 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.699
 Well, just like here you have it 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.470
 in front of you well we are already 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.290
 seeing all its features now 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:04.040
 Let's talk about why each of 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.080
 them so let's first look at 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.060
 the left we have the standard stock 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.190
 in what is standard stock I have already 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.650
 said gentlemen this here only 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.440
 have to see what would be a bit of 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.899
 stability of the weapon itself the game 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.850
 gentlemen who has the difficulty or the 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.430
 joke of the game is to learn to aim 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.020
 what is the way the gentlemen are there 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.660
 so the standard court does not 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.690
 I recommend that what they improve 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.850
 but if in your case you want to improve 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.100
 there are too many technology points 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.009
 you can do with them what you get 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.390
 please do not here just a simple 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.490
 recommendation the simple recommendation 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.920
 well, it arrives on the right, we have what 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.110
 it would be the telescopic sight we have points 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.670
 look at this case gentlemen I've already 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.710
 I 've already thought about doing things 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.960
 the first option is more than 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.540
 well enough later since the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.880
 right we have the 10 mini pistols what 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.880
 which helps lords ministrations 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.750
 is to increase the speed with which 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.690
 that the projectile which is very very but 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.520
 very important when it comes to end 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.560
 the enemy then how to get it 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.180
 you already know gentlemen we have first 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.500
 it comes with what is assault 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.080
 later we would have to buy 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.230
 light assault for how to finally get to 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.850
 our order that are some mini guns and 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.860
 Well, if you have not heard what it is 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.110
 technology tree I repeat it for you 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.970
 please go see it in my first guide 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.930
 weapons in accomplished so good 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.269
 later we are going to talk about the 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.269
 trigger because the automatic trigger 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:39.360
 gentlemen because that is what offers us great 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.860
 dynamism when escaping gentlemen 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.380
 if the time to escape in achieved 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.930
 we also have to give gentlemen in the 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.880
 withdrawal why because now I have seen 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.370
 that not only are you going, you're two of each 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.780
 three times you get the whole team 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.450
 and I want to make you a book that so 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.769
 do not allow it is used 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.560
 automatic while you escape good with 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.379
 consequently we have the high loader 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.440
 capacity because it mainly reaches us 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.540
 what is the standard charger we will have 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.640
 to spend a little bit of money 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.130
 Nine the technology points for 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.800
 buy high capacity because because 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.510
 as well see that 50 percent 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.790
 that we have of bullets we are going to reach a 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.160
 200 percent as I say that we were 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.950
 double the number of bullets the number of 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.200
 projectiles which leads to finish 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.410
 enemies as a maximum of 2 to a maximum 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.750
 of 4 if we have an internet crack and 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.810
 a great connection and a great 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.019
 faculties at the time of shooting in 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.450
 this great hotel and good finally 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:45.140
 finally yes electricity because the 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.810
 electricity very soon very soon bring 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.720
 the air bonus I will share the why 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.819
 give me my decision at the moment of 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.340
 Search 10 electricity and not using 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.420
 fire this what here gentlemen already depends on 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.790
 you 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.730
 it's just my humble opinion which 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.140
 I won not play it not for something 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.130
 I played 61 hours 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.080
 dukes is still playing 61 hours and I'm not 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.780
 proud to be quite not this game 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.720
 It has had me stuck there and even more 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.299
 when we see that there are now servers in 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.889
 South America yes 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.299
 well let's proceed to try this 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.299
 gun is very cool 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.710
 and in people we are already here at the moment of 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.310
 try this great weapon the best 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.560
 customization for what would be the 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.330
 rifle gun I do not recommend that you 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.039
 weapon be for long distances since 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.610
 for long distances gentlemen you need 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:45.500
 a sniper you think me obvious then for 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.710
 short distances and medium distances 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.140
 of this weapon is spectacular gentlemen 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.060
 we also just one 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.520
 difficulty that would be a bit the 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.890
 stability of the alarm but good the 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.280
 electricity if we point to the center of 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.280
 enemy 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.460
 electricity helps us finish them now 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.129
 that they adhere and calmly 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.050
 at least with all the load then 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:12.840
 we could end up with 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.520
 three enemies so gentlemen I'm not 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.310
 good with goodbyes so we're going to 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.560
 do it previously and quickly a 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.990
 greeting great gentlemen from where 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.060
 from the middle of the world ecuador a 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.319
 greeting from his comrade the car 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:31.430
