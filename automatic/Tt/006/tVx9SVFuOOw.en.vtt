00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hello to all and to the ex mister caused 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.490
 all well today we will talk about 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.259
 abdominals how to strengthen his 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.330
 bees not with a single exercise the 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.889
 crunch we'll see the starting position 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.820
 to not hurt you but we 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.469
 will talk about the dosage 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.900
 it's gone for the starting position 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.300
 I will try on the glutes the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.199
 feet width of your pond 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.330
 position your hands in all your 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.400
 knees is unrolled the column 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.890
 vertebral vertebrae by vertebra like 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.019
 these then placed your four fingers 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.660
 or wanted fingers behind the ears 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.669
 as these elbows well apart 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.440
 I propose you to stretch a leg 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.260
 left right no matter the essential 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.940
 being to keep a good of tralee t of 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.940
 your pool 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.920
 the moment of being simple I will suffer 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.890
 and on the climb take off flat house 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.809
 about 30 degrees and go back down without 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.149
 touch the shoulders the ground so I'll you 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.770
 show in motion blow during 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.989
 the climb take off really flat from the ground 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.360
 and get off control your movement 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.309
 without touching the shoulders alone the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.079
 first common mistake not to do 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.729
 it's to draw annick alone during the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.080
 climb like this to avoid this 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.600
 movement there you must nagy is a 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.430
 apple between the chin and the water of your 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.619
 bust during the climb that you do not 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.380
 should not be affected so here I have a 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.030
 apple I do not touch there during the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.580
 climb and during the descent 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.650
 remember the weight of your head with 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.270
 your fingers agree a little bit like if you 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.189
 hold a bowling ball 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.770
 it will allow you to avoid tensions 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.689
 at the level of your neck the second 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.189
 common mistake in that moment it is 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.509
 to get out of the belly during the sale and 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.880
 like these we get out the belly so 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.549
 to avoid that moment god level of 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.140
 belly I advise you to enter the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.909
 navel to imagine they are 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.090
 sucked into the spine 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.060
 during the climb we go there then 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.070
 I inspire will I suffer during the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.009
 climb I enter the belly I enter the 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.320
 navel to the spine at 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.939
 dosage level the muscles of the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.409
 abdominal muscles rate years during 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.350
 I advise you to do series 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.540
 rather long ranging from 15 to 30 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.520
 repetition or even the most important being 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.179
 to feel a burning sensation on 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.420
 your abs 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.120
 once that feeling is felt 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.770
 board 30 to 45 seconds break and 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.989
 to chain like that two to four 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.610
 series for the most experienced one 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.290
 will see that it is also possible to 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.300
 work on a short series with 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.130
 more intense exercises to develop 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.810
 chocolate bars but we 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.280
 will do that in another video by then 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.300
 good at training I tell you to very 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.300
 quickly take care of yourself
