dressing<00:04:07.989> but<00:04:08.320> this<00:04:08.470> is<00:04:08.620> I<00:04:08.950> don't<00:04:09.940> know<00:04:10.120> it's

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
dressing but this is I don't know it's

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.069 
dressing but this is I don't know it's
almost<00:04:10.810> as<00:04:11.109> easy<00:04:11.260> as<00:04:11.500> that<00:04:11.530> and<00:04:12.100> it's<00:04:12.730> better

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
almost as easy as that and it's better

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.849 
almost as easy as that and it's better
in<00:04:14.079> my<00:04:14.260> opinion<00:04:14.560> so<00:04:15.390> try<00:04:16.390> it<00:04:16.419> out<00:04:16.570> okay<00:04:16.930> and

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
in my opinion so try it out okay and

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.680 
in my opinion so try it out okay and
then<00:04:18.609> the<00:04:18.700> salad<00:04:18.940> will<00:04:19.150> get<00:04:19.269> better<00:04:19.450> the

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
then the salad will get better the

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.440 
then the salad will get better the
longer<00:04:20.019> it<00:04:20.260> sits<00:04:20.470> because<00:04:20.829> the<00:04:21.270> pasta<00:04:22.270> will

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
longer it sits because the pasta will

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.140 
longer it sits because the pasta will
absorb<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:23.110> dressing<00:04:23.289> and<00:04:23.820> everything<00:04:24.820> it's
