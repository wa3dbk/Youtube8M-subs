00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:13.950
 the fourth opponent of alejandro falla 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:17.460
 is kanye cory or roger federer 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.110
 He wants to be king for the seventh time 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.050
 hall, six times he has been 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.740
 made the cup in the air 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.800
 stretch 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.530
 today, a victory would be necessary over it 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.970
 kanye co 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.500
 but that has already happened this year 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.600
 not so well worked out in Miami 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.080
 in the quarterfinals he lost to the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.270
 Japanese, meanwhile, a big one 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.250
 star in japan has become the first 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.280
 the Japanese came under the top ten 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.220
 Of course, that comes with a lot 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.320
 self-confidence we go to the hall and is 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.530
 yes, since a week ago 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.380
 beginning of tournament with Michael Chang his 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.500
 trainer traveled here 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.800
 prepare 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:04.859
 of course with michael chang and 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.920
 A lot of aggressiveness with me on the way 

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:10.049
 given for the lawn tournaments 2013 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.999
 Eighth finals this year in any case 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.460
 ever the semifinals 

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:17.869
 when the final he has the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.409
 defeat maestro today he lies back 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:24.209
 22 33 40 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:29.270
 that means first break possibility for the 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:32.369
 Swiss , that's her too 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.880
 Audience favorite for many 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.840
 years 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:43.670
 and you can tell by the facial expression 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:47.210
 technical cory not really satisfied 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.890
 Here is my nice camera setting 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.050
 great almost-wide quickly and 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.900
 nevertheless, it is enough in this moment 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.470
 Not 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.550
 Roger Federer leads 5 to 3 40 0 ​​three 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.680
 set balls 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.680
 and you try the trick schott but 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:11.429
 does japaner fight back again 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.429
 before the loss 40 15 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:29.430
 Oh, look again afterwards 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:29.430
 serve Federer second service 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:39.030
 already won and would win this year 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:42.100
 happy to give everyone for the seventh time 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:46.300
 looks good for the Swiss first 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:49.020
 set won 6 to 3 goes to this sentence 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.020
 Roger Federer 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:58.209
 2003 45 and 2006 in succession tournament winner 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:00.280
 was then a year paused in 2008 yet 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:05.470
 could win in hall and then 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:08.220
 last year the sixth cup with 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.220
 home took 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.590
 charge for kay risk 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.480
 second set first game 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:35.569
 too long because maybe the annoying 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:38.299
 by when you're playing against the number 4 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:42.769
 on the much loved lawn 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:45.560
 against the raven king not easy 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:50.049
 the audience had a great time 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.049
 weather sunshine not too hot and 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:04:01.849
 The story fights against the game loss 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:07.749
 the svs break for roger federer and the 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:07.749
 leadership 1 0 in the second sentence 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:19.810
 the trainer early off from a surcharge for 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.810
 Roger Federer 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:27.320
 at that time at this point 30 40 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.740
 lay back and equal to the re break 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:37.940
 everything was balanced again 1 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:41.080
 both in the second set he has the game 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.370
 maybe too loose 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.090
 underestimated in japan 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:50.330
 he never gives up , he must know 6 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:58.850
 both of you make your mark up to the end 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:05:01.750
 that means that was the first to 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.750
 6 to 4 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.949
 there's michael chang 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:25.229
 the audience celebrates the master at two 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:27.970
 matchballs and the world behind the net 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:29.409
 that meant the victory for the champion 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.960
 the Chancellor is not right yet 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:33.430
 believe 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.340
 technical korea is already in the middle 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:39.280
 and the maestro wanted to go further 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.550
 play different now understood he is 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.120
 in the final , willi weber is pleased 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:50.039
 open and meets alessandro case 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.039
 japan roger federer 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.210
 3
