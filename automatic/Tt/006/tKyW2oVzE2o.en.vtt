00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
beginning and then I'll explain it and

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.230 
beginning and then I'll explain it and
so<00:00:15.120> on<00:00:15.299> each<00:00:15.599> part<00:00:15.960> like<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:17.220> so<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.090> beginning

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
so on each part like so so the beginning

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:34.670 
so on each part like so so the beginning
you<00:00:18.570> have<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:19.789> populate<00:00:20.789> one<00:00:20.939> side

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.050 

and<00:00:35.680> then<00:00:35.980> you<00:00:36.160> do<00:00:36.280> that<00:00:36.310> again<00:00:36.430> and<00:00:36.820> the<00:00:36.880> base

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.060 
and then you do that again and the base

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.830 
and then you do that again and the base
comes<00:00:37.330> in<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:38.590> in<00:00:38.770> essence<00:00:39.130> it's<00:00:39.340> just<00:00:39.840> you

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
comes in but in essence it's just you

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:48.350 
comes in but in essence it's just you
play<00:00:41.050> the<00:00:41.200> top<00:00:41.410> three<00:00:41.650> strings<00:00:43.230> in<00:00:44.230> order<00:00:44.680> just

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.640 

continuously<00:00:49.360> however<00:00:49.989> you<00:00:50.140> move<00:00:50.260> the<00:00:50.440> root

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
continuously however you move the root

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.800 
continuously however you move the root
which<00:00:51.220> would<00:00:51.400> be<00:00:51.520> first<00:00:52.180> you<00:00:52.330> start<00:00:52.540> on<00:00:52.690> the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.810 
which would be first you start on the

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.540 
which would be first you start on the
second<00:00:53.200> fret<00:00:53.410> all<00:00:53.620> of<00:00:53.920> this<00:00:54.070> is<00:00:54.250> on<00:00:54.370> the<00:00:54.460> E

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
second fret all of this is on the E

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:23.900 
second fret all of this is on the E
string<00:00:54.580> that's<00:00:54.970> moving

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.340 

the<00:01:24.910> second<00:01:25.270> time<00:01:25.480> the<00:01:25.810> second<00:01:26.170> repetition

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
the second time the second repetition

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:37.440 
the second time the second repetition
the<00:01:26.710> whole<00:01:26.800> thing<00:01:27.010> it's<00:01:27.370> again<00:01:28.180> too

gives me a comfortable grip on it and

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.080 
gives me a comfortable grip on it and
plus<00:05:25.590> my<00:05:26.040> middle<00:05:26.370> finger<00:05:26.640> is<00:05:26.700> not<00:05:26.820> free

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
plus my middle finger is not free

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.400 
plus my middle finger is not free
because<00:05:27.930> the<00:05:28.650> next<00:05:28.920> part<00:05:29.100> is<00:05:29.340> this<00:05:30.330> so<00:05:30.960> your

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
because the next part is this so your

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.740 
because the next part is this so your
middle<00:05:32.220> finger<00:05:32.520> is<00:05:32.580> already<00:05:32.820> there<00:05:32.940> to<00:05:33.570> catch

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
middle finger is already there to catch

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.290 
middle finger is already there to catch
that<00:05:33.990> note<00:05:34.200> so<00:05:34.650> you<00:05:34.980> can<00:05:35.790> have<00:05:35.940> the<00:05:36.090> emitter

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
that note so you can have the emitter

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.390 
that note so you can have the emitter
finger<00:05:36.630> middle<00:05:37.080> finger<00:05:37.230> already<00:05:37.650> pressed<00:05:38.160> on

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
finger middle finger already pressed on

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.580 
finger middle finger already pressed on
the<00:05:38.610> fret<00:05:38.850> before<00:05:39.360> it<00:05:39.450> so<00:05:39.570> you<00:05:39.630> can<00:05:39.810> just<00:05:39.990> lift

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
the fret before it so you can just lift

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.900 
the fret before it so you can just lift
up<00:05:40.710> your<00:05:40.860> pinky<00:05:41.130> for<00:05:41.280> the<00:05:41.340> next<00:05:41.550> part<00:05:41.760> as

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
up your pinky for the next part as

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:53.860 
up your pinky for the next part as
you'll<00:05:42.090> see

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:09.450 

so<00:05:54.870> astronomy<00:05:55.320> is<00:05:55.410> very<00:05:55.590> important

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.129 

the<00:06:10.460> second<00:06:10.819> chord<00:06:11.030> is<00:06:11.120> exactly<00:06:11.569> the<00:06:11.749> same<00:06:11.960> as

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:12.139 
the second chord is exactly the same as

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:13.809 
the second chord is exactly the same as
the<00:06:12.379> first<00:06:12.560> one<00:06:12.680> except<00:06:13.279> like<00:06:13.430> I<00:06:13.520> told<00:06:13.669> you

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:13.819 
the first one except like I told you

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:17.499 
the first one except like I told you
you're<00:06:14.300> gonna<00:06:14.389> move<00:06:14.740> from<00:06:15.740> 9<00:06:16.069> to<00:06:16.490> 8<00:06:16.729> on<00:06:16.999> the<00:06:17.360> B

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509 
you're gonna move from 9 to 8 on the B

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:18.879 
you're gonna move from 9 to 8 on the B
string<00:06:17.569> so<00:06:17.810> that's<00:06:18.050> why<00:06:18.229> I<00:06:18.259> said<00:06:18.560> your<00:06:18.680> middle

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:18.889 
string so that's why I said your middle

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:20.860 
string so that's why I said your middle
finger<00:06:19.129> should<00:06:19.159> be<00:06:19.400> there<00:06:19.550> ok<00:06:20.389> and<00:06:20.599> then<00:06:20.689> the

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
finger should be there ok and then the

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.480 
finger should be there ok and then the
next<00:06:20.930> chord<00:06:21.319> after<00:06:21.409> that<00:06:21.710> is<00:06:21.919> just<00:06:22.189> a<00:06:22.279> minor

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
next chord after that is just a minor

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:34.029 
next chord after that is just a minor
chord<00:06:31.599> going<00:06:32.599> from<00:06:32.840> the<00:06:33.080> deep<00:06:33.289> from<00:06:33.830> the<00:06:33.860> 8th

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:34.039 
chord going from the deep from the 8th

00:06:34.039 --> 00:07:11.860 
chord going from the deep from the 8th
so<00:06:34.729> a<00:06:35.080> d<00:06:36.080> g/b<00:06:36.590> it'll<00:06:37.159> be<00:06:37.279> 7<00:06:38.139> 9

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:11.870 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:37.370 

again<00:07:12.870> you<00:07:13.050> meet<00:07:13.230> all<00:07:13.380> the<00:07:13.470> strings<00:07:36.380> I'm

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.380 
again you meet all the strings I'm

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.460 
again you meet all the strings I'm
afraid<00:07:37.650> this<00:07:37.740> is<00:07:37.860> gonna<00:07:38.010> get<00:07:38.190> too<00:07:38.310> long<00:07:38.490> so

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:39.470 
afraid this is gonna get too long so

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.470 
afraid this is gonna get too long so
