and you know we basically just few youth
at<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.180> Lions<00:01:00.510> yeah<00:01:00.750> yeah<00:01:01.200> you<00:01:01.440> know<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:02.039> I

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
at the Lions yeah yeah you know so I

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.450 
at the Lions yeah yeah you know so I
mean<00:01:02.969> as<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.270> said<00:01:03.420> before<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:04.220> pretty<00:01:05.220> much

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
mean as I said before it's pretty much

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.130 
mean as I said before it's pretty much
anything<00:01:05.789> is<00:01:06.000> possible<00:01:06.149> to<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.630> certain<00:01:07.020> degree

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
anything is possible to a certain degree

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.800 
anything is possible to a certain degree
I<00:01:08.690> mean<00:01:09.690> just<00:01:10.369> overall<00:01:11.369> speaking<00:01:11.819> what<00:01:12.569> we<00:01:12.690> can

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
I mean just overall speaking what we can

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.779 
I mean just overall speaking what we can
do<00:01:12.899> is<00:01:13.020> we<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.259> change<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.800> the<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
do is we can change the the the

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:16.820 
do is we can change the the the
character<00:01:15.300> of<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> delay<00:01:16.380> repeat<00:01:16.679> so

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
character of the of the delay repeat so

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.290 
character of the of the delay repeat so
we<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.340> know<00:01:17.459> filter<00:01:17.910> them<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.149> different

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
we can you know filter them in different

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.620 
we can you know filter them in different
ways

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
ways

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.529 
ways
EQ<00:01:19.080> them<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.350> different<00:01:19.470> ways<00:01:19.649> yeah<00:01:20.819> we<00:01:21.360> can

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
EQ them in different ways yeah we can

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.650 
EQ them in different ways yeah we can
add<00:01:21.720> some<00:01:22.160> some<00:01:23.160> kind<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.429> grit<00:01:23.670> or<00:01:23.970> drive<00:01:24.479> I

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
add some some kind of grit or drive I

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.850 
add some some kind of grit or drive I
don't<00:01:24.780> want<00:01:24.899> to<00:01:24.959> say<00:01:25.050> distortion<00:01:25.590> because

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
don't want to say distortion because

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.680 
don't want to say distortion because
it's<00:01:26.009> not<00:01:26.160> like<00:01:26.280> crazy<00:01:26.759> gnarly<00:01:27.179> but<00:01:27.300> it<00:01:27.450> it'll

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
it's not like crazy gnarly but it it'll

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.960 
it's not like crazy gnarly but it it'll
turn<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.080> little<00:01:28.289> more<00:01:28.470> crunchy<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.789> then

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
turn it a little more crunchy and then

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.150 
turn it a little more crunchy and then
we<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.240> add<00:01:30.390> different<00:01:30.420> types<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.319> modulation

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
we can add different types of modulation

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:48.230 
we can add different types of modulation
that<00:01:32.580> sounds<00:01:33.090> perfect<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.539> me

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.340 

yeah<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:51.310> then<00:01:52.299> we<00:01:52.479> have<00:01:52.689> the<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:54.250> vibrato<00:01:54.670> one

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
yeah so then we have the the vibrato one

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:23.040 
yeah so then we have the the vibrato one
which<00:01:56.350> sounds<00:01:56.740> like<00:01:57.060> this

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.360 

really<00:02:24.050> like<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.380> one<00:02:24.590> yeah<00:02:24.770> I<00:02:24.800> feel<00:02:25.069> a<00:02:25.190> nice

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
really like that one yeah I feel a nice

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.130 
really like that one yeah I feel a nice
symmetry<00:02:25.760> here<00:02:26.090> vibrato<00:02:26.450> is<00:02:26.660> this<00:02:26.810> kind<00:02:27.050> of

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
symmetry here vibrato is this kind of

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.250 
symmetry here vibrato is this kind of
you<00:02:27.440> know<00:02:27.560> fake<00:02:28.510> typical<00:02:29.510> kind<00:02:29.720> of<00:02:29.780> thing<00:02:29.840> but

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
you know fake typical kind of thing but

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.470 
you know fake typical kind of thing but
this<00:02:30.440> is<00:02:30.590> totally<00:02:31.520> different<00:02:31.700> it's<00:02:32.060> that's<00:02:32.360> a

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
this is totally different it's that's a

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.180 
this is totally different it's that's a
really<00:02:32.690> nice<00:02:32.840> vibe<00:02:33.050> to<00:02:33.260> it

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.800 

see<00:02:39.700> that's<00:02:39.910> nice<00:02:40.090> because<00:02:40.360> then<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:40.660> can

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
see that's nice because then you can

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.480 
see that's nice because then you can
decide<00:02:41.140> where<00:02:41.470> you<00:02:41.620> want<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:42.010> note<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.370> be

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
decide where you want the note to be
