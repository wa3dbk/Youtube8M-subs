cameras<00:01:57.329> at<00:01:57.479> CES<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.320> they're<00:01:58.439> all<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> lot

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
cameras at CES but they're all a lot

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.590 
cameras at CES but they're all a lot
more<00:01:59.040> expensive<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.820> I<00:01:59.850> thought<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.240> one<00:02:00.450> was

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
more expensive so I thought this one was

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.569 
more expensive so I thought this one was
the<00:02:00.750> most<00:02:00.930> notable<00:02:01.259> out<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.500> all<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.649> them<00:02:01.770> now

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
the most notable out of all of them now

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.819 
the most notable out of all of them now
I<00:02:02.610> also<00:02:02.820> wanted<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.149> talk<00:02:03.299> about<00:02:03.329> tvs<00:02:04.079> in

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.309 
particular the 105 inch 4k curved TVs
now<00:02:09.179> there's<00:02:09.420> an<00:02:09.599> interesting<00:02:09.750> one<00:02:10.170> from

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
now there's an interesting one from

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.780 
now there's an interesting one from
Samsung<00:02:10.560> at<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> press<00:02:11.220> conference<00:02:11.370> but<00:02:11.640> I'll

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
Samsung at the press conference but I'll

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.860 
Samsung at the press conference but I'll
talk<00:02:11.910> about<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.180> next

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
talk about that next

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.350

but<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.560> TV's<00:02:13.950> themselves<00:02:14.459> I<00:02:14.610> really<00:02:15.120> like

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
but the TV's themselves I really like

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.640 
but the TV's themselves I really like
where<00:02:15.690> they<00:02:15.840> sit<00:02:16.049> in<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.230> market<00:02:16.500> right<00:02:16.530> now

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
where they sit in the market right now

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.670 
where they sit in the market right now
so<00:02:17.220> instead<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.090> 3d<00:02:18.540> with<00:02:18.780> glasses<00:02:19.019> and<00:02:19.260> being

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
so instead of 3d with glasses and being

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.380 
so instead of 3d with glasses and being
a<00:02:19.769> little<00:02:19.920> gimmicky<00:02:20.280> it's<00:02:20.700> actually<00:02:20.849> a<00:02:21.060> curved

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
a little gimmicky it's actually a curved

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.880 
a little gimmicky it's actually a curved
display<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.140> if<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.440> said<00:02:22.620> at<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.709> right

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
display so if you said at the right

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.949 
display so if you said at the right
distance<00:02:23.099> it<00:02:23.670> kind<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.000> immerses<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.659> without

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
distance it kind of immerses you without

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.170 
distance it kind of immerses you without
having<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.379> whole<00:02:25.530> 3d<00:02:25.950> glasses<00:02:26.159> thing<00:02:26.879> going

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
having the whole 3d glasses thing going

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.509 
having the whole 3d glasses thing going
on<00:02:27.299> so<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:27.780> really<00:02:28.049> like<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.830> it's<00:02:29.340> also

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
on so I really like that and it's also

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.369 
on so I really like that and it's also
4k<00:02:30.000> which<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.420> awesome<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.900> it's<00:02:30.989> a<00:02:31.110> hundred

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
4k which is awesome and it's a hundred

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.869 
4k which is awesome and it's a hundred
and<00:02:31.560> five<00:02:31.680> inches<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.129> it's<00:02:32.280> pretty<00:02:32.579> dang<00:02:32.849> big

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
and five inches so it's pretty dang big

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.880 
and five inches so it's pretty dang big
taking<00:02:33.659> advantage<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.440> much<00:02:34.650> higher

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
taking advantage of the much higher

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.009 
taking advantage of the much higher
resolution<00:02:35.640> now<00:02:36.150> i'm<00:02:36.420> not<00:02:36.659> sure<00:02:36.810> where<00:02:36.930> the

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
resolution now i'm not sure where the

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.569 
resolution now i'm not sure where the
price<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.230> i<00:02:37.470> don't<00:02:37.620> think<00:02:37.680> any<00:02:38.099> prices<00:02:38.459> have

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579

been released about them but depending

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.500 
been released about them but depending
on<00:02:40.980> how<00:02:41.069> expensive<00:02:41.340> they<00:02:41.640> are<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:42.299> would<00:02:42.420> be

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
on how expensive they are that would be

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.030

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
off stage I actually think it's a

off stage I actually think it's a
marketing<00:03:04.200> technique<00:03:04.709> I<00:03:04.859> know<00:03:05.099> it's<00:03:05.549> crazy

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760

Samsung<00:03:12.569> has<00:03:12.720> gotten<00:03:12.959> so<00:03:13.170> much<00:03:13.349> publicity

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
Samsung has gotten so much publicity

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.770 
Samsung has gotten so much publicity
from<00:03:14.099> it<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.459> they<00:03:14.879> probably<00:03:15.090> wouldn't<00:03:15.629> have

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
from it that they probably wouldn't have

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.330 
from it that they probably wouldn't have
gotten<00:03:15.989> since<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.409> lot<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.590> other<00:03:16.769> people<00:03:16.889> are

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
gotten since a lot of other people are

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.390 
gotten since a lot of other people are
doing<00:03:17.459> those<00:03:17.819> big<00:03:18.030> 4k<00:03:18.419> TVs<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.470> I<00:03:19.739> think<00:03:20.040> that

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
doing those big 4k TVs so I think that

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.890 
doing those big 4k TVs so I think that
it<00:03:20.519> could<00:03:20.549> possibly<00:03:20.970> there's<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.599> slim<00:03:21.870> chance

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
it could possibly there's a slim chance

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.110 
it could possibly there's a slim chance
that<00:03:22.410> it's<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:23.040> marketing<00:03:23.340> technique<00:03:23.760> just<00:03:24.030> to

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
that it's a marketing technique just to

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.210 
that it's a marketing technique just to
get<00:03:24.239> more<00:03:24.389> publicity<00:03:24.569> call<00:03:25.560> me<00:03:25.680> crazy<00:03:25.769> argue
