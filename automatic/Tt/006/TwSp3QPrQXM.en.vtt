shows<00:02:23.180> it's<00:02:23.360> charging<00:02:24.490> so<00:02:25.490> then<00:02:26.090> you<00:02:26.180> would

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
shows it's charging so then you would

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.870 
shows it's charging so then you would
get<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.569> need<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.810> get<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.050> error<00:02:27.340> on<00:02:28.340> here

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
get the need to get the error on here

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.050 
get the need to get the error on here
now<00:02:29.709> one<00:02:30.709> of<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.890> solutions<00:02:31.400> that<00:02:31.490> you<00:02:31.610> can<00:02:31.850> do

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
now one of the solutions that you can do

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.080 
now one of the solutions that you can do
is<00:02:32.390> take<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.980> charger<00:02:34.430> on<00:02:34.550> your<00:02:34.730> iPhone

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
is take the charger on your iPhone

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.670 
is take the charger on your iPhone
realize<00:02:35.720> it's<00:02:35.900> shaped<00:02:36.170> differently<00:02:36.640> take<00:02:37.640> it

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
realize it's shaped differently take it

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.320 
realize it's shaped differently take it
unloosen<00:02:39.680> it<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:40.010> then<00:02:40.400> turn<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:40.790> around<00:02:40.880> and

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
unloosen it and then turn it around and

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:51.370 
unloosen it and then turn it around and
plug<00:02:42.230> it<00:02:42.350> in

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.160 

okay<00:02:52.070> because<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:52.580> can<00:02:52.730> it<00:02:53.240> can<00:02:53.570> fit<00:02:53.780> in<00:02:53.900> there

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
okay because it can it can fit in there

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.110 
okay because it can it can fit in there
and<00:02:54.410> that'll<00:02:55.040> only<00:02:55.160> work<00:02:55.400> with<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.670> iPhones

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
and that'll only work with the iPhones

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.840 
and that'll only work with the iPhones
because<00:02:57.160> that's<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.250> only<00:02:58.310> one<00:02:58.520> that<00:02:58.640> you<00:02:58.700> can

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
because that's the only one that you can

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.930 
because that's the only one that you can
you<00:02:59.090> can<00:02:59.210> switch<00:02:59.480> that's<00:02:59.930> one<00:03:00.230> that's<00:03:00.560> one

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
you can switch that's one that's one

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.840 
you can switch that's one that's one

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
turn it off of airplane mode and 90% of

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.470 
turn it off of airplane mode and 90% of
the<00:04:09.920> cases<00:04:10.040> I've<00:04:10.370> found<00:04:10.670> that<00:04:10.909> will<00:04:11.090> make<00:04:11.299> your

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
the cases I've found that will make your

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.649 
the cases I've found that will make your
device<00:04:11.599> start<00:04:12.019> working<00:04:12.349> again<00:04:13.450> okay

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:14.659 
device start working again okay

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:18.069 
device start working again okay
the<00:04:15.500> last<00:04:15.769> solution<00:04:16.400> is<00:04:17.150> to<00:04:17.359> actually<00:04:17.510> clean

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
the last solution is to actually clean

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.009 
the last solution is to actually clean
the<00:04:18.289> connector<00:04:18.560> and<00:04:19.419> there's<00:04:20.419> been<00:04:20.630> reports

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
the connector and there's been reports

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.090 
the connector and there's been reports
of<00:04:21.320> lint<00:04:21.680> being<00:04:22.639> stuck<00:04:23.030> in<00:04:23.330> the<00:04:24.199> iPhone<00:04:24.650> the

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
of lint being stuck in the iPhone the

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.550 
of lint being stuck in the iPhone the
connection<00:04:25.639> and<00:04:25.789> what<00:04:26.630> I'd<00:04:26.750> recommend<00:04:26.930> doing

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
connection and what I'd recommend doing

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.879 
connection and what I'd recommend doing
is<00:04:27.889> first<00:04:28.520> taking<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:28.850> battery<00:04:29.090> out<00:04:29.330> and<00:04:29.889> then

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
is first taking the battery out and then

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.279 
is first taking the battery out and then
you<00:04:31.039> can<00:04:31.130> get<00:04:31.280> like<00:04:31.430> a<00:04:31.460> little<00:04:32.330> you<00:04:33.080> can<00:04:33.199> get

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
you can get like a little you can get

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:37.090 
you can get like a little you can get
like<00:04:33.410> a<00:04:33.440> paperclip<00:04:34.570> you<00:04:35.570> can<00:04:35.720> get<00:04:35.900> a<00:04:36.100> attack

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
like a paperclip you can get a attack

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.189 
like a paperclip you can get a attack
you<00:04:37.910> know<00:04:37.970> something<00:04:38.300> with<00:04:38.360> a<00:04:38.419> pointy<00:04:39.020> edge

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
you know something with a pointy edge

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.529 
you know something with a pointy edge
and<00:04:39.590> you<00:04:39.650> can<00:04:39.770> clean<00:04:40.010> it<00:04:40.160> you<00:04:41.060> can<00:04:41.180> get<00:04:41.330> like<00:04:41.510> a

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
and you can clean it you can get like a

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.420 
and you can clean it you can get like a
little<00:04:41.930> lights<00:04:42.139> rubbing<00:04:42.680> alcohol<00:04:42.830> with<00:04:43.400> a

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
little lights rubbing alcohol with a

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.379 
little lights rubbing alcohol with a
brillo<00:04:43.729> pad<00:04:43.850> and<00:04:44.360> clean<00:04:44.539> that<00:04:44.720> connector<00:04:45.289> and

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
brillo pad and clean that connector and

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:47.980 
brillo pad and clean that connector and
see<00:04:47.389> if<00:04:47.510> that<00:04:47.660> will<00:04:47.750> work

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
see if that will work

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.650 
see if that will work
into<00:04:48.590> getting<00:04:48.820> the<00:04:49.820> connectivity<00:04:50.419> to<00:04:50.449> work

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
into getting the connectivity to work

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.439 
into getting the connectivity to work
again<00:04:50.960> all<00:04:51.919> right<00:04:52.070> so<00:04:52.310> that's<00:04:52.430> four<00:04:52.820> possible

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
again all right so that's four possible

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.420 
again all right so that's four possible
solutions<00:04:54.050> I'm<00:04:54.289> sure<00:04:54.949> that<00:04:55.130> one<00:04:55.250> of<00:04:55.340> those

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
solutions I'm sure that one of those

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.540 
solutions I'm sure that one of those
four<00:04:55.699> will<00:04:55.850> work<00:04:56.620> it<00:04:57.620> take<00:04:58.160> a<00:04:58.190> little<00:04:58.340> bit<00:04:58.490> of

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
four will work it take a little bit of

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.700 
four will work it take a little bit of
trial<00:04:58.789> and<00:04:58.940> error<00:04:59.169> probably<00:05:00.169> the<00:05:00.289> last<00:05:00.440> one<00:05:00.590> I

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
trial and error probably the last one I

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.290 
trial and error probably the last one I
would<00:05:00.830> choose<00:05:00.949> would<00:05:01.280> be<00:05:01.520> the<00:05:01.610> Bob<00:05:01.789> brand<00:05:02.150> new

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
would choose would be the Bob brand new

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.680 
would choose would be the Bob brand new
you<00:05:03.289> know<00:05:03.410> USB<00:05:04.340> charger<00:05:04.760> directly<00:05:05.180> from<00:05:05.270> Apple

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
you know USB charger directly from Apple

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.610 
you know USB charger directly from Apple
alright<00:05:06.560> thanks<00:05:07.099> for<00:05:07.160> watching
