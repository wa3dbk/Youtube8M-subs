00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.820
 surprise for all 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.460
 Italy was evidently the great 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.160
 favorite in this game played there in 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.470
 recife in brazil italy his breaststroke no

 play nothing will not win us a team that 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.340
 almost did not have the ball in the rival field 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.050
 costa rica came out to press uncomfortably 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.699
 a play that had not marked him 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.769
 penal and then center by the left 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.290
 he beat bryan ruiz to quilín and good 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.840
 headbutter they checked the ball had 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.489
 crossed the line 1 by 0 and that was enough 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.140
 to the Costa Rica team to win the 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.910
 match 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.440

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.370
 there in Pernambuco between the selections 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.360
 of italy and cost the three at home 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.250
 offers 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.450
 thank you very much, greetings 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.430
 affectionate until World Cup 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.930
 let's go to the number part of the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.510
 most outstanding party of this 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.130
 Friday evidently the italy ante 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.290
 costa rica these last ones take the 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.870
 match 1 for 0 these are the numbers 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.600
 general stats auction at the arch 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.000
 10 for costa rica for 8 by the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.910
 Italians a wide difference in 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.490
 possession of ball attention 43% by 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.380
 part of the Ticos and 57 percent by 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.600
 italy here what obviously marks 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.310
 the difference is consistency is like 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.530
 touch is like walking the ball into the 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.030
 playing field and despite that coast 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.800
 rich has the lowest percentage with 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.810
 respect to the Italians as he offered 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.220
 much more productivity in the field of 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.440
 game let's go to the players that more 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.910
 they went to the balotelli arch natural is 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.590
 a man of attack however not 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.540
 an important element appears in the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.729
 half court like pirlo that only 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.710
 kick once to the arch by coast 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.509
 rica- borges the one that played the most 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.369
 of the ticos three arrivals to the rival arch 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.210
 and from there it is revealed bolaños and ruiz 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.190
 among others 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.310
 let's go to the comparisons pirlo with 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.170
 borges 84% regarding the effectiveness of 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.270
 passes by borges by 91 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.260
 hundred on the part of pirlo here what 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.930
 draws attention 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.730
 is the poison that those passes have is 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.710
 evidently that they are correct in that 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.020
 sense finishes to the bow we had already 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.540
 seen 3 by borges and only 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.490
 1 on the part of pirlo so this is what 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.140
 that in the end makes a big difference 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.880
 more stability from costa rica 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.070
 in the half court much more stability 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.110
 the referents in this case borges with 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.610
 much more productivity and imagination 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.230
 with respect to what a 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.930
 man like pirlo the part of the 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.770
 Italy numbers against Costa Rica these 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.570
 last that take the victory 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.060
 thank you fellow comebacks for the 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.060
 good night television more atmosphere
