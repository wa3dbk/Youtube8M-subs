00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.540
 no no no 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:36.070
 to me then I do not run out of air 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.230
 inspirational initiative 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.940
 to be united is to be one thing 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.150
 that's why when I refer 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.210
 that is, it is a sports positivism not 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.500
 it's not a positivism with energy that's why 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.450
 and that's why I call him and tell him 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.000
 positivists on the sidelines if it's okay 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.950
 but that is not what I would like me 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.070
 convey in what is what they do to me 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.450
 feel the players when when 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.330
 in this approach to this project 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.980
 Well, they transmit to me no joy and 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.950
 convey my joy as he tried to give 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.080
 that's what I think and I think 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.850
 they have to have and I think not hesitate 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.360
 and I do not doubt that our players 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.690
 they have that positivity is like to 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.520
 to be able to undertake this new project with 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.200
 a with no illusions but those illusions 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.390
 you have to wake up also to 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.700
 amateur to the noble amateur to the 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.100
 noble hobby because he wants to make us not 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.320
 we are nothing without him without one without the other 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.350
 and also that here is not only two 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.170
 here is things 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.930
 of several here is a thing of many here is 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.729
 thing of a country not to say for not 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.680
 be abbreviating here is a country thing 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.960
 where you also get that you're 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.030
 looking at youth where they also 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.920
 is looking at the girls and where also 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.330
 is looking at the dga tonces we are 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.960
 where you are also seeing the 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.750
 veterans those that we bring you a 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.490
 history of enjoying our football 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.649
 that we bring a history of suffering with 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.920
 our football that we bring that history 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:06.069
 of that decency to consider us 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.500
 Salvadorans and with and with pride and on 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.869
 everything I think that with pride without losing 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.030
 intelligence because you can not is not good 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.620
 substitute the one of the other then I 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.569
 I think we Salvadorans are going to 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.390
 know how to support us let's go back to know 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.819
 be as united as possible in this 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.480
 case with our soccer and this this is 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.040
 such a beautiful thing so sensational that 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.280
 we have to give it a positive 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.069
 for our common progress as if like 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.170
 as a society with our progress as 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.170
 as a family for our progress as 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.890
 education panel for me for the ball 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.960
 has a 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.360
 a magical thing so important that I do not know 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.490
 describe it now 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.610
 to my wife as I usually tell the 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.810
 players to the companions encourage and 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.400
 let's put hope is in us 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.500
 Salvadorans are not absolutely 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.810
 no one else think of us 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.390
 Salvadorans that if we can, we have the 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.130
 well well useful hands we have our 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.290
 body in conditions and we have a 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.360
 mind that it has a lot of power and 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.250
 always believing in the little things between 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.780
 more aptly to the little things of God 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.850
 I think that Salvadorans 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.750
 we have a great future, everything is a matter 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.750
 of ourselves
