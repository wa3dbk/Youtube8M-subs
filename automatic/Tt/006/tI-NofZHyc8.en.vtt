00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:07.859
 the eight verses that transformed the mind 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.139
 with the determination to achieve the good 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.200
 supreme for the benefit of all beings 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.990
 more precious than a 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.600
 magic jewel making wishes 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.850
 I will learn to catch them and stimulate them. 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.980
 in the highest degree 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.449
 whenever you are in the company of 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.670
 other people 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.029
 I will learn to think about myself. 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.930
 as the most insignificant of them and 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.969
 with all due respect consider them supreme 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.360
 from the bottom of my heart 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.239
 in all my acts I will learn to 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.180
 examine my mind and whenever 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.460
 negative emotion when 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.780
 risk to myself and others 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.030
 I will firmly face it and avoid 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.850
 I will need the beings that have nature 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.390
 and those on whom they weigh 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.070
 strong negativities and sufferings as 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.510
 if I had found a treasure 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.210
 precious very difficult to find 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.580
 when others treat them as envy 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.670
 me or insult you 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.320
 I will learn to accept the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.090
 defeat and then they offered the victory 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.780
 when someone whom I helped with 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:28.200
 hope to hurt or hurt my person 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.810
 even for no reason I will learn to see this 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.890
 another person like this lens guide 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.939
 spiritual 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.710
 in short I will learn to offer everyone 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.200
 no exception 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.259
 all help and happiness by means of 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.710
 direct and indirect and to take over me 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.979
 in secrecy all the evils and suffering 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.799
 of those who were my mothers 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.079
 I will learn to keep these practices 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:58.290
 free from the stains of the eight concerns 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.899
 understanding of the world. 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.240
 being deceptive phenomena such as 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:08.380
 liberated from bondage bondage 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.940
 the eight worldly concerns like 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:15.340
 to be praised do not like to be criticized 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:19.330
 like being happy do not like being 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:23.319
 unhappy like winning dislike 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.940
 to miss being famous not to like 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:29.790
 be ignored 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.790
 his holiness the Dalai Lama
