00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hey people here is the thorsten again 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.240
 and in this video I want you guys 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.760
 give three tips as you better 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.700
 to photograph or we can do that better 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.590
 so to speak, that's what they are 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.880
 three things that helped me a lot 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.900
 and I just want you to 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.119
 give it to others 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.699
 and yes we start directly 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.519
 Tip 1 is from me that he is natural 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.380
 owe much and you at the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.570
 Just go for a walk yourself 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.869
 so limited that you say so 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.320
 today I use the 50th 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.290
 millimeter fixed focal length or I use 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.620
 just a plug-in flash plus through 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.320
 light show or things just so 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.030
 that she does not always use everything you do 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.360
 But you really have to be aware 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.920
 limited you just do that 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.629
 in lahde maybe a girlfriend or 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.629
 a friend and then you can 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.940
 with which you can try it out 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.399
 and therefore therefore sometime stands 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.350
 these special things so when he goes to 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.290
 example with a aufsteckblitz and 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.670
 by light screen all the time 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.790
 photographed or photographed more often 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.040
 then you know something about this with this one 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.140
 equipment is possible and then you know 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.790
 also in which situation yes that 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.560
 used or maybe something 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.240
 other 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.490
 and yes it is really important that 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.439
 She took a lot of pictures and then 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.540
 synonymous as I said not always uses everything 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:29.220
 what you have but you really times 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.009
 limited and consciously learns things 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.479
 really so what does this know 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.159
 individual equipment really matters 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.450
 do 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.360
 I did that in the beginning too 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.979
 and that really helped me a lot 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.840
 and then you'll be okay for sometime 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.370
 this special situation the me now 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.390
 that and that and then 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.030
 because exactly what I mean with it 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.970
 where can the borders of 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.400
 this equipment or even at 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.810
 aufsteckblitz for example the 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.080
 performance limits in certain situations 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.520
 and so on that is definitely 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.700
 one of the most important tips of mine and 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.900
 then I would recommend you 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.610
 So always in the camera 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.020
 picture section already to choose so 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.490
 while photographing the 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.340
 picture section to choose 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.900
 that means here does not simply express 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.460
 and then go into lightroom or afterwards 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.920
 photoshop and then choose the 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.830
 bildausschnitt as you want but 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.150
 you look really intense times 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.430
 the seeker and looks so that he 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.960
 really really that 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.240
 Get it as you want 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.220
 that you are closer targeted or 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.160
 Zoom in closer or go further 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.380
 because you want that and so on and so on 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.360
 So let's go without it 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.760
 much more will change the excerpt later 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.480
 it just has to be 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.770
 Taking pictures is also with me 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.930
 it does not always work 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.760
 just at some shootings or something 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.950
 but I just want to say it this way 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.600
 at 90 to 95 percent of the pictures 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.000
 So I always try to do it that way 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.980
 but I think at 95 percent of the pictures 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.750
 I also succeed in the picture section 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.940
 possible to choose as I want 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.110
 and this is, of course, on the one hand and 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.420
 a time saver 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.830
 if you look at it like that in the 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.950
 Of course, post-processing is available 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.220
 no longer the work still all about 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.230
 to trim and so on, but yes 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.940
 that in any case also a giant 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.250
 because it does not learn by doing so 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.900
 you also take all the stuff with him 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.290
 image design and composition 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.799
 so on and so on good then as well 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.450
 third tip if you have an analogue 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.650
 camera have for example in analog 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.650
 SLR camera photographed 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.799
 Really with the laundry you have yes 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.560
 yet kin somehow this one 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.730
 Camera still have and there I want you 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.230
 really recommend it too 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.390
 take pictures if you have no 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.290
 display and you have only if we 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:59.019
 in normal small ones have 36 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.049
 Pictures you can do on it and 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.810
 These movies cost in the drugstore or 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.909
 so only a few euros that means you 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.489
 can buy without problems and then 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:11.739
 really busy with it 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:16.329
 the exposure was learned 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:18.989
 also know better and also learns it 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.510
 really use the things targeted 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.449
 if he has no analog camera now 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.580
 then maybe you can open up 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:32.139
 the flea market or something one get the 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:34.090
 are really quite cheap there and if 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.800
 you do not want that then you can 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.580
 just turn off the display 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:42.039
 your camera or indeed to so 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.750
 Cover and then open up 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:45.760
 Limit 36 ​​pictures 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.590
 Of course that will not always be everything 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.659
 be one hundred percent straight at the beginning 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.990
 but I think that's fun too 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:54.820
 So this is also the limit 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.250
 just try and remember 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.220
 okay I get that synonymous with no display 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.050
 or I now realize now 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.000
 such a shutter time so and so 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.270
 and anyway so and so and then I know 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.070
 how the whole thing will look like and how often 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.650
 he does that the better you will be there 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:15.010
 I also have that as with 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.300
 made analog cameras but that is 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.020
 with the digital one too 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.240
 possibility 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.710
 and I would simply block 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.940
 received it just try it out 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.789
 You have nothing to lose you 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.650
 can only learn and I guess 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:27.490
 like you will definitely get something out of it 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.370
 learn 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.460
 he can not do that well 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.630
 now three tips and me 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.849
 have a few more but the video 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.530
 has been too long so if you have something like that 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:39.910
 like it then give my thumb after 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.410
 above and write me your feedback 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.120

 because then I will be even more 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.889
 such tips given what I started 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.729
 helped to get better and better 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:54.250
 also to make better pictures 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:55.930

 other such tips and others 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:06.819
 videos on the topics photography and 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:09.220
 image editing and here I have you 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:10.630
 also two videos linked there can 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.710
 Let's see if there's something for you 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:17.110
 otherwise i really hope that 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.340
 I continue to write that helps 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.630
 me also like some comments if 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.729
 you've tried something and what 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.259
 getting out shows me too 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:25.120
 just pictures he has made 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:25.569
 and so on we can do everything 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.569
 do
