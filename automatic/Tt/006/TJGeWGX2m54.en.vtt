which<00:05:45.390> one<00:05:45.600> I<00:05:45.630> like<00:05:45.840> better<00:05:46.050> series<00:05:46.500> two<00:05:46.680> or

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
which one I like better series two or

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.430 
which one I like better series two or
series<00:05:47.160> three<00:05:47.370> because<00:05:47.700> honestly<00:05:48.120> arm

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
series three because honestly arm

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.160 
series three because honestly arm
I<00:05:50.030> guess<00:05:51.030> series<00:05:51.390> three<00:05:51.660> is<00:05:51.720> better<00:05:51.930> because

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
I guess series three is better because

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.070 
I guess series three is better because
like<00:05:53.010> series<00:05:53.490> two<00:05:53.790> you<00:05:54.330> get<00:05:54.480> to<00:05:54.630> go<00:05:54.750> back<00:05:54.900> in

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
like series two you get to go back in

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.400 
like series two you get to go back in
the<00:05:55.200> ground<00:05:55.940> but<00:05:56.940> that's<00:05:57.390> different<00:05:58.140> though

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
the ground but that's different though

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.900 
the ground but that's different though
because<00:05:58.440> for<00:05:58.860> series<00:05:59.220> two<00:05:59.430> you<00:05:59.550> get<00:05:59.700> to<00:05:59.790> do<00:05:59.880> a

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
because for series two you get to do a

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.580 
because for series two you get to do a
belly<00:06:00.150> flop<00:06:00.330> and<00:06:00.720> then<00:06:00.930> go<00:06:01.140> back<00:06:01.320> in<00:06:01.500> the

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
belly flop and then go back in the

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:02.780 
belly flop and then go back in the
ground<00:06:01.770> unharmed

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
ground unharmed

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.580 
ground unharmed
this<00:06:03.120> one<00:06:03.480> you<00:06:03.690> keep<00:06:03.900> going<00:06:04.170> back<00:06:04.320> in<00:06:04.500> the

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
this one you keep going back in the

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.800 
this one you keep going back in the
ground<00:06:04.830> for<00:06:05.100> a<00:06:05.160> certain<00:06:05.460> period<00:06:05.640> of<00:06:05.790> time<00:06:06.120> but

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
ground for a certain period of time but

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.900 
ground for a certain period of time but
it's<00:06:06.960> a<00:06:07.050> little<00:06:07.260> hectic<00:06:07.950> because<00:06:08.520> you're

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
it's a little hectic because you're

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.000 
it's a little hectic because you're
moving<00:06:09.060> around<00:06:09.390> so<00:06:09.720> fast<00:06:09.990> so<00:06:10.620> I<00:06:10.650> don't<00:06:10.890> know
