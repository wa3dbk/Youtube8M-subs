00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 That's how I became and welcome to everything 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.540
 I do not even know if I'll get better 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.460
 but it's getting better because of it 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.099
 helps you the rest I have yesterday 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.230
 played and played favorably in 242 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.490
 I did two out of two games 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.590
 still have a little break on it 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.699
 in these branches, yes, those games 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.090
 were already after the first minute 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.740
 decided why because people because 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.539
 it is not for him in the near future 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.439
 good invesco initial hand and the 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.820
 people have died 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.830
 and then I thought I'll do it 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.570
 a little video to show you 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.070
 which you position yourself correctly below 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.399
 if the enemy can do you in both 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.160
 back 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.629
 I am now the pop a friend of mine 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.670
 the 293 also called coal in reallife 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.899
 is like a bit the pace sick 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.090
 and I'll show you shortly 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.039
 why not face some 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.110
 Libya happens and then I have her 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.110
 the first point is this dish 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.109
 account can just look like us 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.489
 have seen what and there are also 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.140
 other ways the old flashed 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.850
 Now in the event you can also here in 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.640
 the trend was constantly overshadowed there 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.189
 that is why this is never here 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.200
 So if you are already in the shrubbery 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.729
 wanted to stand here then you have now 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.140
 two options either the certain 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.299
 are more left because it will be here 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.740
 always this edge targeted because the thing 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.570
 if you already have you down here 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.659
 which from above vision something like one 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.650
 Wall and made first theme constantly 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.850
 I know that again and again 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.380
 or he just stands down here 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.360
 but now you have every problem 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.000
 you see, the world is not seeing 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.110
 or institutions, she is one 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.369
 a little later that the opponent comes 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.320
 one here is still so a 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.670
 bit black area but white 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.079
 the enemy does not mean that I am here 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.200
 but one always assumes that 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.030
 One here is the best option 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.680
 it still stands here to stand like that and 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.540
 that someone is what if I have to 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.640
 do not see me and that I am daily 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.469
 down so that here one of her and 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.250
 then here it is just down here 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.250
 just as deadly 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.810
 so are you there I'm okay so 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.480
 be here now this is yes 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.840
 important is never here so central 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.620
 because my brother 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.360
 that is exactly what can happen naturally 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.739
 not even mentally and with blitzkrieg 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.170
 possible it could be that there in the lux 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.900
 cinema come sarasin treschow what i 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.640
 even if the show is standing inside 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.739
 wanted to go and assume that 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.580
 she has not become is always here 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.140
 on the side 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.459
 nobody will really assume it 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.519
 that 's here because it's one 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.750
 typical loop error diamond error 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.880
 challenger feather partially that the 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.900
 people are standing here 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.450
 if you are still unsure 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.239
 Feels pretty easy in this 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.500
 The opponent should be from above 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.690
 you can come down to her directly 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.100
 opponent should not come up to the valley 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.569
 says said or 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.019
 The rookie is already wrong here 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:09.100
 another typical mistake has gone 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:11.260
 was this the banana so another 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.310
 mistake is it right up here too 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.920
 stand and pray because lightning can 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.400
 make one blind or all the same cc 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.840
 come chor one that I now in 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.959
 such a situation and I would be 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.340
 probably so now the the 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.200
 possibilities to prevent something like that 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.420
 First of all, I could be right here at the 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.049
 page are really maximum and and 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.430
 when it comes running towards me 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.910
 then please keep running this way 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.230
 here yes because everyone remember that 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.880
 if someone correct that the plaintiff 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.530
 but when you get out of here , it's high 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.230
 now have two break options 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.940
 You can either go up here 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.380
 in that or you can run across and 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.239
 nobody sees it then because the countries 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.859
 no one has a vision on me the other 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.720
 possibility would be if that already 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:04:00.780
 Energy decided I was running 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:05.290
 here because conti times in position 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.690
 You know where you can barely 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.799
 any is coming at this time 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.940
 I just have to stand right here and 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.889
 you see so far has me 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.010
 not reached 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:15.200
 I'm sure I think so 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.310
 i can reach him he is not 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.720
 is not but I will not do 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.639
 In any case, here are this 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.010
 is always good when you are afraid 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.370
 that the enemy before me is here then yes 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.410
 I ask that of you here is to go there 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.410
 then you run around here so once outside 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.669
 so and then to describe the 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.830
 adversary will not be one hundred percent 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.050
 see it unless he's in here and 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.310
 already has an award but look at that 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.560
 are just the possibility if we are you 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.820
 Especially in Bates can protect 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.470
 in the bistro or so of course 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.240
 you can also put in place 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.100
 but when it comes purely to the positions 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.990
 as I said this place in the complete 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.000
 forget this place completely here 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.919
 forget and this constant completely 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.570
 forgot so that was it so far from 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.060
 I hope not possible with it 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.360
 do not help that you live through 1 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.770
 going 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.770
 and then heralded
