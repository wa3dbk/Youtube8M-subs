probably<00:01:26.909> not<00:01:27.000> good<00:01:27.150> for<00:01:27.180> your<00:01:27.390> skin<00:01:27.630> because

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
probably not good for your skin because

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.300 
probably not good for your skin because
it's<00:01:27.900> still<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.259> there<00:01:28.409> but<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.040> probably

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
it's still on there but it probably

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.380 
it's still on there but it probably
won't<00:01:29.549> cause<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.850> breakouts<00:01:30.180> if<00:01:30.270> you've

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
won't cause you breakouts if you've

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.609 
won't cause you breakouts if you've
never<00:01:30.540> had<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> break<00:01:30.960> out<00:01:31.049> but<00:01:31.229> if<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.470> are

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
never had a break out but if you are

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
acne prone I can say 99.99% of time it

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.160 
acne prone I can say 99.99% of time it
will<00:01:35.850> break<00:01:36.060> people<00:01:36.450> out<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.869> may<00:01:36.990> not

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
will break people out and you may not

naturally slough off you guys know that

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.990 
naturally slough off you guys know that
we<00:02:04.380> have<00:02:04.530> different<00:02:04.799> layers<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.430> skins<00:02:05.729> do

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
we have different layers of the skins do

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.429 
we have different layers of the skins do
the<00:02:06.119> seven<00:02:06.450> layer<00:02:06.600> skin<00:02:06.869> dance

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
the seven layer skin dance

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.340 
the seven layer skin dance
seven<00:02:08.220> different<00:02:08.459> layers<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.789> skin

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
seven different layers of the skin

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.930 
seven different layers of the skin
and<00:02:09.440> those<00:02:09.710> are<00:02:09.830> constantly<00:02:10.370> renewing<00:02:10.700> and

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
and those are constantly renewing and

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.820 
and those are constantly renewing and
the<00:02:11.000> top<00:02:11.240> one<00:02:11.540> is<00:02:11.720> always<00:02:12.140> coming<00:02:12.440> off<00:02:12.650> and

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
the top one is always coming off and

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.860 
the top one is always coming off and
that<00:02:12.950> happens<00:02:13.310> naturally<00:02:13.550> of<00:02:14.330> course<00:02:14.630> if<00:02:14.780> you

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
that happens naturally of course if you

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.870 
that happens naturally of course if you
take<00:02:15.050> an<00:02:15.230> exploit<00:02:15.710> or<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.010> can<00:02:16.160> exfoliate<00:02:16.370> two

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
take an exploit or you can exfoliate two

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.970 
take an exploit or you can exfoliate two
to<00:02:17.060> three<00:02:17.300> layers<00:02:17.540> down<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.710> will<00:02:18.830> speed

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
to three layers down and that will speed

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.490 
to three layers down and that will speed
up<00:02:19.220> that<00:02:19.370> process<00:02:19.840> but<00:02:20.840> if<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.020> just<00:02:21.200> didn't

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
up that process but if you just didn't

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.470 
up that process but if you just didn't
touch<00:02:21.620> your<00:02:21.740> skin<00:02:21.980> naturally<00:02:22.460> it<00:02:22.880> exfoliates

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
touch your skin naturally it exfoliates

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.970 
touch your skin naturally it exfoliates
a<00:02:23.540> little<00:02:23.720> bit<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:24.320> what<00:02:24.440> happens<00:02:24.800> we<00:02:24.950> have

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
a little bit so what happens we have

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.980 
a little bit so what happens we have
this<00:02:25.160> foundation<00:02:25.340> on<00:02:25.780> obviously<00:02:26.780> that's

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
this foundation on obviously that's

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.750 
this foundation on obviously that's
stopping<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.650> skin<00:02:28.040> from<00:02:28.280> doing<00:02:28.580> what<00:02:28.730> it

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
stopping the skin from doing what it

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.820 
stopping the skin from doing what it
does<00:02:28.850> naturally<00:02:29.150> it's<00:02:29.990> stopping<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.590> skin

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
does naturally it's stopping the skin

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.350 
does naturally it's stopping the skin
from<00:02:30.980> taking<00:02:31.280> off<00:02:31.400> that<00:02:31.430> top<00:02:31.790> layer<00:02:31.970> because

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
from taking off that top layer because

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.820 
from taking off that top layer because
we<00:02:32.510> have<00:02:32.630> this<00:02:32.720> foundation<00:02:33.260> that's<00:02:33.410> keeping

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
we have this foundation that's keeping

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.760 
we have this foundation that's keeping
it<00:02:33.920> on<00:02:34.070> so<00:02:34.760> what<00:02:35.180> happens<00:02:35.570> is<00:02:35.720> that<00:02:35.870> as<00:02:36.110> we<00:02:36.590> know

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
it on so what happens is that as we know

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.560 
it on so what happens is that as we know
there's<00:02:37.100> different<00:02:37.430> parts<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.760> a<00:02:37.880> pimple<00:02:38.300> the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
there's different parts to a pimple the

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.530 
there's different parts to a pimple the
pimple<00:02:38.870> is<00:02:38.930> caused<00:02:39.170> by<00:02:39.350> oil<00:02:39.530> bacteria

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
pimple is caused by oil bacteria

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.330 
pimple is caused by oil bacteria
inflammation<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.810> clog<00:02:42.110> so<00:02:42.800> what<00:02:42.980> happens

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
inflammation and a clog so what happens

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.950 
inflammation and a clog so what happens
is<00:02:43.430> that<00:02:43.460> when<00:02:43.700> this<00:02:43.820> foundation<00:02:44.390> is<00:02:44.510> stopping

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
is that when this foundation is stopping

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.110 
is that when this foundation is stopping
the<00:02:45.050> skin<00:02:45.320> from<00:02:45.470> slipping<00:02:45.830> off<00:02:45.980> we're<00:02:46.880> doing

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
the skin from slipping off we're doing

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
the skin from slipping off we're doing
this<00:02:47.210> eight<00:02:47.480> hours<00:02:47.810> a<00:02:47.840> night

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
this eight hours a night

this eight hours a night
all<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.920> sudden<00:02:49.130> that<00:02:49.490> causes<00:02:50.030> a<00:02:50.180> clog<00:02:50.570> that

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
all the sudden that causes a clog that

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.560 
all the sudden that causes a clog that
clog<00:02:51.710> and<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.100> top<00:02:52.310> of<00:02:52.490> the<00:02:52.610> pimple<00:02:53.000> if<00:02:53.390> you

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
clog and the top of the pimple if you

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.730 
clog and the top of the pimple if you
have<00:02:53.660> blackheads<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.320> you<00:02:54.380> sleep<00:02:54.590> in<00:02:54.710> your

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
makeup this may be why so you think

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.080 
makeup this may be why so you think
about<00:02:57.410> it<00:02:57.620> that's<00:02:58.370> one<00:02:58.580> of<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.730> main<00:02:58.910> factors

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
about it that's one of the main factors

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.670 
about it that's one of the main factors
for<00:02:59.450> causing<00:02:59.780> acne<00:03:00.080> so<00:03:00.200> what<00:03:00.320> happens

for causing acne so what happens

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.730 
for causing acne so what happens

pimples all over it now does it I don't

pimples all over it now does it I don't
think<00:03:17.750> so<00:03:17.900> I<00:03:17.990> think<00:03:18.050> it's<00:03:18.260> all<00:03:18.410> inflamed<00:03:18.800> and

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
think so I think it's all inflamed and

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.310 
think so I think it's all inflamed and
it<00:03:19.100> really<00:03:19.430> causes<00:03:19.940> our<00:03:20.600> skin<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:21.050> kind<00:03:21.230> of

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
it really causes our skin to kind of

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.900 
it really causes our skin to kind of
break<00:03:21.530> out<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:21.830> freak<00:03:22.010> out<00:03:22.160> after<00:03:22.550> a<00:03:22.580> week<00:03:22.760> or

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
break out and freak out after a week or

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.220 
break out and freak out after a week or
two<00:03:23.060> even<00:03:23.270> if<00:03:23.360> you<00:03:23.510> remove<00:03:23.630> it<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:23.930> next<00:03:24.110> day

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
two even if you remove it the next day

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.560 
two even if you remove it the next day
so<00:03:25.010> that<00:03:25.460> is<00:03:25.640> why<00:03:25.850> you<00:03:25.880> need<00:03:26.180> to<00:03:26.270> remove<00:03:26.450> your

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
so that is why you need to remove your

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.360 
so that is why you need to remove your
makeup<00:03:26.780> because<00:03:27.230> it<00:03:27.350> stops<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.920> skin<00:03:28.160> from

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
makeup because it stops the skin from

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.220 
makeup because it stops the skin from
doing<00:03:28.670> what<00:03:28.850> it<00:03:28.940> does<00:03:28.970> naturally<00:03:29.450> and<00:03:29.900> also<00:03:29.990> if

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
doing what it does naturally and also if

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.390 
doing what it does naturally and also if
there's<00:03:30.410> chemicals<00:03:30.950> in<00:03:31.040> your<00:03:31.070> foundation

there back through your skin they can
soak<00:03:33.440> into<00:03:33.590> your<00:03:33.650> skin<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:33.980> cause<00:03:34.130> breakouts

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 
soak into your skin and cause breakouts

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.060 
soak into your skin and cause breakouts
you<00:03:34.700> know<00:03:34.850> but<00:03:35.750> overall<00:03:36.020> it<00:03:36.350> stops<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.860> skin

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
you know but overall it stops the skin

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.740 
you know but overall it stops the skin
from<00:03:37.190> exploiting<00:03:37.520> and<00:03:37.910> it<00:03:37.970> creates<00:03:38.330> a<00:03:38.450> plug

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
from exploiting and it creates a plug

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.870 
from exploiting and it creates a plug
which<00:03:39.320> turns<00:03:39.620> into<00:03:39.770> bacteria<00:03:40.340> which<00:03:40.580> turns

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
which turns into bacteria which turns

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.280 
which turns into bacteria which turns
into<00:03:41.000> a<00:03:41.090> pimple<00:03:41.450> which<00:03:41.780> is<00:03:41.900> why<00:03:41.990> you<00:03:42.050> should

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
into a pimple which is why you should

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.050 
into a pimple which is why you should
never<00:03:42.410> sleep<00:03:42.680> in<00:03:42.770> your<00:03:42.890> makeup<00:03:43.130> and<00:03:43.670> that's
