so<00:00:58.909> even<00:00:59.329> if<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.510> error<00:00:59.659> does<00:00:59.839> not<00:01:00.050> fix<00:01:00.559> for

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.939 
so even if the error does not fix for
you<00:01:01.010> it's<00:01:01.339> worth<00:01:01.820> giving<00:01:02.149> the<00:01:02.809> video<00:01:03.050> a<00:01:03.109> try<00:01:03.440> so

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
in this case meaning the first one will

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.120 
in this case meaning the first one will
not<00:01:28.670> let<00:01:28.880> you<00:01:28.970> log<00:01:29.150> in<00:01:29.300> anymore<00:01:29.720> as<00:01:29.900> you<00:01:30.890> have

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
not let you log in anymore as you have

now<00:01:31.700> opened<00:01:32.000> up<00:01:32.360> a<00:01:32.510> new<00:01:32.720> session<00:01:33.080> and<00:01:33.230> you<00:01:33.320> can

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
now opened up a new session and you can

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.090 
now opened up a new session and you can
only<00:01:33.530> have<00:01:33.740> one<00:01:33.910> session<00:01:34.910> at<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.390> same<00:01:35.540> time

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100

the most recent one and the other one
still<00:02:02.170> won't<00:02:02.289> work<00:02:02.500> so<00:02:04.860> just<00:02:05.860> reopen<00:02:06.340> in<00:02:06.429> your

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
still won't work so just reopen in your

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.160 
still won't work so just reopen in your
minecraft<00:02:06.970> session<00:02:07.329> like<00:02:07.479> that<00:02:07.659> should<00:02:07.899> work

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
minecraft session like that should work

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.089 
minecraft session like that should work
if<00:02:08.649> that<00:02:09.009> does<00:02:09.310> not<00:02:09.340> work<00:02:10.050> then<00:02:11.050> someone<00:02:11.950> else

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
if that does not work then someone else

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.680 
if that does not work then someone else
could<00:02:12.370> still<00:02:12.580> be<00:02:12.700> signing<00:02:13.030> into<00:02:13.150> your<00:02:13.390> account

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
could still be signing into your account

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.870 
could still be signing into your account
so<00:02:13.989> you<00:02:14.500> should<00:02:14.800> try<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.130> do<00:02:15.250> is<00:02:15.459> just<00:02:15.489> change

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
so you should try and do is just change

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.780
