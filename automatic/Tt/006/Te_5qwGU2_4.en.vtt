I'm<00:06:51.530> good<00:06:51.860> at<00:06:51.950> video<00:06:52.040> games<00:06:52.190> cuz<00:06:52.610> i<00:06:52.730> played

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 
I'm good at video games cuz i played

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.700 
I'm good at video games cuz i played
public<00:06:53.540> that<00:06:53.690> kind<00:06:53.870> of<00:06:53.930> sounds<00:06:54.200> ridiculous

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710 
public that kind of sounds ridiculous

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.230 
public that kind of sounds ridiculous
but<00:06:54.889> if<00:06:55.370> you're<00:06:55.520> looking<00:06:55.790> at<00:06:55.880> it<00:06:56.000> from<00:06:56.090> a

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 
but if you're looking at it from a

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.000 
but if you're looking at it from a
public<00:06:56.690> stand<00:06:56.840> points<00:06:57.320> if<00:06:57.440> you<00:06:57.590> do<00:06:57.770> really

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.010 
public stand points if you do really

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.310 
public stand points if you do really
really<00:06:58.340> good<00:06:58.490> in<00:06:58.610> pubs<00:06:58.850> i<00:06:59.240> mean<00:06:59.780> you<00:06:59.960> could<00:07:00.139> be

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:00.320 
really good in pubs i mean you could be

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.659 
really good in pubs i mean you could be
i<00:07:00.350> think<00:07:00.710> there's<00:07:00.980> difference<00:07:01.280> between<00:07:01.460> being

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:01.669 
i think there's difference between being

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:04.540 
i think there's difference between being
a<00:07:01.820> good<00:07:02.060> pop<00:07:02.419> star<00:07:02.720> and<00:07:02.960> being<00:07:03.560> you<00:07:03.680> know<00:07:03.800> good

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:04.550 
a good pop star and being you know good

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.120 
a good pop star and being you know good
at<00:07:04.970> the<00:07:05.419> game<00:07:05.450> per<00:07:06.050> se<00:07:06.290> that<00:07:06.560> makes<00:07:06.889> any<00:07:07.010> sense

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.130 
at the game per se that makes any sense

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.210 
at the game per se that makes any sense
so<00:07:07.810> my<00:07:08.810> two<00:07:08.870> cents<00:07:09.230> on<00:07:09.320> this<00:07:09.500> sort<00:07:09.740> of<00:07:09.800> wrapping

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:10.220 
so my two cents on this sort of wrapping

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.850 
so my two cents on this sort of wrapping
it<00:07:10.310> up<00:07:10.370> here<00:07:10.610> is<00:07:10.820> that<00:07:11.139> just<00:07:12.139> have<00:07:12.350> fun<00:07:12.680> with<00:07:12.710> it
