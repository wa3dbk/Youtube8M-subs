it's a nice of easy environment to care
for<00:01:18.690> as<00:01:18.900> well<00:01:19.080> we've<00:01:19.320> got<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.530> smaller<00:01:20.490> space

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
for as well we've got a smaller space

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.850 
for as well we've got a smaller space
which<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.390> means<00:01:21.659> it's<00:01:21.870> easy<00:01:22.050> to<00:01:22.320> plan<00:01:22.680> your

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
which it means it's easy to plan your

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.510 
which it means it's easy to plan your
crop<00:01:23.070> rotation<00:01:23.760> and<00:01:24.480> also<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.710> reach<00:01:25.950> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
crop rotation and also you can reach the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.280 
crop rotation and also you can reach the
soil<00:01:26.760> from<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.240> paths<00:01:27.510> you<00:01:27.900> haven't<00:01:28.200> actually

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
soil from the paths you haven't actually

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.230 
soil from the paths you haven't actually
got<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.620> walk<00:01:28.830> on<00:01:29.010> the<00:01:29.159> soil<00:01:29.430> which<00:01:29.850> means<00:01:30.120> that

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
got to walk on the soil which means that

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.870 
got to walk on the soil which means that
you're<00:01:30.330> not<00:01:30.450> compacting<00:01:31.110> them<00:01:31.340> but<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.430> area

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
you're not compacting them but this area

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.080 
you're not compacting them but this area
here<00:01:33.090> needs<00:01:33.290> preparing<00:01:34.290> as<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.800> see<00:01:35.090> it's

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
here needs preparing as you can see it's

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.420 
here needs preparing as you can see it's
been<00:01:36.270> left<00:01:36.479> fallow<00:01:36.780> over<00:01:37.170> winter<00:01:37.620> had<00:01:38.159> some

been left fallow over winter had some

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.600 
been left fallow over winter had some
nur<00:01:38.790> added<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.680> and<00:01:40.680> we've<00:01:40.830> also<00:01:40.979> done<00:01:41.370> a

nur added to it and we've also done a
little<00:01:41.790> soil<00:01:42.090> test<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.930> see<00:01:43.110> if<00:01:43.200> we

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
little soil test on it to see if we

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.219 
little soil test on it to see if we
needed<00:01:43.620> to<00:01:43.770> add<00:01:43.920> any<00:01:44.159> fertilizers<00:01:45.000> now<00:01:45.960> as<00:01:46.110> it

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
needed to add any fertilizers now as it

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.140 
needed to add any fertilizers now as it
happens<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.890> perfectly<00:01:47.549> okay<00:01:47.880> the

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
happens this is perfectly okay the

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.330 
happens this is perfectly okay the

garden well rotted garden compost that
we<00:01:50.430> use<00:01:50.700> has<00:01:51.000> meant<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.810> we<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.200> grow<00:01:52.710> just

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
we use has meant that we can grow just

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.250 
we use has meant that we can grow just
about<00:01:53.130> anything<00:01:53.400> in<00:01:53.700> here<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:54.870> it<00:01:55.110> really

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
about anything in here and so it really

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.340 
about anything in here and so it really
needs<00:01:55.460> doing<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.580> is<00:01:56.760> to<00:01:56.940> prepare<00:01:57.120> it<00:01:57.570> ready

problem I have found with raised beds is

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.440 
problem I have found with raised beds is
that<00:02:04.409> if<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.799> use<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.010> rotavator<00:02:05.760> such<00:02:06.180> as<00:02:06.330> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
that if you use a rotavator such as the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.660 
that if you use a rotavator such as the
one<00:02:06.600> we're<00:02:06.750> going<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.900> use<00:02:06.960> today<00:02:07.429> and<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.549> go

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
one we're going to use today and you go

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.369 
one we're going to use today and you go
right<00:02:08.879> up<00:02:08.909> to<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.269> edges<00:02:09.599> tends<00:02:10.109> to<00:02:10.229> throw

right up to the edges tends to throw

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.800 
right up to the edges tends to throw
soil<00:02:10.859> over<00:02:11.219> the<00:02:11.549> paths<00:02:11.790> then<00:02:12.359> of<00:02:12.510> course<00:02:12.689> you

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
soil over the paths then of course you

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.910 
soil over the paths then of course you
get<00:02:12.900> weeds<00:02:13.170> growing<00:02:13.469> in<00:02:13.680> amongst<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.040> paths

what we're going to do is he's just dig

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.000 
what we're going to do is he's just dig

and ground elder and you can imagine

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.740 
and ground elder and you can imagine
with<00:02:30.190> those<00:02:30.370> creeping<00:02:30.940> weeds<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:31.540> if<00:02:31.630> you

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
with those creeping weeds that if you

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.180 
with those creeping weeds that if you
don't<00:02:31.930> dig<00:02:32.470> them<00:02:32.620> out<00:02:32.740> and<00:02:33.100> just<00:02:34.980> refine<00:02:35.980> your

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
don't dig them out and just refine your

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.770 
don't dig them out and just refine your
cultivation<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.150> middle<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.600> bed

cultivation to the middle of the bed

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.690 
cultivation to the middle of the bed
then<00:02:38.320> you'll<00:02:38.470> find<00:02:38.770> that<00:02:38.980> they<00:02:39.190> will<00:02:39.250> greatly

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
then you'll find that they will greatly

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.250 
then you'll find that they will greatly
spread<00:02:40.180> along<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:40.690> you'll<00:02:40.780> end<00:02:40.959> up<00:02:41.050> with<00:02:41.230> a

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
spread along and you'll end up with a

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.740 
spread along and you'll end up with a
big<00:02:41.860> ring<00:02:42.070> of<00:02:42.190> ground<00:02:42.489> elder<00:02:42.910> or<00:02:43.030> couch<00:02:43.390> around

big ring of ground elder or couch around
the<00:02:43.900> edge<00:02:43.989> of<00:02:44.110> your<00:02:44.170> bed<00:02:44.290> which<00:02:44.650> is<00:02:44.800> no<00:02:44.950> good<00:02:44.980> at

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
the edge of your bed which is no good at

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.550 
the edge of your bed which is no good at
all<00:02:45.430> so<00:02:46.390> what<00:02:46.480> I<00:02:46.540> do<00:02:46.750> is<00:02:47.020> just<00:02:47.260> take<00:02:47.440> an

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
all so what I do is just take an

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.350 
all so what I do is just take an
ordinary<00:02:47.739> fork<00:02:48.190> first<00:02:48.550> and<00:02:48.820> this<00:02:48.880> is<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.060> hard

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
ordinary fork first and this is the hard

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.660 
ordinary fork first and this is the hard
work<00:02:49.630> before<00:02:50.500> we<00:02:50.709> get<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.130> easy<00:02:51.280> bit<00:02:51.489> of

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
work before we get to the easy bit of

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.610 
work before we get to the easy bit of
the<00:02:51.730> rotavator<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.630> just<00:02:53.019> dig<00:02:53.200> around<00:02:53.320> the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
the rotavator and just dig around the

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.670 
the rotavator and just dig around the
edge<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.820> just<00:02:55.630> dig<00:02:55.810> out<00:02:55.959> any<00:02:56.140> perennial

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
edge and just dig out any perennial

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.949 
edge and just dig out any perennial
weeds<00:02:56.920> as<00:02:57.280> we<00:02:57.670> go<00:02:57.850> I<00:02:58.120> just<00:02:58.209> throw<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.720> soil

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
weeds as we go I just throw the soil

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.630 
weeds as we go I just throw the soil
into<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.320> middle<00:03:00.000> now<00:03:01.000> some<00:03:01.810> people<00:03:02.260> use<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.040> no

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
into the middle now some people use a no

into the middle now some people use a no
dig<00:03:03.910> method<00:03:04.420> of<00:03:04.570> gardening<00:03:04.720> which<00:03:05.140> has<00:03:05.290> always

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
dig method of gardening which has always

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.199 
dig method of gardening which has always
appealed<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.070> me<00:03:06.280> because<00:03:06.670> it<00:03:06.790> means<00:03:06.940> that<00:03:07.060> you

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
appealed to me because it means that you

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.810 
appealed to me because it means that you
haven't<00:03:07.360> got<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.570> do<00:03:07.690> all<00:03:07.780> this<00:03:07.930> hard<00:03:08.200> work<00:03:08.820> and

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
haven't got to do all this hard work and

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.100 
haven't got to do all this hard work and
what<00:03:09.940> they<00:03:10.120> would<00:03:10.269> do<00:03:10.480> is<00:03:10.630> just<00:03:10.810> put<00:03:10.959> their

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
what they would do is just put their

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.860 
what they would do is just put their
garden<00:03:11.470> compost<00:03:11.890> on<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.160> top<00:03:12.489> and<00:03:12.840> let<00:03:13.840> the

garden compost on the top and let the

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.110 
garden compost on the top and let the
worms<00:03:14.170> pull<00:03:14.560> it<00:03:14.680> in<00:03:14.830> so<00:03:14.860> they<00:03:15.220> wouldn't<00:03:15.370> dig<00:03:15.910> or

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
worms pull it in so they wouldn't dig or

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.770 
worms pull it in so they wouldn't dig or
rotavator<00:03:16.630> at<00:03:16.870> all<00:03:17.080> and<00:03:17.380> that's<00:03:17.950> fine<00:03:18.540> as<00:03:19.540> I

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
rotavator at all and that's fine as I

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.020 
rotavator at all and that's fine as I
said<00:03:19.989> being<00:03:20.200> sorely<00:03:20.530> tempted<00:03:20.739> to<00:03:21.340> do<00:03:21.489> that<00:03:21.700> but

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
said being sorely tempted to do that but

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.850 
said being sorely tempted to do that but
when<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.150> have<00:03:22.390> tried<00:03:22.690> it<00:03:22.930> and<00:03:23.380> I<00:03:23.470> have<00:03:23.590> found

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
when I have tried it and I have found

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.930 
when I have tried it and I have found
that<00:03:23.980> weeds<00:03:24.250> tend<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:25.079> as<00:03:26.079> I<00:03:26.200> said<00:03:26.940> establish

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
that weeds tend to as I said establish

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.340 
that weeds tend to as I said establish
themselves<00:03:28.360> especially<00:03:28.660> deep-rooted

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
themselves especially deep-rooted

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.970 
themselves especially deep-rooted
perennial<00:03:30.070> weeds<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:30.640> you<00:03:31.570> have<00:03:31.750> to<00:03:31.989> dig<00:03:32.739> now

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
perennial weeds and you have to dig now

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.699 
perennial weeds and you have to dig now
and<00:03:33.160> again<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.670> get<00:03:33.850> those<00:03:34.030> out<00:03:34.560> having<00:03:35.560> dug

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
and again to get those out having dug

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.530 
and again to get those out having dug
around<00:03:35.860> the<00:03:36.130> edges<00:03:36.400> of<00:03:36.579> the<00:03:36.700> bed<00:03:36.850> we're<00:03:37.420> going

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
around the edges of the bed we're going

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.240 
around the edges of the bed we're going
to<00:03:37.600> rotor<00:03:37.840> base<00:03:38.140> it<00:03:38.350> now<00:03:38.500> just<00:03:38.739> to<00:03:38.920> break<00:03:39.100> this

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
to rotor base it now just to break this

to rotor base it now just to break this
all<00:03:39.519> down<00:03:39.730> into<00:03:40.060> a<00:03:40.150> nice<00:03:40.299> crumbly<00:03:40.780> texture<00:03:41.230> for

all down into a nice crumbly texture for

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.949 
all down into a nice crumbly texture for
Sally<00:03:41.769> I'm<00:03:42.640> just<00:03:42.850> a<00:03:42.940> little<00:03:43.060> rotavator<00:03:43.630> we've

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
Sally I'm just a little rotavator we've

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.960 
Sally I'm just a little rotavator we've
got<00:03:44.140> here<00:03:44.350> which<00:03:44.530> is<00:03:44.680> ideal<00:03:45.070> for<00:03:45.100> a<00:03:45.579> small

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
got here which is ideal for a small

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.360 
got here which is ideal for a small
raised<00:03:46.209> bed<00:03:46.239> like<00:03:46.540> this<00:03:47.040> and<00:03:48.040> we<00:03:48.100> don't<00:03:48.280> have

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
raised bed like this and we don't have

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.130 
raised bed like this and we don't have
pound<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.760> soil<00:03:49.030> into<00:03:49.209> submission<00:03:49.660> we<00:03:49.959> just

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
pound the soil into submission we just

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.930 
pound the soil into submission we just
want<00:03:50.350> to<00:03:50.470> break<00:03:50.950> it<00:03:51.160> down<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.340> little<00:03:51.459> bit<00:03:51.730> just

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
want to break it down a little bit just

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.330 
want to break it down a little bit just
so<00:03:52.030> they<00:03:52.360> could<00:03:52.420> be<00:03:52.660> raked<00:03:52.870> over<00:03:53.110> to<00:03:53.829> a<00:03:53.860> final

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
so they could be raked over to a final

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.890 
so they could be raked over to a final
level<00:03:54.640> and<00:03:54.880> then<00:03:55.120> we<00:03:55.239> can<00:03:55.390> get<00:03:55.480> on<00:03:55.630> with<00:03:55.780> our

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
level and then we can get on with our

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.319 
level and then we can get on with our
sowing<00:03:56.370> so<00:03:57.370> that's<00:03:57.579> what<00:03:57.760> we'll<00:03:57.880> do<00:03:58.060> without

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
sowing so that's what we'll do without

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.080 
sowing so that's what we'll do without
more<00:03:58.540> ado<00:03:59.370> there's<00:04:00.370> a<00:04:00.400> very<00:04:00.579> light<00:04:00.820> little

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
more ado there's a very light little

more ado there's a very light little

machine all I'm going to do

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.470 
machine all I'm going to do
let's<00:04:05.130> just<00:04:05.220> break<00:04:05.430> up<00:04:05.640> those<00:04:05.820> big<00:04:06.030> clods<00:04:06.270> have

we missed and get it nice and level
ready<00:04:54.480> for<00:04:54.720> sowing<00:04:55.080> now<00:04:55.740> I<00:04:55.800> use<00:04:56.100> a<00:04:56.130> soil<00:04:57.060> rake

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
ready for sowing now I use a soil rake

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.500 
ready for sowing now I use a soil rake
which<00:04:58.110> is<00:04:58.350> probably<00:04:59.130> about<00:04:59.250> two<00:05:00.000> three<00:05:00.240> times

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
which is probably about two three times

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.650 
which is probably about two three times
wider<00:05:01.110> than<00:05:01.590> the<00:05:01.680> ordinary<00:05:01.890> rake<00:05:02.280> and<00:05:02.660> that's

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
wider than the ordinary rake and that's

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.870 
wider than the ordinary rake and that's
just<00:05:03.870> because<00:05:04.020> it<00:05:04.260> seems<00:05:04.650> easier<00:05:05.100> to<00:05:05.280> me<00:05:05.430> to

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
just because it seems easier to me to

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.500 
just because it seems easier to me to
get<00:05:05.970> a<00:05:06.030> nice<00:05:06.210> level<00:05:06.900> surface<00:05:08.060> I've<00:05:09.060> never<00:05:09.300> been

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
get a nice level surface I've never been

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.940 
get a nice level surface I've never been
very<00:05:09.540> good<00:05:09.870> at<00:05:10.050> forgetting<00:05:10.290> a<00:05:10.500> level<00:05:10.740> surface

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
very good at forgetting a level surface

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.920 
very good at forgetting a level surface
with<00:05:11.340> an<00:05:11.400> ordinary<00:05:11.610> ramekin<00:05:12.240> it's<00:05:12.420> worth

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
with an ordinary ramekin it's worth

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.710 
with an ordinary ramekin it's worth
investing<00:05:13.530> in<00:05:13.620> one<00:05:13.770> of<00:05:13.890> these<00:05:14.390> if<00:05:15.390> you've<00:05:15.570> got

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
investing in one of these if you've got

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.890 
investing in one of these if you've got
their<00:05:15.870> own<00:05:15.990> plot<00:05:17.240> so<00:05:18.240> we'll<00:05:18.360> just<00:05:18.480> break<00:05:18.690> up

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
their own plot so we'll just break up

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.630 
their own plot so we'll just break up
any<00:05:19.110> any<00:05:19.440> lumps<00:05:19.830> that<00:05:19.890> we<00:05:20.040> find<00:05:20.310> as<00:05:20.490> we're

any any lumps that we find as we're

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.620 
any any lumps that we find as we're
raking<00:05:20.820> I<00:05:22.400> could<00:05:23.400> have<00:05:23.490> gone<00:05:23.610> over<00:05:23.880> this<00:05:24.000> much

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
raking I could have gone over this much

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.570 
raking I could have gone over this much
more<00:05:24.870> with<00:05:25.080> a<00:05:25.110> rotavator<00:05:25.620> and<00:05:26.100> broken<00:05:26.490> them

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
more with a rotavator and broken them

more with a rotavator and broken them
all<00:05:26.730> up<00:05:26.940> but<00:05:27.240> I<00:05:27.480> do<00:05:27.840> worry<00:05:28.140> a<00:05:28.290> little<00:05:28.410> that<00:05:28.770> if

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
all up but I do worry a little that if

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.670 
all up but I do worry a little that if
you<00:05:29.130> go<00:05:29.280> over<00:05:29.310> too<00:05:29.820> often<00:05:30.230> you<00:05:31.230> might<00:05:31.410> just

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
you go over too often you might just

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.990 
you go over too often you might just
spoil<00:05:31.920> the<00:05:32.070> structure<00:05:32.490> of<00:05:32.610> the<00:05:32.730> soil<00:05:34.880> so<00:05:35.880> we're

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
spoil the structure of the soil so we're

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
few if you really want to try it then to

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.940 
few if you really want to try it then to

have a go at the no dig option which

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.230 
have a go at the no dig option which
just<00:06:35.160> means<00:06:35.340> that<00:06:35.490> you<00:06:35.580> put<00:06:35.730> your<00:06:35.820> compost

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
just means that you put your compost

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.970 
just means that you put your compost
over<00:06:36.390> the<00:06:36.630> top<00:06:36.870> and<00:06:37.170> instead<00:06:37.500> of<00:06:37.590> digging<00:06:37.890> it

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:37.980 
over the top and instead of digging it

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.190 
over the top and instead of digging it
in<00:06:38.160> this<00:06:38.400> is<00:06:38.520> in<00:06:38.640> the<00:06:38.760> autumn<00:06:39.120> rather<00:06:39.930> than

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
in this is in the autumn rather than

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.950 
in this is in the autumn rather than
nail<00:06:40.410> when<00:06:40.590> you<00:06:40.680> want<00:06:40.800> to<00:06:40.920> so<00:06:41.570> you<00:06:42.570> can<00:06:42.750> just

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
nail when you want to so you can just

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.270 
nail when you want to so you can just
stuff<00:06:43.200> put<00:06:43.410> it<00:06:43.500> on<00:06:43.590> the<00:06:43.710> top<00:06:43.920> and<00:06:43.950> let<00:06:44.250> the

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 
stuff put it on the top and let the

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.309 
stuff put it on the top and let the
worms<00:06:44.550> pull<00:06:44.910> it<00:06:45.000> in<00:06:45.120> for<00:06:45.390> you

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 
worms pull it in for you

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:49.700 
worms pull it in for you
but<00:06:47.569> as<00:06:48.569> I<00:06:48.689> say<00:06:48.869> I<00:06:48.899> have<00:06:49.139> tried<00:06:49.379> that<00:06:49.559> before

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:49.710 
but as I say I have tried that before

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.219 
but as I say I have tried that before
and<00:06:50.009> I<00:06:50.339> did<00:06:51.059> find<00:06:51.330> that<00:06:51.389> the<00:06:51.539> weeds<00:06:51.719> tended<00:06:52.139> to

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:52.229 
and I did find that the weeds tended to

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:54.799 
and I did find that the weeds tended to
build<00:06:52.439> up<00:06:52.619> a<00:06:52.740> bit<00:06:52.919> so<00:06:53.219> if<00:06:53.729> you<00:06:53.909> are<00:06:54.059> following<00:06:54.659> a

00:06:54.799 --> 00:06:54.809 
build up a bit so if you are following a

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:57.260 
build up a bit so if you are following a
no<00:06:54.930> dig<00:06:55.199> sort<00:06:55.469> of<00:06:55.589> policy<00:06:56.009> I<00:06:56.189> think<00:06:56.999> you<00:06:57.089> will

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
no dig sort of policy I think you will

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.299 
no dig sort of policy I think you will
have<00:06:57.479> to<00:06:57.629> dig<00:06:57.809> perhaps<00:06:58.169> every<00:06:58.499> three<00:06:59.189> or<00:06:59.219> four

00:06:59.299 --> 00:06:59.309 
have to dig perhaps every three or four

00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:00.649 
have to dig perhaps every three or four
years<00:06:59.490> just<00:06:59.849> to<00:07:00.180> get<00:07:00.300> out<00:07:00.419> and<00:07:00.569> your
