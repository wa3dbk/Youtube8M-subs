00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.259
 if we ask any user about 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.360
 what aspect they value most in a phone 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.420
 mobile sure that the quality of the camera 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.820
 It is a clear winner may therefore be 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.160
 start to try different formulas 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.010
 to enhance this relationship that exists 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.020
 between mobile and photography a first 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.109
 approach that shows this relationship 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.590
 symbiotic is the samsung galaxy s 4 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.410
 trump and today we are going to analyze it from 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.960
 in front of galaxy s 4 zone is a phone 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.210
 mobile more of the house but if we give it the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.910
 back the terminal breaks us any 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.430
 concept that we have about what is a 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.250
 smartphone we see like the back 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.670
 of the terminal is literally a camera 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.680
 of digital symbiosis photos that's what 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.629
 the samsung engineers would have in 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.850
 mind when designing a product that does not 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.789
 it finishes defining itself or as a smartphone 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.070
 nor as a digital camera are both 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.420
 united in a product that offers 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.420
 versatility of an Android smartphone 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.870
 with the photographic quality of a camera 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.670
 compact 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.100
 in regards to photography the 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.560
 samsung galaxy s 4 zoom wins whole 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.360
 because the quality far exceeds 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.700
 any image taken with a 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.280
 traditional smartphone facing the use 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.800
 as a smartphone the taxi s4 zoom could 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.990
 nestled in the range of the mid-range 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.780
 although the thickness does not precisely 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.659
 a device like to be defined as 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.759
 main phone its thickness is the point 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.570
 negative that enhances its quality 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.990
 photographic 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.260
 going into detail the galaxy s 4g is a 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.450
 Cortex dual core terminal a9 1.5 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.420
 gb ram memory 8 gigas of memory 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.990
 Internal with slot that supports up to 64 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.940
 gb screen 4.3 inch hd in 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.880
 definitive a range mobile phone 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.650
 mean the most shocking if we talk in 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.470
 terms of smartphones we find it 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.530
 in your secluded camera here we have a 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.530
 sensor 80% greater than that of any 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.229
 another smartphone of type psi and 16 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.289
 megapixels capable of collecting much more 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.959
 light in poorly lit conditions this 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.930
 means more quality and less noise 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.570
 we also have an unusual extra 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.360
 an optical zoom of 10 increases that we 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.430
 provides its extensible lens this 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.350
 can be controlled via camera software 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.830
 or by the ring that surrounds the 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.830
 objective 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.640
 in the case of samsung galaxy s 4 and the 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.380
 type of flash included this type sine what 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.450
 which also improves in terms of quality 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.240
 with any other smartphone that by 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.280
 usually use the LED type and 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.840
 although at this moment they already begin to 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.240
 include in premium models of 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.430
 optic stabilizer manufacturers 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.620
 whole to the results that we can 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.350
 get this hybrid between camera 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.050
 compact and smartphone as you will have 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.030
 noticed on the samsung galaxy s 4 zoom what 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.160
 more striking or what makes it stand out 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.740
 of other terminals of the market is its 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.620
 physical appearance and optical components 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.650
 but of course you have to be able to exploit it 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.780
 at the software level at this point we're going 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.850
 to focus on knowing better the 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.250
 default camera application that 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.230
 the terminal uses an application 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.990
 different and that makes any type 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.840
 user can find their way to use it and 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.390
 squeeze the potential to highlight three 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.220
 configuration types take the mode 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.080
 automatic in which the camera of the 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.600
 terminal the and that the combination of 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.330
 exposure tonality and sensitivity more 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.670
 suitable for what situation 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.220
 the smart mode what samsung proposes us 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.870
 they are different profiles of taking based 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.870
 in the conditions that normally 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.300
 we can meet in real life of 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.670
 make pictures of beach portraits photos to 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.860
 food photography backlit sports 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.680
 to highlight silhouettes photography 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.720
 night and other these modes configure 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.180
 the capture parameters so that it takes 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.980
 stay as close as possible to the effect 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.290
 searched 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.540
 finally the manual mode this method 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.180
 allows us to configure the parameters of 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.860
 exposure sensitivity iso and opening 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.140
 from diaphragm to our whim 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.050
 thus allowing the effect achieved 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.459
 be as we want without 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.890
 attend calculation programs 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:21.160
 practiced as in the previous modes 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.110
 the control interface is intuitive the 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.540
 screen is capacitive and with quality 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.420
 from any samsung phone so 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.730
 that is handled superbly in terms of 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.620
 his vision as a digital camera say 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.080
 that the quality of the images is 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.240
 especially good compared to 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.460
 other smartphone 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.039
 we do not want to delve into the aspect 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.280
 Galaxy S4c mobile but it's inevitable 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:47.410
 treat certain things we have already commented 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.750
 that this terminal also fulfills 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.360
 dual core smartphone and more than one giga 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.180
 of ram guarantees us a quality more than 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.490
 good android 422 is the version of 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.410
 system that comes standard and we have 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.710
 all the applications that tend 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.900
 include these terminals the s4 zoom is 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.210
 also phone and can be equipped with 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.490
 a sim so we can always 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.229
 be connected these guys 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.360
 brings an extra point on other 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.789
 cameras because in our photos they will be able 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.180
 be uploaded to a server or share them 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:21.190
 in the network instantly but not everything was going to 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.380
 be good the worst no doubt that has 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.599
 this device is its size as 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.180
 digital camera there is no problem however 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:29.889
 use the galaxy s 45 as a phone 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.190
 of the newspaper is not as comfortable as 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.930
 should be heavy and thick enough to 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.449
 give you an idea the widest part 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.509
 where is the objective measured almost 3 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:42.340
 centimeters with this contracted 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:45.550
 obviously carry it in a pocket 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.260
 may not be entirely comfortable to 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.020
 now we have pronounced ourselves 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.240
 almost completely on the different 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.360
 aspects that we have seen remarkable in 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.610
 the galaxy s 4g is a concept 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.320
 interesting that power photography 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.960
 in the world of the smartphone but that 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.000
 it becomes even counterproductive 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:07.030
 for the device's own use as 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.010
 such in terms of camera quality say 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.380
 that exceeds the rest of smartphones and 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.139
 it positions very well inside the cameras 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:17.169
 domestic compact maybe if we talk 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:19.810
 in terms of price the more than 350 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:22.090
 euros that cost dan for SLR cameras 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.310
 semi professionals that can certainly 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.590
 give more play to amateur photographers 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.350
 although we have a great pack 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.720
 mobile phone that is my opinion then 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:34.630
 well I liked the idea to use the 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.580
 galaxy s 4g as a quality camera for 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.889
 event two school days and excursions 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.110
 with the possibility of including a sim and 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:43.900
 to be able to share photos and so on 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:46.419
 instantly as main phone I see you 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.979
 but I 'm telling you that interest varies 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:49.180
 depending on if you see it as a 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:51.430
 smartphone with camera 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:55.800
 or as a compact camera with 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.800
 smartphone capabilities that you think
