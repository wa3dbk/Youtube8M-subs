00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
they took the time to actually add that

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.009 
they took the time to actually add that
entire<00:04:05.730> backstory<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.480> him<00:04:06.570> and<00:04:06.660> at<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.810> same

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
entire backstory to him and at the same

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.470 
entire backstory to him and at the same
time<00:04:07.260> they<00:04:07.739> really<00:04:08.190> developed<00:04:08.640> Kyoto's<00:04:09.239> inner

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
time they really developed Kyoto's inner

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.060 
time they really developed Kyoto's inner
monologue<00:04:09.840> hopefully<00:04:10.380> they<00:04:10.500> continue<00:04:10.620> the

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
monologue hopefully they continue the

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.229 
monologue hopefully they continue the
inner<00:04:11.220> monologue<00:04:11.700> because<00:04:11.910> that's<00:04:12.090> exactly

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
inner monologue because that's exactly

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.970 
inner monologue because that's exactly
what<00:04:12.720> we<00:04:12.870> need<00:04:13.019> for<00:04:13.170> Kyoto's<00:04:13.530> character<00:04:13.860> that

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.390 
was something the last series really
lacked<00:04:16.019> that<00:04:16.229> was<00:04:16.320> something<00:04:16.709> that<00:04:16.859> character

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400

big thing right there what exactly
happened<00:04:59.439> what<00:04:59.830> was<00:04:59.979> the<00:05:00.099> cause<00:05:00.279> deaf<00:05:00.490> we<00:05:00.639> know

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
happened what was the cause deaf we know

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:02.399

of cardiac arrest but how did he die

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.379 
of cardiac arrest but how did he die
it's<00:05:05.259> a<00:05:05.409> coincidence<00:05:05.620> is<00:05:06.129> it<00:05:06.699> I<00:05:06.879> mean<00:05:07.090> we<00:05:07.240> got

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
it's a coincidence is it I mean we got

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:08.939 
it's a coincidence is it I mean we got
to<00:05:07.479> figure<00:05:07.599> that<00:05:07.779> one<00:05:07.840> out<00:05:07.990> because<00:05:08.229> I<00:05:08.379> mean<00:05:08.590> as

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:08.949 
to figure that one out because I mean as

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:10.409 
to figure that one out because I mean as
we<00:05:09.009> see<00:05:09.340> the<00:05:09.580> foreshadowing<00:05:09.789> the<00:05:10.150> beginning

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
we see the foreshadowing the beginning

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.749 
we see the foreshadowing the beginning
of<00:05:10.539> this<00:05:10.629> episode<00:05:10.990> okay<00:05:11.349> we<00:05:11.889> see<00:05:12.189> that<00:05:12.460> pretty

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:12.759 
of this episode okay we see that pretty

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:14.040 
of this episode okay we see that pretty
much<00:05:12.879> there's<00:05:13.210> eventually<00:05:13.779> going<00:05:13.870> to<00:05:13.930> be

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
much there's eventually going to be

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.540 
much there's eventually going to be
major<00:05:14.439> senses<00:05:14.979> like<00:05:15.129> they<00:05:15.279> were<00:05:15.340> talking

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
major senses like they were talking

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.339 
major senses like they were talking
about<00:05:15.669> senses<00:05:16.090> how<00:05:16.180> Austin<00:05:16.509> and<00:05:16.659> Kirito<00:05:16.930> we're

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:17.349 
about senses how Austin and Kirito we're

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:18.809 
about senses how Austin and Kirito we're
talking<00:05:17.560> about<00:05:17.620> senses<00:05:18.099> of<00:05:18.189> touch<00:05:18.340> and<00:05:18.610> feel

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:18.819 
talking about senses of touch and feel

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:20.850 
talking about senses of touch and feel
and<00:05:18.849> stuff<00:05:19.240> most<00:05:19.840> likely<00:05:20.199> what<00:05:20.439> we<00:05:20.590> could<00:05:20.710> see

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
and stuff most likely what we could see

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.170 
and stuff most likely what we could see
from<00:05:20.979> the<00:05:21.039> conversation<00:05:21.669> Kirito<00:05:22.029> and<00:05:22.120> the

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
from the conversation Kirito and the

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.939 
from the conversation Kirito and the
government<00:05:22.539> official<00:05:22.930> is<00:05:23.050> that<00:05:23.500> this<00:05:23.710> dude

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:23.949 
government official is that this dude

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:25.860 
government official is that this dude
most<00:05:24.250> likely<00:05:24.520> died<00:05:24.729> because<00:05:24.969> of<00:05:25.150> senses

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
most likely died because of senses

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.540 
most likely died because of senses
because<00:05:26.409> he<00:05:26.560> felt<00:05:26.770> like<00:05:26.860> he<00:05:27.009> was<00:05:27.129> dying<00:05:27.310> or

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
because he felt like he was dying or

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.769 
because he felt like he was dying or
something<00:05:27.759> that's<00:05:27.849> exactly<00:05:28.300> what<00:05:28.389> we<00:05:28.479> can<00:05:28.629> get

00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:28.779 
something that's exactly what we can get

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:30.899 
something that's exactly what we can get
from<00:05:29.169> the<00:05:29.349> beginning<00:05:29.469> of<00:05:29.949> this<00:05:30.189> episode<00:05:30.580> which

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:30.909

from the beginning of this episode which
I<00:05:31.029> like<00:05:31.419> that<00:05:31.599> a<00:05:31.629> lot<00:05:31.839> of<00:05:31.900> how<00:05:32.169> they<00:05:32.349> tried<00:05:32.589> to

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
I like that a lot of how they tried to

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.649 
I like that a lot of how they tried to
do<00:05:32.979> that<00:05:33.129> dialogue<00:05:33.669> which<00:05:34.089> cure<00:05:34.330> tone<00:05:34.509> the

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:34.659

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
the four shot and they set up everything

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.570 
the four shot and they set up everything

correctly and I don't have much to

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.219 
correctly and I don't have much to
really<00:05:42.849> complain<00:05:43.180> about<00:05:43.330> I<00:05:43.539> don't<00:05:43.839> the<00:05:44.080> only

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:49.469 
thing I could see I'm not happy with but
most<00:05:47.620> likely<00:05:47.770> they<00:05:48.039> can<00:05:48.190> add<00:05:48.370> it<00:05:48.400> in<00:05:48.669> later<00:05:48.729> and

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
most likely they can add it in later and

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:51.450 
most likely they can add it in later and
