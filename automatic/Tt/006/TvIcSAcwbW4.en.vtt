maybe this place is the same and we're

maybe this place is the same and we're
just<00:00:36.210> changing<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.960> like<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.379> title<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.860> this

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.340 
just changing I like the title of this
album<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:39.090> doesn't<00:00:39.449> go<00:00:39.540> much<00:00:39.720> beyond<00:00:40.170> that

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
album but it doesn't go much beyond that

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.350 
album but it doesn't go much beyond that
there's<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.129> lot<00:00:41.400> of<00:00:41.579> problems<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.089> I<00:00:42.150> have

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
there's a lot of problems that I have

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.180 
there's a lot of problems that I have
with<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.750> band<00:00:43.019> and<00:00:43.290> there<00:00:43.409> are<00:00:43.500> very<00:00:43.769> few

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
with this band and there are very few

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.790 
with this band and there are very few
moments<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:45.149> kind<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.449> rise<00:00:45.780> above<00:00:46.409> this

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
moments that kind of rise above this

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.250 
moments that kind of rise above this
formula<00:00:47.430> they<00:00:47.640> seem<00:00:47.970> to<00:00:48.120> follow<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.570> formula

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
formula they seem to follow the formula

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.060 
formula they seem to follow the formula
is<00:00:49.470> the<00:00:50.070> following<00:00:50.670> they<00:00:51.239> stick<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> very

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
is the following they stick to a very

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.759 
is the following they stick to a very
generic<00:00:53.430> song<00:00:54.149> meaning<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:55.440> usually

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
generic song meaning it's usually

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.700 
generic song meaning it's usually
involving<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.789> relationship<00:00:57.600> or<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> problem

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
involving a relationship or a problem

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.220 
involving a relationship or a problem
that<00:00:59.010> sounds<00:00:59.820> like<00:00:59.969> some<00:01:00.269> problem<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.840> an

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
that sounds like some problem that an

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.619 
that sounds like some problem that an
early<00:01:01.920> adolescent<00:01:02.760> would<00:01:02.910> probably<00:01:03.390> have

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
early adolescent would probably have

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.350 
early adolescent would probably have
they<00:01:03.960> tackle<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> song<00:01:05.039> and<00:01:05.369> then<00:01:06.030> they

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
they tackle it on the song and then they

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.020 
they tackle it on the song and then they
throw<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.810> some<00:01:07.050> very<00:01:07.320> whiny<00:01:07.740> Fogle's<00:01:08.490> that's

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
throw in some very whiny Fogle's that's

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.770 
throw in some very whiny Fogle's that's
a<00:01:09.360> typical<00:01:10.289> song<00:01:10.860> not<00:01:11.250> every<00:01:12.030> song<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:12.630> there

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
a typical song not every song but there

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.660 
a typical song not every song but there
are<00:01:12.929> very<00:01:13.289> few<00:01:13.560> moments<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:14.160> kind<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.429> rise

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
are very few moments that kind of rise

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.910 
are very few moments that kind of rise
above<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.300> strict<00:01:15.990> formula<00:01:16.350> there's<00:01:16.679> a<00:01:16.740> lot

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
above that strict formula there's a lot

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.310 
above that strict formula there's a lot
of<00:01:17.039> overused<00:01:17.789> cliches<00:01:18.420> here<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.960> record

overdramatic<00:01:27.060> starting<00:01:28.020> with<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.320> track<00:01:28.619> I

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
overdramatic starting with the track I

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.350 
overdramatic starting with the track I
don't<00:01:28.920> love<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.490> anymore<00:01:29.729> which<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
second song on the album it's really a

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.270 
second song on the album it's really a
shame<00:01:33.149> because<00:01:33.210> if<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.380> album<00:01:34.740> was<00:01:34.890> mainly

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
shame because if this album was mainly

shame because if this album was mainly
instrumental<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.970> would<00:01:36.119> probably<00:01:36.390> be<00:01:36.810> pretty

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
instrumental I would probably be pretty

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.560 
instrumental I would probably be pretty
into<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.649> the<00:01:38.100> fact<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.579> there's<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.210> lot<00:01:39.420> of

great<00:01:40.110> guitar<00:01:40.560> moments<00:01:40.950> here<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.280> record

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460

so echoey and distant and just kind of

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.270 
so echoey and distant and just kind of

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
wailing about like certain things I

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.270 
wailing about like certain things I
don't<00:04:27.430> think<00:04:28.000> that<00:04:28.510> it<00:04:28.660> suits<00:04:29.110> this<00:04:29.650> style<00:04:30.070> of

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
maybe this is emo pop punk but it's just

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.500 
maybe this is emo pop punk but it's just
not<00:04:39.070> something<00:04:39.370> that<00:04:39.610> I<00:04:39.790> can<00:04:39.940> really<00:04:40.060> get<00:04:40.360> on
