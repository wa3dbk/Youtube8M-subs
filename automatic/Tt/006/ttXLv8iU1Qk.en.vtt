00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.650
 above you can there is better from the bottom 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.570
 that's good because rpm brought to pass 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.950
 near the table and that's it too 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.299
 we should have bleeding bridge and 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.829
 after you have no color that you 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.790
 do you want to put your plexi on the wheels and 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.650
 700 coffee table we arrive at a time when 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.769
 1 people less and less means 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.150
 and moreover want more and more envy 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.430
 to be well when they go home 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.840
 it's going so badly outside that you 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.980
 you still want to be good at home 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.730
 and since you have no wheat you have to 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.349
 find solutions 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.489
 no I would not know that too much for 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.970
 encourage people to go to 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.280
 garage sales flea markets point and 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.260
 the local villages I love and 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.819
 especially for example me it happened to me 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.079
 to recover push people but I 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.329
 izard less of your grandmother than you 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.370
 hate who his wardrobe brown varnish 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.200
 disgusting but you ponce you put them in the 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.760
 polished concrete on it and it makes you weapons 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.099
 in super but you just change them 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.139
 wrists and for 40 ball you reach 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.849
 wardrobe a little nice and it's more 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.919
 better do it yourself now 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.329
 I like anglicisms we have the 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:24.550
 do it yourself one that basically means 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.580
 hammers alone 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.870
 it's good to be able to do it because 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.580
 that in addition you have a guy you did 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.720
 you say the best it is to 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.140
 to dismount alone because the times 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.670
 are hard 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.910
 or then to play the lottery but that's 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.910
 another debate
