00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
it was the only short stackers which

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.020 
it was the only short stackers which
really<00:02:28.800> takes<00:02:28.980> away<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.190> lot<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.970> know

like sitting goes you know it's pretty

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.900 
like sitting goes you know it's pretty
straightforward<00:02:37.350> it's<00:02:37.830> it's<00:02:38.250> mathematical

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
straightforward it's it's mathematical

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.120 
straightforward it's it's mathematical
it's<00:02:39.060> simple<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.600> it<00:02:40.530> sort<00:02:40.740> of<00:02:40.800> takes<00:02:40.980> away

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
it's simple and it sort of takes away

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.070 
it's simple and it sort of takes away
from<00:02:41.280> what<00:02:41.490> what<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.270> really<00:02:42.450> can<00:02:42.660> can

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
creativity that you that six max in

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.970 
creativity that you that six max in
limit<00:02:48.360> really<00:02:48.570> allows<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:49.050> when<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.680> play<00:02:49.830> it

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
limit really allows you when you play it

more<00:02:55.380> room<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.590> do<00:02:55.830> things<00:02:56.070> when<00:02:56.490> you<00:02:56.580> don't

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
more room to do things when you don't

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.730 
more room to do things when you don't
have<00:02:56.790> short<00:02:57.000> stackers<00:02:57.420> around<00:02:57.660> so<00:02:58.410> whenever<00:02:58.590> I

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
have short stackers around so whenever I

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.180 
have short stackers around so whenever I
can<00:02:58.890> avoid<00:02:59.100> playing<00:02:59.340> short<00:02:59.640> staggers<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:00.120> do
