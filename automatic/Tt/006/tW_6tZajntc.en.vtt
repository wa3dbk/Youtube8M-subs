in<00:00:00.240> this<00:00:00.390> video<00:00:00.659> we're<00:00:00.810> going<00:00:00.900> to<00:00:00.960> talk<00:00:01.170> about

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:01.290 
in this video we're going to talk about

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.130 
in this video we're going to talk about
the<00:00:01.560> safety<00:00:01.860> of<00:00:02.280> tonic<00:00:02.850> herbs<00:00:03.000> and<00:00:03.419> how

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
the safety of tonic herbs and how

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.990 
the safety of tonic herbs and how
they're<00:00:04.350> different<00:00:04.589> from<00:00:05.190> our<00:00:05.580> typical

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
they're different from our typical

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.540 
they're different from our typical
understanding<00:00:06.960> of<00:00:07.109> herbs<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.770> working<00:00:08.400> with

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
understanding of herbs and working with

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.970 
understanding of herbs and working with
herbs<00:00:08.760> in<00:00:09.000> our<00:00:09.150> Western<00:00:09.540> context<00:00:10.320> now<00:00:10.830> it's

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
herbs in our Western context now it's

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.770 
herbs in our Western context now it's
important<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.460> understand<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.240> differences

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
important to understand the differences

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.720 
important to understand the differences
between<00:00:12.840> these<00:00:13.320> two<00:00:13.590> mindsets<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.370> these<00:00:14.549> two

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
between these two mindsets and these two

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.140 
between these two mindsets and these two
worldviews<00:00:15.089> because<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:16.320> our<00:00:16.410> typical

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
worldviews because in our typical

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.150 
worldviews because in our typical
Western<00:00:18.150> mindset<00:00:18.510> we<00:00:19.500> don't<00:00:19.680> really<00:00:19.890> have<00:00:20.039> the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
Western mindset we don't really have the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.720 
Western mindset we don't really have the
understanding<00:00:20.880> as<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.390> herbs<00:00:22.279> past<00:00:23.279> anything

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
understanding as of herbs past anything

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.880 
understanding as of herbs past anything
more<00:00:24.180> than<00:00:24.359> just<00:00:24.390> medicinal<00:00:25.199> or<00:00:25.380> maybe<00:00:25.619> just

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
more than just medicinal or maybe just

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.380 
more than just medicinal or maybe just
something<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.310> add<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.670> your<00:00:26.789> food<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.240> make

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
something you add to your food to make

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.450 
something you add to your food to make
it<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.660> know<00:00:27.750> taste<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.289> little<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.740> little<00:00:29.220> bit

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
it you know taste a little a little bit

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.460 
it you know taste a little a little bit
better<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.449> when<00:00:30.689> you're<00:00:30.810> coming<00:00:31.050> from<00:00:31.260> that

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
better so when you're coming from that

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.319 
better so when you're coming from that
understanding<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.160> someone<00:00:32.430> says<00:00:32.579> oh<00:00:32.759> yes

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
understanding and someone says oh yes

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.209 
understanding and someone says oh yes
here's<00:00:33.809> herbs<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.200> are<00:00:34.320> tonifying<00:00:34.980> and

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
here's herbs that are tonifying and

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.560 
here's herbs that are tonifying and
strengthening<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.910> balancing<00:00:36.420> and

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
strengthening and balancing and

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.819 
strengthening and balancing and
something<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:36.960> can<00:00:37.079> take<00:00:37.290> every<00:00:37.649> day

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
something that you can take every day

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.819 
something that you can take every day
over<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.730> long<00:00:38.910> term<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.899> kind<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.290> throws<00:00:40.620> up

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
over the long term it kind of throws up

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.590 
over the long term it kind of throws up
some<00:00:41.010> red<00:00:41.190> flags<00:00:41.430> because<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:42.000> think<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.329> herbs

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
some red flags because we think of herbs

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.380 
some red flags because we think of herbs
as<00:00:42.899> either<00:00:43.680> just<00:00:44.129> trivial<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.940> know<00:00:45.059> little

medicinal very aggressive substances but

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.500 
medicinal very aggressive substances but

you<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:06.900> see<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.260> there's<00:01:07.470> some<00:01:08.250> obvious

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
you can see that there's some obvious

you can see that there's some obvious
disparity<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.450> some<00:01:09.600> obvious<00:01:09.900> ground<00:01:10.260> that

disparity and some obvious ground that

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.590 
disparity and some obvious ground that
we<00:01:10.619> need<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.860> make<00:01:11.070> up<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.820> our<00:01:12.270> understanding

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
we need to make up in our understanding

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.420 
we need to make up in our understanding
of<00:01:13.110> working<00:01:13.350> with<00:01:13.619> herbs<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.100> different

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
reality it wasn't which is why I was

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.320 
reality it wasn't which is why I was
having<00:05:05.410> the<00:05:05.890> laxative<00:05:06.430> and<00:05:06.610> ingest<00:05:07.180> of

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
effects because that's what happens when

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.090 
effects because that's what happens when
you<00:05:09.850> take<00:05:10.060> unprepared<00:05:10.780> ho<00:05:10.930> Xu<00:05:11.140> Lu<00:05:11.290> because

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
you take unprepared ho Xu Lu because

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.040 
you take unprepared ho Xu Lu because
it's<00:05:12.340> not<00:05:12.520> a<00:05:12.550> tonic<00:05:13.000> because<00:05:13.600> it's<00:05:13.750> more<00:05:13.900> of<00:05:13.960> a

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
it's not a tonic because it's more of a

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.540 
it's not a tonic because it's more of a
cleansing<00:05:14.470> agent<00:05:14.860> because<00:05:15.070> it's<00:05:15.220> more<00:05:15.400> of<00:05:15.460> a

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
cleansing agent because it's more of a

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.340 
cleansing agent because it's more of a
laxative<00:05:15.760> so<00:05:16.570> that's<00:05:16.750> why<00:05:16.930> I<00:05:16.960> really

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350
