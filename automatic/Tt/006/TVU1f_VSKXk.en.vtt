providing wonderful materials today
we're<00:00:22.439> gonna<00:00:22.590> be<00:00:22.769> doing<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.130> front<00:00:23.369> balance

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
we're gonna be doing the front balance

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.800 
we're gonna be doing the front balance
which<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.150> another<00:00:24.920> basic<00:00:25.920> position<00:00:26.810> although

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
which is another basic position although

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.330 
which is another basic position although
it's<00:00:28.080> under<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.439> more<00:00:28.619> advanced<00:00:28.859> positions

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
it's under the more advanced positions

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.040 
it's under the more advanced positions
in<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.609> manual<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.150> don't<00:00:30.720> think<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:30.929> too

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
in the manual I don't think is too

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.069 
in the manual I don't think is too
difficult<00:00:32.270> although<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.360> becomes<00:00:33.630> harder<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
difficult although it becomes harder the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.280 
difficult although it becomes harder the
higher<00:00:34.260> up<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.530> Rope<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.770> do<00:00:35.809> so<00:00:36.809> I'm<00:00:37.140> going

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
higher up the Rope you do so I'm going

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.290 
higher up the Rope you do so I'm going
to<00:00:37.350> show<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.680> position<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.129> then<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.940> will

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
to show you the position and then I will

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:58.900 
to show you the position and then I will
tell<00:00:39.660> me

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.090 

so<00:01:00.830> hopefully<00:01:01.830> you<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:01.950> see<00:01:02.040> that<00:01:02.160> position

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
so hopefully you can see that position

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.560 
so hopefully you can see that position
it's<00:01:05.100> fairly<00:01:05.309> straightforward<00:01:08.570> involves

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
it's fairly straightforward involves

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.540 
it's fairly straightforward involves
getting<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.230> good<00:01:10.440> tension<00:01:10.740> between<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.340> lower

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
getting a good tension between the lower

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.750 
getting a good tension between the lower
hand<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.120> upper<00:01:12.150> hand<00:01:12.710> so<00:01:13.710> really<00:01:14.160> being

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
hand in the upper hand so really being

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.240 
hand in the upper hand so really being
fully<00:01:15.030> extended<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.200> if<00:01:16.290> your<00:01:16.470> cord<00:01:17.070> lease

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
fully extended and if your cord lease

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.690 
fully extended and if your cord lease
has<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.790> bit<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.660> elasticity<00:01:19.230> to<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.770> then<00:01:20.610> you

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
has a bit of elasticity to it then you

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.830 
has a bit of elasticity to it then you
really<00:01:20.910> need<00:01:20.940> to<00:01:21.060> take<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.240> out<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.750> make

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
really need to take that out and make

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.170 
really need to take that out and make
sure<00:01:21.870> that<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.350> Rope<00:01:23.220> between<00:01:23.760> your<00:01:23.910> arms

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
sure that the Rope between your arms

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.510 
sure that the Rope between your arms
nice<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.479> straight<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:26.160> really<00:01:26.340> push

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
nice and straight so you really push

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.640 
nice and straight so you really push
down<00:01:26.700> with<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.940> bottom<00:01:27.240> hand<00:01:27.450> pull<00:01:28.410> with<00:01:28.590> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
down with the bottom hand pull with the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.350 
down with the bottom hand pull with the
top<00:01:29.150> you<00:01:30.150> pull<00:01:30.390> slightly<00:01:30.800> with<00:01:32.090> your<00:01:33.090> upper

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
top you pull slightly with your upper

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.850 
top you pull slightly with your upper
hand<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:33.840> you're<00:01:33.960> going<00:01:34.080> to<00:01:34.140> do<00:01:34.260> a<00:01:34.290> pull<00:01:34.530> up<00:01:34.680> and
