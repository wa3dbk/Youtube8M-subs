just<00:03:15.629> like<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:17.750> I'm<00:03:18.750> still<00:03:19.170> using<00:03:19.650> almost<00:03:20.159> no

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
just like that I'm still using almost no

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.899 
just like that I'm still using almost no
pressure<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:21.680> letting<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.799> paint<00:03:23.099> break<00:03:23.549> a

pressure and letting that paint break a
little<00:03:26.909> bit<00:03:27.030> up<00:03:27.209> here<00:03:28.670> just<00:03:29.670> let<00:03:29.849> the<00:03:30.030> knife

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:37.569 
little bit up here just let the knife
float<00:03:30.659> right<00:03:31.290> now<00:03:35.629> now<00:03:36.629> with<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:36.870> clean<00:03:37.170> brush

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
angles of the mountain and then we can

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.140 
angles of the mountain and then we can
lift<00:03:48.269> up<00:03:48.510> also<00:03:49.019> following<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.859> angles<00:03:50.310> very
