00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.599 
this is thin with some shortening to

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.809 
this is thin with some shortening to
make<00:05:02.750> it<00:05:02.870> thin<00:05:03.050> enough<00:05:03.080> to<00:05:03.439> dip<00:05:03.710> I<00:05:04.129> want<00:05:04.729> to

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:04.819 
make it thin enough to dip I want to

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:07.619 
make it thin enough to dip I want to
make<00:05:05.000> sure<00:05:05.030> the<00:05:05.449> whole<00:05:05.629> thing<00:05:05.840> gets<00:05:05.990> covered

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
and it's thinned enough that it's

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.159 
and it's thinned enough that it's
probably<00:05:10.400> going<00:05:10.610> to<00:05:10.849> need<00:05:11.000> to<00:05:11.060> be<00:05:11.930> dipped

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169

much as possible so you don't get a

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:37.869 
much as possible so you don't get a
puddle<00:05:28.430> underneath<00:05:28.879> of<00:05:29.240> them<00:05:36.580> and<00:05:37.580> you<00:05:37.699> can

00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:37.879
