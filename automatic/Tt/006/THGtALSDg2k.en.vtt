00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.380
 now that we've seen what the 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.740
 social networks 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.750
 why use these networks and how 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.000
 we can be classify it because we're going to 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.070
 see some criteria or advice for 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.410
 to choose a social network because 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.570
 example to create a community of 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.349
 learning for our classes 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:33.739
 then these criteria we have 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.180
 considered or collected throughout 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.220
 our experience then in these 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.710
 different editions of the course a lot 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.930
 but they are not unique is to say that they can 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.210
 have more or even in your in some 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.330
 particular case because maybe they are not 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.630
 enough I say are not necessary 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.760
 all the criteria when choosing 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.340
 the network then on the one hand we're going to 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.340
 have the feeling of community and 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.280
 understanding this concept of sensation 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:05.210
 of community as the one in which we are going 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.970
 to differentiate or delimit 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.590
 publications and the interactions of 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.720
 our group for example from our 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.850
 community of the rest of the activity of 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.609
 the social network there are some social networks 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.530
 that allow in a very simple way 

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:20.780
 this type of separation for example 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.119
 google plus or facebook allow us 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.939
 easily then create a page a 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.039
 group where when we click on him 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.319
 we will find delimited then those 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.789
 interactions in other cases because 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:35.840
 example on twitter is going to be more 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:39.170
 complicated to separate that activity from 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.409
 rest of the rest of users that 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.240
 we find in the network for example then 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.280
 as I was commenting on twitter in my line of 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.959
 time will not only appear in the 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.149
 publications of those people who 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:52.009
 are part of the community but 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.159
 will also appear the publications of 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.889
 other people then good because that 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.920
 is a criterion that depending on whether 

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:03.560
 you have that need or not because you have 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.020
 that take it into account then another 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.020
 side the characteristics of the network 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.660
 social is important 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.340
 study first what requirements 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.550
 you are going to need yours for yours 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.830
 community and then see if the networks 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.390
 social organizations meet those requirements 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.660
 through its characteristics by 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.910
 example the number of users if there is not 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.590
 maximum or no users if by 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.120
 example let's have a community with 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.730
 a high number because maybe there will be 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.070
 networks that do not meet those two requirements 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.490
 then what kinds of tools do they have 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.470
 ie if if we lack 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.050
 specific tools or not and if the 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.000
 they have those social networks then the 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.810
 approach to publications is to say yes 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.830
 the type of publications are only text 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.780
 or we can also add video or they are 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.880
 only images because that will be important 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.670
 Take it into account when choosing a 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.940
 or another and then also the hierarchy and 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.110
 with that what I mean is in 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.960
 let say 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.310
 the publications that are going to have 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.970
 differentiation in publications 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.790
 between what users write and what 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.100
 that others write for example maybe to 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.050
 I am interested that what I publish 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.090
 be the most important and then my 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.740
 students can only comment on what 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.870
 I public or your comments always 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.610
 be in second place giving importance 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.490
 especially to what I publish, because 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.320
 example the administrator of the page or 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.740
 on the contrary perhaps what I 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.390
 interesting is that all the users 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.310
 that are part of the community and that 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.050
 publish they have the same importance is 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.600
 say all publications have the 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.310
 same weight and appear in the same 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.220
 space to speak 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.500
 here we would find for example in the 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.390
 pages on facebook we usually the 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.040
 pages the administrator of the page is 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.760
 the one that publishes the main content 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.830
 in front of the groups in which 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.629
 all publications of all 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.670
 users of the group are equal 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.370
 important and we will appear from 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.319
 chronological way in time but with 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.790
 the same importance because that will be 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.819
 important to keep it in mind at the time 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.319
 to choose a community or another then 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.590
 also closely related to the 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.650
 characteristics is if they will allow us 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.959
 perform searches and classify 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.610
 publications will be important to be able 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.039
 search within the community to be able to 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.020
 quickly recover in any 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:29.699
 moment then any content that 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.830
 we have or publication that we have uploaded 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.300
 but also in turn will be important 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.760
 can classify them 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.090
 of these publications also well for 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.860
 collect them and especially so for 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.990
 favor searches that in the 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.760
 most of the cases because it is already 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:50.430
 it supplements with the hashtags that we put 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.220
 although the hashtags were born with twitter 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.320
 but in most of the networks 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.960
 Most social media can be used 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.060
 these these hashtags or keywords 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.100
 that allow us to search 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.260
 related to 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.630
 all publications that have that 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.100
 keyword and then also some 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.980
 social networks even allow us 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:14.970
 add categories categories for 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:18.390
 classify those publications then the 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:22.470
 management is very important yes 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:24.600
 if this management of the network or 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.190
 of let's say the tool that 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.230
 let's use within the network to create 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.020
 the community is simple or it is not 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.020
 simple and above all if it meets the 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.570
 requirements that we need from 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.880
 administration in the case of our 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:42.750
 our community and then also if 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:46.530
 allows statistics to be able to obtain 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:48.450
 then know the activity that has 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.280
 been within our community to leave 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.600
 clear that most of the networks 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.850
 social 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.370
 the statistics are usually pretty 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.830
 poor even in some cases nor 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:02.220
 even they exist and others even as 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:05.400
 we have to install applications or 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.020
 associate third-party applications that 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.290
 third parties that in many cases are even 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.900
 they are for payment but the most important thing is 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:15.150
 feel comfortable in the network is to say 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.700
 work in a network in which we are 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.320
 accustomed and that we like it because if 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.330
 not in the end what will happen is that we are going to 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.330
 leave that network aside and then not 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.370
 We will publish or publish less 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.479
 this time will end up dying with what 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.849
 what we have to do 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:33.240
 above all it is 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:35.309
 well that will be comfortable and that 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.499
 we can work in a correct way 

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:40.139
 within that network and then it's also 

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:42.889
 important before choosing a network 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:46.770
 especially think about what we want 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:48.779
 have our community and already in function 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.759
 of what we want you to apply 

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:54.949
 For example, these criteria and 

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:54.949
 choose to choose a network or another
