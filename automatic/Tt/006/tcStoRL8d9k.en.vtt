00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.800
 mariel solís 2015 with a lot of work 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.460
 inside the jp racing thanks and much 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.429
 work 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.160
 we are working happy and 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:33.430
 preparing for the online race 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.650
 s track mouras tc mouras and tc track etc 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.110
 well we can do a survey of 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.870
 the pilots yes good thanks to them 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.240
 We have cars in all categories of 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.550
 the cpc 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.390
 would be on tc track mouras patán 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.190
 Where are you? Jonathan Vásquez 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.579
 continuous from last year 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.270
 adds valentín aguirre and luciano 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.660
 catch 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.700
 all with weepers after we continue on 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.420
 thirteen tracks continued juan martín with a 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.760
 change of brand 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.770
 go back to chevrolet 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.980
 and then I started good pass manual with 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.310
 a torino 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.710
 Guillermo continues with a chevrolet and 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.910
 pedrito happens to be conceived with whom 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.110
 you found what was the first 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.600
 impression when you saw these new 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.030
 structures in principle let's say the 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.030
 chevrolet structure we already knew 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.530
 for last year for the car gastón 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.970
 it's very similar to what we came 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.580
 working previously and the torino in 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:43.200
 the personal is almost new although I had 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:45.539
 some races with norberto in 2013 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.539
 the tiered structure is very similar to 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:51.030
 a chevrolet surely at levels 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.890
 dynamic are different highs but 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.030
 structurally similar 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.039
 we saw that we are working a lot with 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.539
 Tito Perez on the torino of the hands was 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.369
 as surely you will work in all 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.079
 the cars but there's something that worries you 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.329
 and something that disturbs you and something that 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.770
 this start of work is already 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.770
 complicating the new structure 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.650
 it requires some adjustments a little bit 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.440
 different to the chevrolet at the time of 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.720
 place the engine block but nothing 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.099
 worrying if we add to that the removes 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.500
 of aerodynamic loads you're going to see 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.180
 for this year how the work arises 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.730
 from here onwards for the 16 dates 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.970
 that come now good this is going to be very 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.920
 good because it opens a new book a 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.810
 new stage beyond structures and 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.269
 engines that also opens another path is 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.250
 they open two new roads one from the 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.780
 tuning 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.150
 good some let's grab for one side 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.870
 but for others it's a new seasoning 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.170
 I hope he gives 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.810
 a better show at tc 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.800
 I think it points to that and I think I was 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.930
 well on track 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.030
 so well that's going to give you a 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.020
 seasoning because it came with 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.240
 regulations 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.950
 very similar technicians beyond the 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.500
 engine changes at chassis level we come 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.780
 we had been bringing a regulation that did not 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.490
 he changed he said time and good we 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.930
 forces now to look for new ones 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.430
 alternatives to try to go fast 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.560
 doing a little bit of history of what 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.300
 what has been 2014 I understand understand 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.040
 that for the team it has been good more 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.110
 beyond achievements beyond the 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.180
 championships I think that at the time 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.960
 to evaluate the work of the whole team 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.720
 it has been positive 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.760
 if on a global level it was positive 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.370
 surely that if I started to humanize in 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.140
 particular there is some objective that is not 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.459
 they got 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:37.319
 but if we evaluate the global, I think it's 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:39.659
 acceptable let's say we arrived 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.340
 to the last races with the year 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:44.340
 fighting the championship with possibilities 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.730
 and in some cases not that is the goal 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.560
 that we do not meet in 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.360
 I consider that I have not reached the 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.500
 last of the year 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.490
 with possibilities with guillermo nothing 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.490
 it is a failure
