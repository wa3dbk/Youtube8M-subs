00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.440
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.049
 today we are going to reuse a bottle of 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.429
 plastic making this keychain if not 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.620
 you want to miss any video of 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.350
 recycling I invite you to subscribe here 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.900
 in the upper left hand give a 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.550
 I like and share this video well 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.180
 before starting with asturias and coffee from 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.370
 Today I wanted to show you what I did with 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.400
 gummies following my tutorial 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:34.250
 friend Olga in her channel is modality of 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.620
 I'll leave you the link here for 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.570
 that you can visit it in addition 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.340
 I also made this bracelet 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.320
 starting so I've done the most 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.970
 simple but the truth is that you go 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.820
 to continue because I loved all the 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.250
 details that can be made with gummies 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.739
 thanks to olga who shows us how 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.630
 do well let's continue with our 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.540
 recycling today the first thing we do 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.270
 is to cut with the part of the bottle the 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.899
 silver part that we are going to use and 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.009
 we will also cut out the images that 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.590
 let's go to need 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.049
 I'll stick've put 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.210
 double-sided tape and I'm going to paste it 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.820
 well once we have stuck we have 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.189
 our image for our keychain the 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.020
 next step is going to be look for the side 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.880
 that we can use from the bottle 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.149
 then placed the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.810
 the image that I want to put more or less 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.550
 in the center and here I'm going to fold everything 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.650
 there 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.580
 and that one of the piece of plastic that I'm going to 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:39.140
 use so I cut the leftover 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.140
 Now I'm going to measure the height 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.670
 Now what I'm going to do is cut off the 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.120
 corners so that these tips do not remain 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.950
 that are a little bit dangerous 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.410
 I just round up the 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.670
 corners this way and the next 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:58.460
 step is going to be making the holes in the 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.400
 plastic and starts to make holes in 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.260
 all the edge let's do a technique 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.870
 that we have already used several times with 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.840
 crochet to make an edge more or less 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:12.290
 every centimeter we are making a 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.420
 hole in the two layers of plastic a 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.190
 the time well once finished just from 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.410
 holes included the side that is 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.990
 bent 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.210
 Now let's start knitting we will 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.730
 take the crochet needle and the thread in 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:29.160
 I have picked it blue color 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:35.520
 that the image that I have and I'm starting 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.520
 to weave then I introduce the needle 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.930
 and I begin to weave with you already 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.410
 have done this technique several times 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.930
 that I imagine you already know how to 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.150
 work let's make half points 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.180
 so here I have one that I'm going to do 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.240
 three three in each hole once 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.950
 I have all three I make a chain and 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.080
 I go back to do three more and when I go 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.870
 coming to the corner I do the three that 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.140
 correspond to this side that I am 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.300
 doing I make two chains and I do the 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.490
 three that correspond to the other side that 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.010
 I'm doing in the same hole before 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.240
 to close everything we are going to put the image 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.360
 what are we going to put inside 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.850
 and now we are going to finish closing it 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.430
 once we have done the last 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:27.640
 we make a chain and a point 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.950
 slipped to join with the first one and 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.410
 this and what is left over already know that what 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.930
 we lose inside the tissue that we have 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.020
 well and now to finish we're going to do 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:43.370
 another hole taking another nozzle in 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:45.319
 a little corner and let's put the buttonhole 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.030
 we have put the buttonhole now 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.030
 we only have to put the ring 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.970
 we put the ring now we put the 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.700
 chain and the key ring and how 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.280
 you can see here we already have our 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.470
 good keychain then nothing else I hope that 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.239
 you liked today's recycling and 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.610
 that you do too and do not 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.590

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.750
