00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.299 
five cases to solve they sell at retail
and<00:00:42.600> come<00:00:42.809> with<00:00:42.930> five<00:00:43.110> cases<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.860> it's

lot of you know forensics work using the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.670 
lot of you know forensics work using the
fingerprint<00:01:03.329> brush<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:03.989> luminol<00:01:04.409> and

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
fingerprint brush and the luminol and

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.870 
fingerprint brush and the luminol and

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
you know we're gonna start by taking a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.310 
you know we're gonna start by taking a
look<00:01:12.090> at<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.360> guy<00:01:12.509> we'll<00:01:12.750> open<00:01:12.840> up<00:01:12.990> our<00:01:13.170> tool

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
look at this guy we'll open up our tool

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.940 
look at this guy we'll open up our tool
box<00:01:13.700> take<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> picture<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.299> scene

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.840 

and<00:01:21.460> as<00:01:21.700> you<00:01:21.850> go<00:01:21.969> through<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.299> cases<00:01:22.619> it'll<00:01:23.850> we

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
and as you go through the cases it'll we

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.429 
and as you go through the cases it'll we
kind<00:01:25.030> of<00:01:25.090> piece<00:01:25.299> together<00:01:25.509> what<00:01:25.869> happens<00:01:26.229> so

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
kind of piece together what happens so

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.139 
kind of piece together what happens so
based<00:01:26.649> on<00:01:26.799> the<00:01:26.920> forensics<00:01:27.399> that<00:01:27.460> we<00:01:27.700> find<00:01:27.939> the

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
based on the forensics that we find the

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.389 
based on the forensics that we find the
csi's<00:01:28.600> will<00:01:28.869> tell<00:01:29.020> us<00:01:29.170> well<00:01:29.740> what<00:01:29.890> does<00:01:30.250> that

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
csi's will tell us well what does that

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.749 
csi's will tell us well what does that
mean<00:01:30.579> about<00:01:30.759> this<00:01:31.060> particular<00:01:32.429> you<00:01:33.429> know<00:01:33.549> what

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
mean about this particular you know what

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.100 
mean about this particular you know what
we<00:01:33.880> found<00:01:34.030> what<00:01:34.299> does<00:01:34.420> that<00:01:34.539> mean<00:01:34.750> about<00:01:34.929> the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
we found what does that mean about the

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.559 
we found what does that mean about the
crime<00:01:36.039> and<00:01:36.070> how<00:01:36.520> well<00:01:36.670> can<00:01:36.789> we<00:01:36.850> have<00:01:37.149> what<00:01:37.479> can

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
crime and how well can we have what can

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.440 
crime and how well can we have what can
we<00:01:37.659> deduce<00:01:37.840> from<00:01:38.170> that<00:01:38.670> do<00:01:39.670> you<00:01:39.759> play<00:01:39.939> like<00:01:40.270> a

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
we deduce from that do you play like a

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.179 
we deduce from that do you play like a
one<00:01:40.630> specific<00:01:41.140> character<00:01:41.500> in<00:01:41.619> this<00:01:41.770> game<00:01:41.829> you

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
one specific character in this game you

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.209 
one specific character in this game you
play<00:01:42.220> we're<00:01:43.030> kind<00:01:43.240> of<00:01:43.299> the<00:01:43.420> anonymous<00:01:44.219> partner

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
play we're kind of the anonymous partner

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:47.459 
play we're kind of the anonymous partner
so<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.789> it's<00:01:46.119> unlike<00:01:46.659> sama<00:01:46.899> max<00:01:47.140> which<00:01:47.319> is<00:01:47.350> a

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
so the it's unlike sama max which is a

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:48.899 
so the it's unlike sama max which is a
third-person<00:01:47.890> game<00:01:48.189> this<00:01:48.340> is<00:01:48.490> a<00:01:48.520> first-person

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
third-person game this is a first-person

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.550 
third-person game this is a first-person
game<00:01:49.179> so<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.450> idea<00:01:49.689> is<00:01:49.780> we're<00:01:50.020> actually<00:01:50.200> the

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
game so the idea is we're actually the

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.240 
game so the idea is we're actually the
partner<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.219> you<00:01:52.119> know<00:01:52.240> if<00:01:52.329> we<00:01:52.450> if<00:01:52.689> we<00:01:52.840> go<00:01:52.990> over

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
partner and you know if we if we go over

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:01.060 
partner and you know if we if we go over
and<00:01:54.250> talk<00:01:54.549> to<00:01:54.580> our<00:01:54.880> partner<00:01:55.209> Nick<00:01:55.390> here<00:01:55.689> that's

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.930 

and<00:02:02.070> I'm<00:02:02.190> not<00:02:02.310> sure<00:02:02.460> if<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.580> can<00:02:02.700> get<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.850> them

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
and I'm not sure if I can get to them

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.640 
and I'm not sure if I can get to them
but<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.180> can<00:02:03.540> talk<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.870> the<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.230> can<00:02:04.380> talk<00:02:04.530> to

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
but you can talk to the you can talk to

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.450 
but you can talk to the you can talk to
the<00:02:04.740> CSIS

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
the CSIS

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.070 
the CSIS
you<00:02:05.820> can<00:02:06.000> go<00:02:06.120> into<00:02:06.300> the<00:02:06.450> lab<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.660> kind<00:02:07.020> of

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
you can go into the lab and kind of

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.600 
you can go into the lab and kind of
interact<00:02:07.440> with<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.650> CSIS<00:02:08.100> and<00:02:08.340> figure<00:02:08.550> out

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
interact with the CSIS and figure out

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.710 
interact with the CSIS and figure out
the<00:02:08.789> case<00:02:08.970> together<00:02:11.270> and<00:02:12.270> that's<00:02:12.450> something

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
the case together and that's something

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.420 
the case together and that's something
the<00:02:12.840> CSI<00:02:13.200> games<00:02:13.410> have<00:02:13.590> always<00:02:13.710> been<00:02:13.980> like<00:02:14.190> that

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
the CSI games have always been like that

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.940 
the CSI games have always been like that
there<00:02:15.270> were<00:02:15.360> three<00:02:15.600> CSI<00:02:16.080> games<00:02:16.290> made<00:02:16.560> before

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
there were three CSI games made before

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.680 
there were three CSI games made before
telltale<00:02:17.520> got<00:02:17.700> involved<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.270> they<00:02:18.360> we

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
telltale got involved and they we

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.180 
telltale got involved and they we
probably<00:02:19.260> kind<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.560> same<00:02:19.709> format<00:02:20.070> that

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
probably kind of the same format that

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.600 
probably kind of the same format that
was<00:02:20.280> set<00:02:20.490> up<00:02:20.520> by<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:21.390> original

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
was set up by the original

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.770 
was set up by the original
but<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:26.670> know<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.880> gameplay<00:02:27.270> itself<00:02:27.570> is

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
but the you know the gameplay itself is

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.510 
but the you know the gameplay itself is
really<00:02:27.990> very<00:02:28.200> similar<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.890> game<00:02:28.980> like<00:02:29.310> Sam

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
really very similar to a game like Sam

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.450 
really very similar to a game like Sam
MX<00:02:29.850> or<00:02:30.150> another<00:02:30.900> adventure<00:02:31.170> games<00:02:31.560> so<00:02:32.220> here<00:02:32.370> is

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
MX or another adventure games so here is

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.710 
MX or another adventure games so here is
talking<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.790> us<00:02:32.910> now<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:36.420> know<00:02:36.540> where

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
talking to us now and you know where

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.710 
talking to us now and you know where
where<00:02:37.430> there's<00:02:38.430> kind<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.790> story<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.420> it's

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
where there's kind of a story and it's

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.150 
where there's kind of a story and it's
like<00:02:39.900> an<00:02:40.020> episode<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.470> TV<00:02:40.620> show<00:02:40.770> by<00:02:41.100> the

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
like an episode of the TV show by the

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.560 
like an episode of the TV show by the
end<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.640> case<00:02:41.820> we're<00:02:42.030> gonna<00:02:42.090> find<00:02:42.450> out

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
end of the case we're gonna find out

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.330 
end of the case we're gonna find out
what<00:02:42.690> happened<00:02:43.050> but<00:02:43.560> we<00:02:43.680> have<00:02:43.770> to<00:02:43.890> kind<00:02:44.070> of<00:02:44.130> get

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
what happened but we have to kind of get

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.060 
what happened but we have to kind of get
there<00:02:44.580> using<00:02:45.000> forensics<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:46.380> when<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.650> solve

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
there using forensics so when you solve

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.580 
there using forensics so when you solve
a<00:02:47.430> crime<00:02:47.760> do<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.300> then<00:02:48.750> get<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:48.960> more<00:02:49.320> difficult

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
a crime do you then get a more difficult

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.610 
a crime do you then get a more difficult
one<00:02:49.950> after<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.900> that's<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:52.020> good<00:02:52.140> question<00:02:52.200> I

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
one after that that's a good question I

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
one after that that's a good question I
don't<00:02:52.680> think<00:02:52.980> they're<00:02:53.100> actually<00:02:53.220> more

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
don't think they're actually more

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.270 
don't think they're actually more
difficult<00:02:53.790> as<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.209> go<00:02:54.420> through<00:02:54.720> but<00:02:54.959> our<00:02:55.620> CSI

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
difficult as you go through but our CSI

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.560 
difficult as you go through but our CSI
games<00:02:56.490> compared<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.060> ones<00:02:57.209> we<00:02:57.360> care<00:02:57.510> that

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
games compared to the ones we care that

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.449 
games compared to the ones we care that
came<00:02:57.840> before<00:02:57.990> them<00:02:58.320> where<00:02:58.620> we<00:02:59.010> worked<00:02:59.220> really

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
came before them where we worked really

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.070 
came before them where we worked really
hard<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.970> make<00:03:00.120> them<00:03:00.330> more<00:03:00.510> difficult<00:03:00.660> because

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
hard to make them more difficult because

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.479 
hard to make them more difficult because
one<00:03:01.290> of<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.470> complaints<00:03:01.980> about<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.280> early

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
one of the complaints about the early

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:03.620 
one of the complaints about the early
games<00:03:02.670> was<00:03:02.850> that<00:03:02.940> they<00:03:03.060> were<00:03:03.120> too<00:03:03.300> short<00:03:03.540> and

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
games was that they were too short and

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.229 
games was that they were too short and
too<00:03:03.750> easy<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.350> for<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.040> TV<00:03:05.310> viewing<00:03:05.670> audience<00:03:06.090> I

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
too easy and for a TV viewing audience I

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.580 
too easy and for a TV viewing audience I
might<00:03:06.360> be<00:03:06.450> okay<00:03:06.540> because<00:03:06.870> they're<00:03:06.989> not<00:03:07.140> gamers

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
might be okay because they're not gamers

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.280 
might be okay because they're not gamers
but<00:03:08.310> for<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.700> gaming<00:03:09.209> audience<00:03:09.300> since<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:10.080> want

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
but for a gaming audience since you want

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.199 
but for a gaming audience since you want
something<00:03:10.620> that's<00:03:10.770> more<00:03:10.890> challenging<00:03:11.209> so

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
something that's more challenging so

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.360 
something that's more challenging so
you've<00:03:12.540> actually<00:03:12.720> got<00:03:13.220> some<00:03:14.220> more

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
you've actually got some more

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.350 
you've actually got some more
complicated<00:03:15.030> gameplay<00:03:15.360> in<00:03:16.220> in<00:03:17.220> our<00:03:17.400> games<00:03:17.640> and

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
complicated gameplay in in our games and

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.479 
complicated gameplay in in our games and
then<00:03:18.570> there's<00:03:18.750> also<00:03:19.190> bonuses<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.370> know

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
then there's also bonuses you know

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.420 
then there's also bonuses you know
there's<00:03:20.700> if<00:03:21.090> you'll<00:03:21.300> if<00:03:21.570> you<00:03:21.950> look<00:03:22.950> around<00:03:23.250> the

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
there's if you'll if you look around the

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.890 
there's if you'll if you look around the
crime<00:03:23.610> scene<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.060> see<00:03:24.120> things<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:24.630> might<00:03:24.720> not

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
crime scene and see things it might not

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.770 
crime scene and see things it might not
be<00:03:25.020> critical<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.590> case<00:03:25.800> but<00:03:26.580> you<00:03:26.820> find<00:03:27.120> you

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
be critical to the case but you find you

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.820 
be critical to the case but you find you
know<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:27.959> look<00:03:28.230> at<00:03:28.350> all<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.560> nooks<00:03:28.769> and

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
know you look at all the nooks and

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.620 
know you look at all the nooks and
crannies<00:03:28.920> you<00:03:29.340> get<00:03:29.489> more<00:03:29.640> points<00:03:29.850> there's<00:03:30.540> a

around<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.900> scene<00:03:40.080> I<00:03:40.110> think<00:03:40.260> there's<00:03:40.530> one<00:03:40.650> in

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.920 
around the scene I think there's one in
here<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.010> pick<00:03:41.190> it<00:03:41.340> up<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:41.880> if<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.480> find<00:03:42.750> all

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
here and pick it up and if you find all

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.350 
here and pick it up and if you find all
of<00:03:42.959> them<00:03:43.230> you<00:03:44.220> get<00:03:44.430> extra<00:03:44.730> points<00:03:44.910> in<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.239> end
