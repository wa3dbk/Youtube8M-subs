 Small groups were doing so over it 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.019

 thick and not so big cracks in it 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.200
 I'm a bit hasty 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.190

 trough 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.980
 that's where all the meat goes 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.540
 together in the middle and then get 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.819

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.549
 our two pans in view and 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:04.139
 of course a bit of oil here 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:09.000
 Rhine from here also so that takes already 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:09.000

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:14.740
 minutes I finished we are the way 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.360

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.840

 all ingredients are ready and now 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:49.749
 we can start our citizens too 

00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:55.599
 to build 

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:59.449
 one side we make ketchup on it 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:02.559

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:09.909
 alone with the salad 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:09.909
 The order is almost irrelevant 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:19.479
 do the onion rings here and 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:24.800
 uigurs go in 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:37.909

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:40.269

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:09.970
 I think he can be seen 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:13.250
