us and I had an RPG so yeah that was a

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.670 
us and I had an RPG so yeah that was a
pretty<00:06:52.170> epic<00:06:52.350> win<00:06:52.740> so<00:06:53.040> then<00:06:53.250> we<00:06:53.880> just<00:06:54.470> get<00:06:55.470> in

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
pretty epic win so then we just get in

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.990

00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 
cars and head to the checkpoint so

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.640 
cars and head to the checkpoint so
basically<00:07:00.000> I<00:07:00.120> got<00:07:00.450> my<00:07:00.630> own<00:07:00.750> car<00:07:00.780> because<00:07:01.470> of

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:01.650 
basically I got my own car because of

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.440 
basically I got my own car because of
what<00:07:01.830> happened<00:07:02.160> before<00:07:02.280> and<00:07:02.760> I<00:07:02.940> told<00:07:03.000> them<00:07:03.270> to

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:03.450 
what happened before and I told them to

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.140 
what happened before and I told them to
wait<00:07:03.480> and<00:07:03.990> then<00:07:04.140> I<00:07:04.260> go<00:07:04.710> in<00:07:04.890> ahead<00:07:05.280> and<00:07:05.670> then<00:07:05.880> I

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.150 
wait and then I go in ahead and then I

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.180 
wait and then I go in ahead and then I
guess<00:07:06.690> I'd<00:07:06.930> get<00:07:07.170> blown<00:07:07.440> up<00:07:07.650> or<00:07:07.860> whatever
