00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.100
 rafa the key to mega sports from the 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.720
 Mexico City and accompanied by a 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.300
 great friend dominates chopper istan 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.380
 again or nacho the first grace 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.660
 for being with us but again 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.519
 again Juan Manuel Marquez returns to the 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.670
 Quadrilateral everyone happy as is 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.670
 you 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.440
 worried because the principle of 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.950
 training will be difficult for us 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.530
 the lack of sparring 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.990
 We hope to solve our week on 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:32.940
 fact that he's a lefty is timothy 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.560
 bradley is not natural but he is fighting 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.110
 right thats that 's what part that 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.600
 It bothers you that you do not 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.570
 but as it favors us a bit 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.730
 because they changed it of hers 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.180
 he does not know if he's right handed left 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.190
 before trying to say if it facilitates 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.100
 things the question that everyone does the 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.870
 nachos when deciding bradley or the 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.150
 fifth with manny pacquiao what was the 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.130
 decisive decision you know here he 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.890
 where the captain does not govern the sailor 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.280
 not then the pattern is juan and he is the 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.260
 who decides what it is and I believe that what I 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.880
 I must continue because it is successful I 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.030
 had told him to look for the title 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.440
 turn would be ideal and right now do not think 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.080
 both in the money but in the 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.150
 possibility to leave your name written 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.430
 in the world deduction book with 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.740
 golden letter and something that I already believe that already 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.970
 is more than written or nacho but you 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.430
 believes that the fifth title of 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.840
 I definitely miss Juan Manuel 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.910
 marquez in history not only the 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.650
 Mexican boxing but that put world me 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.200
 I think it is already is already a must 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.170
 be not but it is obvious that it is to be 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.830
 world champion for the fifth time in 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.440
 different divisions 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.080
 mark plus its step by the boxing the 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.100
 I remember the people who 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.320
 that takes statistics 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.689
 rice by Juan Manuel Marquez as 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.009
 young man or nacho imagined that he was going to 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.570
 get to write so much history in the 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.509
 boxing going on his side I've had several 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.340
 fighters with faculties however not 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:04.630
 all had the vocation that has 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.960
 john of how unbreakable his way 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.110
 live your sport and that's what I 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.209
 keeps there and the class of course you 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.360
 recommends the next make-up artist good 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.950
 because this one I would like him to fight 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.350
 because he is going to take a 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.230
 no bills but but no no I think 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.870
 that it's already fair that his family 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.840
 enjoyment good there we were then 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.970
 everything ready today the account has already started 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.060
 regressive for bradley against marquez the 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.950
 October 12 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.560

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.890
 I do not know but we are going to work intensely 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.310
 to try to achieve it and we are 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.330
 then accompanied by the legendary 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.250
 coach and great friend don nacho 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.880
 Beristain I am Rafael Mayor from the
