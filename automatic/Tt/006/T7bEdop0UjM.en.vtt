that you kind of daydream /live in and
people<00:00:59.910> that's<00:01:00.300> why<00:01:00.449> they<00:01:00.539> call<00:01:00.690> multiple

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
people that's why they call multiple

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.540 
people that's why they call multiple
personality<00:01:01.530> because<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.770> actually<00:01:01.980> can

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
personality because you actually can

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.399 
personality because you actually can
create<00:01:02.850> like<00:01:03.000> an<00:01:03.090> alter-ego<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.719> some<00:01:04.019> extent

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
create like an alter-ego to some extent

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.020 
create like an alter-ego to some extent
and<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.589> could<00:01:04.739> kind<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:04.979> live<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.610> land

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
and you could kind of live in that land

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.899 
and you could kind of live in that land
so<00:01:06.500> imagine<00:01:07.500> if<00:01:07.619> your<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:08.250> know<00:01:08.280> daydream<00:01:08.580> and

I'll have all these dogs or whatever you

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.320 
I'll have all these dogs or whatever you
can<00:01:15.990> create<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.619> happier<00:01:17.400> place<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.150> is

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
can create a happier place and this is

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.030 
can create a happier place and this is
something<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.780> we<00:01:18.960> do<00:01:19.200> kind<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.680> as<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> way<00:01:19.890> to

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
something that we do kind of as a way to

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.249 
something that we do kind of as a way to
cope<00:01:20.369> which<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.729> why<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.210> linked<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:21.900> much<00:01:22.080> to

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
cope which is why it's linked so much to

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.800 
cope which is why it's linked so much to
PTSD<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.729> difference<00:01:24.119> being<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.659> have

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
PTSD the difference being you can have

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.620 
PTSD the difference being you can have
PTSD<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.619> dissociate<00:01:26.280> sometimes<00:01:26.790> but<00:01:27.509> if

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
PTSD and dissociate sometimes but if

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.109 
PTSD and dissociate sometimes but if
it's<00:01:28.470> taking<00:01:28.890> up<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.100> significant<00:01:29.670> portion<00:01:29.850> of

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
it's taking up a significant portion of

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.140 
it's taking up a significant portion of
your<00:01:30.180> time<00:01:30.689> then<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.770> would<00:01:31.890> be<00:01:32.040> di<00:01:32.280> D<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.820> you

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
your time then it would be di D and you

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.870 
your time then it would be di D and you
can<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:33.420> PTSD<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.530> di<00:01:35.070> D<00:01:35.250> but<00:01:35.579> they<00:01:35.670> don't

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
can have PTSD and di D but they don't

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.359 
can have PTSD and di D but they don't
always<00:01:36.150> happen<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.840> way<00:01:37.040> okay<00:01:38.040> does<00:01:38.340> that

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
always happen that way okay does that

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.550 
always happen that way okay does that
make<00:01:38.579> sense<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.110> sometimes<00:01:40.110> you'll<00:01:40.200> have<00:01:40.320> one

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
make sense so sometimes you'll have one

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.920 
make sense so sometimes you'll have one
with<00:01:40.799> you'll<00:01:41.369> have<00:01:41.549> dissociation<00:01:42.060> with<00:01:42.360> PTSD

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
with you'll have dissociation with PTSD

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.560 
with you'll have dissociation with PTSD
but<00:01:43.229> only<00:01:43.710> if<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.159> taking<00:01:44.460> up<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.640> significant

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
but only if it's taking up a significant

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.399 
but only if it's taking up a significant
portion<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.899> time<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.439> actually<00:01:46.560> di<00:01:46.979> D<00:01:47.130> okay

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
portion of time is of actually di D okay

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.260 
portion of time is of actually di D okay
question<00:01:49.409> number<00:01:49.439> two<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.670> normal<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.000> just

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
question number two is it normal to just

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.300 
question number two is it normal to just
start<00:01:51.509> crying<00:01:51.780> I've<00:01:52.320> gotten<00:01:52.649> this<00:01:52.710> question<00:01:52.860> I

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
start crying I've gotten this question I

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
just crying it's usually because we're

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.559 
just crying it's usually because we're
really<00:02:10.440> overwhelmed<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.310> our<00:02:12.060> anxieties

really overwhelmed and our anxieties

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.610

is<00:02:13.799> really<00:02:14.069> bad<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:15.450> smallest<00:02:15.959> things<00:02:16.260> or

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
is really bad and the smallest things or

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.259 
is really bad and the smallest things or
nothing<00:02:17.010> really<00:02:17.190> can<00:02:17.430> just<00:02:17.459> set<00:02:17.790> us<00:02:17.909> off<00:02:18.090> right

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
nothing really can just set us off right

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.830 
nothing really can just set us off right
and<00:02:18.540> then<00:02:18.659> we<00:02:18.810> instantly<00:02:19.530> start<00:02:19.799> crying

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
and then we instantly start crying

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
and then we instantly start crying
because<00:02:22.580> another<00:02:23.580> thing<00:02:23.819> to<00:02:23.909> think<00:02:23.940> about<00:02:24.150> is

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
because another thing to think about is

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.369 
because another thing to think about is
what<00:02:25.860> we<00:02:26.010> hypothesize<00:02:26.940> as<00:02:27.360> being<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.930> reason

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
what we hypothesize as being the reason

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.910 
what we hypothesize as being the reason
for<00:02:28.650> our<00:02:28.980> depression<00:02:29.849> and<00:02:30.299> anxiety<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.680> stuff

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
for our depression and anxiety and stuff

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.009 
for our depression and anxiety and stuff
like<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.430> kind<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:33.030> the

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
like that is kind of a the

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.670 
like that is kind of a the
neurotransmitters<00:02:34.860> in<00:02:34.980> our<00:02:35.069> brain<00:02:35.299> aren't

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
neurotransmitters in our brain aren't

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.069 
neurotransmitters in our brain aren't
keeping<00:02:37.819> our<00:02:38.819> dopamine<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.540> serotonin<00:02:39.569> at

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
keeping our dopamine and serotonin at

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.050 
keeping our dopamine and serotonin at
the<00:02:40.170> right<00:02:40.319> levels<00:02:40.739> that's<00:02:41.370> what<00:02:41.909> they

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
the right levels that's what they

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.690 
the right levels that's what they
hypothesize<00:02:42.780> right<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:43.890> those<00:02:44.489> are<00:02:44.670> very

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
hypothesize right so those are very

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.569 
hypothesize right so those are very
clearly<00:02:45.209> linked<00:02:45.569> hormones<00:02:46.109> and<00:02:46.530> affects<00:02:47.430> our

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
clearly linked hormones and affects our

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.300 
clearly linked hormones and affects our
mood<00:02:47.849> and<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:48.569> things<00:02:48.959> if<00:02:49.260> we're<00:02:49.769> depressed<00:02:50.160> or

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
mood and so things if we're depressed or

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.000 
mood and so things if we're depressed or
anxious<00:02:50.970> are<00:02:51.420> kind<00:02:52.379> of<00:02:52.440> mood<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:52.739> our

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
anxious are kind of mood and our

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.559 
anxious are kind of mood and our
hormones<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.670> all<00:02:53.760> that<00:02:53.940> stuff<00:02:54.060> is<00:02:54.180> going<00:02:54.329> all

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
hormones and all that stuff is going all

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.180

out<00:02:54.599> of<00:02:54.780> whack<00:02:54.959> so<00:02:55.200> we<00:02:55.290> might<00:02:55.500> just<00:02:55.530> cry<00:02:55.890> for<00:02:56.099> no

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
out of whack so we might just cry for no

out of whack so we might just cry for no
reason<00:02:56.459> you<00:02:56.519> might<00:02:56.670> want<00:02:57.359> to<00:02:57.480> yell<00:02:58.079> at<00:02:58.440> someone
