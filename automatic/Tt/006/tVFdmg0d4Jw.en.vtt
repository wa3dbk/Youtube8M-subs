 the line 4 l TSI no male domain we do not want to accept that more exactly 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.709
 watching movies 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.509
 large touch screen 3 12 had in the diagonal 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:18.399
 Here are the all keys to accept calls 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:24.439
 Hang up call and in the middle of a mini keyboard that are so Cape's streets 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.249
 who practically put their money and drive belts 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:28.460
 here one page 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.079
 Date everything solved in practice namely percent and shift 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.620
 Differences 9 the slot for 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.970
 a the usb cable 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.970
 Here we go in Beijing connection for the headphones 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.990
 you can press it on and around it here 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.990
 pull the Pako cover backwards 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.500
 Here we now see the 5-megapixel camera with a desk 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.800
 schneider-kreuznach optics 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.800
 and not the EEG 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.470
 here would be the canal route and then we have one up here 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.600
 Volume control 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.139
 so while now were not giving min this cell phones need to deal with 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.380
 that's the surface that's made stylish 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.860
 Adel Chihi directly for services Farina mobile percent 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.060
 designed 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.880
 90 it creaks 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.329
 and that is stupid 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.329
 Bentley was allowed to set up 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.600
 you can practice here 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.760
 and loads are on the net 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.510
 four pages 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.260
 So you have 2 4 Home Screens and it depends on him with the 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.980
 with the first start screen date you can arrange per gram the one on the 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.330
 common 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.900
 used 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.800
 on the hunt second side 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.410
 Percent one finds now now one can naturally also per cent depending on 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.390
 Adjust demand 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.740
 then bought 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.730
 Victor Fritzen side 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.220
 One can get his year favorite among the contacts 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.019
 save it so that you are particularly fast 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.879
 can contact 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.900
 and here on the last page you still bang those 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:18.219
 Multimedia favorites so far but still no one 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:21.219
 Music and also no wave hit therefore one finds rather not 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:26.959
 Add Qantas by listening to the patience that parents receive 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:31.179
 who has the opportunity to work the bookmarks then you can get out music and 

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:32.019
 Gaddafi 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.739
 select and that's how eggs work 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.419
 high on the other pages 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.819
 now there is nothing in his nest to smell, therefore nothing can 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.169
 Add 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.169
 just now 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:51.329
 and it still looked 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.430
 in Cocoa it is so out of hand that it is in the four categories 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.309
 divided 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:00.309
 and not as omens communication 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.889
 the Namibier multimedia application 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:06.299
 in the settings 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.359
 You can do more here 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.519
 a to the side 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.729
 Scroll 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:14.689
 in all four parts 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:15.859
 by a bit 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.879
 You can also press individual symbols longer 

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:23.449
 that someone can adjust the heat to their own needs, so that's what you have to do 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:26.609
 be honest the phone can be very well individualized and 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.039
 personalize and 

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:31.059
 whenever I adapt to my own needs and needs 

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:33.829
 and the whole turns into landscape mode 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.129
 Hartmut that the key lock narrower 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.789
 when that once gave rise to the end 

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:42.209
 you see the complete ones 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.619
 Mimi points at once after, however, parts without caption 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.969
 being many of the symbols 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:50.269
 definitely percent 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.459
 suffice and percent 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.509
 yes he in per year or communicate what is behind it 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.469
 it's a shame 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:01.469
 It may be a place which is the highest 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:08.879
 working around but it is not a year that is not so they march 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.730
 should be planned so that you can really install many more programs 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.059
 yes the other cops stress can not change 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.389
 its ensuing 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.840
 Now we are happy 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.840
 that are locked 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.689
 alone helps measuring times 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.889
 and then there are several 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.309
 possibilities 

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:40.090
 and on the import 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.110
 in portrait format, I have almost never as normal 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.849
 mobile phone keyboard 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.379
 and no one has put him an entry or exit percentage 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:50.290
 now is Blatter 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.699
 driven up by now Estrada 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.900
 Percent set 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.370
 with the most accurate here that does not work quite as well 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.180
 that the faction pulls Beckers I realized that one had pressed 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.139
 but I already have it 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.610
 why we talk 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.809
 in percentages you miss again that's a pity 

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:10.169
 yes if Mainz changes landscape then remember 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.169
 really putting out a qwerty keyboard 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.639
 and here too 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.389
 you have to be possible 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.069
 keeps a close eye on where to go 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:23.180
 at the 90th 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.879
 relatively fast 9 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:28.990
 and so a few millimeters mislead others 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.990
 "We seem to be talking about the topics of fake showers 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:36.360
 that means you have to try a bit more while doing the go types 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.770
 does not work so well for the new patch 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.249
 if the Lord Chad need 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:40.949
 mobile phone keyboard
