00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
quite a cool cart I think it's I think

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.210 
quite a cool cart I think it's I think
it's<00:04:02.389> for<00:04:02.959> bringing<00:04:03.290> villages<00:04:03.859> up<00:04:03.980> from<00:04:04.130> when

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
it's for bringing villages up from when

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.039 
it's for bringing villages up from when
I<00:04:04.280> can<00:04:04.400> tell<00:04:04.579> all<00:04:05.450> the<00:04:05.510> way<00:04:05.599> up<00:04:05.690> here<00:04:05.840> to<00:04:05.900> the

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
I can tell all the way up here to the

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.020 
I can tell all the way up here to the
top<00:04:06.079> to<00:04:06.530> try<00:04:06.709> and<00:04:06.829> refute<00:04:07.459> I<00:04:07.489> guess<00:04:07.639> is<00:04:07.880> just

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
top to try and refute I guess is just

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.080 
top to try and refute I guess is just
refilling<00:04:09.250> villages<00:04:10.250> or<00:04:10.430> you're<00:04:10.790> still

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
refilling villages or you're still

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.150 
refilling villages or you're still
making<00:04:11.329> it<00:04:11.630> cuts<00:04:12.200> beacons<00:04:12.590> all<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:12.919> way<00:04:12.979> down

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
making it cuts beacons all the way down

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.360 
making it cuts beacons all the way down
here<00:04:13.400> so<00:04:13.579> let's<00:04:13.759> just<00:04:14.389> head<00:04:14.449> back<00:04:14.630> inside<00:04:15.370> I'm

liked this horse farm so you jump to
open<00:04:44.180> it<00:04:44.300> so<00:04:44.780> I'm<00:04:44.840> guessing<00:04:45.169> with<00:04:45.470> it<00:04:45.590> so<00:04:45.860> this

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
open it so I'm guessing with it so this

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.950 
open it so I'm guessing with it so this
this<00:04:46.699> is<00:04:46.849> why<00:04:47.030> it<00:04:47.090> up<00:04:47.270> to<00:04:47.419> open<00:04:47.509> it<00:04:47.720> so<00:04:47.810> this

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
this is why it up to open it so this

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.219 
this is why it up to open it so this
trip<00:04:48.169> wire<00:04:48.380> here<00:04:48.650> if<00:04:49.130> you<00:04:49.250> can<00:04:49.400> see<00:04:49.430> it<00:04:50.229> that's

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
trip wire here if you can see it that's

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.200 
trip wire here if you can see it that's
what<00:04:51.500> does<00:04:51.650> it<00:04:51.770> so<00:04:51.860> I'm<00:04:51.919> guessing<00:04:52.160> it<00:04:52.880> means

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
what does it so I'm guessing it means

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.060 
what does it so I'm guessing it means
you<00:04:53.599> can<00:04:53.750> set<00:04:53.960> it<00:04:53.990> off<00:04:54.169> or<00:04:54.410> one<00:04:54.560> my<00:04:54.680> pressing
