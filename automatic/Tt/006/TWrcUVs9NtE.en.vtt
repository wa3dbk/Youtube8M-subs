00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
it doesn't blend right at the base with

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.060 
it doesn't blend right at the base with
the<00:01:10.560> orange<00:01:11.509> and<00:01:12.509> then<00:01:13.259> for<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> orange<00:01:13.950> and

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
the orange and then for the orange and

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.010 
the orange and then for the orange and
mixing<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:15.030> one<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.600> special

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
mixing this I on one and the special

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.010 
mixing this I on one and the special
effects<00:01:16.380> one<00:01:16.619> called<00:01:16.950> napalm<00:01:17.750> just<00:01:18.750> because

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
effects one called napalm just because

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.810 
effects one called napalm just because
I've<00:01:19.140> had<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> eye<00:01:19.409> on<00:01:19.740> one<00:01:19.979> for<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> while<00:01:20.549> now

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
I've had the eye on one for a while now

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.450 
I've had the eye on one for a while now
and<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:22.110> was<00:01:22.229> like<00:01:22.409> five<00:01:22.680> bucks<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.220> thought<00:01:23.399> I

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
and it was like five bucks I thought I

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.070 
and it was like five bucks I thought I
should<00:01:23.729> use<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.330> was<00:01:24.450> afraid<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.930> wasn't

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
should use it but I was afraid it wasn't

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.200 
should use it but I was afraid it wasn't
going<00:01:25.289> to<00:01:25.350> cover<00:01:25.530> my<00:01:25.860> entire<00:01:25.979> head<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.789> I<00:01:26.820> mixed

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
going to cover my entire head so I mixed

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.330 
going to cover my entire head so I mixed
it<00:01:27.330> with<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.509> little<00:01:27.630> bit<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.409> napalm<00:01:29.100> by

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
it with a little bit of napalm by

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.320 
it with a little bit of napalm by
special<00:01:29.729> effects

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
special effects

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.010 
special effects
it<00:01:31.289> also<00:01:31.500> helps<00:01:31.950> because<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.490> eye<00:01:32.520> on

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
it also helps because the eye on

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.090 
it also helps because the eye on
semi-permanent<00:01:34.020> colors<00:01:34.289> are<00:01:34.470> super<00:01:34.649> thick

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
semi-permanent colors are super thick

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.279 
semi-permanent colors are super thick
and<00:01:35.399> I<00:01:35.789> don't<00:01:35.850> really<00:01:36.060> like<00:01:36.360> thick<00:01:36.630> color<00:01:36.869> so

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
and I don't really like thick color so

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.020 
and I don't really like thick color so
it<00:01:37.380> kind<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.610> know<00:01:38.670> made<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.119> thinner<00:01:41.030> yeah

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
it kind of you know made it thinner yeah

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.059 
it kind of you know made it thinner yeah
I<00:01:42.330> liked<00:01:42.929> how<00:01:43.080> it<00:01:43.110> turned<00:01:43.409> out<00:01:43.530> though<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.979> was

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
I liked how it turned out though it was

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:45.499 
I liked how it turned out though it was
a<00:01:44.100> really<00:01:44.549> bright<00:01:44.789> orange

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
a really bright orange

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.590 
a really bright orange
I<00:01:45.539> used<00:01:46.140> napalm<00:01:46.590> orange<00:01:47.159> on<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:48.119> know<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.479> by

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
I used napalm orange on you know just by

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.419 
I used napalm orange on you know just by
itself<00:01:48.929> once<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.590> looked<00:01:49.799> like<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.979> freaking

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
itself once and I looked like a freaking

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.300 
itself once and I looked like a freaking
traffic<00:01:51.209> cone<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.630> was<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.929> bright<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.470> don't

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
traffic cone it was that bright I don't

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.490 
traffic cone it was that bright I don't
know<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.580> doesn't<00:01:53.670> look<00:01:53.880> like<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.500> it's

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
know it doesn't look like that but it's

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.440 
know it doesn't look like that but it's
definitely<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:56.039> really<00:01:56.490> bright<00:01:56.789> orange<00:01:57.209> and<00:01:57.390> I

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
definitely a really bright orange and I

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.620 
definitely a really bright orange and I
really<00:01:57.720> like<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.459> and<00:01:59.459> then<00:02:00.450> I'm<00:02:00.600> just

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
really like it and then I'm just
