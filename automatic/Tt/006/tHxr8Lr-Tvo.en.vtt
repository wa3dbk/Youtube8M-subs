guess<00:00:21.310> technically<00:00:21.790> it's<00:00:21.910> just<00:00:21.970> Marvel<00:00:22.420> icons

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
guess technically it's just Marvel icons

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.080 
guess technically it's just Marvel icons

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
an upscaled version or the other ones a

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.470 
an upscaled version or the other ones a
downscaled<00:00:29.410> version<00:00:29.800> of<00:00:29.920> the<00:00:30.670> face-off

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530

but he does have a good batch of
articulation<00:03:50.739> nonetheless<00:03:50.949> and<00:03:51.609> he<00:03:52.120> has

fairly<00:03:53.079> good<00:03:53.440> paint<00:03:53.680> work<00:03:53.859> it's<00:03:54.040> not<00:03:54.159> perfect

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:54.729 
fairly good paint work it's not perfect

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:58.619 
fairly good paint work it's not perfect
but<00:03:55.239> it<00:03:55.449> does<00:03:55.690> look<00:03:55.989> good<00:03:56.829> in<00:03:57.129> general<00:03:57.760> so<00:03:58.269> I<00:03:58.299> do

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
but it does look good in general so I do

but it does look good in general so I do
100%<00:03:59.379> recommend<00:03:59.829> this<00:04:00.190> figure<00:04:00.459> if<00:04:00.609> you<00:04:00.760> can

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:00.909 
100% recommend this figure if you can

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:03.030 
100% recommend this figure if you can
pick<00:04:01.090> it<00:04:01.120> up<00:04:01.359> I'm<00:04:01.900> pretty<00:04:02.290> sure<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.620> masked

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
pick it up I'm pretty sure the masked

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.309 
pick it up I'm pretty sure the masked
version<00:04:03.639> costs<00:04:03.909> more<00:04:04.359> than<00:04:04.419> the<00:04:04.690> unmasked

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
version costs more than the unmasked

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.559 
version costs more than the unmasked
version<00:04:05.709> just<00:04:05.889> like<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.129> faceoff<00:04:06.519> cap<00:04:06.819> just

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
version just like the faceoff cap just

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.449 
version just like the faceoff cap just
because<00:04:07.780> it's<00:04:07.930> more<00:04:08.139> desirable<00:04:08.590> but<00:04:09.220> either

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
because it's more desirable but either

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.490 
because it's more desirable but either
one<00:04:09.760> is<00:04:10.000> a<00:04:10.030> great<00:04:10.359> figure<00:04:10.720> and<00:04:10.930> I<00:04:10.989> do<00:04:11.049> recommend

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
one is a great figure and I do recommend

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.259
