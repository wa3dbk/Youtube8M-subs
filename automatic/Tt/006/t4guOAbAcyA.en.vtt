the left so I tend to also start on the
right<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.210> then<00:01:36.299> switch<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.900> left

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
able to open the elevator so basically

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.900 
able to open the elevator so basically
just<00:02:49.380> hang<00:02:49.650> out<00:02:49.800> until<00:02:49.860> you're<00:02:50.280> talking<00:02:50.730> and

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
just hang out until you're talking and

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.470 
just hang out until you're talking and
then<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.120> can<00:02:51.360> move<00:02:51.480> towards<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.410> elevator<00:02:52.890> I

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
then you can move towards the elevator I

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.810 
then you can move towards the elevator I
also<00:02:54.480> want<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.720> mention<00:02:54.840> a<00:02:55.110> new<00:02:55.380> trick<00:02:55.739> I<00:02:56.190> don't

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
also want to mention a new trick I don't

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.340 
also want to mention a new trick I don't
know<00:02:56.880> if<00:02:56.940> it's<00:02:57.030> really<00:02:57.270> a<00:02:57.300> trick<00:02:57.660> I<00:02:57.900> guess<00:02:58.200> it

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
know if it's really a trick I guess it

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.140 
know if it's really a trick I guess it
is<00:02:58.470> as<00:02:59.010> you're<00:02:59.310> as<00:02:59.550> you're<00:02:59.790> sprinting

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
is as you're as you're sprinting

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.000 
is as you're as you're sprinting
normally<00:03:00.720> you<00:03:00.780> have<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.930> meter<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.530> runs<00:03:01.770> out

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
normally you have a meter that runs out

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
normally you have a meter that runs out
right<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:02.430> you're<00:03:02.550> like<00:03:02.640> sprint<00:03:02.910> sprint

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
right so you're like sprint sprint

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.410 
right so you're like sprint sprint
sprint<00:03:03.300> and<00:03:03.540> then<00:03:03.930> you're<00:03:04.110> forced<00:03:04.320> to<00:03:04.560> stop<00:03:04.830> so

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
sprint and then you're forced to stop so

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.150 
sprint and then you're forced to stop so
what<00:03:06.420> people<00:03:06.630> realize<00:03:07.110> is<00:03:07.320> that<00:03:07.440> if<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:07.739> jump

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
what people realize is that if you jump

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.270 
what people realize is that if you jump
and<00:03:08.340> melee<00:03:08.880> then<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.750> melee<00:03:10.170> actually<00:03:10.739> resets

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
and melee then the melee actually resets

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.130 
and melee then the melee actually resets
your<00:03:11.370> sprint<00:03:11.880> timer<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.750> can<00:03:12.989> get

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
your sprint timer so you can get

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.590 
your sprint timer so you can get
infinite<00:03:13.590> sprint<00:03:14.010> by<00:03:14.459> jumping<00:03:15.270> up<00:03:15.420> and

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
infinite sprint by jumping up and

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.650 
infinite sprint by jumping up and
punching<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.170> air<00:03:16.489> every<00:03:17.489> four<00:03:17.820> steps<00:03:18.239> or<00:03:18.420> so

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
punching the air every four steps or so

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.930 
punching the air every four steps or so
so<00:03:19.110> you'll<00:03:19.320> see<00:03:19.530> Joker<00:03:19.950> doing<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.400> in<00:03:20.670> pretty

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
so you'll see Joker doing that in pretty

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.330 
so you'll see Joker doing that in pretty
much<00:03:21.030> every<00:03:21.480> single<00:03:21.780> run<00:03:22.170> these<00:03:22.980> are<00:03:23.130> really

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
much every single run these are really

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.100 
much every single run these are really
tight<00:03:23.580> corridors<00:03:24.120> where<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:24.690> doesn't<00:03:24.900> have

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
tight corridors where it doesn't have

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.710 
tight corridors where it doesn't have
much<00:03:25.350> impact<00:03:25.769> I<00:03:26.580> should<00:03:27.120> mention<00:03:27.269> that<00:03:27.420> right

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
much impact I should mention that right

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.970 
much impact I should mention that right
there<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:28.080> want<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.320> just<00:03:28.440> run<00:03:28.650> through<00:03:28.680> that

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
there you want to just run through that

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.120 
there you want to just run through that
area<00:03:29.750> sometimes<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:31.320> elite<00:03:31.560> will<00:03:31.709> chase<00:03:31.920> you

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
area sometimes the elite will chase you

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.620 
area sometimes the elite will chase you
that's<00:03:32.310> like<00:03:32.400> worst<00:03:32.760> case<00:03:32.880> scenario<00:03:33.450> but

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
that's like worst case scenario but

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.210 
that's like worst case scenario but
usually<00:03:34.080> what<00:03:34.290> Joker's<00:03:34.650> doing<00:03:34.950> here<00:03:35.130> is

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
usually what Joker's doing here is

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.190 
usually what Joker's doing here is
actually<00:03:35.640> very<00:03:35.880> reliable<00:03:36.540> as<00:03:36.630> crazy<00:03:36.870> as<00:03:37.080> it

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
actually very reliable as crazy as it

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
jump up the back side so that you didn't

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.009 
jump up the back side so that you didn't
have<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:18.000> fight<00:04:18.150> all<00:04:18.329> these<00:04:18.450> enemies<00:04:18.810> or<00:04:18.959> at

that's what it showed so here you'll see
this<00:04:23.400> little<00:04:23.760> trick<00:04:24.030> that<00:04:24.240> we<00:04:24.390> call<00:04:24.690> muscle

hit<00:04:49.710> those<00:04:49.919> pipes<00:04:50.190> that's<00:04:50.490> totally<00:04:51.030> fine<00:04:51.270> but

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
hit those pipes that's totally fine but

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.210 
hit those pipes that's totally fine but
more<00:04:52.169> often<00:04:52.319> than<00:04:52.560> not<00:04:52.590> you'll<00:04:52.889> be<00:04:52.919> able<00:04:53.039> to

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
more often than not you'll be able to

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.550 
more often than not you'll be able to
make<00:04:53.400> it<00:04:53.520> through<00:04:53.669> there<00:04:53.789> safely<00:04:54.180> and<00:04:54.569> of

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
make it through there safely and of

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.080 
make it through there safely and of
course<00:04:55.800> you<00:04:55.949> want<00:04:56.039> full<00:04:56.280> shields<00:04:56.699> before<00:04:57.000> you

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
course you want full shields before you

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.510 
course you want full shields before you
do<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:57.330> concussion<00:04:57.810> jump<00:04:58.050> trick<00:04:58.259> it's<00:04:59.250> it's

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
do the concussion jump trick it's it's

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.159 
do the concussion jump trick it's it's
the<00:04:59.880> fastest<00:05:00.360> way<00:05:00.389> to<00:05:00.539> get<00:05:00.720> up<00:05:00.810> there<00:05:00.990> and

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
the fastest way to get up there and

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.140 
the fastest way to get up there and
honestly<00:05:01.620> it's<00:05:01.800> it's<00:05:02.160> really<00:05:02.520> easy<00:05:02.789> to<00:05:02.970> pull

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
honestly it's it's really easy to pull

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.240 
honestly it's it's really easy to pull
off<00:05:03.330> you<00:05:03.539> dude<00:05:04.410> literally<00:05:04.889> just<00:05:05.099> look

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
off you dude literally just look

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.159 
off you dude literally just look
straight<00:05:05.550> down<00:05:05.580> towards<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:06.449> pipe<00:05:06.660> as<00:05:06.900> you're

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
straight down towards the pipe as you're

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.379 
straight down towards the pipe as you're
wedged<00:05:07.440> in<00:05:07.740> between<00:05:07.770> both<00:05:08.370> of<00:05:08.400> them<00:05:08.669> and<00:05:08.910> you

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
wedged in between both of them and you

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:11.659 
wedged in between both of them and you
just<00:05:09.720> jump<00:05:10.139> and<00:05:10.380> then<00:05:10.590> press<00:05:10.919> trigger<00:05:11.250> trigger

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
just jump and then press trigger trigger

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.480 
just jump and then press trigger trigger
trigger<00:05:11.759> and<00:05:12.300> that<00:05:12.330> will<00:05:13.139> land<00:05:13.440> you<00:05:13.710> on<00:05:13.919> top<00:05:14.280> of

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
trigger and that will land you on top of

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.120 
trigger and that will land you on top of
the<00:05:14.729> pipe<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.840> timing<00:05:16.289> is<00:05:16.410> really<00:05:16.590> important

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
the pipe the timing is really important

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.820 
the pipe the timing is really important
you<00:05:17.160> have<00:05:17.490> to<00:05:17.520> beeline<00:05:18.150> it<00:05:18.180> for<00:05:18.840> those<00:05:19.470> pipes

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
you have to beeline it for those pipes

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.040 
you have to beeline it for those pipes
if<00:05:20.159> you<00:05:20.340> wait<00:05:20.580> too<00:05:20.789> long<00:05:20.820> then<00:05:21.330> the<00:05:21.389> elites<00:05:21.810> on

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
if you wait too long then the elites on

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.540 
if you wait too long then the elites on
the<00:05:22.289> top<00:05:22.500> that<00:05:22.710> spawned<00:05:23.070> along<00:05:23.340> with<00:05:23.460> the

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
the top that spawned along with the

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.360 
the top that spawned along with the
Jackals<00:05:24.000> will<00:05:24.330> kill<00:05:24.630> you<00:05:24.860> since<00:05:25.860> you<00:05:25.979> land<00:05:26.190> up

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
Jackals will kill you since you land up

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.890 
Jackals will kill you since you land up
there<00:05:26.400> with<00:05:26.639> no<00:05:26.789> shields<00:05:27.180> so<00:05:27.659> as<00:05:27.780> you're

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
there with no shields so as you're

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.749 
there with no shields so as you're
watching<00:05:28.050> speedruns<00:05:28.500> don't<00:05:29.099> think<00:05:29.370> that<00:05:29.610> you

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
watching speedruns don't think that you

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:32.240 
watching speedruns don't think that you
can<00:05:29.970> you<00:05:30.150> know<00:05:30.320> it's<00:05:31.320> very<00:05:31.560> it's<00:05:31.770> very<00:05:31.860> true

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
can you know it's very it's very true

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.100 
can you know it's very it's very true
that<00:05:32.370> watching<00:05:32.759> speedruns<00:05:33.030> is<00:05:33.509> sometimes

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
that watching speedruns is sometimes

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.020 
that watching speedruns is sometimes
deceitful<00:05:34.710> because<00:05:34.919> your<00:05:35.340> deceptive<00:05:35.820> rather

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
deceitful because your deceptive rather

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.839 
deceitful because your deceptive rather
that's<00:05:36.539> a<00:05:36.659> word<00:05:36.840> because<00:05:37.830> you<00:05:38.340> you<00:05:38.669> don't

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
that's a word because you you don't

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:41.480 
that's a word because you you don't
really<00:05:39.240> recognize<00:05:39.630> what<00:05:40.139> can<00:05:40.320> go<00:05:40.500> wrong<00:05:40.830> in<00:05:41.220> a

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
really recognize what can go wrong in a

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.399 
really recognize what can go wrong in a
successful<00:05:42.030> speedrun<00:05:42.419> so<00:05:42.870> in<00:05:43.229> my

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:43.409 
successful speedrun so in my

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:44.749 
successful speedrun so in my
commentaries<00:05:44.039> I<00:05:44.159> try<00:05:44.370> to<00:05:44.430> point<00:05:44.669> out

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 
commentaries I try to point out

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:47.659 
commentaries I try to point out
alternative<00:05:45.270> scenarios<00:05:45.810> and<00:05:46.219> explain<00:05:47.219> the

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
alternative scenarios and explain the

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.879 
alternative scenarios and explain the
circumstances<00:05:47.909> surrounding<00:05:48.750> these<00:05:49.349> actions

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
circumstances surrounding these actions

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.249 
circumstances surrounding these actions
so<00:05:50.159> that<00:05:50.310> it<00:05:50.430> actually<00:05:50.610> makes<00:05:51.030> sense<00:05:51.300> and<00:05:51.599> when

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 
so that it actually makes sense and when

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:53.899 
so that it actually makes sense and when
you<00:05:52.440> try<00:05:52.680> to<00:05:52.740> do<00:05:52.949> it<00:05:53.070> you<00:05:53.190> can<00:05:53.340> actually<00:05:53.490> pull

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
you try to do it you can actually pull

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:56.719 
you try to do it you can actually pull
it<00:05:53.969> off<00:05:54.440> so<00:05:55.440> yeah<00:05:55.620> basically<00:05:55.770> the<00:05:56.340> timings

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
it off so yeah basically the timings

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:58.129 
it off so yeah basically the timings
important<00:05:57.180> sprint<00:05:57.570> straight<00:05:57.840> to<00:05:57.990> those

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 
important sprint straight to those

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.129 
important sprint straight to those
pillars<00:05:58.639> and<00:05:59.639> then<00:06:00.120> just<00:06:00.479> head<00:06:00.630> on<00:06:00.750> up<00:06:00.870> as<00:06:01.020> fast

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
pillars and then just head on up as fast

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.050 
pillars and then just head on up as fast
as<00:06:01.380> you<00:06:01.469> can<00:06:01.650> before<00:06:01.889> the<00:06:02.310> elite<00:06:02.580> walks<00:06:02.880> on

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
as you can before the elite walks on

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.700 
as you can before the elite walks on
over<00:06:03.330> and<00:06:03.479> then<00:06:03.599> kills<00:06:03.840> you<00:06:03.990> and<00:06:04.139> then<00:06:04.620> you

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
over and then kills you and then you

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:05.959 
over and then kills you and then you
just<00:06:04.830> press<00:06:04.919> the<00:06:05.130> button<00:06:05.370> and<00:06:05.460> you<00:06:05.550> can<00:06:05.699> run<00:06:05.880> on

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:05.969 
just press the button and you can run on

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:08.570 
just press the button and you can run on
down<00:06:06.210> across<00:06:06.509> the<00:06:06.630> way<00:06:06.960> this<00:06:07.770> it<00:06:08.099> might<00:06:08.370> look

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
down across the way this it might look

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.089 
down across the way this it might look
crazy<00:06:08.820> but<00:06:09.210> it's<00:06:09.360> very<00:06:09.630> very<00:06:10.110> safe<00:06:10.469> very

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:11.099 
crazy but it's very very safe very

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:13.459 
crazy but it's very very safe very
reliable<00:06:11.729> you<00:06:11.940> die<00:06:12.210> a<00:06:12.240> very<00:06:12.719> small<00:06:13.110> percent<00:06:13.440> of

reliable you die a very small percent of

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:17.810 
reliable you die a very small percent of
the<00:06:13.590> time<00:06:14.419> now<00:06:15.419> here<00:06:15.930> we<00:06:16.139> are<00:06:16.169> going<00:06:16.770> to<00:06:17.009> just
