with<00:01:05.640> your<00:01:05.760> fingers<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.619> then<00:01:07.619> he's<00:01:08.280> going<00:01:08.400> to

a pretty easy light bulb to replace some
are<00:01:37.670> much<00:01:37.850> more<00:01:38.060> difficult<00:01:38.329> than<00:01:38.750> that<00:01:38.960> you

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
are much more difficult than that you

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.810 
are much more difficult than that you
may<00:01:39.320> have<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.740> remove<00:01:40.009> some<00:01:40.070> things<00:01:40.640> that

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
would be blocking your way in there but

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.350 
would be blocking your way in there but
that's<00:01:43.100> pretty<00:01:43.399> much<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:43.670> way<00:01:43.970> it's<00:01:44.149> done

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
that's pretty much the way it's done
