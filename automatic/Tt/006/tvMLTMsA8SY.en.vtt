00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:05.910
 The starting signal for a higher useless at least if the organizer 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.220
 may believe 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.780
 Microsoft celebrates in Munich with a lot of light and plenty of prominence the 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.480
 Sales launch of Kinect 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.980
 the new game control for the expats 360 and that was nothing short of that 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.630
 Revolutionize the player market 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.039
 the projection serves a bit to symbolize water with Kinect 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.100
 Project namely 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.470
 new picture worlds will open new fantasies and of course a new one 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.830
 Openness has had creativity and all ill of it struck 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:32.570
 over 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.210
 Movement and not just a technical tool without a controller for 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.789
 Film start was also clearly in the foreground for the class Heinz 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:44.810
 at the very front with absolutely attached Dr 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.540
 No 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.630
 after that we would not have participated 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.970
 that will be projected stages of Merlini 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.850
 DAPD 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.300
 Dr Kinect consists of a 3d camera a sensor and the corresponding 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.810
 software 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.010
 the sensor detects movements and gestures in the room so accurately it is none 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.120
 additional controller's need to play differently than with the competition 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.860
 without EUR 1 no 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.810
 that is the tax the games 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.910
 on the outside prefer my body movement over the language also no technical 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.340
 Helps more to stop me from getting away that's natural 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.070
 something very special around 150 euros Kinect in the store costs 300 euros including Xbox 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.060
 360 and games 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.909
 To start Germany, there are a total of 19 different Microsoft 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:33.990
 title 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.500
 all more or less family-friendly 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.780
 like Harry Potter clearly meanwhile many game consoles are in the 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.549
 living room 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.890
 including Microsoft's with the new technology too 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.880
 Here at the World Cup segments in the course of other competitors, too 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.100
 others would all be very sporty that means we want the best there 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.150
 be by giving to consumers 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.650
 makes the best offer 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.910
 We know that besides Segment two, we have strong Japanese competitors 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.370
 Have room 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.440
 but we know that we are now a very innovative and Weiling unique 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.370
 Make offer that is already very much on us I am very curious 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.780
 in the next few weeks the percentage of resonance we hear from 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.970
 End consumers who were partially integrated in the test phase or 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.290
 Of course, our business partners leave me very much 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.670
 Confident that we are the number one in the world 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.510
 German market are now very big steps now in the 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.990
 North fans of the Xbox 360 were so far mainly the technical 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.019
 hardcore gamer 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.180
 the dear elaborate and expensive game productions 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.659
 Microsoft wants to refill here until the spring of 2011 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.069
 and present the first hardcore game titles for Kinect 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.480
 From today, the new sensor technology is available in Germany 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.319
 In the US, Kinect had already partially for shortly after the launch 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.379
 sold out shelves 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.550
 Microsoft corrected expectations worldwide 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.180
 and estimates that there will be five million kinect systems by Christmas instead of three 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.979
 Selling 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:58.489
