but<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:19.980> just<00:02:20.160> want<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.400> make<00:02:20.550> sure<00:02:20.580> that<00:02:21.030> it

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
but you just want to make sure that it

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.750 
but you just want to make sure that it
spins<00:02:21.569> with<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.470> food<00:02:22.709> on<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:22.950> we<00:02:23.310> have<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.459> lot

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
spins with the food on it we have a lot

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.390 
spins with the food on it we have a lot
of<00:02:23.790> clearance<00:02:24.260> noticed<00:02:25.260> I've<00:02:25.409> put<00:02:25.709> the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
of clearance noticed I've put the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.000 
of clearance noticed I've put the
flatter<00:02:26.760> part<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.810> know<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.260> doesn't<00:02:28.290> hit

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
flatter part you know so it doesn't hit

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.430 
flatter part you know so it doesn't hit
the<00:02:29.670> top<00:02:29.940> there<00:02:30.269> but<00:02:30.629> you<00:02:30.720> could<00:02:30.840> just<00:02:30.900> turn

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
the top there but you could just turn

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.180 
the top there but you could just turn
these<00:02:31.709> skewers<00:02:32.239> around<00:02:33.239> to<00:02:33.959> get<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.190> smaller

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
these skewers around to get a smaller

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.339 
these skewers around to get a smaller
section<00:02:35.970> up<00:02:36.090> on<00:02:36.239> top<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.900> don't<00:02:37.049> want<00:02:37.200> these

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
section up on top you don't want these

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.530 
section up on top you don't want these
long<00:02:37.709> wings<00:02:37.980> sticking<00:02:38.400> out<00:02:38.549> so<00:02:38.849> then<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.390> can

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
long wings sticking out so then you can

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.949 
long wings sticking out so then you can
close<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:41.190> turn<00:02:41.489> it<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.959> no

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
close it and you turn it and no

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.550 
close it and you turn it and no
obstructions<00:02:44.599> so<00:02:45.599> then<00:02:45.750> what<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:45.989> do<00:02:46.170> is<00:02:46.200> you
