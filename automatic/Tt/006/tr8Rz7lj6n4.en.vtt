how the design looks like for this new

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.740 
how the design looks like for this new
controller<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.700> looks<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.939> little<00:01:18.090> weird<00:01:18.509> but

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
then again people were seeing that about

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.149 
then again people were seeing that about
the<00:01:20.790> gamecube<00:01:21.299> controller<00:01:21.750> but<00:01:22.530> people<00:01:23.040> have

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
the gamecube controller but people have

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.429 
the gamecube controller but people have
been<00:01:23.310> wanting<00:01:23.700> something<00:01:24.060> similar<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
been wanting something similar to the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.289 
been wanting something similar to the
gamecube<00:01:25.799> controller<00:01:26.189> they<00:01:26.759> said<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.119> this

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
gamecube controller they said that this

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.649 
gamecube controller they said that this
was<00:01:27.360> inspired<00:01:28.259> by<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.210> gamecube<00:01:30.210> controller

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
was inspired by the gamecube controller

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.039 
was inspired by the gamecube controller
so<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.619> they<00:01:32.280> say<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.909> they<00:01:33.270> plan<00:01:33.840> to

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
so and they say that they plan to

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.050 
so and they say that they plan to
release<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.380> number<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.009> gamecube<00:01:35.520> inspired

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
release a number of gamecube inspired

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.109 
release a number of gamecube inspired
controllers<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.979> probably<00:01:38.520> isn't<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
controllers so this probably isn't the

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.210
