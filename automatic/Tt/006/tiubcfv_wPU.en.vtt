 and so in everything hello dear friends with 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.940
 you 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.859
 and bones and today we are apr 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.500
 we plant the passage of contracts in the game 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.170
 hitman absolution as i promised today 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.599
 we will go through and the contract created and more 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.460
 By the way, my first friend 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.560
 turn I will jump contracts created 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.480
 my friends and there will be another 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.520
 some people from my circle 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.500
 communication and then I will be looking 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.309
 contracts around the world and so by 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.930
 today's contract sledge star game 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.149
 very well known 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.980
 raspiarenny man on y tube very 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.110
 also achieved a lot I think I shouldn't 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.449
 you explain who you are him and so 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.550
 for sure you know I'm sure in general he 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.530
 created a contract that seemed to me 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.170
 the most difficult of all I 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.999
 only did it just usually when i 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.069
 I see very hardcore contracts I even 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:01.289
 not trying to pass them but this time I 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:03.569
 promised him that the contract that will make 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.729
 whatever he may be I must pass 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:09.479
 and write it on youtube and your promise 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:13.380
 I today hold the general then we 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.570
 We are in the courtroom in the help and where was 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.240
 mission remember called law 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.870
 sorrow and 15 in my account and sled 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.610
 gave us hope the scarecrow initially and in 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.320
 In general, today we have three goals between 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.570
 all the rest must be killed with different weapons and 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.190
 in different disguise that's it that's it and 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.440
 He is so complicated from a well 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.870
 I thought of everything that I was even surprised because 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.880
 that i probably wouldnâ€™t be so mace 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.920
 creating a contract inventing here 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.660
 literally such a huge algorithm 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.720
 actions that you will soon 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.160
 see for yourself 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.770
 get close and kill the first one correctly 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.480
 goal we will have to change clothes in 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.330
 bailiff's clothes which now 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.090
 walks right here here are he vests in a shirt 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.530
 and we line up around the corner and how he 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.090
 fits right off we start it a 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.880
 in no way neutralize 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.790
 kill because sledge banned here 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.770
 killing innocents just need to kill 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.260
 just goals big and nobody 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.640
 we will not touch the rest here 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.670
 neutralize dress up like 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.319
 want me to hang a contract comes out 2 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.540
 cutting down i mean i still sweat one 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.349
 man cut down for the sake of clothes but themselves 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.440
 you will see 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:22.170
 interrupted by hiding the body and run on 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.850
 killing the first goal but generally vkontakte 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.280
 she is numbered three but her and 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.240
 I will kill first of all because I do not know 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.540
 maybe the sleigh did not go as 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.490
 gave the contract but I honestly did not ask 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.920
 his canto del i asked him a couple 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.400
 subtleties where I find a putter because 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.440
 i know stick only in judge's room i 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.640
 just hoped there was money here 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.040
 she still to find her 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.870
 went here did not find asked him where 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.850
 is located but he said that only 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.350
 the judge's room there he and she took it 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.210
 the only thing I learned from him about 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.570
 contact everything else i went through a 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.120
 purely himself so we cut down the trench because 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.370
 what is the killing of the goal that I am now 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.870
 and kill the first will need to implement 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.540
 suit exactly in this suit 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.180
 the police officer body naturally throw box and 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.060
 Now we have our goal right here with him 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.890
 the help of the radio that I took there in here 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.260
 the building and in general it is still for us 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.390
 need to kill 2 cut in 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.530
 leaving him on the floor and moving back here 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.960
 in the direction of not forgetting to grab 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.920
 a baton because it is us 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.720
 will serve as a murder weapon 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.640
 now he must turn off the radio 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.100
 wait for him to turn off the script otherwise 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.750
 work wrong you know what 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.330
 will be just and somebody else will come and 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.070
 save us in general wait until he 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.990
 off and with the help of a cop 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.930
 batons break husband and by the way 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.600
 looks very nice and throw his body 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.940
 In the box we take back the radio and we need 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.160
 change clothes again bailiff because 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.380
 that the second goal is to kill it 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.380
 run out can not be afraid and he just 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.430
 waiting for us here we approach and brazenly beat 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.890
 in face 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.080
 radio and this will remain 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.990
 eliminates the last goal which 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.180
 it will not be difficult to achieve 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.560
 we just have to get her stick 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.750
 is as I said only in 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.180
 judge's room well in general then do it 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.970
 not really i would say difficult but not 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.550
 less there is some amount of hemorrhoids from 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.160
 this in general then we come back 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.350
 courthouse and now have to go in 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.090
 the judge's room down the street in the bailiff costume 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.650
 and we can not do this like me 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.750
 passage did that is through the window 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.360
 because we will scorch about costume 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.280
 cop pass there too hemorrhoid in 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.630
 general so we are clamping here 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.180
 instinct neatly 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.280
 we pass into the room of judge and we take from him 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.750
 stick that is right here 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.669
 near his desk 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.770
 run out back and also with 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.650
 instinct now we are with you 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.419
 back for the scarecrow costume because 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.220
 last goal here is this sleigh all 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.800
 complicated the last goal must be killed 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.349
 hockey stick and do it 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.409
 it is also necessary in a suit scarecrow more precisely light 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:57.729
 I made a mistake not a hockey golf club 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:59.740
 confused but okay 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.930
 really come back and now it is necessary 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.639
 will wait a moment and we immediately suit 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.190
 can not pick up because there is 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:08.530
 two guards and now come to them 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.659
 3 here here we go aside 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.879
 so as not to interfere with anyone not to distract them 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:15.940
 him hide right here down here for 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:18.699
 the column now comes here alone 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.740
 the cop and 2 out of here from the room should 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:23.789
 tactfully dump then we can 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:26.800
 pick up your clothes initially and 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:29.169
 go back to these goals down I took the radio and 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.020
 in the same place we hit him with a stick and 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.330
 quietly leave contracts to 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.860
 it turned out hard 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.560
 I won't hide it a little 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.569
 but nevertheless I was able to pass it and 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.080
 Thank God for the promises that I gave 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:46.289
 Sonya, I kept we pick up a suit 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.849
 scared back and go down now 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.440
 there are only 3 goals to kill a 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:53.110
 if you have already returned the costumes taken 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.150
 stick simple and run here 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.069
 here and now it will be necessary to distract him 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.020
 because imperceptibly while he stands near 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:01.300
 table his stick dolbanut not work 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.779
 throw a fire extinguisher wall and take 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:07.690
 stick and go through here for hours 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:09.969
 balls him on the head after that we hide 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:13.289
 the body and thatâ€™s all the terms of the contract 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:16.270
 complied with and we can only run away 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:18.580
 all his body we threw and 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.680
 actually give sneakers out with us 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.810
 contact here is like quite well 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.759
 do not have to sweat thank God that his 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.259
 not stuck somewhere far to 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:29.319
 would have to wade with difficulty 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:31.240
 well, that's it, but how do you see me 

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:32.979
 scored three hundred and seventy three thousand for 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.630
 I got a good score and I beat during 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:37.719
 I have my previous record 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:40.389
 there were 371 1000 points and in general this 

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:42.550
 good and the payment for the contract is also generous 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:44.800
 more than three hundred thousand as I 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.110
 I understand correctly in all conditions 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.819
 met and like a truck of course 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.639
 very cool turned sledge tried 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:53.740
 and, in general, an ardent one around the world though 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:55.270
 besides me and sanka here nobody else 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.920
 No, but I hope this contract is still 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.570
 notice I will send it to my friends with 

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.160
 those then and on this I say goodbye to you 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.260
 good luck to all and bye 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.380
 see you probably already passing max 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.380
 payne
