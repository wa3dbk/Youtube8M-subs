00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
it's good for my HP case so let's go

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.500 
it's good for my HP case so let's go
ahead<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.200> see<00:01:10.890> what<00:01:11.070> we<00:01:11.159> got<00:01:11.310> here<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:12.330> power

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
ahead and see what we got here the power

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.770

Det

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.859 
Det
let's<00:01:55.920> take<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> look<00:01:56.340> here<00:01:56.610> can't<00:01:57.509> really<00:01:57.689> see

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
let's take a look here can't really see

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.230 
let's take a look here can't really see
the<00:01:57.990> letters<00:01:58.350> they're<00:01:58.799> kind<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.100> small<00:01:59.430> but

you<00:02:04.500> know<00:02:04.619> have<00:02:05.340> some<00:02:05.579> technical

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
you know have some technical

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.130 
you know have some technical
specifications<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.710> then<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:08.610> has<00:02:09.140> all

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.820 
specifications and then it just has all
those

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
those

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.260 
those
it's<00:02:12.220> technical<00:02:13.090> specifications<00:02:13.930> in<00:02:14.140> other

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
it's technical specifications in other

it's technical specifications in other
languages<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:16.710> then<00:02:17.710> here's<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.070> minimum

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
languages and then here's a minimum

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.780 
languages and then here's a minimum
system<00:02:18.910> crime<00:02:19.480> rates<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.430> yeah<00:02:21.430> let's<00:02:21.640> get

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
system crime rates and yeah let's get

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.420 
system crime rates and yeah let's get
started<00:02:22.150> with<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.660> benchmark<00:02:23.290> up<00:02:24.040> here<00:02:24.310> you

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
started with the benchmark up here you

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.560 
started with the benchmark up here you
have<00:02:25.650> Crytek<00:02:26.650> crazy<00:02:27.070> crisis<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.420> know

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
have Crytek crazy crisis to you know
