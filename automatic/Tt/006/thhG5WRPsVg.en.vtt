00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.510 
with it so i suggest you guys uses c4

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
because it's a really good equipment and

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.819 
because it's a really good equipment and
it<00:01:44.670> gets<00:01:44.820> me<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.000> lots<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.329> kills<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:46.229> i'm<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> PDW

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
it gets me a lots of kills so i'm a PDW

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.130 
it gets me a lots of kills so i'm a PDW
i'm<00:01:47.310> using<00:01:47.610> sound<00:01:47.820> sir<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.329> laser<00:01:48.479> sight<00:01:48.869> and

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
i'm using sound sir and laser sight and

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.370 
i'm using sound sir and laser sight and
then<00:01:49.409> my<00:01:49.670> mp7<00:01:50.670> i<00:01:50.729> like<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.149> use<00:01:51.210> sound<00:01:51.780> sir<00:01:52.020> and

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
then my mp7 i like to use sound sir and

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.130 
then my mp7 i like to use sound sir and
sometimes<00:01:53.250> fast<00:01:53.549> mags<00:01:53.850> but<00:01:54.149> also<00:01:54.360> i<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:55.049> to

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
sometimes fast mags but also i like to

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.569 
sometimes fast mags but also i like to
try<00:01:55.320> out<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.530> foregrip<00:01:55.860> because<00:01:56.100> sometimes<00:01:56.460> i

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
try out the foregrip because sometimes i

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.069 
try out the foregrip because sometimes i
think<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.880> actually<00:01:57.000> does<00:01:57.299> help<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.750> bit

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
think it actually does help a bit

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.749 
think it actually does help a bit
because<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.409> mp7<00:01:58.619> has<00:01:58.979> some<00:01:59.130> weird<00:01:59.310> recoil

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
because the mp7 has some weird recoil

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.609 
because the mp7 has some weird recoil
which<00:02:00.299> i<00:02:00.420> think<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.719> foregrip<00:02:01.049> kind<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.409> helps

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
which i think the foregrip kind of helps

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.719 
which i think the foregrip kind of helps
because<00:02:01.710> i<00:02:01.799> know<00:02:01.860> for<00:02:02.189> group<00:02:02.340> doesn't<00:02:02.520> really

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
because i know for group doesn't really

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.760 
because i know for group doesn't really
help<00:02:02.909> one<00:02:03.090> most<00:02:03.390> guns<00:02:03.630> but<00:02:04.259> i<00:02:04.290> think<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.619> kind

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
help one most guns but i think it kind

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.109 
help one most guns but i think it kind
of<00:02:04.829> helps<00:02:05.040> on<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.159> mp7<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.820> that's<00:02:05.969> what<00:02:06.090> i

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
of helps on the mp7 so that's what i

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.059 
of helps on the mp7 so that's what i

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
really great setup i think i've already

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.590 
really great setup i think i've already
done<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.290> vector<00:02:38.770> video<00:02:39.010> where<00:02:39.370> i<00:02:39.400> used<00:02:39.970> it<00:02:40.360> and

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
done a vector video where i used it and

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.810 
done a vector video where i used it and
I<00:02:40.930> got<00:02:41.170> nuclear<00:02:41.650> with<00:02:41.800> it<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.100> it's<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.640> really

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
I got nuclear with it and it's a really

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.460 
I got nuclear with it and it's a really
great<00:02:42.940> setup<00:02:43.300> I<00:02:43.510> definitely<00:02:43.900> suggest<00:02:44.110> using

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
great setup I definitely suggest using

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.820 
great setup I definitely suggest using
that<00:02:44.760> my<00:02:45.760> MSMC<00:02:46.420> I<00:02:46.450> also<00:02:46.840> use<00:02:47.140> sound<00:02:47.410> sir<00:02:47.650> and

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
that my MSMC I also use sound sir and

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
fast mag just because it has a really

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.130 
fast mag just because it has a really
slow<00:02:49.630> reload<00:02:50.620> without<00:02:51.040> fast<00:02:51.250> mag<00:02:51.550> and<00:02:52.140> fast

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
just because the reload on this is kind

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.720 
just because the reload on this is kind
of<00:05:28.870> slow<00:05:28.990> and<00:05:29.290> fast<00:05:29.470> mags<00:05:29.740> always<00:05:30.310> helps<00:05:30.580> out

fast<00:05:55.540> mags<00:05:55.840> on<00:05:56.200> most<00:05:56.740> of<00:05:56.950> my<00:05:57.640> guns<00:05:57.940> my<00:05:58.690> sorrow

fast mags on most of my guns my sorrow

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.560 
fast mags on most of my guns my sorrow
apples<00:05:59.290> I<00:05:59.410> i<00:05:59.590> think<00:06:00.070> that<00:06:00.250> the<00:06:00.400> sound<00:06:00.730> sir<00:06:00.970> kind

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
apples I i think that the sound sir kind

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.930 
apples I i think that the sound sir kind
of<00:06:01.630> reduces<00:06:02.020> the<00:06:02.380> damage<00:06:02.770> at<00:06:03.220> a<00:06:03.250> far<00:06:03.520> distance

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
of reduces the damage at a far distance

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.190 
of reduces the damage at a far distance
so<00:06:04.120> that's<00:06:04.270> why<00:06:04.420> i<00:06:04.450> don't<00:06:04.630> really<00:06:04.750> like<00:06:04.870> using

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200 
so that's why i don't really like using

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.860 
so that's why i don't really like using
it<00:06:05.500> because<00:06:06.070> it<00:06:06.310> reduces<00:06:06.400> at<00:06:07.180> the<00:06:07.360> distance

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
it because it reduces at the distance

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.660 
it because it reduces at the distance
the<00:06:08.500> distance<00:06:08.680> where<00:06:09.130> you<00:06:09.220> can<00:06:09.370> get<00:06:09.520> like

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670 
the distance where you can get like

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.450 
the distance where you can get like
couple<00:06:10.570> shot<00:06:10.960> kills<00:06:11.260> and<00:06:11.740> i<00:06:12.160> don't<00:06:12.340> really

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
couple shot kills and i don't really

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.120 
couple shot kills and i don't really
like<00:06:12.730> it<00:06:12.910> but<00:06:13.480> i<00:06:13.750> like<00:06:14.020> using<00:06:14.290> primary
