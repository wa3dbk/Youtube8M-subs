00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello everyone in this video I do 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.910
 see but the recipe with the given pumpkin 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.320
 who know this huge pumpkin arrived 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.630
 we are looking for a these days 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.549
 lots of recipes to consume 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.789
 from the man thought to let you see a 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.430
 black cloud bread the pumpkin we're going to 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.010
 do even with hazelnuts were 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.080
 almost 100 percent complete because 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.420
 the first use the flour to do it 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.300
 supplement that promises that the flour 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.489
 of whole rye and then of course there 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.809
 a little bit of oil will be a bit of malt 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.910
 salt and brewer's yeast 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.350
 so first of all if you call to give 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.350
 a nice slice of pumpkin 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.949
 after cleaning the pumpkin come 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.350
 we cut it into cubes and cooked it 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.350
 steam and now we can start 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.300
 pass which ones to own then the 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.519
 we put in a nice bowl there 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.490
 add the malt and if we add 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.880
 also regarding beer in this way 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.220
 while you break the pumpkin dough 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.130
 well lite yeast also to melt 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.649
 ok at this point we can add the 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:24.520
 so let's put that of sidone 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.520
 put the spelled flour on the gr 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:34.280
 we add the oil we do not pass we put 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:37.970
 also in salt we add a little bit 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.690
 water little by little helped you 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.690
 reshuffle 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.340
 finally we can chop not only the 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.950
 let's say inside that the dough 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.540
 will have to remain quite soft in 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.540
 passed with a spatula 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.140
 now we cover that film and 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.330
 let it rise until doubled 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.460
 our leavened bread surrounds said 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.610
 an hour and a half doubled 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.980
 now on a floured floor there is 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.040
 we are going to pour very gently and 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:35.030
 we put it in the form but you 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.120
 we delicately live a suitable form 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:42.880
 to the mold so be careful not to 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.880
 deflated book too much my name is immediately 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.560
 let's click on some hazelnuts 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.460
 we let it rise about a network 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.830
 then we can bake it at 180 degrees 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.830
 ours then in the pumpkin and trying to 4 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.950
 about 40 minutes in the oven 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:22.840
 I 've already made the jambs towards the 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:24.760
 dish not because the recipe of silvia 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.970

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.970
