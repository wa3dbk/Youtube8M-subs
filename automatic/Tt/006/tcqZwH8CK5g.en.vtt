the choke you kick it through twice you

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.420 
the choke you kick it through twice you
turn<00:02:24.799> the<00:02:24.980> key<00:02:25.159> on

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430

kick it it's running that's one kick
yeah<00:02:29.569> you<00:02:29.959> know<00:02:30.109> would<00:02:30.319> they<00:02:30.469> live<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.569> switch

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
yeah you know would they live the switch

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.690 
yeah you know would they live the switch
on<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:34.870> rather<00:02:35.870> than<00:02:36.200> take<00:02:36.890> this<00:02:37.159> original

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
on and rather than take this original

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.720 
on and rather than take this original

up<00:02:43.010> over<00:02:43.189> the<00:02:43.340> years<00:02:43.569> we're<00:02:44.569> just<00:02:44.750> going<00:02:44.900> to

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
up over the years we're just going to

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.729 
up over the years we're just going to
clean<00:02:45.230> it<00:02:45.379> slowly<00:02:45.709> with<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.299> 9100<00:02:47.439> the<00:02:48.439> fuel

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
clean it slowly with the 9100 the fuel

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.379 
clean it slowly with the 9100 the fuel
additive<00:02:49.159> is<00:02:49.310> going<00:02:49.489> to<00:02:49.549> keep<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.879> carburetor

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:50.389 
additive is going to keep the carburetor

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:55.690 
additive is going to keep the carburetor
happy<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:52.329> it's<00:02:53.329> it's<00:02:53.870> fixing<00:02:54.859> itself<00:02:55.250> now<00:02:55.489> as

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
happy and it's it's fixing itself now as

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.270 
happy and it's it's fixing itself now as
it's<00:02:55.939> driven<00:02:56.299> that's<00:02:57.049> how<00:02:57.469> we're<00:02:57.680> using<00:02:57.889> the

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
it's driven that's how we're using the

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.629 
it's driven that's how we're using the
91<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.659> 6200<00:03:00.590> on<00:03:00.739> this<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.459> rough

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:01.639 
91 and the 6200 on this and the rough

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.899 
91 and the 6200 on this and the rough
stuff<00:03:02.319> saved<00:03:03.319> the<00:03:03.769> patina<00:03:04.189> of<00:03:04.340> these<00:03:04.609> gas

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:04.909 
stuff saved the patina of these gas

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.429 
stuff saved the patina of these gas
tanks<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:06.879> it's<00:03:07.879> amazing<00:03:08.510> I<00:03:08.659> have<00:03:08.810> never<00:03:09.109> seen

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:09.439 
tanks and it's amazing I have never seen

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.740 
tanks and it's amazing I have never seen
anything<00:03:09.739> like<00:03:09.919> the<00:03:10.280> rough<00:03:10.459> stuff<00:03:10.489> it's<00:03:11.120> gone

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
anything like the rough stuff it's gone

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.050 
anything like the rough stuff it's gone
it<00:03:12.139> was<00:03:12.379> gone<00:03:12.439> first<00:03:13.280> time<00:03:13.489> we<00:03:13.639> played<00:03:13.879> with

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
more than one motorcycle tank you've

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.099 
more than one motorcycle tank you've
done<00:03:28.459> several<00:03:28.879> tanks<00:03:29.060> I<00:03:29.299> believe<00:03:29.569> right<00:03:29.780> yeah

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
done several tanks I believe right yeah

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.619 
done several tanks I believe right yeah
and<00:03:30.260> there's<00:03:30.439> a<00:03:30.500> lot<00:03:30.620> of<00:03:30.859> T<00:03:31.340> heads<00:03:31.669> here<00:03:32.329> there

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
and there's a lot of T heads here there

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.170 
and there's a lot of T heads here there
are<00:03:32.810> tons<00:03:33.470> of<00:03:33.650> old<00:03:33.919> engines<00:03:34.549> that<00:03:34.729> are<00:03:34.849> just

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
are tons of old engines that are just

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.189 
are tons of old engines that are just
full<00:03:35.720> of<00:03:35.780> rust<00:03:36.440> and<00:03:37.090> you<00:03:38.090> could<00:03:38.299> mix<00:03:38.569> this<00:03:38.930> and

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:39.199 
full of rust and you could mix this and

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:43.599 
full of rust and you could mix this and
fill<00:03:39.769> a<00:03:39.799> cooling<00:03:40.310> system<00:03:41.229> with<00:03:42.229> this<00:03:42.709> and<00:03:42.949> when

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
fill a cooling system with this and when

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.089 
fill a cooling system with this and when
you<00:03:43.639> drain<00:03:44.120> it<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.540> rust<00:03:44.840> is<00:03:45.049> gone<00:03:45.169> yeah<00:03:45.769> then

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
you drain it the rust is gone yeah then

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.610 
you drain it the rust is gone yeah then
all<00:03:46.310> you<00:03:46.489> have<00:03:46.669> to<00:03:46.729> do<00:03:47.000> is<00:03:47.150> protect<00:03:47.629> against

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
all you have to do is protect against

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.460 
all you have to do is protect against
future<00:03:49.129> rust<00:03:49.400> this<00:03:49.669> helps<00:03:50.090> that<00:03:50.329> but<00:03:50.930> you<00:03:51.049> then

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
future rust this helps that but you then

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.949 
future rust this helps that but you then
need<00:03:51.680> to<00:03:51.709> stop<00:03:52.280> using<00:03:52.519> water<00:03:52.909> use<00:03:53.359> coolant

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
need to stop using water use coolant

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.179 
need to stop using water use coolant
right<00:03:54.560> etc<00:03:55.780> but<00:03:56.780> I've<00:03:56.959> used<00:03:57.259> a<00:03:57.439> lot<00:03:57.769> of<00:03:57.799> stuff

00:03:58.179 --> 00:03:58.189 
right etc but I've used a lot of stuff

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:01.899 
right etc but I've used a lot of stuff
this<00:03:58.609> takes<00:03:58.909> care<00:03:59.209> of<00:03:59.269> rust<00:03:59.659> this<00:04:00.349> is<00:04:00.909> amazing

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:01.909 
this takes care of rust this is amazing

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:02.710 
this takes care of rust this is amazing
how<00:04:02.120> it<00:04:02.180> works

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
how it works

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.030 
how it works
and<00:04:03.109> what's<00:04:03.259> really<00:04:03.409> neat<00:04:03.709> is<00:04:03.739> it's

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
and what's really neat is it's

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.499 
and what's really neat is it's
biodegradable<00:04:04.250> and<00:04:04.909> when<00:04:05.060> you're<00:04:05.180> done<00:04:05.329> with

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:05.509 
biodegradable and when you're done with

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:07.210 
biodegradable and when you're done with
it<00:04:05.629> you<00:04:06.019> dump<00:04:06.259> it<00:04:06.409> out<00:04:06.530> it's<00:04:06.799> done

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
it you dump it out it's done

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.140 
it you dump it out it's done
it<00:04:07.879> saved<00:04:08.870> this<00:04:09.049> gas<00:04:09.290> tank<00:04:09.620> yeah<00:04:10.150> there's

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
it saved this gas tank yeah there's

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.110 
it saved this gas tank yeah there's
other<00:04:11.359> motorcycles<00:04:12.139> here<00:04:12.379> with<00:04:13.129> rusty<00:04:13.639> tanks

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
other motorcycles here with rusty tanks

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.050 
other motorcycles here with rusty tanks
the<00:04:14.930> very<00:04:15.169> first<00:04:15.470> thing<00:04:15.739> we<00:04:15.769> will<00:04:16.039> do<00:04:16.280> is<00:04:16.519> fill

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
the very first thing we will do is fill

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.110 
the very first thing we will do is fill
them<00:04:17.209> with<00:04:17.389> water<00:04:17.930> and<00:04:18.669> this<00:04:19.669> 20<00:04:20.570> 50<00:04:21.229> 100<00:04:21.699> AR<00:04:22.699> 50

taking the engine all apart the parts
that<00:05:25.360> need<00:05:25.630> to<00:05:25.780> be<00:05:25.900> clean<00:05:26.199> are<00:05:26.440> being<00:05:26.800> cleaned

and the stuff that would normally

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.240 
and the stuff that would normally
deteriorate<00:05:34.630> just<00:05:34.990> by<00:05:35.139> sitting<00:05:35.650> we're<00:05:36.159> not

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
deteriorate just by sitting we're not

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.409 
deteriorate just by sitting we're not
going<00:05:36.370> to<00:05:36.430> worry<00:05:36.639> about<00:05:36.729> that<00:05:36.940> anymore

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
going to worry about that anymore

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.749

because<00:05:37.630> I<00:05:37.960> believe<00:05:38.409> you<00:05:38.680> when<00:05:39.009> you<00:05:39.069> say<00:05:39.490> that

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 
because I believe you when you say that

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:46.409 
because I believe you when you say that
the<00:05:40.650> 6200<00:05:41.650> will<00:05:43.949> allow<00:05:44.949> for<00:05:45.310> the<00:05:45.430> fuel<00:05:46.180> to

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
the 6200 will allow for the fuel to

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.210 
the 6200 will allow for the fuel to
store<00:05:46.840> without<00:05:47.349> going<00:05:47.710> bad

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
store without going bad

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.240 
store without going bad
yep<00:05:48.580> and<00:05:48.990> time<00:05:49.990> will<00:05:50.229> tell<00:05:50.440> on<00:05:50.500> that<00:05:50.710> but<00:05:51.220> I

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
yep and time will tell on that but I

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.740 
yep and time will tell on that but I
