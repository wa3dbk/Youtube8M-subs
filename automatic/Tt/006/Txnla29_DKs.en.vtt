00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
left and right pair and I asked the SI

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.479 
left and right pair and I asked the SI
to<00:02:45.220> give<00:02:45.459> me<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:46.540> drawstring<00:02:47.440> back<00:02:47.770> button<00:02:48.220> she

to give me a drawstring back button she

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.580 
to give me a drawstring back button she
gave<00:02:48.670> me<00:02:48.820> a<00:02:48.970> really<00:02:49.209> big<00:02:49.510> one<00:02:49.690> but

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
gave me a really big one but

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.590 
gave me a really big one but
nevertheless<00:02:50.890> it's<00:02:51.489> still<00:02:51.610> free<00:02:52.030> so<00:02:52.300> I'll

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
nevertheless it's still free so I'll

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.340 
nevertheless it's still free so I'll
take<00:02:53.020> it

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
take it

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.820 
take it
so<00:02:53.980> this<00:02:54.220> is<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:56.020> dust<00:02:56.260> bag<00:02:56.440> that<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:56.620> came

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
look so that's it that's the edge of

because the might be oh well just to

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.759 
because the might be oh well just to
keep<00:04:01.600> the<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:03.660> cold

hardware kind of shiny protective

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.649 
hardware kind of shiny protective
because<00:04:11.299> it<00:04:11.450> might<00:04:11.599> be<00:04:11.780> scratches<00:04:12.650> everywhere

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:13.659 
because it might be scratches everywhere

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:17.050

make<00:04:14.659> it<00:04:14.810> looks<00:04:15.019> really<00:04:15.349> dull<00:04:15.790> so<00:04:16.790> that's<00:04:16.970> the

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
make it looks really dull so that's the

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.820 
make it looks really dull so that's the
bottom<00:04:18.519> thing<00:04:19.519> apart<00:04:19.820> from<00:04:19.940> that<00:04:21.820> stitches<00:04:22.820> X

diagonal<00:04:24.830> stitches<00:04:25.220> I'm<00:04:26.180> think<00:04:26.479> that<00:04:26.630> was

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
diagonal stitches I'm think that was

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.540 
diagonal stitches I'm think that was
used<00:04:27.139> to<00:04:27.290> secure<00:04:27.770> maybe<00:04:28.130> those<00:04:28.430> four<00:04:29.389> legs

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
used to secure maybe those four legs

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.950 
used to secure maybe those four legs
metal<00:04:31.550> legs<00:04:31.850> and<00:04:32.600> then<00:04:32.720> let's<00:04:32.930> have<00:04:33.080> a<00:04:33.139> look

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
metal legs and then let's have a look

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.350 
metal legs and then let's have a look
just<00:04:35.960> for<00:04:36.260> the<00:04:36.380> size<00:04:37.300> if<00:04:38.300> you<00:04:38.419> have<00:04:38.449> a<00:04:38.660> look
