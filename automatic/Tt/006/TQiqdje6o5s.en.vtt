00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.420
 Hello 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.340
 I would like to 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.130
 to do something 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:21.880
 system for the 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:24.360
 the 204 what I bought show and me 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:32.500
 I want to show you how good the system is 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:39.550
 start the car now see her coming 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:49.600
 as a mercedes logo world short system 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:52.870
 starts to watch radio quieter down here 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.760
 the hypo is not the main one 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.530
 unit 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.180
 the original the same as you 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.379
 usually in their c class in there 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.840
 have no difference 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.560
 And this selector lever will too 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.560
 function 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:26.350
 are on the way are both at cd 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:31.290
 they can all also in radio and 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.670
 just see them show hang 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.210
 you can also see the frequency for example 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:42.610
 at the time of the radio the wheel is running then 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:45.070
 can also be from the steering wheel so if 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.220
 They have multi-functional steering wheel 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.600
 on the steering wheel of a next too 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.430
 CD also with radio and incoming calls 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.280
 are displayed here so the phone 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.539
 mobility displayed on the color screen 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.539
 Dialogs can also accept 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.440
 all function tests I with this device 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:14.440
 so we have the radio 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:21.370
 You can control the device you see 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:26.079
 here for example gps for navigation has 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:29.350
 he radio dvd usb sd bluetooth you can 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:31.450
 Listening to music on your mobile phone is optimal 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.130
 of course you can also call ipod 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.670
 she then the whole in the 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.670
 glove compartment 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.400
 I start the navigation for a short time 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.340
 So here at the place 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.230
 start it, it can also inform the 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:56.470
 city needs back 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:59.900
 you can see it starts here 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:04.700
 the card opens and you can 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:08.239
 see map is the allgÃ¤u crime 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.319
 current with all european countries 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:16.129
 as well as places as everything possible in it 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:18.769
 it is like said that the device is 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:24.470
 fully adapts to your device 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:26.750
 original faithful as multifunction steering wheel 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.319
 or this selector works everything 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.269
 impeccable and they just like that 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.810
 of course , the display is original 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.630
 much bigger 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.780
 and accordingly a lot 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.489
 better view I can only the device 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.819
 I recommend using it yourself in 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.530
 my car and habs started too 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:51.450
 sell because I'm very happy with it 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.450
