because I mean we were doing so good
together<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:32.520> thought<00:02:33.300> it<00:02:33.450> was<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.570> good

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780

a week I mean I was really bummed about

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.090 
a week I mean I was really bummed about
that<00:02:48.240> but<00:02:48.660> on<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.080> good<00:02:49.110> side<00:02:49.320> one<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.040> my

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
that but on the good side one of my

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.490 
that but on the good side one of my
friends<00:02:50.430> did<00:02:50.640> go<00:02:50.820> vegan<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:52.110> far<00:02:52.380> as
