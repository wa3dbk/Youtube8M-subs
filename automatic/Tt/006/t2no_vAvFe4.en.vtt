00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.969 
there you go once you've got a mobile
terminal<00:04:18.940> install<00:04:19.720> that<00:04:19.900> as<00:04:20.079> well<00:04:20.349> and<00:04:20.739> then

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
terminal install that as well and then

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.100 
terminal install that as well and then
you'll<00:04:21.160> be<00:04:21.340> able<00:04:21.430> to<00:04:21.609> install<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.150> openssh

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
you'll be able to install the openssh

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.210 
you'll be able to install the openssh
and<00:04:23.610> so<00:04:24.610> once<00:04:24.970> openssh<00:04:25.930> is<00:04:26.169> installed<00:04:26.620> it's<00:04:27.010> a

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
and so once openssh is installed it's a

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.089 
and so once openssh is installed it's a
hidden<00:04:27.930> control<00:04:28.930> which<00:04:29.349> you'll<00:04:29.590> be<00:04:29.830> able<00:04:29.919> to

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:30.099

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:33.690 
hidden control which you'll be able to
control<00:04:30.430> through<00:04:30.880> your<00:04:31.180> your<00:04:32.220> if<00:04:33.220> we<00:04:33.400> can<00:04:33.580> get

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
control through your your if we can get

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.350 
control through your your if we can get
this<00:04:33.849> working<00:04:34.150> here<00:04:34.889> through<00:04:35.889> your<00:04:36.360> control

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360
