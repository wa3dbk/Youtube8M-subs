00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
yields there a lot I mean I'm just

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.390 
yields there a lot I mean I'm just
staggered<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.560> by<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.799> number<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.159> yeah

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
staggered it by the number of yeah

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.130 
staggered it by the number of yeah
potatoes<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:23.970> Agra<00:01:24.240> bees<00:01:24.390> only<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:24.869> thirty

potatoes and Agra bees only have thirty

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.410 
potatoes and Agra bees only have thirty
thousand<00:01:25.530> dollars<00:01:25.860> because<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.970> had<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.299> buy<00:01:27.390> a

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
thousand dollars because I had to buy a

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.870 
thousand dollars because I had to buy a
lot<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.689> equipment<00:01:27.930> it's<00:01:28.890> expensive<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.610> do<00:01:29.729> so

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
lot of equipment it's expensive to do so

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.660 
lot of equipment it's expensive to do so
to<00:01:29.939> get<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:31.229> map<00:01:31.500> was<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:31.860> hard

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
to get and and this map was on hard

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.850 
to get and and this map was on hard
medium<00:01:33.210> at<00:01:33.329> meet<00:01:33.540> no<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.200> SMAP<00:01:34.380> wasn't<00:01:34.680> hard

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
medium at meet no the SMAP wasn't hard

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.460 
medium at meet no the SMAP wasn't hard
now<00:01:35.040> pretty<00:01:35.939> sure<00:01:36.090> exactly<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.020> way<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.350> on

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
now pretty sure exactly the way is on

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.749 
now pretty sure exactly the way is on
something<00:01:37.650> more<00:01:37.920> than<00:01:37.979> easy<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.460> map<00:01:38.640> was

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
something more than easy this map was

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.190 
something more than easy this map was
either<00:01:38.909> medium<00:01:39.360> or<00:01:39.509> hard<00:01:39.659> pretty<00:01:39.960> sure<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.110> was

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
either medium or hard pretty sure it was

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.319 
either medium or hard pretty sure it was
