now let's say for color get in just the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.690 
now let's say for color get in just the
temperature<00:01:06.960> like<00:01:07.890> for<00:01:08.159> instance<00:01:08.490> if<00:01:08.610> we

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
temperature like for instance if we

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.390 
temperature like for instance if we
didn't<00:01:08.909> want<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.119> show<00:01:09.330> such<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:10.110> red<00:01:11.070> warm

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.330 
didn't want to show such a red warm
photo<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.360> bring<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.780> left

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
photo you can just bring it to the left

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.490 
photo you can just bring it to the left
and<00:01:14.450> it<00:01:15.450> turns<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> photo<00:01:15.960> into<00:01:16.140> more<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.380> a

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
and it turns the photo into more of a

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.940 
and it turns the photo into more of a
blue<00:01:16.680> hint<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.640> we'll<00:01:17.759> keep<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.060> warm<00:01:18.270> sunset

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
blue hint but we'll keep the warm sunset

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.530

also<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.340> straight<00:01:20.610> into<00:01:20.759> photo<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
also you can straight into photo and

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.539 
also you can straight into photo and
just<00:01:21.720> move<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.990> slider<00:01:22.259> left<00:01:22.530> or<00:01:22.680> right<00:01:22.860> to

adjust the photo so it's straight what
this<00:01:25.590> does<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:25.979> simply<00:01:26.280> keeps<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.610> photos

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
this does is it simply keeps the photos

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.280 
this does is it simply keeps the photos
square<00:01:27.360> as<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:28.259> rotate<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.770> left<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.130> right

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
square as you rotate it left and right

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.340 
square as you rotate it left and right
you<00:01:31.290> can<00:01:31.409> also<00:01:31.530> adjust<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.009> detail<00:01:32.990> or<00:01:33.990> simply

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
you can also adjust the detail or simply

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.679 
you can also adjust the detail or simply
how<00:01:34.439> sharp<00:01:34.829> or<00:01:35.040> blurry<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.460> images<00:01:35.850> let's<00:01:36.540> say

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
how sharp or blurry the images let's say

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.760 
how sharp or blurry the images let's say
for<00:01:36.869> instance<00:01:36.960> we<00:01:37.200> thought<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.500> was<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.619> little

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
for instance we thought it was a little

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.200 
for instance we thought it was a little
too<00:01:37.890> blurry<00:01:38.100> we<00:01:38.430> moved<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> right<00:01:39.030> to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
too blurry we moved to the right to

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.460 
too blurry we moved to the right to
sharpen<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:41.479> or<00:01:42.479> left<00:01:42.750> for<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.170> be<00:01:43.290> more

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
sharpen it or left for it to be more

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.639 
sharpen it or left for it to be more
blurry<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.930> there<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.079> go<00:01:46.200> that's<00:01:46.380> how<00:01:46.590> you

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
blurry and there you go that's how you

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.630 
blurry and there you go that's how you
adjust<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.579> detail<00:01:47.880> straight<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.960> photo
