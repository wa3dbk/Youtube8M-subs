00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
um a shoe that has the panels would be

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.130 
um a shoe that has the panels would be
like<00:01:37.170> um<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:40.700> GG<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.120> Reynolds<00:01:42.540> threes<00:01:42.900> I

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
think they have the battles but it's a

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.680 
think they have the battles but it's a
really<00:01:46.080> thick<00:01:46.410> shoe<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.070> um<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:48.210> doesn't

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
really thick shoe so um it doesn't

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.610 
really thick shoe so um it doesn't
really<00:01:48.870> matter<00:01:49.670> so<00:01:50.810> again<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.080> hoe<00:01:52.320> cap<00:01:52.500> is

really matter so again this hoe cap is

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.410 
really matter so again this hoe cap is
really<00:01:52.860> good<00:01:53.040> because<00:01:53.190> it's<00:01:53.640> round<00:01:53.940> it

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
really good because it's round it

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.850

doesn't<00:01:54.660> have<00:01:54.720> any<00:01:54.930> panels<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.440> rip<00:01:55.620> it's

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
doesn't have any panels to rip it's

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.880 
doesn't have any panels to rip it's
really<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.670> really<00:01:56.880> durable<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:58.050> I<00:01:58.380> really

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
really it's really durable and I really

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.790 
really it's really durable and I really
like<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.250> part<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.760> the<00:01:59.880> shoe<00:02:00.260> now<00:02:01.260> right

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
like this part of the shoe now right

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.960 
like this part of the shoe now right
here<00:02:01.830> um<00:02:02.610> there<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.480> a<00:02:03.510> panel<00:02:03.930> but<00:02:04.670> you<00:02:05.670> have<00:02:05.850> to

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
here um there is a panel but you have to

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.540 
here um there is a panel but you have to
have<00:02:06.090> panel<00:02:06.420> there<00:02:06.570> for<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.050> laces<00:02:07.470> but<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:08.340> is

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
have panel there for the laces but it is

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.190 
have panel there for the laces but it is
double<00:02:09.000> stitch<00:02:09.269> so<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.719> helps<00:02:10.049> with<00:02:10.109> the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
double stitch so it helps with the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.030 
double stitch so it helps with the
ripping<00:02:10.619> but<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:12.180> skin

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
ripping but it skin

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.000 
ripping but it skin
after<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.030> while<00:02:14.150> so<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.900> doesn't<00:02:15.439> really

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
after a while so it doesn't really

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.360 
after a while so it doesn't really
matter<00:02:16.219> it's<00:02:16.579> the<00:02:16.879> same<00:02:17.269> with<00:02:17.390> all<00:02:17.599> shoes<00:02:17.959> so

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
matter it's the same with all shoes so

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.160 
matter it's the same with all shoes so
you<00:02:19.370> can't<00:02:19.609> really<00:02:19.640> complain<00:02:20.000> about<00:02:20.209> that<00:02:20.569> and

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.080 

the<00:02:24.170> way<00:02:24.319> you<00:02:24.379> can<00:02:24.590> fix<00:02:24.799> that<00:02:25.010> problem<00:02:25.189> is<00:02:25.640> you

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
the way you can fix that problem is you

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.780 
the way you can fix that problem is you
can<00:02:26.269> get<00:02:26.390> like<00:02:26.510> super<00:02:26.780> glue<00:02:26.989> and<00:02:27.409> you<00:02:27.859> just<00:02:28.010> put

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
can get like super glue and you just put

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.770 
can get like super glue and you just put
a<00:02:29.090> layer<00:02:29.629> and<00:02:29.900> cost<00:02:30.230> an<00:02:30.470> up<00:02:30.769> and<00:02:30.920> down<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.400> then

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
a layer and cost an up and down and then

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.869 
a layer and cost an up and down and then
that<00:02:32.780> way<00:02:33.019> list<00:02:33.709> that<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:34.010> come<00:02:34.430> out<00:02:34.549> as<00:02:34.700> easy

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
that way list that you come out as easy

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.569 
that way list that you come out as easy
and<00:02:35.599> then<00:02:35.930> get<00:02:36.109> shoe<00:02:36.349> goo<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:36.920> just<00:02:37.189> put<00:02:37.459> it

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
and then get shoe goo and just put it

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.619 
and then get shoe goo and just put it
right<00:02:37.760> across<00:02:38.540> here<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.200> that<00:02:40.000> will<00:02:41.000> make

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
right across here and that will make

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.259 
right across here and that will make
your<00:02:41.780> shoe<00:02:41.989> last<00:02:42.230> for<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:42.530> really<00:02:42.560> long<00:02:42.709> time<00:02:43.269> so

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
your shoe last for a really long time so

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.569 
your shoe last for a really long time so
um<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:45.470> that's<00:02:45.590> basically<00:02:45.859> the<00:02:46.129> front<00:02:46.400> of<00:02:46.489> the

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
um so that's basically the front of the

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:56.069 
um so that's basically the front of the
shoe<00:02:46.790> really<00:02:47.780> nice<00:02:47.930> again<00:02:48.879> it<00:02:49.879> looks<00:02:50.239> like

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.909 

alright<00:02:57.079> so<00:02:57.260> now<00:02:57.379> we're<00:02:57.470> going<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.620> go<00:02:57.769> into

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:57.919 
alright so now we're going to go into

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.490 
alright so now we're going to go into
the<00:02:58.099> back<00:02:58.280> of<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.579> shoe<00:02:59.079> back<00:03:00.079> of<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.319> shoe

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
call this the heelflip spot because this

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.309 
call this the heelflip spot because this
is<00:03:14.180> where<00:03:14.359> you<00:03:14.450> flick<00:03:14.720> when<00:03:14.870> you<00:03:14.959> do<00:03:15.079> a<00:03:15.109> heel

this thin so it doesn't really give you
much<00:04:20.449> protection<00:04:20.900> for<00:04:21.529> impact<00:04:22.039> but<00:04:22.940> um<00:04:23.150> it

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
much protection for impact but um it

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.779 
much protection for impact but um it
doesn't<00:04:24.680> really<00:04:24.860> matter<00:04:25.070> too<00:04:25.400> much<00:04:25.430> because

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
doesn't really matter too much because

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:26.620 
doesn't really matter too much because
I'm

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630

my<00:04:31.400> foot<00:04:31.670> except<00:04:32.120> for<00:04:32.150> when<00:04:32.660> I<00:04:32.930> land<00:04:33.200> on<00:04:33.380> the

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
my foot except for when I land on the

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.060 
my foot except for when I land on the
heel<00:04:33.830> but<00:04:34.700> uh<00:04:34.730> yeah<00:04:35.560> anyways<00:04:36.560> the<00:04:36.740> bottom<00:04:37.010> of

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
heel but uh yeah anyways the bottom of

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.670 
heel but uh yeah anyways the bottom of
the<00:04:37.160> shoe<00:04:37.400> is<00:04:37.610> like<00:04:37.790> it's<00:04:38.780> really<00:04:39.020> grippy<00:04:39.470> and

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
I really like how they incorporated a

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.360 
I really like how they incorporated a
super<00:04:41.960> logo<00:04:42.290> right<00:04:42.530> here<00:04:42.560> in<00:04:42.950> the<00:04:43.130> middle

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
super logo right here in the middle

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.640 
super logo right here in the middle

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.140 
instead of having like little small ones
all<00:04:45.770> over<00:04:45.950> the<00:04:46.040> place<00:04:46.220> it<00:04:46.430> just<00:04:46.520> bowled<00:04:46.880> like
