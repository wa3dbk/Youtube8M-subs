matter but then I realized that it was
going<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:08.060> insinuate<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.900> every<00:03:10.379> game<00:03:10.590> that

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
going to insinuate the every game that

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.520

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.229 
has this label is violent in some way my
mom<00:03:13.680> learned<00:03:13.859> really<00:03:14.250> quickly<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:15.060> just

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
mom learned really quickly that just

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.059 
mom learned really quickly that just
because<00:03:15.509> I<00:03:15.599> wanted<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:15.989> rent<00:03:16.199> an<00:03:16.349> anime<00:03:16.769> it

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
because I wanted to rent an anime it

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.589 
because I wanted to rent an anime it
didn't<00:03:17.430> mean<00:03:17.519> that<00:03:17.639> that<00:03:17.790> anime<00:03:18.150> wasn't<00:03:18.449> going

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
didn't mean that that anime wasn't going

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.439 
didn't mean that that anime wasn't going
to<00:03:18.659> have<00:03:18.810> all<00:03:19.109> sorts<00:03:19.560> of<00:03:19.650> gore<00:03:20.250> or<00:03:20.280> nudity<00:03:21.030> or

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
to have all sorts of gore or nudity or

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.089 
to have all sorts of gore or nudity or
whatnot<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.169> she<00:03:22.349> started<00:03:22.650> checking<00:03:22.889> the

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
whatnot and she started checking the

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.559 
whatnot and she started checking the
labels<00:03:23.220> before<00:03:23.609> she<00:03:23.909> would<00:03:24.060> let<00:03:24.209> me<00:03:24.359> rent

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
labels before she would let me rent

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.390 
labels before she would let me rent
things<00:03:24.870> I<00:03:25.109> think<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:25.799> there<00:03:25.919> are<00:03:25.949> plenty<00:03:26.220> of

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
things I think that there are plenty of

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.249 
things I think that there are plenty of
