00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.580
 Good all clear with you I want you 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.200
 Just give me a quick tip today 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.450
 on the way and that is 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.030
 actually very easy buy nothing 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.099
 a tv commercial has yes why is it 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.420
 so the whole thing became the 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.340
 TV ads are just stops 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.140
 easily processed with any 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.949
 additional everything industrial 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.330
 processed products and mostly is 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.859
 it also keeps making it at company 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.480
 then not as good as we do 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.310
 could actually take it so have 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.430
 We for example if you ever watch it 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.140
 gave chiquita advertising and advertising for a while 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.730
 if you times with google it admitted 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.829
 This time in the company just stop 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.290
 problems because just stop aldi and lidl 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.030
 with the cheap banana next to them too 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.040
 has broken the market and this 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.200
 there's none of that and now there's none 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.629
 bananas advertising more for chiquita so 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.309
 I 've certainly been good forever 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.289
 but also hardly watching TV but also 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.059
 so all this advertising the whole 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.280
 advertising where so on tv and running 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.199
 everything there for products and things 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.000
 Forms are mostly simple 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.980
 that seiffen and felling mostly yes 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.719
 and as I said most things are 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.309
 industrially processed this 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.189
 packed with sugar salt 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.420
 preservatives glutamate and what 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.760
 I do not know everything so for example 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.650
 I do not want to be here now either 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.710
 as an exception 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.110
 I habs grad run table are my 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.570
 my favorite chili sauce is honestly so 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.920
 yes, but if you look for the 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.840
 There's no extension now 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.970
 but it is an industrially processed one 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:33.170
 product yes there you have expensive with 260 e 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:38.119

 stabilizer 413 preservative e 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.110
 282 chemical bomb to exactly the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.700
 which we do not want the small measure 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.149
 it is alright but really a tip 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.399
 Do not buy this stuff in advertising 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.110

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.790
