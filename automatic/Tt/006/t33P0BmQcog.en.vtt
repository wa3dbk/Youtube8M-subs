 clementine of goodyear we're going to go the 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.920
 to see and talk to him but clementine 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.550
 clementine hello do you have two 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.070
 minutes to give me 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.869
 yes of course the line thank you today 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.029
 on the world I take you to see 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.770
 clementine antunes responsible marketing 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.910
 digital goodyear dunlop and 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.460
 today we are going to talk about goudiard 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.180
 clementine hello hello adeline is 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.280
 what is the first time for 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.600
 goodyear dunlop on the world is the 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.950
 first time that goodyear brands 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.750
 and dunlop are present on the world 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.180
 and in partnership with alloc do you 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.710
 have a new shot will not fight flu 9 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.539
 can you tell me more about 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.219
 this novelty winter yes winter 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:52.600
 approach and luckily goodyear 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.910
 continues to innovate every year a little 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.190
 more to go out this year g9 him 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.260
 left following him I have 8 and that is 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.730
 today even more successful because 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.590
 that it responds to a real demand of 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.379
 consumers to have a tire 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.970
 winter that has lava the grip of the 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.310
 traction on the snow but also a 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.960
 very very good braking than in all 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.850
 winter conditions whether it's on the 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.759
 snow on the ice or on the snow 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.500
 melted or in the rain at great 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.060
 synthe cold temperatures and that 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.600
 it was important for us to respond 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.430
 to this need 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.140
 yes because a winter tire is not 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.400
 that for the snow actually 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.259
 winter tires that's when the 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.500
 temperatures go down below 7 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.790
 degrees already there the gum is hardening and 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.930
 it's like chewing gum 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.700
 when you put in the refrigerator 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.350
 you can no longer the market is 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.880
 now matic was as he is 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.930
 designed today does not allow for 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.759
 meet winter conditions 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.350
 only winter tires guarantee 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.369
 optimal performance 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.650
 Clementine is what you can 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.560
 succinctly outline the profile that 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.759
 introduce yourself here with us we are here 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.530
 we offer you three types of tires 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.390
 different the first and the fish and 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.830
 greet performance it actually matches 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.360
 tires that equip 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.980
 compact vehicles from the French market 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.020
 which is done in teams 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.880
 the majority of vehicles that drive 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.930
 on the French market today and 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.910
 it's a tire is very good 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.040
 balanced with a round profile for 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.170
 a regular and uniform measure is 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.180
 disgust is not symmetrical 2 it's 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.850
 simple and matic team vehicles 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.440
 more athletic more road and so who has 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.360
 an asymmetrical profile to evacuate 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.890
 even more easily water and have a 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.540
 braking especially six races and 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.770
 tires there that has delivered genri 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.350
 performance or league 1 is not 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.580
 symmetrical 2o the highest score on 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.020
 the adhesion to wet ground that means 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.000
 that they have the score of that by 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.140
 Pneumatic thematic c1 is the winter 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.670
 sees 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.890
 the dimensional mettrie to hang 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.970
 the snow be even more efficient in 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.410
 winter conditions 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.560
 and then if you touch in and touch and 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.560
 line 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.160
 thematic that has a much more eraser 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.460
 soon that the tires were for 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.440
 blow power resist conditions and 3 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.810
 winter below 7 degrees east 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.980
 then braking at all too short 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.170
 Well thank you very much for this 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.680
 interview see you soon in Lille 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.680
 thank you
