00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.889
 we are used to more traditional 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:05.149
 finishing material of both klitschko 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:06.410
 porcelain stoneware 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.500
 but today 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.320
 if the pain is unique and 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.589
 interesting solutions 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:12.659
 flexible cameras 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:13.879
 what is the peculiarity 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.070
 this is important finishing materials 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.650
 in nature occur 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.590
 in structures that was formed in a lot 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.189
 centuries where even millions of years we have 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.989
 the ability to make upright funds 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:27.879
 in loose sandstones that is further 

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:30.879
 taken reinforcing canvas 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.780
 after drying 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.450
 certain layer 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.330
 shoot together 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.600
 pay attention to this wall 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.360
 here we see the pristine beauty 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.040
 of nature 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.170
 the most important thing 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.750
 we see that the brain 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.120
 titus 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.770
 in the same way as it turns out 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:54.670
 monolith 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.040
 the phrase we have two canvases 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.090
 whether we need to dock so that 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.960
 people 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.200
 was hidden show 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.530
 we do 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.530
 his story 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.000
 impose this elevator 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 on the previous one which was previously pasted 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.730
 doing 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.570
 exactly the same slot repeats 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.480
 contours 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.990
 on the second person 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.730
 their materially 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.170
 protected from the composition for which we have time 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.240
 wild stone 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.140
 all the same sochi which sweeps all the same 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.140
 fill in 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.480
 so here I have not found 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.670
 here is interfax 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.140
 visually not see 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.950
 another important feature of this 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.830
 material is 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.770
 printing for us as for 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.140
 designers is a very important factor 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.880
 using certain 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.570
 opposition party color decisions we 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.990
 can create 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.990
 but into the atmosphere 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.010
 monolithic construction in 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.350
 concrete column 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.470
 bearing which is further simple 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.410
 was covered 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.380
 in materials 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.560
 looks like 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.739
 we are one big lump 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.959
 sandstone address despite the fact that 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.749
 this material can be used 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:15.439
 in almost any room 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.979
 plans in the kitchen and even shot 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:19.120
 first of all 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.420
 worth paying attention 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.209
 his uniqueness that he 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.299
 it is she who should be the basis of all these 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.299
 interior composition 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:32.769
 now
