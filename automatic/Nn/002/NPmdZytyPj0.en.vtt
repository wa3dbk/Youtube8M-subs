00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Tell me guys, on this bus video 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.040
 How do you create that velvety effect? 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.040
 in the water 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.279
 so it's very simple then 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.380
 It is what will cause it never 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.369
 I'll tell you what it is, you use a long 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.070
 exhibition 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.289
 so in the case of today is the day too 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.750
 cloudy so it's not so clear to 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.829
 I'll be easier to get this 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.420
 long exposure 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.610
 so what you have to do it without 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.039
 put the iso at least in case here is the 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.969
 center of a widow close the diaphragm 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:46.460
 of the valentino march that the f-22 and so 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.379
 Let's see what the city's favor is. 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.210
 camera will give me not to do a test 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.699
 here I set the mode shadow to 0 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:58.039
 then I put the project 22 will leave 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:59.359
 control the shutter or make the 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.949
 first picture after the camera is giving me 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:05.360
 a bar 10 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:07.490
 so let's see what effect it will have on 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.230
 shutter speed 1/10 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.780
 I'll wait for the water to get closer. 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:15.020
 that has to do quite strong and with 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.640
 water movement every photo has a way 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.770
 different 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.300
 I did not expect to get closer now. 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.300
 here will be the first photo 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.850
 how can you see the water there 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.009
 They rely on the mayor got a medal 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.140
 politics with an expulsion badon 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.460
 Then what are we going to have to do? 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.869
 now you have no choice but to 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.310
 to buy a filter to let the 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.200
 learn the camera darker so I 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.450
 I can use a governor's bag . 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.350
 Newest vote today using a filter is 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.659
 nbb 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.780
 this filter that it will change for me 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.539
 more or less 55 6 points 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.530
 in the exhibition will put in front of the 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.110
 lens here 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.080
 besides using tip today at 18 55 of the 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.330
 kit and even if it does not have four 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.310
 with her in front here to meet 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.380
 track by track composition bathroom is 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.720
 gossip right what's for later 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.940
 put fifth later when you put 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.590
 a filter on the front of the lens 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.720
 You will no longer get anything through 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.720
 firefox let's put it here 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.030
 because he already had compulsion manual focus 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:31.840
 It is very simple. 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.890
 I'll put here is that's it's on 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.600
 variable 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.800
 so I can make it clearer but they were 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:43.840
 placed at the most and now aa camera 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.980
 It's giving me two seconds of the shutter. 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:53.470
 I'm going to take a picture in two now 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:55.510
 seconds what will happen is you 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.470
 The effect is pretty cool. 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.470
 making various forms 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.320
 each will give a different effect 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.510
 as movement avatar has no secret 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.640
 only you doing enough door to put 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.530
 a filter so the weather gets very dark 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.900
 and you get a bigger exposure was 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.060
 the second will have a legal effect there 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.220
 you use the filter but like here the sun 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.170
 appearing and have time that comes 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.580
 So I stay put, I have to put 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.130
 A filter for me was able to control the 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.230
 shutter speed 15 seconds 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.230
 finish it cool and made for one more here 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.730
 you can see the result 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.980
 so it's that simple but serious 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.740
 just ask in the video comments and 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.840
 until next Sunday 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.840
 Wow
