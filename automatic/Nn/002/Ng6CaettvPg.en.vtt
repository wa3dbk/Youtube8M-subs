00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.550
 hello today I'm going to prepare some ribs 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.770
 grilled to whiskey we will need kilo and 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.539
 half of pork rib two onions 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.860
 a head of garlic pills 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.019
 broth concentrate I've taken it from 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.180
 chicken but you can use the one that is online 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:36.410
 will be at home a little bit of 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.739
 pepper a glass of whiskey oil 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.989
 extra virgin olive and a little sauce 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.730
 tomato is a homemade sauce that you have the 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.920
 recipe on the blog 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.460
 we'll start by sprinkling the ribs 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.570
 right now I just turned on the oven and 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:56.750
 I have it at 220 degrees so that when 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.879
 have already prepared the prepared rib 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.280
 can put directly and find it 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.280
 hotter we're going to pepper what 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.320
 I left the salt 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.860
 salt let's also put a little 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.860
 only to rectify 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.780
 we started adding in the pepper to 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.170
 I did not have to cut a 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.170
 puntita 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.430
 and I will have 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.430
 also from our side 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.070
 now with the broth pill we're going 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.060
 to crumble 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.060
 above 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.109
 if you prefer to put salt instead of 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:45.009
 pill because you have some the day 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:47.920
 with the family 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.740
 no matter this gives a little more 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.380
 flavor but you could also use if 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.560
 you want a broth anyway the 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.010
 secret of a good barbecue is more in the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.350
 quality of the products we use 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.540
 in condiments condiments 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.900
 they will only give a little 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.200
 global texture will help us to soften 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.410
 the 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.720
 and also flavor but the roast meat already 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.480
 in itself the head of 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.060
 garlic I'm going to put it whole 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.430
 and now I will add the whole onions 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.980
 I have to clean 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:31.440
 we give some cuts to the second 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.440
 and the parts in 4 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.900
 and the cast 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.900
 with the tongue 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.090
 and now we record it with a little bit of 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.090
 olive oil 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.700
 I'm not going to add him anymore because he's going to 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.470
 release a little fat on the rib and 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.500
 now as we introduce it in the 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.680
 oven we have yet to add the 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.160
 whiskey and tomatoes in the oven the best 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.500
 is to leave it at half height at 220 degrees 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.319
 we will go up we will lower the temperature in 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.450
 function to be done sooner or 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.330
 it takes a little longer this will be a 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.069
 little to each one's choice the case is 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.860
 that in the end we left the rib 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.170
 gilt after half an hour in the oven 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.120
 You can start by putting a little more 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.819
 of temperature if you want but if you have 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.950
 time to cook them the best is at 220 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.440
 degrees now it's already 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.840
 half an hour in the oven I took it out and I 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.480
 I'm going to add a few teaspoons of tomato 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.370
 very little will only be for you 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.299
 to medicate 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.299
 a tan color 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.410
 the sale 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.709
 all right 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.350
 you have to rotate it from time to time 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:11.160
 that already we will see as you go 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.160
 cooking 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.530
 it has already begun to brown 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:32.590
 Onion is already laid 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.590
 to do a little 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:42.890
 tomato as you see it is not necessary to throw 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.890
 too much we just take 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.260
 like someone pound and a half rib 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.610
 although you throw him half glove he quoted not 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.610
 I'm throwing too much 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.370
 add him 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.169
 the whiskey glass does not matter if you leave 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.599
 of tomato 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:05.610
 and so that it does not dry out I'm going to 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:08.430
 add a little water 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.439
 the better we take hot water will 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.219
 we will add each time you leave 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:16.169
 drying if we take a quarter of a liter or 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:17.969
 a liter does not matter the fact is that I do not know 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.590
 I do not know what the rib for him to go 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:23.290
 cooking well inside 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.200
 now I put it back in the oven 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.669
 until it's finished cooking 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:35.870
 after one and a half to two hours 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:37.820
 hours retained between 220 degrees and 250 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.560
 depending a bit on the pace at which 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:44.240
 I knew we already have the prepared rib 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.690
 we ask with a little bit of juice the 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.240
 juice is water that I have been adding if 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.040
 it lacks juice because it is added and then 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.560
 you have to rectify a little jump 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.300
 that we have not added much I hope that 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.060
