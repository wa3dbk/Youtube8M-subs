00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.260 
and of course TJ the tiger who was very
interested<00:01:03.220> in<00:01:03.610> what<00:01:03.670> was<00:01:03.850> happening<00:01:03.879> around

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.270 
interested in what was happening around

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:09.240 
interested in what was happening around
him<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:07.840> projected<00:01:08.320> 25<00:01:08.770> year<00:01:08.950> life<00:01:09.130> of

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
him for the projected 25 year life of

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.400 
him for the projected 25 year life of
the<00:01:09.369> system<00:01:09.550> annual<00:01:10.330> utility<00:01:10.840> savings<00:01:11.110> are

the system annual utility savings are

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.260 
the system annual utility savings are
expected<00:01:11.860> to<00:01:11.920> average<00:01:12.070> around<00:01:13.110> 1542<00:01:14.110> dollars
