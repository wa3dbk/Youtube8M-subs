number two and it's in c-sharp minor'
and<00:02:02.120> because<00:02:02.810> it's<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:03.020> Rhapsody<00:02:03.380> basically

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
and because it's a Rhapsody basically

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.760 
and because it's a Rhapsody basically
you<00:02:05.030> can<00:02:05.210> do<00:02:05.390> what<00:02:05.720> you<00:02:05.840> want<00:02:06.140> as<00:02:06.350> long<00:02:06.530> as<00:02:06.590> you

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
you can do what you want as long as you

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.510 
you can do what you want as long as you
stick<00:02:07.130> to<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:08.750> principles<00:02:09.380> of<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:10.010> Rhapsody

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
stick to the principles of the Rhapsody

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.470 
stick to the principles of the Rhapsody
you<00:02:11.330> can<00:02:12.520> because<00:02:13.520> I've<00:02:13.610> adjusted<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:14.180> to

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
you can because I've adjusted this to

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.810 
you can because I've adjusted this to
two<00:02:15.460> easier<00:02:16.460> for<00:02:16.670> me<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.910> play<00:02:17.090> certain<00:02:17.450> parts

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
two easier for me to play certain parts

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.340 
two easier for me to play certain parts
but<00:02:19.820> if<00:02:19.910> used<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.210> play<00:02:20.360> classical<00:02:21.110> pieces

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
but if used to play classical pieces

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.010 
but if used to play classical pieces
like<00:02:21.680> Chopin<00:02:22.550> waltz<00:02:22.700> then<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:23.570> would<00:02:23.690> have<00:02:23.840> to

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
like Chopin waltz then you would have to

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:51.240 
like Chopin waltz then you would have to
hit<00:02:24.170> every<00:02:24.350> single<00:02:24.500> now

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.350 

you<00:02:52.250> know<00:02:52.370> you'll<00:02:52.580> have<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.760> every<00:02:53.180> single

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
you know you'll have to every single

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.750 
you know you'll have to every single
note<00:02:53.680> in<00:02:54.680> a<00:02:54.800> classical<00:02:55.160> piece<00:02:55.310> but<00:02:55.520> because

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
note in a classical piece but because

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.610 
note in a classical piece but because
it's<00:02:55.940> a<00:02:55.970> Rhapsody<00:02:56.240> you<00:02:56.450> don't<00:02:56.660> have<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:57.020> keep

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
it's a Rhapsody you don't have to keep

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.280 
it's a Rhapsody you don't have to keep
that<00:02:57.740> in<00:02:57.860> mind<00:02:58.130> if<00:02:59.050> when<00:03:00.050> you're<00:03:00.170> learning

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
that in mind if when you're learning

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.130 
that in mind if when you're learning
this<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:00.890> you<00:03:01.730> find<00:03:02.170> that<00:03:03.170> oh<00:03:03.440> this<00:03:04.220> chord<00:03:05.140> I

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
this and you find that oh this chord I

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.500 
this and you find that oh this chord I
could<00:03:06.800> change<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:07.490> I<00:03:07.610> could<00:03:07.820> just<00:03:08.000> I<00:03:08.210> don't

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
could change it and I could just I don't

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.410 
could change it and I could just I don't
need<00:03:08.690> that<00:03:09.410> octave<00:03:09.920> I<00:03:10.100> could<00:03:10.250> just<00:03:10.430> you<00:03:11.390> know

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
need that octave I could just you know

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.240 
need that octave I could just you know

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
we start with C sharp because it's in

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.900 
we start with C sharp because it's in
c-sharp<00:03:51.140> minor'<00:03:51.590> you<00:03:52.190> start<00:03:52.459> with<00:03:52.580> C<00:03:52.730> sure

c-sharp minor' you start with C sure

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.410 
c-sharp minor' you start with C sure
when<00:03:53.090> we<00:03:53.180> hit<00:03:53.330> that<00:03:53.390> twice<00:03:55.060> with<00:03:56.060> our<00:03:56.180> right

hand and bugged me I've just eaten it on

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.729 
hand and bugged me I've just eaten it on
the<00:04:01.940> fingers<00:04:02.570> that<00:04:02.630> we<00:04:02.720> use<00:04:02.959> our<00:04:03.230> three<00:04:03.709> and

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
the fingers that we use our three and

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.320 
the fingers that we use our three and
two<00:04:05.200> so<00:04:06.200> we<00:04:06.290> go<00:04:06.470> three<00:04:07.220> and<00:04:07.250> two<00:04:07.610> so<00:04:08.060> really

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
two so we go three and two so really

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.060 
two so we go three and two so really
fast

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
fast

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.449 
fast
and<00:04:10.070> then<00:04:10.310> after<00:04:10.640> that<00:04:10.730> we<00:04:10.940> come<00:04:11.180> in<00:04:11.300> with<00:04:11.450> this

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
and then after that we come in with this

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.909 
and then after that we come in with this
which<00:04:13.459> is<00:04:13.489> C<00:04:14.300> sharp<00:04:14.330> G<00:04:14.900> sharp<00:04:15.200> F<00:04:15.769> and<00:04:16.430> G<00:04:16.760> sharp

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
which is C sharp G sharp F and G sharp

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.350 
which is C sharp G sharp F and G sharp
and<00:04:18.919> that<00:04:19.100> is<00:04:19.250> again<00:04:19.580> twice<00:04:20.480> fast<00:04:21.440> and<00:04:22.360> after

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
and that is again twice fast and after

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.330 
and that is again twice fast and after
that<00:04:23.510> we<00:04:23.810> have<00:04:25.030> which<00:04:26.030> is<00:04:26.300> C<00:04:26.960> sharp<00:04:26.990> B<00:04:27.410> C<00:04:28.310> sharp

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
that we have which is C sharp B C sharp

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.430 
that we have which is C sharp B C sharp
B<00:04:28.760> and<00:04:29.270> that's<00:04:29.570> just<00:04:29.840> played<00:04:30.020> with<00:04:30.229> the<00:04:30.290> right

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
B and that's just played with the right

and then after that we do this twice

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.320 
and then after that we do this twice
which<00:04:41.600> is<00:04:42.280> g-sharp<00:04:43.280> octave<00:04:43.700> the<00:04:43.910> lowest<00:04:44.210> G

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330
