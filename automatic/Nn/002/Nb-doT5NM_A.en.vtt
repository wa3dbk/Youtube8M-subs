diaper bag I actually don't have as much
as<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.270> thought<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.479> did<00:01:27.740> but<00:01:28.740> I'm<00:01:29.280> just<00:01:29.490> starting

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
as I thought I did but I'm just starting

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.170 
as I thought I did but I'm just starting
over<00:01:30.240> here<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.020> have<00:01:31.650> three<00:01:32.340> blankets<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.000> have

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
over here I have three blankets I have

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.289 
over here I have three blankets I have
two<00:01:34.159> receiving<00:01:35.159> blankets<00:01:35.700> these<00:01:35.970> ones<00:01:36.180> are

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
two receiving blankets these ones are

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.090 
two receiving blankets these ones are
just<00:01:36.329> really<00:01:36.689> nice<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.259> soft<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.979> they're<00:01:38.070> a

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
just really nice and soft and they're a

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.460 
just really nice and soft and they're a
little<00:01:38.250> bit<00:01:38.430> thicker<00:01:38.990> because<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.350> is

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
little bit thicker because it is

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.190 
little bit thicker because it is
actually<00:01:40.890> quite<00:01:41.549> cool<00:01:41.909> here<00:01:42.420> already<00:01:42.810> so

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
actually quite cool here already so

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.170 
actually quite cool here already so
those<00:01:43.530> will<00:01:43.770> keep<00:01:44.189> him<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.399> little<00:01:44.490> bit<00:01:44.759> warmer

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
those will keep him a little bit warmer

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.530 
those will keep him a little bit warmer
and<00:01:45.360> then<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.950> swaddle<00:01:47.549> blanket<00:01:48.360> and

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
and then this is a swaddle blanket and

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.440 
and then this is a swaddle blanket and
it's<00:01:48.720> made<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.920> think<00:01:50.310> they<00:01:50.490> call<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.700> muslin

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
it's made of I think they call it muslin

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.719 
it's made of I think they call it muslin
material<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.560> it's<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.189> little<00:01:53.430> bit<00:01:53.549> more

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
material and it's a little bit more

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.520 
material and it's a little bit more
breathable<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.720> lightweight<00:01:54.780> but<00:01:55.409> it's

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
breathable and lightweight but it's

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.190 
breathable and lightweight but it's
really<00:01:55.979> good<00:01:56.189> for<00:01:56.399> swaddling<00:01:56.729> them<00:01:57.719> up<00:01:57.899> nice
