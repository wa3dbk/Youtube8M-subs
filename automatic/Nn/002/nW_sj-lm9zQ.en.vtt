00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.620
 ready in Willich and we have 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.510
 first seen swimming in winter and 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.280
 be a fake fair prowein so we have 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.309
 Already well out of the cabin 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.840
 the second zone is exhausting for us 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.020
 the men realized that he was one 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.600
 less deeply into the cards 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.550
 in the attention because of the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.230
 energy level but still out of the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.390
 three days is not bad either 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:00.210
 yes that's all tactical things of the 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.430
 change come to ask I like the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.350
 tactical left out with that so the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.870
 was to know and his the next 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.250
 change refers to the very game we have 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.440
 a hard training week behind us 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.850
 bavaria of course a bit heavier 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.280
 the normal but that belongs to 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.170
 preparation for this i think we have 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.300
 already seen a few very good approaches 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.900
 Still, only a lot is stuck 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.060
 amount of work 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.000
 or is a lot of work ahead of us and 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.830
 yes but I think we can be satisfied 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.759
 I do not want to say anything we can 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.240
 Do not get us out either 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:37.470
 but as I said it was positive 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:38.369
 things here and the people so I have to 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.259
 to say honestly I'll have it in 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.290
 moment not seen because player before 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.440
 I did and most of the whales puck 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.509
 behind the line and yes there we have 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.740
 We were very pleased to hear 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.319
 why not tee off 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.569
 and who will be able to get into it relatively quickly 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:57.840
 different direction and dropped the premature 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.789
 but it's not that green yet 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.920
 demand we need video proof in 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.360
 this league is coming next year 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.340
 for those we start with such 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.850
 situations we have to play up 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.850
 to the 5th
