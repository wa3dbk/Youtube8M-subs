00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.320 
went onto soya milk for about three or
four<00:01:10.470> days<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.340> then<00:01:11.580> after<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.000> she<00:01:12.060> just

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
four days and then after that she just

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.550 
four days and then after that she just
wouldn't<00:01:12.479> go<00:01:12.600> near<00:01:12.630> solid<00:01:13.020> food<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.350> mean<00:01:13.500> she

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
wouldn't go near solid food I mean she

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.890 
wouldn't go near solid food I mean she
was<00:01:13.680> waning<00:01:13.830> at<00:01:14.010> four<00:01:14.189> months<00:01:14.780> and<00:01:15.780> she

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
was waning at four months and she

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.240 
was waning at four months and she
wouldn't<00:01:16.080> go<00:01:16.170> near<00:01:16.200> solid<00:01:16.590> food<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.950> think

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
wouldn't go near solid food and I think

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.190 
wouldn't go near solid food and I think
the<00:01:17.700> yoga<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.150> actually<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> safety<00:01:19.020> thing

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
the yoga is actually like a safety thing

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.980 
the yoga is actually like a safety thing
for<00:01:19.470> her<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:19.950> she<00:01:20.610> knows<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:21.119> safe<00:01:21.330> she<00:01:21.869> knows

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
for her so she knows it's safe she knows

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.420 
for her so she knows it's safe she knows
that<00:01:22.110> there's<00:01:22.259> nothing<00:01:22.380> unusual<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:23.040> there<00:01:23.250> or

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
that there's nothing unusual in there or

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.429 
that there's nothing unusual in there or
nothing<00:01:23.729> she<00:01:23.820> doesn't<00:01:24.000> like<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:25.110> she's

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
nothing she doesn't like and it she's

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.990 
nothing she doesn't like and it she's
just<00:01:25.650> always<00:01:25.799> too<00:01:26.070> stuck<00:01:26.280> with<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.939> she

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
just always too stuck with that so she

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.910 
just always too stuck with that so she
had<00:01:27.270> been<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.320> yogurt<00:01:28.619> was<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> only
