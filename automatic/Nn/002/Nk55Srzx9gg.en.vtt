00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
there's sort of like a little sort of

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.890 
there's sort of like a little sort of
it's<00:03:59.700> almost<00:03:59.880> like<00:04:00.030> a<00:04:00.090> zipper<00:04:00.329> catches<00:04:00.780> like

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
it's almost like a zipper catches like

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.449 
it's almost like a zipper catches like
the<00:04:00.989> zipper<00:04:01.229> pulls<00:04:01.500> into<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.859> catch<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:02.370> then

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
the zipper pulls into the catch and then

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.570 
the zipper pulls into the catch and then
it<00:04:02.549> kind<00:04:02.669> of

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
it kind of

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.550 
it kind of
I<00:04:03.610> think<00:04:04.150> that<00:04:04.240> the<00:04:04.510> dots<00:04:04.750> to<00:04:04.990> sort<00:04:05.200> of<00:04:05.260> improve

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
I think that the dots to sort of improve

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.410 
I think that the dots to sort of improve
the<00:04:05.770> waterproof<00:04:06.280> weatherproof<00:04:06.670> part<00:04:07.300> of<00:04:07.360> this

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
the waterproof weatherproof part of this

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.410 
the waterproof weatherproof part of this
bag<00:04:07.630> so<00:04:07.900> that<00:04:08.440> you<00:04:08.560> can<00:04:08.740> actually<00:04:09.130> keep<00:04:09.430> you

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
don't need to fold this all the way down

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.940 
don't need to fold this all the way down
actually<00:04:12.310> roll<00:04:12.880> up<00:04:13.180> the<00:04:13.450> top<00:04:13.690> of<00:04:13.990> this<00:04:14.110> bag<00:04:14.319> if

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
actually roll up the top of this bag if

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.740

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
you had just sort of more stuff in it

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.470 
you had just sort of more stuff in it
intermediate<00:04:17.230> at<00:04:17.350> taller<00:04:17.790> you<00:04:18.790> know<00:04:18.940> back

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
intermediate at taller you know back

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.750 
intermediate at taller you know back
carry<00:04:20.079> it<00:04:20.230> so<00:04:20.859> you<00:04:20.919> could<00:04:21.040> really<00:04:21.220> stuff<00:04:21.579> this

for a second so the bag has sort of two
main<00:05:06.970> compartments<00:05:07.570> here<00:05:07.720> you<00:05:08.260> have<00:05:08.440> sort<00:05:08.800> of

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
the whole sort of main part and then if

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.780 
the whole sort of main part and then if
you<00:05:11.080> look<00:05:11.229> at<00:05:11.350> the<00:05:11.470> top<00:05:11.710> part<00:05:12.100> you<00:05:12.280> have<00:05:12.490> sort

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
you look at the top part you have sort

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.580 
you look at the top part you have sort
of<00:05:12.820> this<00:05:12.940> zippered<00:05:13.720> opening<00:05:14.229> kind<00:05:14.530> of

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
of this zippered opening kind of

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.650 
of this zippered opening kind of
separates<00:05:15.040> it<00:05:15.250> now<00:05:15.729> I<00:05:15.760> use<00:05:16.210> the<00:05:16.360> zipper

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
separates it now I use the zipper

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.360 
separates it now I use the zipper
opening<00:05:16.960> and<00:05:17.110> I<00:05:17.140> think<00:05:17.320> they<00:05:17.410> design<00:05:17.740> before<00:05:17.950> a

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
opening and I think they design before a

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.490 
opening and I think they design before a
notebook<00:05:18.610> notebook<00:05:19.270> looks<00:05:19.630> perfectly<00:05:20.290> in

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
notebook notebook looks perfectly in

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.840 
notebook notebook looks perfectly in
there<00:05:20.650> and<00:05:20.890> the<00:05:21.490> zipper<00:05:21.729> compartment

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
there and the zipper compartment

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.790 
there and the zipper compartment
