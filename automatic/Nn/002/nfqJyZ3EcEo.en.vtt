00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 just before the departure of our team 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.120
 after hannover the korkut tested eleven 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.030
 again as an opponent in Feldbach was the 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.769
 Qatari club al Ahli sports against the 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.179
 former club of bavaria coach pep 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.549
 guardiola sent our head coach 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.740
 following position on the field in goal 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.619
 robert almer started from the right 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.750
 to the left moritz philippe stefan kÃ¤ser 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.510
 and micro alvanos on the double-six 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.519
 started 96 with centuries and 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.740
 fabian fiedler on the left side 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.369
 should be your strong for creative accents 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.439
 to care 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.600
 on the right-hand captain jan schlaudraff 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.989
 Before that, the young children formed Karaman 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.640
 and even the storm duo at very much 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.129
 Hot temperatures found the game 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.200
 By the way, at 13 o'clock ours started 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.059
 Team playfully here in the tenth 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.590
 minute sakkara manning started like that 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.840
 birk the nicely over the opponent 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.149
 goalkeeper chippte over the angle was 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.320
 But then too pointed so that an opponent 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.050
 could still clarify 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.210
 17 minutes this time the game is different 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.969
 so burke sent karaman and the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.739
 came to fall eleven for 96 and from 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.140
 Point was our team so far 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.309
 not so successful schlaudraff 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.799
 took over the burden 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:14.670
 the 1 0 for our guys absolutely 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:17.070
 At this time, however, it deserves to be 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.009
 also al ali in attack the strong 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.990
 monuta kabangu tried it after 23 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.689
 played minutes but no problem for 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.580
 Robert Almer is better for the Cathars 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.170
 It should be running a little later here 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.030
 the referee assessed that 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.670
 go in by stefan pieske as lazy 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.400
 Messer Ahmad gave alba no chance 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.780
 his eleven meter the 1 to 14 al ahli net 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.759
 33 minutes 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.060
 with this result, it went in 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.820
 the break from the 96 unchanged and with 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.710
 very much momentum again came only 20 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.840
 played in seconds kenan 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.420
 Karaman came on the way the beautiful pass came 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.100
 held by kyoto though 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.260
 the adjoining corner took over the 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.930
 Attack on the first post 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.360
 and there was again the 2 1 for 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.340
 96 what a nice head butt of ours 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:14.600
 Turkish youth national player only 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:16.370
 two minutes after the restart and 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.440
 Now it was shock 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.570
 Karaman was a great fit in this return match 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.210
 well, and what he did then was great 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.670
 class with fine technology would be arnaldo 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.130
 series in the gate of al ahly no chance 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.930
 and moved freestanding to 3 2 1 1 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.660
 what a wonderful kenan gate 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.660
 Karaman in the fiftieth minute 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.120
 and on, s 96 went on running 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.830
 on the opponent's gate too classic 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.050
 sprint from micro alvanos over the left 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.330
 page fits on smart and in it 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.400
 we just pay for our red ones 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.870
 only ten minutes played in the 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.880
 second half changed for the first time 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.800
 came after about an hour so Lehman ii 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.630
 for felipe and rakowitz for deer 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.340
 As a result, biggest lame slipped back on 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.380
 the defender position and 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.989
 schlaudraff into the central midfield 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.880
 our boys took many meters back 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.220
 especially the strong child Karaman 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.480
 the here in the 72 minute again in the 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.500
 was brought unfairly to ground 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.930
 but this time should not schlaudraff 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.640
 shoot but kinotage top left 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.200
 certainly turns five to one for 96 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.000
 and it should still be a hit 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.519
 give cheer seven minutes before the 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.769
 Karaman had the good eye for 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:34.540
 schlaudraff the very considered and beautiful 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.540
 increased to 6 to 1 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.780
 our boys wanted more here 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.120
 fought because sulimani me 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.700
 ball and conjured a bit but the 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:48.380
 scene went even further 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:53.450
 Bankovic on the ball for four days 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:55.370
 flank attempt and then sat down 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.480
 lehman ii through but unfortunately prevented 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.950
 the post a higher result 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.870
 but the final point was still allowed 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.599
 times the sport club al ahli set 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.000
 unfortunate action of sulejmani once 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:11.060
 rescued at first but the header could 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.829
 then nobody do anything with 6 too 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.629
 2 So our team win the 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.400
 last test in the training camp of bad 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.660
 radkersburg what a beautiful 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.340
 conclusion of a very good 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.260
 training camps and also ours 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.990
 chess coach tayfun korkut moved in 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.840
 positive conclusion of all the most important 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.530
 conclusion is we drive back without 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.900
 injured 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.539
 that's been incredibly important 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.910
 everyone could 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:38.120
 or almost everything says the whole thing 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.800
 Program is one has all minutes 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.550
 had 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.919
 therefore nothing is extraordinary 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.530
 happens that's for that's all 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:51.860
 positive then I have already said 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:57.110
 we are very focused and also through the 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:59.120
 just play worked hard 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.139
 Of course, the players also pull one 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.070
 uncannily uncanny power and to 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:09.530
 we have these duplicates 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:12.190
 had workouts and positive 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:15.560
 Conclusion from my side in any case 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:19.160
 and now we have two more 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.410
 really good endurance tests at home and the 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.720
 and as I said the last cut with 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.320
 the spritzigkeit all this one more 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.150
 little time 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:32.690
 there will be nothing in the 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.729
 then come in next week 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.380
 this is a very intense 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.419
 Training camp to end with many 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.949
 We hope that we will play you one 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.500
 could make a little joy and 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:45.130
 will report back to us from Hannover 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.130
 until then
