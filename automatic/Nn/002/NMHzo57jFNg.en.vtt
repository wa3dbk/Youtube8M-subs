 nintendo teacher 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.460
 the plot of the wind waker happens 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.710
 hundreds of years after the defeat of 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.719
 canon in ocarina of time and is situated in 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.550
 an ocean full of islands 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.589

 complete in gamecube the legend of zelda 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.560
 the wind waker had its detractors and 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.119
 defenders the cartoon style does not 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.130
 convinced all the followers of the 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.899
 saga and labeled it as childish 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.119
 But we must admit that aesthetics 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.760
 It broke molds and brought fresh air to 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.470
 the sector 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.930
 the first version we thought that no 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.940
 the graphic experience could be improved 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.610
 in the era of the 128 bits it was 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.920
 unforgettable that barrier has been broken with 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.290
 the remastering the image looks like a 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.790
 true cartoon for 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.350
 get it has increased the 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.180
 resolution of textures up 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.620
 reach 1080 pixels have been 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.960
 increased the polygons and it has 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.790
 adapted to the panoramic format also 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.380
 the field of vision has been extended and 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.680
 have adjusted the colors to more 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.140
 warm in terms of sound we can now 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.360
 listen to the great tunes in 5.1 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.090
 and not in pro logic 2 as it happened in 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.860
 gamecube to the remastering would have to 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.870
 blame him on bad decisions and mistakes 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.910
 The polygonal load has not been corrected in 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.100
 some areas of the video game especially 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.110
 those referred to the shadows and in 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.150
 certain times the new effect of 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.290
 the sun's rays whiten too much the 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.689
 image 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.040
 when a video game is adapted to hd the 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.719
 developers do not have us 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.159
 used to include other improvements 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:21.290
 that are not graphic and sound 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.480
 Nintendo has gone further and has adapted 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.150
 the wind waker the possibilities of wii 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.829
 and thanks to the new gamepad we will not have 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.049
 why pause the game to access the 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.790
 inventory in a fast way thanks to 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.189
 the touch screen we can equip 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.560
 objects visualize the maps and consult 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:38.090
 other information of importance the only 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.700
 it is not possible to use it 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.290
 during charges and sequences it also fits 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.060
 the possibility of playing in warm off in 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.310
 any time but in that case the 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.290
 controls are the traditional ones for 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.139
 those who do not convince them can use 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.419
 the command pro somehow the gamepad 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:55.250
 replaces the game boy advance in the 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:57.079
 previous version, there was the possibility of 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.000
 connect the laptop to the game club for 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.709
 that works with a map and even that 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.720
 another player will help in the adventure with 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.580
 different options the truth is that 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.710
 he is not missing either 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.360
 the gameplay has also been improved to 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.340
 when sailing with our boat 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.660
 the vast ocean sometimes in the previous 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.000
 version we lost a lot of time 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.130
 moving from one island to another now 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.780
 It is possible to acquire a new candle for 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.550
 travel faster without changing the 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.350
 wind direction the hook of the 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.940
 ship has also been improved is possible 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.650
 collect the treasures submerged in the 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.510
 ocean in a more comfortable way 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.030
 the controls have been optimized for 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.920
 improve the experience for example with 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.959
 the first person vision now we 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.970
 we can move and the gamepad gyroscope 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.600
 allows you to aim with certain gadgets and 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.150
 weapons 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.340
 these are not the only novelties of the 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.020
 legend of zelda the wind waker for 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.790
 pro players or for those who have 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.860
 lived the adventure in game club from a 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.620
 principle can play a new way 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.510
 hero in this modality there are no hearts 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.120
 to recover life and attacks the 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.100
 enemies inflict twice as much damage on 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.740
 As for normal mode this is quite 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.810
 simple the dungeons the puzzles and the 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.150
 final bosses do not present any 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.040
 difficulty surprisingly also 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.020
 has polished the end of the videogame the 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.760
 fans of the saga called it tedious and 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.100
 now it has been modified to make it more 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.530
 the saga may be already casual 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.239
 hoisted but it's still fun that's 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.890
 it would have been nice to leave the option of 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.709
 experience the adventure as you 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.720
 he conceived 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.090
 as not the remastering has been 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.770
 adapted to the social network universe now 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.630
 we can write messages and take pictures 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.979
 and enter the contents in a bottle 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.990
 so that players can 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.860
 find it by the beaches located in 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.860
 the different islands 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.210
 the legend of zelda the wind waker is a 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.340
 magical game not only for its appearance 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.840
 cartoon also because of its setting 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.259
 soundtrack and its characters 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.259
 charismatic 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.380
 it's a long title with a lot of 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.390
 secrets minigames and missions 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.460
 secondary since it has been restructured 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.320
 part of the game we would have liked the 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.120
 incorporation of a new dungeon or a 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.720
 object to further exploit the 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.250
 characteristics willy 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.960
 until the new delivery of the 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.640
 saga can be a pretty appetizer 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.200
 appetizing for new users of 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.000
 nintendo the fans will have to 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.590
 settle for this face wash that 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.320
 goes beyond the graphics but not 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.570
 we believe that they are in conformity 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.830
 if you want to lend a hand the power of 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.830
 trifuerza is with you
