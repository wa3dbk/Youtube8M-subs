00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
the guts to show you in a video so here

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.759 
the guts to show you in a video so here
we<00:00:19.289> go<00:00:19.439> we'll<00:00:20.070> see<00:00:20.250> how<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.430> goes<00:00:21.260> first<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.560> all

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
we go we'll see how it goes first of all

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.099 
we go we'll see how it goes first of all
of<00:00:23.189> course<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:24.210> wouldn't<00:00:24.420> be<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> banana<00:00:24.930> split

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
of course it wouldn't be a banana split

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.230 
of course it wouldn't be a banana split
without<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.740> banana<00:00:26.160> split<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:27.210> course<00:00:27.710> so<00:00:29.240> you

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
without a banana split of course so you

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.080 
without a banana split of course so you
will<00:00:30.420> peel<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.900> banana<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:34.579> split<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.730> down

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
will peel the banana and split it down

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.770 
will peel the banana and split it down
the<00:00:36.149> center

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.950 

in<00:00:42.199> here<00:00:43.100> for<00:00:43.460> our<00:00:43.550> banana<00:00:43.910> split<00:00:44.390> actually<00:00:44.870> it

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
in here for our banana split actually it

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.229 
in here for our banana split actually it
will<00:00:45.050> just<00:00:45.260> break<00:00:45.440> these<00:00:45.649> up<00:00:45.710> like<00:00:46.070> this<00:00:46.280> it's

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
will just break these up like this it's

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.009 
will just break these up like this it's
not<00:00:47.570> your<00:00:47.840> typical<00:00:47.989> bananas<00:00:48.710> football<00:00:49.129> today

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
not your typical bananas football today

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.560 
not your typical bananas football today
um<00:00:51.019> secondly<00:00:51.649> we<00:00:52.370> have<00:00:52.399> the<00:00:52.730> frozen<00:00:53.239> banana

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
um secondly we have the frozen banana

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.360 
um secondly we have the frozen banana
still<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.110> same<00:00:54.320> ingredient<00:00:54.860> just<00:00:55.100> frozen

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
still the same ingredient just frozen

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.130 
still the same ingredient just frozen
chopped<00:00:56.000> bananas<00:00:56.239> i<00:00:56.719> think<00:00:56.899> there's<00:00:57.019> about

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
chopped bananas i think there's about

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.910 
chopped bananas i think there's about
two<00:00:57.469> in<00:00:57.649> here<00:00:57.829> we'll<00:00:58.489> see<00:00:58.670> what<00:00:58.820> fits<00:00:59.030> in<00:00:59.300> the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
two in here we'll see what fits in the

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.250 
two in here we'll see what fits in the
food<00:01:00.920> processor<00:01:01.790> and<00:01:02.479> i<00:01:02.629> put<00:01:02.870> it<00:01:02.899> my<00:01:03.110> little

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
food processor and i put it my little

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.740 
food processor and i put it my little
old<00:01:03.559> school<00:01:03.890> food<00:01:04.670> processor<00:01:05.119> that<00:01:05.299> used<00:01:05.600> to

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
old school food processor that used to

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.520 
old school food processor that used to

ancient<00:01:10.240> cross<00:01:11.240> our<00:01:11.450> fingers<00:01:11.479> that<00:01:11.840> it<00:01:12.200> will

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
ancient cross our fingers that it will

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.950 
ancient cross our fingers that it will
work<00:01:12.380> today<00:01:12.830> I<00:01:13.310> do<00:01:13.880> that<00:01:14.060> every<00:01:14.210> time<00:01:14.479> I<00:01:14.690> use

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
work today I do that every time I use

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.210 
work today I do that every time I use
this<00:01:15.700> processor<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:17.119> we<00:01:17.720> process<00:01:18.350> it<00:01:18.590> until

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
this processor and we process it until

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
this processor and we process it until
it<00:01:19.460> becomes<00:01:19.820> a<00:01:20.000> soft-serve<00:01:20.420> consistency<00:01:20.659> so

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.420 

well<00:01:32.049> news<00:01:32.740> it's<00:01:33.430> partially<00:01:34.210> there<00:01:34.890> yeah<00:01:35.890> stop

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
and since this is going to be our

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.760 
and since this is going to be our
vanilla<00:01:42.580> base<00:01:43.030> which<00:01:43.390> is<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.689> vanilla<00:01:44.049> part<00:01:44.439> I

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
vanilla base which is the vanilla part I

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.610 
vanilla base which is the vanilla part I
don't<00:01:45.580> even<00:01:45.700> really<00:01:45.970> measure

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
don't even really measure

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.770 
don't even really measure
I<00:01:46.680> just<00:01:47.460> put<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> little<00:01:47.760> bit<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.120> vanilla<00:01:48.360> in

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
I just put a little bit of vanilla in

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.980 
I just put a little bit of vanilla in
there<00:01:49.790> when<00:01:50.790> we<00:01:50.910> used<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.150> do<00:01:51.240> crank<00:01:51.990> type<00:01:52.440> of

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
there when we used to do crank type of

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.900 
there when we used to do crank type of
ice<00:01:54.990> cream<00:01:55.470> we'd<00:01:55.830> always<00:01:55.980> have<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.430> add<00:01:56.520> salt

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
ice cream we'd always have to add salt

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.360 
ice cream we'd always have to add salt
so<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.270> me<00:01:57.510> it's<00:01:57.750> not<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:58.650> not<00:01:58.710> an<00:01:58.950> ice<00:01:59.070> cream

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
so to me it's not it's not an ice cream

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:22.390 
so to me it's not it's not an ice cream
if<00:01:59.550> you<00:01:59.580> didn't<00:01:59.850> add<00:01:59.940> a<00:02:00.000> little<00:02:00.120> sea<00:02:00.330> salt<00:02:00.540> so

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.370
