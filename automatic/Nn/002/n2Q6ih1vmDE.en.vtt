00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 And that's it, folks, it's okay, I'll bring one more. 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.250
 video for you who doubts today will 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.410
 be to talk about the most 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.990
 expected for e3 this year that already 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.269
 starts next week so hopefully 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.340
 You like the video I've separated 15 games 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.260
 I only put games that have already been 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.990
 announced and are likely to 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.119
 appear in this year's e3 so I do not 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.710
 I put lay- type games on the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.820
 two because of the troops of the two was not 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.199
 announced 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.150
 so I just put games that were 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.789
 advertised and has a chance of appearing 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.279
 at this year's e3 so let's go 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.710
 the 15 games and I hope you like the 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.930
 video in 15th place and I put the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.540
 the last guardian game in a game 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.399
 exclusively for playstation and in recent 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.469
 days there has been plenty of rumors that 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.030
 the game may appear on e3 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.010
 We've been gone a long time and without 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.469
 information about the game who knows the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.809
 People already have a release date. 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.930
 and who knows a gameplay would be very 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.149
 cool one in 14th place 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.340
 There's a break in the game. 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.739
 exclusive to xbox the year we do not 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.480
 had a lot of gameplay revealed from the game until 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.549
 The moment then I hope begins between them 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.560
 reveal more gameplay because we do not 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.930
 there's a lot about the game revealed 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.250
 still in question of such gameplay and the game 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.189
 there is that scheme there that will mix 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.470
 kind of the video game that he is 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.509
 half with one thing that's kind of a series 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.759
 television, then we play watch the 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.530
 series something like this so let's see how 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.369
 that's the idea and decide to stay 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.530
 cool 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.310
 so it 's a long awaited game for 3 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.290
 also in 13th place I put in a 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.320
 game that has just been announced this 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.180
 week of a mortal kombat x galera he 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.910
 already reveal a trailer including 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.590
 I even made a video on the middle channel 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.720
 that analyzing a trailer had not 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.180
 a lot to analyze but I made a 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.520
 video so who wants to see the video of 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.260
 mortal kombat x I commented the fear 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.940
 I'll leave the link in the description of the 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.810
 video that only has two minutes who 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.820
 To see, just click and the 12th 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.220
 because I played with him there. 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.320
 of id Software racing game that 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.150
 say right but finally the game is 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.180
 seems to be very cool there will have a 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.619
 gigantic country then like many people 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.030
 have more information 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:14.040
 in this year's e3 in 11th place 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.709
 I put the killer exploded this 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.480
 galley which is the next game in the series and 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.730
 Let's see how it goes. 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.920
 Let's see, I'm very anxious. 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.420
 to see how the next one will look 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.980
 Assassin's Creed and Let 's Go 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.450
 see if they can innovate 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.430
 I do not know if the next game in the series 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.260
 still going to have naval battles 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.500
 but one thing I've always wanted was that 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.650
 The game had tavares battles and it's a 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.209
 laine and then does not receive if 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.010
 naval battles and I hope that 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.680
 have still hope that the game also 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.930
 bring more innovation to the series because 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.120
 the last critical sense did not come this way 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.470
 with much innovation and I also hope that the 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.049
 game is good because I think it's a 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.269
 very good series but that has a lot to 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.459
 evolve even more consider us 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.290
 which is a murder game of tels 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.250
 knows there are many mechanics that can be 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.799
 put in the game to improve it so good 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.150
 and now could a journalist who is a 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.070
 game that was also announced 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.680
 officially it's a while back there 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.360
 which is a pair have hard laine yarn 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.980
 galley to the series game sound 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.180
 battlefield that will also appear on the 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.730
 e3 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.890
 I made a video talking about the game there. 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.590
 So whoever wants to see a link will be 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.969
 in the description of the video also to that 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.760
 butterfield that will be from a 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:27.450
 theme and let's see if the game is 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.969
 cool 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.329
 in the ninth place I put the star wars 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:35.459
 hit the galley source where there was also no 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.750
 much information is revealed then 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.010
 I'm really looking forward to having a chemistry. 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.989
 law of the game at that year's e3 the eighth 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.730

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.010

 I do not handle it uses around one of 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.769
 is or maybe even 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.629

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.970

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.859
 also already a gameplay of the game 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.459

 reveal revealed a gameplay is 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:12.870
 recently but i hope on e3 none 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.359
 bigger gameplay there to see how it is 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.829
 It's the game, I hope the fire is good. 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.720
 I hope that the gameplay they want 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.449
 Be nice 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.210
 the sixth game of the German league now you are 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:26.430
 the sixth game on the list is a new game from 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.750
 Batman guys so it looks like it's going to 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.490
 be very cool 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.950
 this way it will be able to control the 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.500
 batmÃ³vel by the city 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.420
 I'm pretty anxious also hope there 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.960
 there was a gameplay who knows in batmobile 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:42.090
 and also around the city on Thursday 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.850
 It 's a game that I've seen a lot. 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.380
 time behind a bigger one has tom 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.160
 Hot does not have any information about him 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.260
 had a boxing ix patriots in 16 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.150
 provinces sure to make your game too 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.460
 writing appears on the screen for you one 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.350
 Ubisoft game for a long time 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.690
 has no information about the game quem 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.640
 You know the game is back on e3 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.770
 this year seems to be a very 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.720
 interesting at least one video that 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.850
 they showed it to you dog behind 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.860
 it seemed to be very cool 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.650
 in fourth place what is that the 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.230
 winner 3d a rpg game that is also 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.450
 looking very good indeed 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.810
 then hope that he would appear more 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:24.060
 3 of this year in third place 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.490
 arriving in the top 3 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.230
 it's the third position I put the divide 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.110
 a ubisoft game also waiting 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:34.230
 enough for the best how it works 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.480
 and I hope he is at the e3 of this 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.830
 year will probably have the game was 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.200
 to be released this year the estimate 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.600
 last year, the same thing happened 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.460
 with batman batman that I said here in 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.169
 video will be released this year but also 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.730
 It was postponed for the last year 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.340
 from last year's weta has been 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.810
 delayed for next year 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.580
 so this is third game is the 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.310
 division there was also delayed and product 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.900
 in the second place we are 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.970
 arriving at the end of the list 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:04.020
 in the second place I put the Paraguayan 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:06.419
 4 guys I really liked the same package 3 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:10.080
 so they were quite expectation 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:12.960
 already to see a game play of far cry 4 43 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.540
 this year also the game of Ubisoft and 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.580
 in the first place it was a game 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:20.310
 that the most waiting to see in this e3 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:23.610
 is an exclusive playstation 4 game that 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:26.729

 I'm very anxious to see you 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:30.180
 game in my opinion the uncharted series 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.550
 was one of the series that most marked the 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.140
 seventh generation and everyone eager to 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.180
