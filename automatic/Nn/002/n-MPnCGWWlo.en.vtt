00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
that's like 120 Hertz clear motion that

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.690 
that's like 120 Hertz clear motion that
doesn't<00:02:59.079> necessarily<00:02:59.739> mean<00:02:59.950> it<00:03:00.129> is<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.340> full

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
doesn't necessarily mean it is a full

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.849 
doesn't necessarily mean it is a full
120<00:03:01.359> Hertz<00:03:01.780> you<00:03:01.989> need<00:03:02.140> to<00:03:02.230> make<00:03:02.440> sure<00:03:02.470> it<00:03:02.739> is<00:03:02.829> a

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
120 Hertz you need to make sure it is a

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.309 
120 Hertz you need to make sure it is a
3d<00:03:03.489> compatible<00:03:03.849> display<00:03:04.450> or<00:03:04.900> you're<00:03:05.079> probably

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
3d compatible display or you're probably

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.830 
3d compatible display or you're probably
not<00:03:05.650> going<00:03:05.859> to<00:03:05.950> have<00:03:06.129> any<00:03:06.640> success<00:03:07.150> so<00:03:07.660> in<00:03:07.750> this

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
not going to have any success so in this

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.589 
not going to have any success so in this
case<00:03:08.109> this<00:03:08.349> is<00:03:08.590> a<00:03:08.650> 120<00:03:09.489> Hertz<00:03:09.700> panel<00:03:10.090> we<00:03:10.420> make

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
case this is a 120 Hertz panel we make

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.539 
case this is a 120 Hertz panel we make
sure<00:03:10.780> it's<00:03:10.930> set<00:03:11.109> to<00:03:11.140> that<00:03:11.410> then<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.370> last

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
sure it's set to that then the last

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.339 
sure it's set to that then the last
thing<00:03:12.879> is<00:03:13.090> to<00:03:13.269> go<00:03:13.420> into<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.810> tools<00:03:14.049> and

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
thing is to go into the tools and

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.130 
thing is to go into the tools and
display<00:03:15.010> settings<00:03:15.430> of<00:03:15.609> 3d<00:03:16.120> ignition<00:03:16.569> and<00:03:16.720> make

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
display settings of 3d ignition and make

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.020 
display settings of 3d ignition and make
sure<00:03:17.319> that<00:03:17.470> it<00:03:17.590> is<00:03:17.709> set<00:03:17.919> up<00:03:18.040> correctly<00:03:18.069> so<00:03:19.000> we

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
sure that it is set up correctly so we

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.080 
sure that it is set up correctly so we
tried<00:03:19.450> a<00:03:19.750> number<00:03:20.200> of<00:03:20.380> different<00:03:20.829> a<00:03:21.130> number<00:03:22.000> of

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
tried a number of different a number of

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.819 
tried a number of different a number of
different<00:03:22.389> profiles<00:03:22.569> before<00:03:23.230> we<00:03:23.349> found<00:03:23.530> one

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
different profiles before we found one

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.740 
different profiles before we found one
that<00:03:24.010> worked<00:03:24.430> a<00:03:24.549> hundred<00:03:24.849> percent<00:03:24.970> in<00:03:25.269> 3d<00:03:25.630> in

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
that worked a hundred percent in 3d in

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.210 
that worked a hundred percent in 3d in
this<00:03:25.930> case<00:03:26.109> we<00:03:26.319> went<00:03:26.500> with<00:03:26.620> left/right

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
this case we went with left/right

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.710 
this case we went with left/right
remember<00:03:27.639> there<00:03:27.760> are<00:03:27.940> different<00:03:28.359> formats

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
remember there are different formats

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.750 
remember there are different formats
about<00:03:29.319> putting<00:03:29.650> 3d<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:30.099> a<00:03:30.130> display<00:03:30.549> and<00:03:30.669> it

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
about putting 3d to a display and it

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.909 
about putting 3d to a display and it
depends<00:03:31.299> on<00:03:31.389> how<00:03:31.900> your<00:03:32.109> display<00:03:32.440> interprets

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:32.919 
depends on how your display interprets

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.949 
depends on how your display interprets
it<00:03:33.099> however<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.940> software<00:03:34.359> does<00:03:34.569> come

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
it however the software does come

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.780 
it however the software does come
pre-loaded<00:03:35.230> with<00:03:35.560> a<00:03:35.919> number<00:03:36.280> of<00:03:36.400> profiles

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
pre-loaded with a number of profiles

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.409 
pre-loaded with a number of profiles
including<00:03:37.359> a<00:03:37.480> generic<00:03:37.959> HD<00:03:38.380> 3d<00:03:38.680> one<00:03:39.040> under<00:03:39.700> AMD

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
including a generic HD 3d one under AMD

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.180 
including a generic HD 3d one under AMD
so<00:03:40.959> once<00:03:41.139> you've<00:03:41.290> got<00:03:41.440> all<00:03:41.470> of<00:03:41.650> that<00:03:41.680> set<00:03:42.040> up

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
so once you've got all of that set up

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.430 
so once you've got all of that set up
all<00:03:42.489> there<00:03:42.970> is<00:03:43.090> to<00:03:43.299> it<00:03:43.450> is<00:03:43.599> to<00:03:44.079> launch<00:03:44.290> your

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
all there is to it is to launch your

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.500 
all there is to it is to launch your
game<00:03:44.500> so<00:03:45.099> the<00:03:45.340> launcher<00:03:45.730> can<00:03:45.970> actually<00:03:46.329> even

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
game so the launcher can actually even

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.449 
game so the launcher can actually even
launch<00:03:46.870> team<00:03:47.169> game<00:03:47.440> so<00:03:47.680> Crysis<00:03:48.040> is<00:03:48.069> a<00:03:48.190> steam

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
launch team game so Crysis is a steam

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.789 
launch team game so Crysis is a steam
game<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:48.880> it<00:03:49.480> kicks<00:03:50.019> out<00:03:50.169> this<00:03:50.319> error<00:03:50.530> but<00:03:50.709> it

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
game and it kicks out this error but it

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.110 
game and it kicks out this error but it
actually<00:03:50.950> works<00:03:51.430> and<00:03:51.579> we'll<00:03:51.730> show<00:03:51.880> it<00:03:51.940> to<00:03:52.030> you

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
actually works and we'll show it to you

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.629 
actually works and we'll show it to you
guys<00:03:52.180> in<00:03:52.540> just<00:03:53.049> a<00:03:53.139> moment<00:03:53.500> so<00:03:54.160> I<00:03:54.190> want<00:03:54.459> to<00:03:54.519> wrap

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
guys in just a moment so I want to wrap

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.369 
guys in just a moment so I want to wrap
this<00:03:54.669> up<00:03:55.000> with<00:03:55.209> some<00:03:55.450> actual<00:03:55.840> live<00:03:56.079> gameplay

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
this up with some actual live gameplay

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.220 
this up with some actual live gameplay
using<00:03:57.010> HD<00:03:57.340> 3d<00:03:57.579> so<00:03:58.150> we<00:03:58.299> launched<00:03:58.629> Crysis<00:03:59.049> one

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
using HD 3d so we launched Crysis one

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.680 
using HD 3d so we launched Crysis one
using<00:03:59.739> the<00:03:59.859> middleware<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:00.430> we<00:04:01.269> are<00:04:01.419> running

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
using the middleware and we are running

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.069 
using the middleware and we are running
it<00:04:01.900> on<00:04:02.079> our<00:04:02.349> samsung<00:04:02.889> series<00:04:03.340> 9s<00:04:04.090> a<00:04:04.480> 950

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
it on our samsung series 9s a 950

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.500 
it on our samsung series 9s a 950
display<00:04:05.500> with<00:04:05.769> the<00:04:05.889> Samsung<00:04:06.400> glasses<00:04:06.879> so

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
display with the Samsung glasses so

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.199 
display with the Samsung glasses so
let's<00:04:08.190> let's<00:04:09.190> sum<00:04:09.400> this<00:04:09.430> up<00:04:09.730> in<00:04:09.879> terms<00:04:10.090> of

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
let's let's sum this up in terms of

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.030 
let's let's sum this up in terms of
performance<00:04:10.660> so<00:04:10.810> we<00:04:10.930> can<00:04:11.079> run<00:04:11.230> Crysis<00:04:11.650> on<00:04:11.799> high

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
performance so we can run Crysis on high

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.970 
performance so we can run Crysis on high
at<00:04:12.220> 1080p<00:04:12.639> in<00:04:12.910> 3d<00:04:13.329> which<00:04:13.720> actually<00:04:14.199> is<00:04:14.410> no<00:04:14.709> mean

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
at 1080p in 3d which actually is no mean

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.939 
at 1080p in 3d which actually is no mean
feat<00:04:15.010> even<00:04:15.489> now<00:04:15.879> however<00:04:16.479> the<00:04:17.199> challenge<00:04:17.470> that

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
feat even now however the challenge that

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:19.860 
feat even now however the challenge that
we<00:04:18.190> did<00:04:18.370> run<00:04:18.549> into<00:04:18.729> is<00:04:19.090> that<00:04:19.120> we're<00:04:19.840> using

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
we did run into is that we're using

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.050 
we did run into is that we're using
Crysis<00:04:20.680> 1<00:04:20.859> we<00:04:21.099> actually<00:04:21.459> had<00:04:21.609> trouble<00:04:21.969> with

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
Crysis 1 we actually had trouble with

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.750 
Crysis 1 we actually had trouble with
some<00:04:22.240> of<00:04:22.360> the<00:04:22.419> newer<00:04:22.630> games<00:04:22.840> and<00:04:23.169> that<00:04:23.890> stands

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
some of the newer games and that stands

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.180 
some of the newer games and that stands
to<00:04:25.000> reason<00:04:25.150> because<00:04:25.690> instead<00:04:26.440> of<00:04:26.620> like

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
to reason because instead of like

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.420 
to reason because instead of like

finally there's a third party working on

finally there's a third party working on
the<00:04:46.840> middleware<00:04:47.410> so<00:04:47.680> you've<00:04:47.860> got<00:04:48.040> third<00:04:48.280> party

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
the middleware so you've got third party

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.460 
the middleware so you've got third party
software<00:04:48.790> as<00:04:49.300> well<00:04:49.330> as<00:04:49.660> two<00:04:49.840> pieces<00:04:50.020> of<00:04:50.290> third

compatibility<00:04:53.200> wasn't<00:04:54.100> as<00:04:54.220> comprehensive<00:04:55.180> as

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
compatibility wasn't as comprehensive as

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.840 
compatibility wasn't as comprehensive as
you<00:04:55.840> find<00:04:56.110> with<00:04:56.290> 3d<00:04:56.590> vision<00:04:56.800> so<00:04:57.160> the<00:04:57.430> flip<00:04:57.640> side

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
you find with 3d vision so the flip side

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.210 
you find with 3d vision so the flip side
of<00:04:57.880> that<00:04:58.150> is<00:04:58.480> that<00:04:58.750> the<00:04:59.170> flexibility<00:04:59.890> in<00:05:00.010> terms

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
of that is that the flexibility in terms

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.310 
of that is that the flexibility in terms
of<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:00.460> hardware<00:05:00.670> you<00:05:00.880> can<00:05:01.180> use<00:05:01.390> in<00:05:02.080> the

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.780 
of the hardware you can use in the
future<00:05:02.650> is<00:05:02.770> potentially<00:05:03.310> much<00:05:03.460> higher

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
future is potentially much higher

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.090 
future is potentially much higher
because<00:05:04.090> you're<00:05:04.360> not<00:05:04.510> even<00:05:04.780> tied<00:05:05.020> down<00:05:05.320> just

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
because you're not even tied down just

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.140 
because you're not even tied down just
to<00:05:06.250> 3d<00:05:06.690> LCDs<00:05:07.690> you<00:05:08.380> can<00:05:08.590> also<00:05:08.740> use<00:05:09.040> the<00:05:09.220> 3d<00:05:09.550> TV<00:05:09.940> or

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
to 3d LCDs you can also use the 3d TV or

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.450 
to 3d LCDs you can also use the 3d TV or

to<00:05:16.330> it<00:05:16.480> you<00:05:16.870> can<00:05:17.050> use<00:05:17.080> it<00:05:17.230> in<00:05:17.470> 3d<00:05:17.710> there<00:05:18.280> are

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
to it you can use it in 3d there are

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.490 
to it you can use it in 3d there are
some<00:05:18.670> caveats<00:05:18.880> though<00:05:19.300> we<00:05:19.630> actually<00:05:20.050> did<00:05:20.290> an

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
some caveats though we actually did an

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.830 
some caveats though we actually did an
HD<00:05:20.830> 3d<00:05:21.100> video<00:05:21.490> a<00:05:21.550> while<00:05:21.910> back<00:05:22.240> that<00:05:22.270> ended<00:05:22.750> up

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
HD 3d video a while back that ended up

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.660 
HD 3d video a while back that ended up
we<00:05:23.290> were<00:05:23.410> we<00:05:23.590> were<00:05:23.710> sort<00:05:23.950> of<00:05:24.040> wrong<00:05:24.250> we<00:05:24.460> thought

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
we were we were sort of wrong we thought

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.460 
we were we were sort of wrong we thought
the<00:05:24.820> only<00:05:25.030> way<00:05:25.150> to<00:05:25.210> run<00:05:25.390> HD<00:05:25.750> 3d<00:05:25.990> at<00:05:26.140> the<00:05:26.260> time

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
the only way to run HD 3d at the time

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.100 
the only way to run HD 3d at the time
was<00:05:26.770> to<00:05:26.800> use<00:05:27.040> HDMI<00:05:27.460> and<00:05:27.910> the<00:05:28.330> performance<00:05:28.900> was

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
was to use HDMI and the performance was

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.409 
was to use HDMI and the performance was
not<00:05:29.710> very<00:05:29.980> good<00:05:30.280> now<00:05:30.730> that<00:05:30.760> we're<00:05:31.060> running<00:05:31.330> it

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
not very good now that we're running it

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.560 
not very good now that we're running it
over<00:05:31.540> dual<00:05:31.810> link<00:05:32.050> DVI<00:05:32.350> the<00:05:32.470> performance<00:05:33.250> is

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
over dual link DVI the performance is

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.790 
over dual link DVI the performance is
dramatically<00:05:34.570> better<00:05:34.960> than<00:05:35.290> it<00:05:35.620> was<00:05:35.740> last

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
dramatically better than it was last

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.820 
dramatically better than it was last
time<00:05:36.250> so<00:05:36.910> ultimately<00:05:37.330> here<00:05:38.020> it<00:05:38.110> is<00:05:38.230> does<00:05:38.680> it

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
time so ultimately here it is does it

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.360 
time so ultimately here it is does it
work<00:05:39.040> yes<00:05:39.580> is<00:05:39.820> it<00:05:40.360> perfect<00:05:40.600> no<00:05:41.200> but<00:05:41.830> then<00:05:42.070> I

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
work yes is it perfect no but then I

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.220 
work yes is it perfect no but then I
don't<00:05:42.580> think<00:05:42.790> anyone<00:05:43.600> would<00:05:43.720> argue<00:05:43.780> that<00:05:44.080> any

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
don't think anyone would argue that any

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.230 
don't think anyone would argue that any
stereoscopic<00:05:45.160> 3d<00:05:45.190> implementation<00:05:46.120> is

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
stereoscopic 3d implementation is

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.870 
stereoscopic 3d implementation is
perfect<00:05:46.630> it<00:05:47.110> is<00:05:47.350> immersive<00:05:47.890> as<00:05:48.070> long<00:05:48.640> as<00:05:48.790> you

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
perfect it is immersive as long as you

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.220 
perfect it is immersive as long as you
have<00:05:48.970> a<00:05:49.000> glasses<00:05:49.300> and<00:05:49.630> a<00:05:49.660> good<00:05:49.840> quality

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.230 
have a glasses and a good quality

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.420 
have a glasses and a good quality
display<00:05:50.470> then<00:05:50.800> you're<00:05:50.950> going<00:05:51.070> to<00:05:51.190> have<00:05:51.400> a

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
display then you're going to have a

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.220 
display then you're going to have a
satisfying<00:05:52.000> 3d<00:05:52.330> experience<00:05:52.510> and<00:05:52.960> the<00:05:53.020> gains

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230 
satisfying 3d experience and the gains

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.440 
satisfying 3d experience and the gains
that<00:05:53.440> you<00:05:53.500> can<00:05:53.740> get<00:05:53.890> running<00:05:54.070> and<00:05:54.310> I<00:05:55.060> think

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
that you can get running and I think

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.900 
that you can get running and I think
that<00:05:55.660> pretty<00:05:55.870> much<00:05:55.990> covers<00:05:56.260> it<00:05:56.470> so<00:05:56.830> in<00:05:57.490> summary

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
that pretty much covers it so in summary

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.850 
that pretty much covers it so in summary
beyond<00:05:58.510> the<00:05:58.600> nvidia<00:05:58.930> side<00:05:59.169> you've<00:05:59.440> got<00:05:59.650> this

beyond the nvidia side you've got this
