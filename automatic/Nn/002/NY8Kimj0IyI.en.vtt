00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
newer design that we saw that looks a

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.200 
newer design that we saw that looks a
lot<00:02:04.079> like<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.500> HTC<00:02:04.979> Windows<00:02:05.189> Phone<00:02:05.610> 8x<00:02:05.790> well

arts and even though we were thinking
that<00:02:12.270> this<00:02:12.390> could<00:02:12.569> probably<00:02:12.720> be<00:02:12.930> a

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
that this could probably be a

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.690

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
that confirm that it is for real so

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.930 
that confirm that it is for real so
could<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:16.920> be<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.190> we're<00:02:17.340> getting<00:02:17.430> more<00:02:17.760> than

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
could it be that we're getting more than

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.880 
could it be that we're getting more than
one<00:02:18.180> device<00:02:18.360> as<00:02:18.690> well<00:02:18.900> well<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.620> leaves<00:02:19.799> me
