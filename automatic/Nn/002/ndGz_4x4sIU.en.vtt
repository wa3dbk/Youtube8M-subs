00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.340
 we are doing today with a fork rp 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:18.560
 doubt they are cabling a bit thicker 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:18.560
 Takes her a bit wraps the wool 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:39.480
 several times around the fork like her 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:50.360
 your point of want would have to 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:54.570
 rich draw gently hold on well 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:01:03.600
 then once in the middle with the rest 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:06.180
 live around in solid and one phase 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.780
 make a loop and a knot 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.780
 pull through 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:19.009
 the can you again once the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:25.020
 finger and then carry the rest through 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:33.890
 and solid and then just with the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.890
 scissors cut open the loops 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:53.360
 Of course you can not get big pompons 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:59.720
 join in but small for hats 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:01.450
 Example and finished our pump now 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.600
 we only have to do it a bit more 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:19.310
 just cut what is cutting so long 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:24.620
 we make the beautiful round and finished 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.860
 in Hongkong with the fork just like that 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.860
 you
