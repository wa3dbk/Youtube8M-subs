00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.540 
can't do anything to that thing because
it<00:00:40.239> is<00:00:40.360> a<00:00:40.390> defensive<00:00:41.050> monster<00:00:41.559> but<00:00:42.190> i<00:00:42.220> thought

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550

my goggles would you know I thought it

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.110 
my goggles would you know I thought it
could<00:00:44.440> at<00:00:44.530> least<00:00:44.680> do<00:00:44.920> something<00:00:45.250> but<00:00:46.000> it

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120

because I want to see what he's gonna do

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.729 
because I want to see what he's gonna do
so<00:02:03.429> i<00:02:03.459> use<00:02:03.729> a<00:02:03.759> heat<00:02:04.090> wave<00:02:04.259> expecting<00:02:05.259> him<00:02:05.439> maybe

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:05.739 
so i use a heat wave expecting him maybe

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:07.139 
so i use a heat wave expecting him maybe
to<00:02:05.860> switch<00:02:06.219> into<00:02:06.399> a<00:02:06.579> different<00:02:06.969> pokemon

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
to switch into a different pokemon

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.020 
to switch into a different pokemon
whatever<00:02:07.840> but<00:02:08.470> yeah<00:02:08.829> he<00:02:09.039> uses<00:02:09.369> toxic<00:02:09.819> and<00:02:10.000> I

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
guess he expects me to use heat wave

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.369 
guess he expects me to use heat wave
again<00:02:12.069> here<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:12.640> I<00:02:12.940> was<00:02:13.150> like<00:02:13.299> Shalala<00:02:14.019> gotta

to<00:02:22.720> use<00:02:22.840> heat<00:02:23.079> wave<00:02:23.260> again<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.859> I<00:02:24.310> end<00:02:24.489> up

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
to use heat wave again and I end up

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.479 
to use heat wave again and I end up
using<00:02:24.790> that<00:02:25.030> t-bolt<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.350> yeah<00:02:26.859> so<00:02:27.340> now<00:02:27.430> he

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
using that t-bolt and yeah so now he

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.430 
using that t-bolt and yeah so now he
goes<00:02:27.730> in<00:02:27.880> with<00:02:28.000> excadrill<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:28.900> thought<00:02:29.230> he

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
goes in with excadrill and I thought he

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.710 
goes in with excadrill and I thought he
would<00:02:29.590> just<00:02:29.799> stay<00:02:30.010> in<00:02:30.220> with<00:02:30.489> Vetta<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:31.540> he

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
would just stay in with Vetta that he

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.330 
would just stay in with Vetta that he
trained<00:02:32.019> since<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.319> was<00:02:32.410> are<00:02:32.530> already<00:02:33.099> dead

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.400 
trained since it was are already dead
it's<00:02:33.700> paralyzed<00:02:34.269> and<00:02:34.630> it's<00:02:34.840> just<00:02:35.109> you<00:02:35.380> know

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410

it's paralyzed and it's just you know
whatever<00:02:36.190> but<00:02:36.549> now<00:02:36.670> he<00:02:36.880> switches<00:02:37.120> out<00:02:37.329> to<00:02:37.450> his

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569
