 "Hormones in Skimmed versus Whole Milk" 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.122
 A very important review on diet and acne has been published this year in the international journal for dermatology. 

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:15.882
 Acne is described as a disease of western civilization, 

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:24.384
 an almost universal disease that affects 95% of teenagers and about half of adults here in the United States. 

00:00:24.384 --> 00:00:28.008
 But when you go to places where the more traditional diets are still eaten 

00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:34.495
 - Of the more than 1000 people who have been examined, there is not a single case with acne. 

00:00:34.495 --> 00:00:39.196
 Milk seems to play the most important role in this. 

00:00:39.196 --> 00:00:48.318
 The concentrations of the steroid hormones in milk are high enough that they may influence our oil-producing pores. 

00:00:48.731 --> 00:00:54.656
 But, if there are so many hormones in milk, then acne seems to be the least thing to worry about. 

00:00:54.656 --> 00:01:01.715
 From this year's German Society of Dermatology Journal - 

00:01:01.715 --> 00:01:10.405
 Milk consumption: not only an aggravating factor for acne, but a promoter of chronic diseases in general. 

00:01:10.405 --> 00:01:19.241
 Yes, the potential risks of cow's milk consumption include the influence on the skin. 

00:01:19.241 --> 00:01:23.909
 But I am less concerned about the so-called acne epidemic 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.133
 Then I am about the epidemic of dementia, cancer and heart disease. 

00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:36.618
 Although premature puberty and autoimmune diseases are also a serious problem. 

00:01:36.618 --> 00:01:43.640
 But in which are the highest concentrations of hormones? 

00:01:43.648 --> 00:01:45.260
 Skim milk? 

00:01:45.263 --> 00:01:47.230
 Semi-skimmed milk? 

00:01:47.236 --> 00:01:48.300
 Full Milk? 

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:50.960
 Or buttermilk? 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.330
 Here is the research - and buttermilk contains the most hormones. But who drinks buttermilk? 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:06.340
 Which comes second after buttermilk? Is it skimmed, semi-skimmed or whole milk? 

00:02:06.348 --> 00:02:11.400
 On the second place of 'the most hormone-containing milk' is written .. 

00:02:11.405 --> 00:02:13.000
 Skim milk. 

00:02:13.005 --> 00:02:15.470
 Why are we worried? 

00:02:15.473 --> 00:02:17.790
 Among other things because of breast cancer. 

00:02:17.794 --> 00:02:26.300
 The collection of substances that are suspected of causing cancer are always found in milk by scientists. 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:38.940
 Skimmed milk, second after buttermilk, in terms of the levels of about a dozen steroidal hormones recently found in milk sold in retail stores. 

00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:44.220
 This can partly be explained by what we have done with dairy cows. 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:53.670
 By manipulating diet and genes, it is now possible for us to force cows to milk even in the late stages of pregnancy, 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:01.690
 since we have to ensure that they are constantly pregnant so that they produce milk - that is good for the industry - 

00:03:01.694 --> 00:03:08.910
 But right at the end of the third trimester, the hormone levels rise, and that is what we ultimately drink. 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:18.430
 Milk was designed by nature to make things grow like crazy. That is why it is good for babies, but bad for tumors. 

00:03:18.435 --> 00:03:29.530
 Good for baby cows, but bad for adult people who carry small microscopic breasts or prostate tumors that we don't want them to grow so quickly. 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:44.050
 In a study of 140,000 men conducted this year, 35 grams of milk protein resulted in a 76% increase in the chance of developing high-grade prostate cancer. 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:56.240
 That is an increased chance of 2% for every gram of milk protein. So a cup of cottage cheese per day can increase someone's chance by about 50%.
