00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
should be an upstroke for the same

00:03:49.200 --> 00:04:01.259 
should be an upstroke for the same
reason<00:03:49.550> here<00:03:50.550> it<00:03:50.730> is<00:03:50.790> again

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.089 

this<00:04:02.269> sequence<00:04:02.510> repeats<00:04:02.870> later<00:04:03.349> on<00:04:03.590> so

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
this sequence repeats later on so

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.220 
this sequence repeats later on so
practice<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.670> section<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:05.180> few<00:04:05.390> times<00:04:05.599> so<00:04:06.110> it

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
practice the section a few times so it

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.100 
practice the section a few times so it
flows<00:04:06.470> smoothly<00:04:07.180> as<00:04:08.180> a<00:04:08.269> variation<00:04:08.900> on<00:04:08.989> the

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
flows smoothly as a variation on the

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.680 
flows smoothly as a variation on the
theme<00:04:09.140> to<00:04:09.560> starting<00:04:10.160> on<00:04:10.250> 5th<00:04:10.519> fret<00:04:10.730> look<00:04:11.540> at

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
theme to starting on 5th fret look at

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.440 
theme to starting on 5th fret look at
bars<00:04:11.900> 10<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:12.470> 11<00:04:12.560> they're<00:04:13.430> doubled<00:04:13.849> up<00:04:14.030> in<00:04:14.239> the

bars 10 and 11 they're doubled up in the
last<00:04:14.660> line<00:04:14.930> sounds<00:04:15.890> like<00:04:15.980> this<00:04:21.520> try<00:04:22.520> if<00:04:22.580> you

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
last line sounds like this try if you

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.490 
last line sounds like this try if you
can<00:04:22.790> to<00:04:23.060> play<00:04:23.389> the<00:04:23.510> fifth<00:04:23.750> fret<00:04:24.139> with<00:04:24.470> your

let's take a look at the other single

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.170 
let's take a look at the other single
note<00:04:51.419> passages<00:04:52.370> it's<00:04:53.370> a<00:04:53.430> good<00:04:53.550> idea<00:04:53.760> to<00:04:53.970> give

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
note passages it's a good idea to give

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.300 
note passages it's a good idea to give
the<00:04:54.300> idea<00:04:54.630> of<00:04:54.780> chords<00:04:55.200> and<00:04:55.380> arpeggios<00:04:55.440> in<00:04:56.190> your

the idea of chords and arpeggios in your
head<00:04:56.490> for<00:04:56.970> these<00:04:57.150> two<00:04:57.450> as<00:04:58.050> a<00:04:58.110> general<00:04:58.410> rule

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
head for these two as a general rule

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.620 
head for these two as a general rule
you'll<00:04:59.460> find<00:04:59.790> the<00:04:59.970> longer<00:05:00.300> you<00:05:00.419> can<00:05:00.570> keep

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
you'll find the longer you can keep

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.750 
you'll find the longer you can keep
fingers<00:05:01.139> on<00:05:01.230> the<00:05:01.350> frets<00:05:01.620> the<00:05:02.100> smoother<00:05:02.580> you'll

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
fingers on the frets the smoother you'll

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.090 
fingers on the frets the smoother you'll
play<00:05:02.970> it<00:05:03.030> look<00:05:03.960> at<00:05:04.080> bar<00:05:04.230> for<00:05:04.560> you'll<00:05:04.770> see<00:05:04.980> you

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
play it look at bar for you'll see you

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.010 
play it look at bar for you'll see you
played<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:05.400> neigh-<00:05:05.730> seven<00:05:06.210> there's<00:05:06.750> a<00:05:06.870> little

lead in to the next bar if you plan
ahead<00:05:09.419> you'll<00:05:10.110> see<00:05:10.380> that<00:05:10.500> these<00:05:10.680> notes<00:05:11.040> are

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
ahead you'll see that these notes are

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.760 
ahead you'll see that these notes are
just<00:05:11.550> an<00:05:11.700> a<00:05:11.790> minor<00:05:12.060> arpeggio<00:05:12.450> so<00:05:13.320> rather<00:05:13.560> than

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
just an a minor arpeggio so rather than

just an a minor arpeggio so rather than
playing<00:05:14.010> the<00:05:14.100> chord<00:05:14.430> and<00:05:14.639> taking<00:05:14.880> your

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
play the lead line like an arpeggio then

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.710

string leaving the first finger where it

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:34.700 
string leaving the first finger where it
is<00:05:26.970> see<00:05:27.419> how<00:05:27.510> smooth<00:05:27.780> it<00:05:27.900> is<00:05:32.930> the<00:05:33.930> same<00:05:34.169> idea<00:05:34.590> is

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
is see how smooth it is the same idea is

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.440 
is see how smooth it is the same idea is
repeated<00:05:35.190> in<00:05:35.250> bars<00:05:35.490> eight<00:05:35.790> and<00:05:36.000> nine<00:05:36.240> and

later<00:05:37.139> on<00:05:37.410> in<00:05:37.530> the<00:05:37.620> fourth<00:05:37.889> line<00:05:38.160> use<00:05:38.430> the<00:05:38.610> same

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
later on in the fourth line use the same

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.440 
later on in the fourth line use the same
principle<00:05:40.100> that'll<00:05:41.100> do<00:05:41.250> for<00:05:41.430> now<00:05:41.490> I<00:05:41.910> need<00:05:42.360> to

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
principle that'll do for now I need to

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.540 
principle that'll do for now I need to
take<00:05:42.600> some<00:05:42.810> medicine<00:05:43.110> come<00:05:43.919> back<00:05:44.070> next<00:05:44.280> time

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
take some medicine come back next time

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.790 
take some medicine come back next time
and<00:05:44.820> I'll<00:05:45.389> show<00:05:45.600> you<00:05:45.630> some<00:05:45.900> chord<00:05:46.260> passages

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
and I'll show you some chord passages

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.590 
and I'll show you some chord passages
and<00:05:46.919> get<00:05:47.070> some<00:05:47.220> rhythm<00:05:47.460> in<00:05:47.669> them<00:05:47.850> take<00:05:48.570> a
