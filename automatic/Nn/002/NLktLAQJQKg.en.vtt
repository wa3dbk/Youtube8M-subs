00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.500 
like the LEM shadows and in this photo
from<00:03:37.660> Apollo<00:03:37.960> 17<00:03:38.820> again<00:03:39.820> the<00:03:39.940> shadows<00:03:40.330> are

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
from Apollo 17 again the shadows are

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
parallel with one another so the shadows

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.290 
parallel with one another so the shadows

will never intersect it's not just the
