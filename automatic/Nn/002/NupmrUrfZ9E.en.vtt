00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
Jaguar main dealerships and I think

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.330 
Jaguar main dealerships and I think
that's<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:55.809> case<00:00:55.960> prior<00:00:56.290> to<00:00:56.440> that<00:00:56.590> not<00:00:57.129> just

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
that's the case prior to that not just

carried<00:01:00.220> out<00:01:00.340> so<00:01:01.590> mechanically<00:01:02.590> it<00:01:02.680> should<00:01:02.890> be

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
carried out so mechanically it should be

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.550 
carried out so mechanically it should be
really<00:01:03.580> rather<00:01:03.730> good<00:01:03.910> and<00:01:04.449> I've<00:01:04.540> done<00:01:04.780> quite<00:01:05.530> a

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.390 
gets on with it nicely all the
instruments<00:02:31.080> are<00:02:31.200> working<00:02:31.350> properly<00:02:31.740> I<00:02:32.070> think

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
instruments are working properly I think

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.980 
instruments are working properly I think
I<00:02:32.430> have<00:02:32.580> seen<00:02:32.790> just<00:02:33.000> on<00:02:33.240> one<00:02:33.510> or<00:02:33.600> two<00:02:33.630> occasions

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
I have seen just on one or two occasions

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.050 
I have seen just on one or two occasions
where<00:02:34.350> I've<00:02:34.410> been<00:02:34.530> parked<00:02:34.860> on<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.040> slope<00:02:35.340> just

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
where I've been parked on a slope just

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.960 
where I've been parked on a slope just
on<00:02:36.240> start<00:02:36.930> up<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.320> fuel<00:02:37.530> gauge<00:02:37.740> hasn't<00:02:38.190> hasn't

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
on start up the fuel gauge hasn't hasn't

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.490 
on start up the fuel gauge hasn't hasn't
registered<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:39.750> has<00:02:39.840> stayed<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.290> way<00:02:40.350> until

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
registered and has stayed that way until

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.340 
registered and has stayed that way until
have<00:02:41.030> stopped<00:02:42.030> my<00:02:42.240> destination<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:42.960> started

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
have stopped my destination and started

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.840 
have stopped my destination and started
again<00:02:43.590> but<00:02:43.800> I<00:02:44.070> think<00:02:44.250> that's<00:02:44.400> just<00:02:44.580> where<00:02:44.730> it's

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
again but I think that's just where it's

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.060 
again but I think that's just where it's
been<00:02:44.970> parked<00:02:45.210> on<00:02:45.480> on<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.200> slope<00:02:46.530> certainly<00:02:46.950> it's

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
been parked on on a slope certainly it's

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.070 
been parked on on a slope certainly it's
as<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.370> can<00:02:47.490> see<00:02:47.700> hopefully<00:02:48.510> from<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.840> video

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
as you can see hopefully from the video

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.440 
as you can see hopefully from the video
it's<00:02:49.200> working<00:02:49.260> properly<00:02:50.040> at<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.280> moment

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
it's working properly at the moment

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.120 
it's working properly at the moment
it's<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.380> standing<00:02:53.650> for<00:02:53.770> a<00:02:53.800> couple<00:02:54.069> of

it's to standing for a couple of

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:06.270 
it's to standing for a couple of
intermittent<00:02:55.060> occasions

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.920 

look<00:03:06.790> quite<00:03:06.970> good<00:03:07.000> drivers<00:03:07.420> cars<00:03:07.630> these<00:03:07.780> they

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
look quite good drivers cars these they

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.450 
look quite good drivers cars these they
really<00:03:08.140> put<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.350> power<00:03:08.500> down<00:03:08.530> well<00:03:08.920> obviously

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
really put the power down well obviously

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:17.620 
really put the power down well obviously

it's<00:03:19.769> got<00:03:19.890> cruise<00:03:20.099> control<00:03:20.219> which<00:03:20.640> all<00:03:20.790> works

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:20.969 
it's got cruise control which all works

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:28.880 
it's got cruise control which all works
properly

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.530 

can't<00:03:29.460> really<00:03:29.550> fault<00:03:29.820> if<00:03:29.940> anything<00:03:30.270> I<00:03:30.360> will

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
can't really fault if anything I will

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.940 
can't really fault if anything I will
say<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.900> air<00:03:30.990> conditioning<00:03:31.560> or<00:03:31.740> the<00:03:31.830> rather

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
say the air conditioning or the rather

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.510 
say the air conditioning or the rather
climate<00:03:32.430> control<00:03:32.820> isn't<00:03:33.420> particularly<00:03:34.020> cold

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.270 

that<00:03:38.520> know<00:03:38.670> why<00:03:38.850> this<00:03:39.650> feels<00:03:40.650> in<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:40.920> history

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
that know why this feels in the history

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.400 
that know why this feels in the history
for<00:03:41.490> having<00:03:41.850> accumulators<00:03:42.780> replace<00:03:43.140> and

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
for having accumulators replace and

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.590 
for having accumulators replace and
stuff<00:03:43.590> like<00:03:43.740> that<00:03:43.980> so<00:03:44.330> it's<00:03:45.330> not<00:03:45.450> especially

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
stuff like that so it's not especially

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:55.820 
stuff like that so it's not especially
cold

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:05.230 

tracks<00:03:56.430> perfectly<00:03:56.670> straight<00:03:57.090> at<00:03:57.270> high<00:03:57.420> speed

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.270 

sigh<00:04:05.930> hundred<00:04:06.230> and<00:04:06.350> six<00:04:06.500> thousand<00:04:06.920> warranted

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
sigh hundred and six thousand warranted

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.199 
sigh hundred and six thousand warranted
miles

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:20.860 

good<00:04:12.659> under<00:04:12.870> heavy<00:04:13.049> braking

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:31.480 

and<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.560> full<00:04:21.739> acceleration<00:04:23.590> spot-on<00:04:24.590> again

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.060 

so<00:04:32.090> quite<00:04:32.270> a<00:04:32.300> quick<00:04:32.450> little<00:04:32.720> thing<00:04:32.980> not<00:04:33.980> much

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
so quite a quick little thing not much

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.580 
so quite a quick little thing not much
else<00:04:34.220> I<00:04:34.340> can<00:04:34.370> say<00:04:34.580> about<00:04:34.670> it<00:04:34.850> really<00:04:34.970> just<00:04:35.590> gets

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
else I can say about it really just gets

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:43.810 
else I can say about it really just gets
on<00:04:36.710> with<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:36.890> job<00:04:37.540> quite<00:04:38.540> nice<00:04:38.780> and<00:04:38.900> refined

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.240 

and<00:04:44.300> say<00:04:44.480> there's<00:04:44.690> a<00:04:44.750> small<00:04:44.990> model<00:04:45.290> so<00:04:45.590> it's<00:04:45.710> um

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
and say there's a small model so it's um

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.850 
and say there's a small model so it's um
