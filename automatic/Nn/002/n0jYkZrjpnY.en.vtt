right now I'm virtually exclusive I

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.519 
right now I'm virtually exclusive I
don't<00:00:26.670> cook<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.570> uniform<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.230> know<00:00:28.260> it

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
don't cook in this uniform you know it

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:46.369 
don't cook in this uniform you know it
would<00:00:28.650> get<00:00:31.669> no<00:00:38.870> ya<00:00:41.270> was<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> good<00:00:42.450> year<00:00:45.379> don't

would get no ya was a good year don't

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.310 
would get no ya was a good year don't
remember<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:47.300> was<00:00:48.300> trying<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.750> teach<00:00:48.899> them<00:00:49.110> some

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
remember I was trying to teach them some

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.619 
remember I was trying to teach them some
science<00:00:49.710> earlier<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.489> watch<00:00:50.940> watch<00:00:51.239> watch

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
science earlier and watch watch watch

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.189 
science earlier and watch watch watch
what<00:00:51.809> happens<00:00:52.160> so<00:00:53.160> I'm<00:00:53.910> talking<00:00:54.180> about<00:00:54.449> you

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
what happens so I'm talking about you

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.229 
what happens so I'm talking about you
know<00:00:55.260> biological<00:00:55.920> reproduction<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.760> all

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
know biological reproduction of all

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.209 
know biological reproduction of all
sorts<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.780> animals<00:00:58.230> not<00:00:58.320> just<00:00:58.649> humans<00:00:59.039> so

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
sorts of animals not just humans so

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.860 
sorts of animals not just humans so
there's<00:00:59.399> asexual<00:01:00.059> reproduction<00:01:00.510> and

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
there's asexual reproduction and

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.319 
there's asexual reproduction and
reproduction<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.530> plants<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.399> know<00:01:03.149> that

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
reproduction of plants you know that

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.390 
reproduction of plants you know that
it's<00:01:03.750> more<00:01:03.989> than<00:01:04.140> just<00:01:04.199> human<00:01:04.739> biology<00:01:05.010> you'd

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
it's more than just human biology you'd

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:32.090 
it's more than just human biology you'd
be<00:01:05.549> learning<00:01:05.880> about<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.119> college

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.590 

that's<00:01:33.100> what<00:01:33.280> you<00:01:33.370> do<00:01:33.550> if<00:01:33.670> you<00:01:33.850> really<00:01:34.300> think

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
that's what you do if you really think

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.060 
that's what you do if you really think
you're<00:01:34.810> gonna<00:01:34.930> stop<00:01:37.440> this<00:01:38.440> really<00:01:38.830> could

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
you're gonna stop this really could

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.190 
you're gonna stop this really could
explode<00:01:39.550> I'm<00:01:39.790> going<00:01:40.030> to<00:01:40.120> put<00:01:40.300> my<00:01:40.450> loved<00:01:40.660> one

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
explode I'm going to put my loved one

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.560 
explode I'm going to put my loved one
back<00:01:41.410> so<00:01:42.340> you<00:01:42.400> can<00:01:42.520> step<00:01:42.760> right<00:01:42.790> out<00:01:42.970> of<00:01:43.240> it<00:01:43.360> and

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
back so you can step right out of it and

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.410 
back so you can step right out of it and
then<00:01:43.720> just<00:01:44.400> exactly<00:01:45.400> in<00:01:46.030> case<00:01:46.210> it's<00:01:46.390> on<00:01:46.510> fire

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
then just exactly in case it's on fire

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.700 
then just exactly in case it's on fire
fire<00:01:49.420> is<00:01:49.750> something<00:01:50.140> I<00:01:50.200> know<00:01:50.260> how<00:01:50.470> to<00:01:50.530> deal

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
fire is something I know how to deal

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:58.410 
fire is something I know how to deal
with<00:01:53.940> eyebrows<00:01:54.940> this<00:01:55.570> one

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.930 

so<00:01:59.050> fires<00:01:59.740> something<00:02:00.310> you<00:02:00.400> know<00:02:00.520> how<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.730> deal

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
so fires something you know how to deal

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:28.880 
so fires something you know how to deal
with<00:02:01.120> them<00:02:02.070> yeah<00:02:12.270> now<00:02:15.720> thought<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:16.810> liked<00:02:17.050> me

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.900 

know<00:02:31.860> if<00:02:32.860> you<00:02:33.010> didn't<00:02:33.310> have<00:02:33.370> sense<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:33.820> might

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
know if you didn't have sense you might

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.810 
know if you didn't have sense you might
be<00:02:34.090> able<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.270> keep<00:02:34.420> up<00:02:34.570> with<00:02:34.630> me<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:37.890> try<00:02:38.890> but<00:02:39.489> you

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
be able to keep up with me I try but you

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.310 
be able to keep up with me I try but you
know<00:02:42.360> it's<00:02:43.360> getting<00:02:43.600> like<00:02:43.720> three<00:02:43.930> more<00:02:44.230> of

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
know it's getting like three more of

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.270 
know it's getting like three more of
those<00:02:44.440> give<00:02:44.739> up<00:02:44.860> of<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.330> sure<00:02:46.330> mm-hmm

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.420 

so<00:02:51.280> about<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.820> hotel<00:02:52.209> room
