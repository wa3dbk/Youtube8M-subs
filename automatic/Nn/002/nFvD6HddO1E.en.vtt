00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
here with Brian from Benro and we're

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.240 
here with Brian from Benro and we're
talking<00:00:24.000> about<00:00:24.500> some<00:00:25.500> new<00:00:25.529> heads<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.070> legs

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
talking about some new heads and legs

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.820 
talking about some new heads and legs
and<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:27.480> think<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.349> price<00:00:28.560> point<00:00:28.769> is

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
and I think the the price point is

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.439 
and I think the the price point is
pretty<00:00:29.010> attractive<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.519> what<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.269> that

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
pretty attractive so what is this that

hat<00:01:03.870> bolts<00:01:04.199> fix<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.309> can<00:01:05.430> actually

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
hat bolts fix to it you can actually

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.820 
hat bolts fix to it you can actually
remove<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.119> stud<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.659> go<00:01:06.810> flat<00:01:07.080> base<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.650> when

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
you're attaching it to a slider or jib

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.840 
you're attaching it to a slider or jib
it's<00:01:09.930> perfect<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.430> you're<00:01:11.580> looking

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
it's perfect for that and you're looking

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.230 
it's perfect for that and you're looking
at<00:01:12.200> operator<00:01:13.200> side<00:01:13.470> control<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.670> obviously

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
at operator side control so obviously

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.859 
at operator side control so obviously
your<00:01:15.630> tilt<00:01:16.350> drag<00:01:16.650> lock<00:01:17.100> pan<00:01:17.850> drag<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.659> lock

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
your tilt drag lock pan drag and lock

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.870 
your tilt drag lock pan drag and lock
all<00:01:19.470> accessible<00:01:19.860> with<00:01:20.130> your<00:01:20.280> left<00:01:20.460> hand

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
all accessible with your left hand

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.420 
all accessible with your left hand
we<00:01:21.390> added<00:01:21.540> some<00:01:21.830> accessory<00:01:22.830> mounts<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
we added some accessory mounts on the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.890 
we added some accessory mounts on the
front<00:01:23.700> both<00:01:24.000> sides<00:01:24.270> 3/8<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:27.270> nicest

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
front both sides 3/8 and the nicest

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.600 
front both sides 3/8 and the nicest
thing<00:01:28.080> about<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.189> counterbalance

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
thing about this is the counterbalance

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.749 
thing about this is the counterbalance
to<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.630> you've<00:01:30.810> got<00:01:31.020> five<00:01:31.560> steps<00:01:31.979> here<00:01:32.400> not

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
to so you've got five steps here not

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.080 
to so you've got five steps here not
including<00:01:33.180> zero<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.369> just<00:01:35.369> dial<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.909> in<00:01:36.060> and

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
including zero so just dial it in and

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.760 
including zero so just dial it in and
you<00:01:36.869> know<00:01:36.960> within<00:01:37.140> an<00:01:37.350> eight<00:01:37.470> point<00:01:37.710> eight

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
you know within an eight point eight

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.440 
you know within an eight point eight
pound<00:01:38.040> capacity<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.670> have<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.939> many<00:01:39.119> steps

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
pound capacity to have that many steps

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.969 
pound capacity to have that many steps
it<00:01:39.600> really<00:01:39.900> helps<00:01:40.200> fine-tune<00:01:40.799> that

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
it really helps fine-tune that

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.039 
it really helps fine-tune that
counterbalance<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.720> use<00:01:42.840> there's

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
counterbalance and so that use there's

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.350 
counterbalance and so that use there's
two<00:01:43.200> models<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.340> six<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
two models this is the six this the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.270 
two models this is the six this the
smaller<00:01:45.630> one<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:49.470> larger<00:01:49.770> one<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.920> six

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
smaller one and the larger one the six

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.999 
smaller one and the larger one the six
will<00:01:50.460> hold<00:01:50.579> thirteen<00:01:51.000> pounds<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.770> pleats

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
will hold thirteen pounds and the pleats

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.100 
will hold thirteen pounds and the pleats
that<00:01:53.100> we<00:01:53.250> use<00:01:53.430> now<00:01:53.670> we've<00:01:54.090> got<00:01:54.240> adopted<00:01:54.990> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
that we use now we've got adopted the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.670 
that we use now we've got adopted the
whole<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:56.009> know<00:01:56.070> 501<00:01:56.520> 504<00:01:57.180> even<00:01:57.990> everyone's

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
whole you know 501 504 even everyone's

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.469 
whole you know 501 504 even everyone's
