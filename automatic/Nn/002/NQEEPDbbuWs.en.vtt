00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.070
 and the avocados the avocados 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.500
 they begin to mature until they are taken 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.570
 the tree is to buy an avocado is 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.330
 hard as a rock do not keep it in the 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.760
 refrigerator or refrigerator as it will retard 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.310
 the maturation process on the other hand 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.110
 if you have ripe avocados and you want 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.419
 prolong the in good conditions 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.910
 before they become too mature 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.660
 then place them in the refrigerator 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.739
 If you're not going to eat it immediately 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.330
 now let's talk about the tomato 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.730
 technically it is a fruit but the taste 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.070
 wise is closer to a vegetable if 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.140
 have you ever grown tomato then 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.000
 you will know that he loves the heat and does not 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.129
 like the cold therefore the 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.890
 refrigerator or the fridge is not the place 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.809
 ideal to store the tomatoes put them 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.850
 at room temperature and I assure you that 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.560
 they will know you fresher at the moment of 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.990
 prepare a salad and cook them 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.330
 let's talk now about the onion I advise you 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.240
 that you keep it in a cool dry place 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.340
 dark and well ventilated since the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.680
 lack of air circulation will cause the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.120
 onion is damaged I do not advise you either 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.730
 place the onion that you give 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.150
 directly sunlight as it can 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.340
 change their flavor and turn bitter I 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.980
 I advise you to place it in a basket in your 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.290
 kitchen besides looking very good you 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.160
 I assure you that it will not change its texture 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.160
 no flavor 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.970
 potatoes is another of the foods that 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.010
 they do not like the cold 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.470
 we must preserve them at temperatures 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.450
 cool, not cold, and why not in the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.880
 refrigerator because the storage of 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.490
 potatoes in cold temperatures turns your 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.800
 starch in sugar more quickly what 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.930
 which can affect its texture flavor and 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.670
 I recommend placing them in a 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.460
 dark place inside a bag 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.140
 paper since it is more breathable than 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.110
 plastic so they do not get damaged with 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.000
 ease and retains its point now 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.770
 basil tomatoes and basil 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.450
 they are an excellent combination in 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.759
 dish and it turns out that they also have 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.739
 similar needs the basil him 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.840
 love the heat if you put it in the 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.690
 refrigerator will make them wilt before 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.920
 time my recommendation places a bunch 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.920
 of basil in a glass with water 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.440
 changing the water every day or two without 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.930
 to give him direct sunlight if 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.209
 you cover with a plastic bag will help 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.190
 to keep it moist but make sure 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.989
 the bag has an opening for 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.989
 allow fresh air to enter 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.960
 good
