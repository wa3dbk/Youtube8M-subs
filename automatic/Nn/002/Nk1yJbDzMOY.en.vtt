00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
the reasons we're going to review the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.600 
the reasons we're going to review the
rolling<00:00:54.930> chassis<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.370> know<00:00:56.460> when

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
rolling chassis is that you know when

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.920 
rolling chassis is that you know when
you<00:00:56.670> look<00:00:56.789> at<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.030> complete<00:00:57.360> car<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.780> really

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
you look at the complete car you really

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.279 
you look at the complete car you really
can't<00:00:58.260> see<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> lot<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.010> detail<00:00:59.520> and<00:01:00.289> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
can't see a lot of the detail and the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.840 
can't see a lot of the detail and the
engines<00:01:01.739> available<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.370> separate<00:01:02.699> model

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
engines available is a separate model

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.640 
engines available is a separate model
it's<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.510> same<00:01:03.690> engine<00:01:03.899> that's<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.409> car

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
it's the same engine that's in this car

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.130 
it's the same engine that's in this car
and<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:04.979> see<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.250> pretty<00:01:05.460> well<00:01:05.670> as<00:01:05.960> we<00:01:06.960> take

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
and we can see it pretty well as we take

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.320 
and we can see it pretty well as we take
a<00:01:07.170> look<00:01:07.380> at<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.590> rolling<00:01:07.890> chassis<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:09.030> that's

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
a look at the rolling chassis so that's

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.590 
a look at the rolling chassis so that's
why<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.479> chose<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.810> do<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.170> rolling<00:01:10.439> chassis

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
why I chose to do the rolling chassis

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.289 
why I chose to do the rolling chassis
over<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> complete<00:01:13.260> car<00:01:13.650> or<00:01:13.979> say<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.430> engine<00:01:14.760> so

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
over a complete car or say the engine so

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.850 
over a complete car or say the engine so
as<00:01:15.390> we<00:01:15.540> take<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.720> look<00:01:15.840> at<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.080> carts<00:01:16.500> it's

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
as we take a look at this carts it's

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.440 
as we take a look at this carts it's
normal<00:01:17.430> build<00:01:18.299> quality<00:01:18.659> for<00:01:18.930> CMC<00:01:23.150> every<00:01:24.150> every

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
normal build quality for CMC every every

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.170 
normal build quality for CMC every every
time<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.720> talk<00:01:25.259> about<00:01:25.290> CMC<00:01:25.920> models<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.400> really

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
looks heavier or clunky if you look at

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.370 
looks heavier or clunky if you look at

it's the diameter of the of the the knob
and<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.810> lever<00:03:40.489> aren't<00:03:41.870> clunky<00:03:42.870> because<00:03:43.140> it

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
and the lever aren't clunky because it

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.530 
and the lever aren't clunky because it
was<00:03:43.380> hard<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.709> make<00:03:43.950> it<00:03:44.130> you<00:03:44.430> know<00:03:44.549> then<00:03:45.209> and
