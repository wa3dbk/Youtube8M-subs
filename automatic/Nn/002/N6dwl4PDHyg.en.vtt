00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:22.349
 why I came to see you 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.199
 % have the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.259
 however an approach 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.060
 the two hostages to be sure ecological ie 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.669
 materials 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.309
 samsung pollutants for me 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.309
 in an online environment will also for humans 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.030
 a master requirements regarding 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.030
 the logis was first the wood the quality of the wood and the provenances 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.840
 and for 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.320
 the specifications was a passive house so a fortiori are 328 meters 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.590
 insulation 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.550
 in his interview to the world 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.159
 had to be ecological that is to say the field of wood wool 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.159
 and no glass slides 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.580
 a passive house for us it's after the besides the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.740
 regulation it is a house that consume less than 15 km 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.900
 per capita for oneself 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.900
 fifteen to twenty times less than a small 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.410
 the djia stands out by 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.580
 by the fact already since its beginnings all the bodies of state from the first 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.250
 plane shot 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.340
 I saw him once we had done together 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.990
 % of supplies and everything is done in workshop 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.990
 but not quite 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.320
 we wanted to buy a wooden house oven 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.330
 to know during the lifetime of his friend the oncfs 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.950
 no pollution 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.480
 on materials 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.080
 dangerous Monday 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.280
 to see also recycling the day when you home will disappear the way in 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.280
 natural site for the environment 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.700
 evolutionary house it's a house that can 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.760
 who can adapt and grow 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.990
 cry to the wolf to change in the fridge about the needs of life so there we do not 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.300

 as required 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.349
 for m but today we come back to 2 5 euros 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.689
 in terms of additional square meter compared to 2009 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:33.779
 traditional houses 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:37.569
 as we think we have a return on investment in ideas 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:38.269
 saying 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.319
 because of a flu 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.419
 the rapid increase of what if the newspaper 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:46.419
