00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
want to smooth it ending and then the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.359 
want to smooth it ending and then the
second<00:00:24.720> thing<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:25.140> we<00:00:25.410> are<00:00:25.529> going<00:00:25.800> from<00:00:25.949> low<00:00:26.099> C

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
second thing is we are going from low C

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.790 
second thing is we are going from low C
all<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.699> way<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.630> G<00:00:27.930> not<00:00:28.349> very<00:00:28.529> far<00:00:28.710> on

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
all the way to this G not very far on

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.140 
all the way to this G not very far on
the<00:00:28.920> keyboard<00:00:29.220> just<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:29.580> section<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.060> will

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
the keyboard just this section you will

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.020 
the keyboard just this section you will
not<00:00:30.300> touch<00:00:30.480> that's<00:00:31.050> at<00:00:31.380> all<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:32.279> your<00:00:32.880> right

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
not touch that's at all so your right

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.250 
not touch that's at all so your right
hand<00:00:33.270> will<00:00:33.420> come<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.630> handy<00:00:33.719> over<00:00:34.079> here

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
hand will come in handy over here

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.600 
hand will come in handy over here
because<00:00:34.620> some<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.950> notes<00:00:35.160> get<00:00:35.399> very

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
because some of the notes get very

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.030 
because some of the notes get very
spread<00:00:35.910> out<00:00:36.140> you<00:00:37.140> may<00:00:37.260> eventually<00:00:37.440> be<00:00:37.770> able<00:00:37.890> to

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
spread out you may eventually be able to

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.000 
spread out you may eventually be able to
spider<00:00:38.940> hand<00:00:39.300> but<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.899> don't<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.530> don't<00:00:40.680> like<00:00:40.890> to

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
spider hand but I don't I don't like to

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.490 
spider hand but I don't I don't like to
do<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.190> anyways<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.450> we're<00:00:42.989> gonna<00:00:43.140> start

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
do that anyways so we're gonna start

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.470 
do that anyways so we're gonna start
with<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> instruction<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.989> low<00:00:46.289> C<00:00:46.530> go<00:00:47.340> g<00:00:47.640> c

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
with the instruction on the low C go g c

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.229 
with the instruction on the low C go g c
e<00:00:48.559> g<00:00:49.700> back<00:00:50.700> here<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.420> see<00:00:51.809> g<00:00:52.500> c<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.910> it's<00:00:54.030> very

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
e g back here to see g c and it's very

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.090 
e g back here to see g c and it's very
slow<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.110> it'll<00:00:55.289> sound<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.590> little<00:00:55.800> something

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
slow so it'll sound a little something

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.650 
slow so it'll sound a little something
like<00:00:56.129> this

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.770 

just<00:01:03.110> like<00:01:03.260> that<00:01:03.940> so<00:01:04.940> after<00:01:05.210> that<00:01:05.360> that<00:01:05.630> goes

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
just like that so after that that goes

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.390 
just like that so after that that goes
on<00:01:05.930> for<00:01:06.170> about<00:01:06.230> a<00:01:06.320> minute<00:01:06.560> and<00:01:06.800> 10<00:01:06.980> seconds

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
on for about a minute and 10 seconds

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.360 
on for about a minute and 10 seconds
after<00:01:07.790> that<00:01:08.210> she<00:01:08.630> goes<00:01:08.810> into<00:01:09.140> a<00:01:09.410> quicker

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
after that she goes into a quicker

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.190 
after that she goes into a quicker
pattern<00:01:10.820> which<00:01:11.390> your<00:01:11.540> right<00:01:11.690> hand<00:01:11.900> will<00:01:11.990> be<00:01:12.020> on

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
pattern which your right hand will be on

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.610 
pattern which your right hand will be on
base<00:01:12.410> based<00:01:13.370> on<00:01:13.580> e<00:01:13.760> and<00:01:14.240> then<00:01:14.930> you<00:01:15.200> will<00:01:15.380> hit

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
base based on e and then you will hit

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.780 
base based on e and then you will hit
the<00:01:15.740> notes<00:01:15.890> with<00:01:16.070> your<00:01:16.190> left<00:01:16.370> hand

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
the notes with your left hand

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.530 
the notes with your left hand
CAG<00:01:17.270> F<00:01:17.900> in<00:01:18.170> this<00:01:18.830> pattern<00:01:19.160> c<00:01:19.820> ec<00:01:20.120> e<00:01:20.480> AE<00:01:21.350> AE<00:01:22.030> g<00:01:23.030> EG

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.050 
e f EF V so it will sound a little
something<00:01:26.540> like<00:01:26.630> this

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.660 

just<00:01:32.930> like<00:01:33.079> that<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:33.799> then<00:01:34.070> after<00:01:34.280> about<00:01:34.399> 10

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
just like that and then after about 10

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.219 
just like that and then after about 10
to<00:01:34.790> 15<00:01:35.090> seconds<00:01:35.450> of<00:01:35.540> that<00:01:35.689> or<00:01:35.899> maybe<00:01:36.020> a<00:01:36.140> little

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
to 15 seconds of that or maybe a little

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.649 
to 15 seconds of that or maybe a little
more<00:01:36.470> I'm<00:01:36.590> not<00:01:36.649> sure<00:01:36.950> she<00:01:37.610> goes<00:01:37.700> into<00:01:38.000> a<00:01:38.149> double

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
more I'm not sure she goes into a double

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.060 
more I'm not sure she goes into a double
time<00:01:38.840> version<00:01:39.350> which<00:01:39.500> is<00:01:39.619> the<00:01:39.649> exact<00:01:39.979> same

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
time version which is the exact same

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.679 
time version which is the exact same
though<00:01:40.369> it's<00:01:40.549> just<00:01:40.789> a<00:01:40.880> little<00:01:41.060> quicker<00:01:41.270> so

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
though it's just a little quicker so

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:51.090 
though it's just a little quicker so
it'll<00:01:41.840> sound<00:01:41.960> a<00:01:42.049> little<00:01:42.140> something<00:01:42.500> like<00:01:42.590> this

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.820 

just<00:01:51.970> like<00:01:52.090> that<00:01:52.479> and<00:01:53.200> then<00:01:53.320> at<00:01:53.409> the<00:01:53.500> part<00:01:53.710> when

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
just like that and then at the part when

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.350 
just like that and then at the part when
she<00:01:54.009> starts<00:01:54.310> singing<00:01:54.400> I'll<00:01:54.700> never<00:01:54.909> ever<00:01:55.119> ever

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
she starts singing I'll never ever ever

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.890 
she starts singing I'll never ever ever
ever

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
ever

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:04.499 
ever
you're<00:01:56.290> gonna<00:01:56.439> go<00:02:00.840> very<00:02:01.840> simple<00:02:02.229> it's<00:02:02.409> C<00:02:02.770> CA<00:02:03.509> AG

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
you're gonna go very simple it's C CA AG

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.130 
you're gonna go very simple it's C CA AG
GS<00:02:05.350> and<00:02:06.040> then<00:02:06.159> back<00:02:06.310> to<00:02:06.520> be<00:02:06.610> hangs<00:02:06.850> down<00:02:07.060> like<00:02:08.020> I

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
GS and then back to be hangs down like I

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.139 
GS and then back to be hangs down like I
played<00:02:08.350> it<00:02:08.590> just<00:02:08.800> sounds<00:02:09.039> like<00:02:09.100> that<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:09.729> so
