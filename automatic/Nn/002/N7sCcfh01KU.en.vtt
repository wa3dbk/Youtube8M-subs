00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:57.150 
the direction in which the locomotive
should<00:03:51.250> start<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.989> best<00:03:56.200> thing<00:03:56.470> is<00:03:56.680> to<00:03:56.890> run

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
should start the best thing is to run

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.860 
should start the best thing is to run
the<00:03:57.280> locomotive<00:03:57.880> for<00:03:58.030> one<00:03:58.239> or<00:03:58.450> two<00:03:58.660> laps

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
the locomotive for one or two laps

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.949 
the locomotive for one or two laps
without<00:03:59.440> any<00:03:59.709> load<00:03:59.980> I<00:04:00.390> didn't<00:04:01.390> had<00:04:01.510> a<00:04:01.540> passing

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
without any load I didn't had a passing

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.680 
without any load I didn't had a passing
loop<00:04:02.080> on<00:04:02.260> my<00:04:02.370> temporary<00:04:03.370> track<00:04:03.730> so<00:04:04.120> I<00:04:04.150> coupled

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
loop on my temporary track so I coupled

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:11.280 
loop on my temporary track so I coupled
to<00:04:04.989> locomotive<00:04:05.560> directly<00:04:06.069> to<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:06.340> train<00:04:10.290> and

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
to locomotive directly to the train and

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:32.879 
to locomotive directly to the train and
there<00:04:11.620> she<00:04:11.829> goes

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.070 

it<00:04:33.889> was<00:04:34.100> also<00:04:34.370> not<00:04:34.699> the<00:04:34.820> best<00:04:34.850> idea<00:04:35.540> to<00:04:35.660> take

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
it was also not the best idea to take

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.170 
it was also not the best idea to take
the<00:04:36.290> first<00:04:36.560> team<00:04:36.860> up<00:04:37.070> of<00:04:37.220> this<00:04:37.400> evening<00:04:38.000> to

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
the first team up of this evening to

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.650 
the first team up of this evening to
take<00:04:38.360> this<00:04:38.570> video<00:04:39.190> in<00:04:40.190> most<00:04:40.520> cases<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:41.300> second

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
take this video in most cases the second

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.900 
take this video in most cases the second
team<00:04:41.900> absolutely<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:42.979> best<00:04:43.130> performing<00:04:43.790> of

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
team absolutely the best performing of

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.080 
team absolutely the best performing of
the<00:04:44.000> locomotive<00:04:44.660> as<00:04:45.560> well<00:04:46.100> as<00:04:46.370> each<00:04:46.669> following

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
the locomotive as well as each following

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.450 
the locomotive as well as each following
steamapps<00:04:47.660> on<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.800> first<00:04:49.040> team<00:04:49.280> up

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
steamapps on the first team up

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.250 
steamapps on the first team up
locomotive<00:04:50.060> is<00:04:50.180> very<00:04:50.389> cold<00:04:50.720> and<00:04:50.900> it<00:04:51.050> needs

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
locomotive is very cold and it needs

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.650 
locomotive is very cold and it needs
some<00:04:51.470> time<00:04:51.770> until<00:04:52.610> everything<00:04:53.300> is<00:04:53.389> working

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
some time until everything is working

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:11.900 
some time until everything is working
fine

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.680 

therefore<00:05:12.910> it<00:05:13.000> could<00:05:13.120> happen<00:05:13.479> that<00:05:13.630> the

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
therefore it could happen that the

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.749 
therefore it could happen that the
inherent<00:05:14.500> rain<00:05:14.889> will<00:05:15.099> stop

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 
inherent rain will stop

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.510 
inherent rain will stop
just<00:05:16.660> give<00:05:16.900> her<00:05:17.020> a<00:05:17.050> new<00:05:17.349> push<00:05:17.590> start<00:05:17.949> and<00:05:18.310> the

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
just give her a new push start and the

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:36.580 
just give her a new push start and the
trailer<00:05:18.789> continued

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:07:37.770 

let's<00:05:37.590> use<00:05:37.889> this<00:05:38.130> stop<00:05:38.490> for<00:05:38.819> some<00:05:39.000> switching

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:37.780 

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.150 

with<00:07:38.780> one<00:07:38.990> boiler<00:07:39.260> full<00:07:39.590> of<00:07:39.740> water<00:07:40.010> and

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 
with one boiler full of water and

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.980 
with one boiler full of water and
locomotive<00:07:40.850> will<00:07:41.030> run<00:07:41.210> fo<00:07:41.420> around<00:07:41.720> about

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:41.990 
locomotive will run fo around about

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:47.140 
locomotive will run fo around about
eight<00:07:42.230> to<00:07:42.500> ten<00:07:42.740> minutes<00:07:45.520> now<00:07:46.520> it's<00:07:46.700> time<00:07:46.970> to

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:47.150 
eight to ten minutes now it's time to

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.600 
eight to ten minutes now it's time to
get<00:07:47.270> this<00:07:47.450> locomotive<00:07:47.950> running<00:07:48.950> on<00:07:49.220> my

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:49.610 
get this locomotive running on my

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.180 
get this locomotive running on my
modular<00:07:50.240> H<00:07:50.450> 130<00:07:51.170> logging<00:07:51.680> railroad<00:07:51.830> layout

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:54.190 
modular H 130 logging railroad layout

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.830 
modular H 130 logging railroad layout
but<00:07:55.190> this<00:07:55.400> will<00:07:55.610> be<00:07:55.700> shown<00:07:55.970> in<00:07:56.240> one<00:07:56.420> of<00:07:56.540> my<00:07:56.690> next

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:56.840 
but this will be shown in one of my next

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.410 
but this will be shown in one of my next
videos
