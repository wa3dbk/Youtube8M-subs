00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.850
 very nice poster between angers and 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.400
 auxerre the Angevins will have to play without 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.570
 crazy henin and montceau la gia is 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.770
 always deprived of his defender 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.720
 malian international adama coulibaly 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.220
 the Angevins stay on a victory 4 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.960
 goals to 1 to laval while he had 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.340
 won only one game out of the seven 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.410
 previous meetings 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.809
 they want to regain success at 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.110
 home the angels who stays on two 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.720
 0 0 at home here's finally a goal 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.150
 in front of their audience for the Angevins and 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.769
 a goal signed christopher julien at the 9th 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.809
 minute against his side 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.489
 it is the auxerrois defender who allows 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.479
 to angers to lead 1 0 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.879
 a blow to the gym but the 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:59.589
 Burgundians react with this blow 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.159
 franc and who ends on the bar 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.150
 transversal what an opportunity 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.220
 christopher julien was not far from 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.920
 catch up after the goal scored against 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.530
 his camp 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.320
 the gia is the worst team of the season at 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.920
 outside and yet she succeeds in 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.800
 equalize 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.390
 willy boly's goal in the 29th minute he 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.490
 rose from his defense to place the 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.400
 head a goal anywhere in between 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.260
 teams at the half hour of play la gia 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.030
 won only one game away 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.350
 since the beginning of the season for 1 draw 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.570
 and 6 defeats 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.700
 but maybe trust is in the process 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.760
 to return under the direction of Bernard 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.300
 casoni la jia won 4 to 2 binding 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.130
 on the last day 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.350
 four minutes after the equalizer this 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.640
 terrible tackle of ibrahima diallo and 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.900
 didier falcone the referee of the match 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.960
 do not hesitate red card 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.090
 angers will have to play nice to mid 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.080
 time score of 1 goal everywhere a part 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.510
 extremely tight in the second half 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.010
 auxerre 1 gives himself chances of 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.020
 score the second goal why not 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.390
 with this opening on the right side 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.130
 in the possibility of center it comes back to 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.069
 towards the penalty spot and shooting 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.730
 completely missed 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.769
 credible opportunity polge in the lead all 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.260
 close to scoring the second goal of his 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.719
 team 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:22.049
 the Angevins are wary even if they are 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:24.269
 much better classified attention this space 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.340
 in the defense auxerroise the 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.219
 opportunity to hit and that's under the 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.819
 goalkeeper's body choplin's goal of 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:36.439
 sat and 88th minute his first goal of the 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:40.590
 season to release the stadium jean baud 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:43.230
 of musa for the sco d'angers impute 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.989
 hyper important to offer victory 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.000
 to the angels 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:51.030
 and that's how the sco is placed 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.040
 at the top of the auxerre ranking 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.099
 the worst team in the championship 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.099
 outdoors
