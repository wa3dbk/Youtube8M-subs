 then go to our garage 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.470
 as you can see the toy on the record a little 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.900
 slows down when loading this is not 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.230
 trouble in the garage can be respectively 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.120

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.239
 tanks 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.980
 There are tanks that open with 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.260
 time that is when you pump 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.200
 level as you can see at the top 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.489
 there is gasoline also tanks can 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.620
 paint and 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.559
 that is, camouflage and different on them 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.059

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.180
 certain bonuses 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.250
 Well, in general, I noticed that in all arcade 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.000
 There are such simulators here are these 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.939
 camouflage and gasoline stickers and everything somehow 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.780
 same here but let's play 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.729
 let's go to battle and see what yes 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.950
 like that is if you want to play 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.500
 some arcade tanks 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.390
 One option for you in which you are 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.670

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.390
 rivals from around the world here and 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.390

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.509
 kill each other so well there is already going 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.509
 kneading hard that's what stas saved us 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.150
 snatched from me dashing easy and 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.380
 punching so to say i have it now 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.930
 just destroyed because he did not 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.180
 can counter my car 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.369
 death so now move on 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.530

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.689
 some guy grabs it 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.659
 apparently finished the summer I did I also did not 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.990
 understood so there we have a guy from Ukraine he 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.990
 I need to go for a shelter 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.340
 Stas Stas resurfaced and he wants to pick up 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.380
 money from your corpse 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.869
 but 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.539
 I do not know whether he will have time to dunk me if 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.870
 I stand it another shot I have been 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.420

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.709
 tough tough so well there still a guy with 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.989

 In general, as you can see the game is enough 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.319
