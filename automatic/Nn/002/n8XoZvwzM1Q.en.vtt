from your air source you don't have to
really<00:00:22.020> put<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.260> dust<00:00:22.410> cover<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:22.769> because<00:00:23.039> it

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
really put the dust cover in because it

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.700 
really put the dust cover in because it
won't<00:00:23.310> open<00:00:23.400> up<00:00:23.990> so<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.019> don't<00:00:25.289> need<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.529> have

yeah<00:00:40.890> looking<00:00:41.700> at<00:00:41.850> that's<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.120> auto<00:00:42.360> closure

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
yeah looking at that's the auto closure

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.340 
yeah looking at that's the auto closure
device<00:00:42.950> see<00:00:43.950> if<00:00:44.010> we<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.219> focus<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:45.140> and<00:00:46.140> that

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
device see if we can focus it and that

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.990 
device see if we can focus it and that
won't<00:00:46.500> open<00:00:46.649> up<00:00:46.920> at<00:00:47.039> all<00:00:47.160> but<00:00:47.550> if<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.760> push

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
won't open up at all but if you push

won't open up at all but if you push
down<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.690> don't<00:00:48.989> think<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.379> take<00:00:49.500> my

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
down on it I don't think I can take my

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.369 
down on it I don't think I can take my
fingers<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.629> you<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.809> budget<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.079> little<00:00:52.170> bit

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
fingers and you can budget a little bit

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.950 
fingers and you can budget a little bit
but<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:53.460> tank<00:00:53.910> puts<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.360> here<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.750> closes

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
but the tank puts on here and it closes

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.450 
but the tank puts on here and it closes
it<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.410> don't<00:00:55.500> our<00:00:55.829> excuse<00:00:56.039> me<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.250> opens

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
it and I don't our excuse me and opens

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.990 
it and I don't our excuse me and opens
it<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.140> that's<00:00:58.140> how<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.350> gets<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.969> but<00:00:59.969> I

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
it up and that's how it gets in but I

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.220 
it up and that's how it gets in but I
always<00:01:00.149> get<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.510> dust<00:01:00.690> cover<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.020> just

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
always get this dust cover on just

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:12.609 
always get this dust cover on just
because<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.530> good<00:01:01.710> habit<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.010> get<00:01:02.100> into

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.310 

okay<00:01:13.280> now<00:01:13.969> I<00:01:14.000> sold<00:01:14.329> my<00:01:14.479> low-pressure<00:01:14.840> inflator

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
okay now I sold my low-pressure inflator

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.050 
okay now I sold my low-pressure inflator
tube<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:15.799> I<00:01:16.100> don't<00:01:16.250> have<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:16.490> cover<00:01:16.670> for<00:01:16.939> it

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
tube and I don't have the cover for it

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.889 
tube and I don't have the cover for it
so<00:01:17.649> that's<00:01:18.649> open<00:01:18.829> and<00:01:19.399> I<00:01:19.520> figured<00:01:19.789> if<00:01:20.659> you<00:01:20.750> buy

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
so that's open and I figured if you buy

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:21.730 
so that's open and I figured if you buy
this<00:01:20.960> you're<00:01:21.259> gonna<00:01:21.380> have<00:01:21.530> a<00:01:21.590> low-pressure

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
this you're gonna have a low-pressure

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.779 
this you're gonna have a low-pressure
inflate<00:01:22.280> or<00:01:22.369> tube<00:01:22.490> anyway<00:01:22.789> so<00:01:23.350> not<00:01:24.350> a<00:01:24.380> big<00:01:24.590> deal

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
inflate or tube anyway so not a big deal

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.660 
inflate or tube anyway so not a big deal
it's<00:01:25.789> only<00:01:25.909> been<00:01:26.060> like<00:01:26.119> that<00:01:26.420> for<00:01:26.630> like<00:01:26.689> a<00:01:26.750> week

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
it's only been like that for like a week

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.199 
it's only been like that for like a week
okay<00:01:28.670> this<00:01:28.909> is<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.409> second<00:01:30.409> stage<00:01:30.590> no<00:01:31.579> there's

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:32.209 
okay this is the second stage no there's

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:33.370 
okay this is the second stage no there's
been<00:01:32.299> some<00:01:32.509> concern<00:01:32.719> of<00:01:33.020> whether<00:01:33.140> these<00:01:33.319> are

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
been some concern of whether these are

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.899 
been some concern of whether these are
the<00:01:33.530> LX<00:01:33.920> or<00:01:34.039> the<00:01:34.159> regular<00:01:34.429> model<00:01:34.579> this<00:01:34.759> is

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
the LX or the regular model this is

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.449 
the LX or the regular model this is
definitely<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:35.299> Alex<00:01:35.539> because<00:01:35.750> here's<00:01:35.990> the

air<00:01:40.459> selector<00:01:41.109> switch<00:01:42.640> will<00:01:43.640> clearly<00:01:44.030> see

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
air selector switch will clearly see

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:51.990 
air selector switch will clearly see
that<00:01:44.209> yeah<00:01:44.780> Oh<00:01:45.039> almost<00:01:46.039> clearly<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:50.630> legend
