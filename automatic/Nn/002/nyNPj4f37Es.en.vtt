00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
so this video is going to be relatively

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.240 
so this video is going to be relatively
short<00:00:02.370> because<00:00:02.550> I<00:00:02.760> shot<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.870> shot<00:00:04.529> one<00:00:04.770> a<00:00:04.980> little

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
short because I shot a shot one a little

short because I shot a shot one a little
while<00:00:05.430> ago<00:00:05.640> to<00:00:05.819> test<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.420> new<00:00:06.830> x8n<00:00:07.830> camcorder

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
had the misfortune of leaving while that

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.840 
had the misfortune of leaving while that
misfortune<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:15.150> lack<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.660> skill<00:00:15.990> overall

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
misfortune the lack of skill overall

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.720 
misfortune the lack of skill overall
leaving<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.060> camcorder<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:19.460> external<00:00:20.460> mic

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
leaving the camcorder in external mic

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.250 
leaving the camcorder in external mic
recording<00:00:21.300> mode<00:00:21.480> which<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.779> what<00:00:21.810> we<00:00:22.020> had<00:00:22.140> is

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
recording mode which is what we had is

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.769 
recording mode which is what we had is
set<00:00:22.439> up<00:00:22.529> for<00:00:22.740> for<00:00:23.010> tech<00:00:23.160> tips<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.150> did<00:00:24.630> not

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
set up for for tech tips so I did not

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.349 
set up for for tech tips so I did not
record<00:00:24.960> any<00:00:25.439> sound<00:00:25.830> from<00:00:26.189> my<00:00:26.340> previous<00:00:26.580> video

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.990 
those are a couple photo albums on top
of<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.870> they<00:00:51.989> keep<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.379> cats<00:00:52.590> from<00:00:53.430> getting

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
of it they keep the cats from getting

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.630 
of it they keep the cats from getting
into<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.510> too<00:00:54.840> too<00:00:55.020> much<00:00:55.230> here<00:00:55.559> I'm<00:00:56.280> just

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
into it too too much here I'm just

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.250 
into it too too much here I'm just
trying<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.000> test<00:00:57.270> more<00:00:57.600> than<00:00:57.629> anything<00:00:57.960> else

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
trying to test more than anything else

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.310 
trying to test more than anything else
the<00:00:58.910> relative<00:00:59.910> low-light<00:01:00.510> performance<00:01:00.539> of

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
the relative low-light performance of

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.090 
the relative low-light performance of
this<00:01:01.410> camera<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:03.350> based<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.559> what<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.799> saw

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
this camera so based on what I saw

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.620 
this camera so based on what I saw
already<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.610> think<00:01:05.700> I'll<00:01:06.030> be<00:01:06.180> switching<00:01:06.600> to

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
already I think I'll be switching to

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.570 
already I think I'll be switching to
using<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.110> exclusively<00:01:07.860> for<00:01:08.010> cat<00:01:08.220> videos

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
using this exclusively for cat videos

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.850 
using this exclusively for cat videos
because<00:01:09.030> if<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.780> guys<00:01:09.900> ever<00:01:10.229> watched<00:01:10.470> my<00:01:10.650> cat

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
because if you guys ever watched my cat

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.820 
because if you guys ever watched my cat
videos<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.369> probably<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:11.909> noticed<00:01:12.090> that

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
videos you probably have noticed that

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.770 
videos you probably have noticed that
usually<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.250> dark<00:01:14.580> or<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.119> grainy<00:01:15.390> that

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
usually it's so dark or so grainy that

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.120 
usually it's so dark or so grainy that
you<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:16.020> barely<00:01:16.470> even<00:01:16.650> make<00:01:16.770> out<00:01:16.950> what's

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
you can barely even make out what's

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.370 
you can barely even make out what's
going<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:18.360> here<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.720> don't<00:01:18.780> give<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> cat

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
going on so here I don't give the cat

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.530 
going on so here I don't give the cat
something<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:20.009> interested<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.640> it's<00:01:21.090> just

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:31.249 

hey<00:01:26.540> thank<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:30.240> as<00:01:30.360> soon<00:01:30.509> as<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.780> move<00:01:30.960> those

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
hey thank you so as soon as I move those

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.170 
hey thank you so as soon as I move those
they<00:01:32.250> will<00:01:32.659> naturally<00:01:34.250> go<00:01:35.250> right<00:01:35.670> up<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:36.000> top

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
they will naturally go right up on top

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.590 
they will naturally go right up on top
of<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.570> can<00:01:36.600> see<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.049> flex<00:01:37.350> right<00:01:37.619> there

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
of it you can see the flex right there

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.830 
of it you can see the flex right there
where<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.460> mesh<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.700> not<00:01:41.880> probably<00:01:42.509> strong

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
where the mesh is not probably strong

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.679 
where the mesh is not probably strong
enough<00:01:43.079> for<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.500> one<00:01:44.250> or<00:01:44.549> two<00:01:44.820> cats<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.390> stand

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
enough for it one or two cats to stand

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.929 
enough for it one or two cats to stand
on<00:01:45.950> as<00:01:46.950> they<00:01:47.250> invariably<00:01:47.820> do<00:01:49.549> it's<00:01:50.549> all<00:01:50.729> good

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
on as they invariably do it's all good

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.490 
on as they invariably do it's all good
though<00:01:50.970> what<00:01:51.270> I'll<00:01:51.360> probably<00:01:51.540> do<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.110> I'll

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
though what I'll probably do is I'll

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.590 
though what I'll probably do is I'll
either<00:01:52.710> get<00:01:53.130> something<00:01:53.640> more<00:01:53.880> solid<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.420> put

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
either get something more solid to put

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.410 
either get something more solid to put
on<00:01:54.689> overtop<00:01:55.170> or<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.890> will<00:01:58.219> build<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.369> new<00:01:59.399> leg<00:02:00.180> out

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
on overtop or I will build a new leg out

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.770 
on overtop or I will build a new leg out
of<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.659> stronger<00:02:01.170> mesh<00:02:02.180> I'll<00:02:03.180> figure<00:02:03.360> something

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
of a stronger mesh I'll figure something

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.690 
of a stronger mesh I'll figure something
out<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.079> I've<00:02:04.200> stocked<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.799> mice<00:02:04.950> up<00:02:05.189> on<00:02:05.369> food

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
out so I've stocked the mice up on food
