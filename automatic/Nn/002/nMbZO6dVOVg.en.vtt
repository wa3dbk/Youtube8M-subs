00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
to talk about this because I think

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.180 
to talk about this because I think
everyone<00:00:28.690> has<00:00:28.900> experienced<00:00:29.590> at<00:00:29.710> some<00:00:29.920> point

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 
everyone has experienced at some point

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.519 
everyone has experienced at some point
or<00:00:30.310> another<00:00:30.340> where<00:00:31.300> you've<00:00:31.630> had<00:00:31.810> a<00:00:31.840> behavioral

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
or another where you've had a behavioral

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.270 
or another where you've had a behavioral
issue<00:00:32.680> that<00:00:33.629> wasn't<00:00:34.629> really<00:00:35.069> behavioral<00:00:36.069> it

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
issue that wasn't really behavioral it

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.500 
issue that wasn't really behavioral it
could<00:00:36.519> have<00:00:36.640> been<00:00:36.789> caused<00:00:37.089> by<00:00:37.329> a<00:00:37.359> physical

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
could have been caused by a physical

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.750 
could have been caused by a physical
problem<00:00:37.989> so<00:00:38.409> for<00:00:38.620> example<00:00:39.039> with<00:00:39.429> the<00:00:39.550> horse

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
problem so for example with the horse

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:51.999 
and really kind of opened my eyes to how

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:55.319 
and really kind of opened my eyes to how
big<00:00:52.989> a<00:00:53.019> role<00:00:53.289> the<00:00:54.010> horse<00:00:54.219> is<00:00:54.399> physical<00:00:55.089> state

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
big a role the horse is physical state

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.459 
big a role the horse is physical state
plays<00:00:55.870> in<00:00:56.319> not<00:00:57.100> only<00:00:57.339> behavior<00:00:57.850> but<00:00:58.209> also

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
plays in not only behavior but also

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.219 
plays in not only behavior but also
training<00:00:59.469> and<00:00:59.889> riding<00:01:00.129> and<00:01:00.670> how<00:01:00.789> they<00:01:00.969> move<00:01:01.229> so

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
training and riding and how they move so

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.569 
training and riding and how they move so
I<00:01:02.260> got<00:01:02.499> promised<00:01:02.859> about<00:01:03.069> nine<00:01:03.249> or<00:01:03.369> ten<00:01:03.399> months

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
I got promised about nine or ten months

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.000 
I got promised about nine or ten months
ago<00:01:03.909> and<00:01:04.330> she<00:01:04.900> was<00:01:05.019> given<00:01:05.320> to<00:01:05.350> me<00:01:05.530> because<00:01:05.710> she

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
ago and she was given to me because she

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.590 
ago and she was given to me because she
was<00:01:06.040> bucking<00:01:06.490> so<00:01:06.670> at<00:01:06.790> the<00:01:06.909> time<00:01:07.090> we<00:01:07.300> thought<00:01:07.330> it

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
was bucking so at the time we thought it

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.780 
was bucking so at the time we thought it
was<00:01:07.660> just<00:01:07.870> a<00:01:07.990> behavior<00:01:08.440> OSU<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:09.430> more<00:01:09.640> that<00:01:09.730> I

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
was just a behavior OSU the more that I

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.370 
was just a behavior OSU the more that I
got<00:01:10.000> to<00:01:10.150> know<00:01:10.300> promise<00:01:10.750> and<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.050> more<00:01:11.200> that<00:01:11.320> I

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
got to know promise and the more that I

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.070 
got to know promise and the more that I
worked<00:01:11.680> with<00:01:11.830> her<00:01:12.040> I<00:01:12.600> realized<00:01:13.600> that<00:01:13.810> she<00:01:13.960> has

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
worked with her I realized that she has

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.410 
worked with her I realized that she has
a<00:01:14.110> very<00:01:14.320> sore<00:01:14.590> back<00:01:14.830> so<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.220> bucking<00:01:15.550> was<00:01:15.670> most

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
a very sore back so the bucking was most

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.200 
a very sore back so the bucking was most
likely<00:01:16.840> just<00:01:16.870> a<00:01:17.200> response<00:01:17.590> to<00:01:17.800> pain<00:01:18.040> and<00:01:18.280> as<00:01:19.060> I

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
likely just a response to pain and as I

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.030 
likely just a response to pain and as I
said<00:01:19.270> I<00:01:19.450> think<00:01:19.540> all<00:01:19.900> of<00:01:19.930> us<00:01:20.110> can<00:01:20.380> relate<00:01:20.650> I

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
said I think all of us can relate I

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.820 
said I think all of us can relate I
think<00:01:21.490> we've<00:01:21.640> all<00:01:21.820> had<00:01:22.060> things<00:01:22.990> that<00:01:23.350> happened

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
think we've all had things that happened

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.770 
think we've all had things that happened
on<00:01:23.920> our<00:01:23.950> horses<00:01:24.520> that<00:01:25.060> we<00:01:25.300> thought<00:01:25.480> we<00:01:25.660> were

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
on our horses that we thought we were

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.020 
on our horses that we thought we were
behavioral<00:01:26.410> we<00:01:26.830> either<00:01:27.160> blamed<00:01:27.580> them<00:01:27.790> on<00:01:27.910> the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
behavioral we either blamed them on the

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.840 
behavioral we either blamed them on the
horse<00:01:28.240> or<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:29.740> know<00:01:29.860> we<00:01:29.980> blamed<00:01:30.280> them<00:01:30.460> on<00:01:30.580> on

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
horse or you know we blamed them on on

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.640 
horse or you know we blamed them on on
something<00:01:31.180> that<00:01:31.510> the<00:01:31.600> horse<00:01:31.780> was<00:01:31.990> doing<00:01:32.410> and

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
something that the horse was doing and

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.490 
something that the horse was doing and
then<00:01:33.250> in<00:01:33.550> hindsight<00:01:33.940> we<00:01:34.300> realized<00:01:34.510> that<00:01:35.020> it

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
then in hindsight we realized that it

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.500 
then in hindsight we realized that it
was<00:01:35.680> really<00:01:35.920> just<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.460> pain<00:01:36.730> and<00:01:37.060> it<00:01:37.120> was<00:01:37.210> really

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
was really just a pain and it was really

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.260 
was really just a pain and it was really
just<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:37.870> horses<00:01:38.380> response<00:01:38.860> to<00:01:39.070> pain<00:01:39.280> so

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
just the horses response to pain so

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.570 
just the horses response to pain so
besides<00:01:41.110> even<00:01:41.320> just<00:01:41.710> things<00:01:42.010> like<00:01:42.160> the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
besides even just things like the

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.580 
besides even just things like the
obvious<00:01:42.730> things<00:01:43.210> like<00:01:43.300> bucking<00:01:43.810> thinks<00:01:44.200> like

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
obvious things like bucking thinks like

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.130 
obvious things like bucking thinks like
horses<00:01:45.220> that<00:01:45.610> you<00:01:45.909> know<00:01:46.060> maybe<00:01:46.300> run<00:01:46.630> after<00:01:47.020> the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
horses that you know maybe run after the

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.870 
horses that you know maybe run after the
fences<00:01:47.560> or<00:01:47.830> do<00:01:47.980> those<00:01:48.130> sorts<00:01:48.460> of<00:01:48.550> things<00:01:48.760> that

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
fences or do those sorts of things that

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.840 
fences or do those sorts of things that
can<00:01:49.210> obviously<00:01:49.510> be<00:01:49.750> caused<00:01:49.990> by<00:01:50.230> pain<00:01:50.670> we<00:01:51.670> also

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
can obviously be caused by pain we also

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.399 
can obviously be caused by pain we also
have<00:01:52.150> to<00:01:52.270> look<00:01:52.450> at<00:01:52.659> when<00:01:52.900> we're<00:01:53.050> trying<00:01:53.170> to

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
have to look at when we're trying to

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.560 
have to look at when we're trying to
teach<00:01:53.590> a<00:01:53.800> horse<00:01:53.950> new<00:01:54.370> thing<00:01:54.700> so<00:01:54.940> for<00:01:55.150> example

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
teach a horse new thing so for example

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.270 
teach a horse new thing so for example
just<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.230> basics<00:01:56.650> trying<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:56.950> teach<00:01:57.070> your

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
just the basics trying to teach your

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.830 
just the basics trying to teach your
horse<00:01:57.460> how<00:01:57.580> to<00:01:57.640> bend<00:01:57.909> how<00:01:58.150> to<00:01:58.210> ride<00:01:58.480> in<00:01:58.720> an

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
horse how to bend how to ride in an

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.600 
horse how to bend how to ride in an
arena<00:01:59.050> how<00:01:59.290> to<00:01:59.380> keep<00:01:59.590> his<00:01:59.740> balance<00:01:59.950> how<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:00.400> do

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
arena how to keep his balance how to do

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.820 
arena how to keep his balance how to do
circles<00:02:01.090> all<00:02:01.300> those<00:02:01.450> sorts<00:02:01.720> of<00:02:01.810> things<00:02:02.020> the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
circles all those sorts of things the

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.830 
circles all those sorts of things the
horses<00:02:03.220> one-sidedness<00:02:04.000> so<00:02:04.330> horses<00:02:04.720> are

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
horses one-sidedness so horses are

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.380 
horses one-sidedness so horses are
stronger<00:02:05.350> on<00:02:05.590> one<00:02:06.430> side<00:02:06.700> they<00:02:06.940> tend<00:02:07.150> to<00:02:07.210> be

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
stronger on one side they tend to be

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.779 
stronger on one side they tend to be
their<00:02:08.349> strength<00:02:08.679> more<00:02:08.860> works<00:02:09.129> on<00:02:09.369> a<00:02:09.399> diagonal

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
their strength more works on a diagonal

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.970 
their strength more works on a diagonal
so<00:02:10.090> example<00:02:10.539> they'll<00:02:10.690> kind<00:02:10.989> of<00:02:11.049> be<00:02:11.109> pushing

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
so example they'll kind of be pushing

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.039 
so example they'll kind of be pushing
off<00:02:12.189> one<00:02:12.459> hind<00:02:12.730> leg<00:02:12.969> and<00:02:13.209> usually<00:02:13.540> stronger<00:02:13.840> in

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
off one hind leg and usually stronger in

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.090 
off one hind leg and usually stronger in
one<00:02:14.170> shoulder<00:02:14.469> they're<00:02:14.769> not<00:02:14.889> quite<00:02:15.219> as

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
one shoulder they're not quite as

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.760 
one shoulder they're not quite as
really<00:02:16.310> one-sided<00:02:16.580> as<00:02:17.240> we<00:02:17.480> are<00:02:17.660> but<00:02:18.560> they

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
really one-sided as we are but they

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.800 
really one-sided as we are but they
still<00:02:19.040> have<00:02:19.190> areas<00:02:19.550> of<00:02:19.580> their<00:02:19.760> body<00:02:19.820> that<00:02:20.690> are

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
still have areas of their body that are

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.510 
still have areas of their body that are
stronger<00:02:21.350> they<00:02:21.620> have<00:02:21.830> areas<00:02:22.190> in<00:02:22.220> their<00:02:22.340> body

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
stronger they have areas in their body

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.680 
stronger they have areas in their body
where<00:02:22.700> their<00:02:22.820> muscles<00:02:23.090> are<00:02:23.150> going<00:02:23.270> to<00:02:23.330> be<00:02:23.450> say

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
where their muscles are going to be say

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.080 
where their muscles are going to be say
tight<00:02:23.960> on<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.260> writer<00:02:24.440> side<00:02:24.800> and<00:02:25.670> they're

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
tight on the writer side and they're

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.520 
tight on the writer side and they're
going<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.270> be<00:02:26.330> longer<00:02:26.600> on<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.900> left<00:02:27.080> side<00:02:27.290> so

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
going to be longer on the left side so

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.930 
going to be longer on the left side so
if<00:02:27.620> they<00:02:27.740> want<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.040> bend<00:02:28.250> this<00:02:28.400> way<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.670> the

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
if they want to bend this way to the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.850 
if they want to bend this way to the
right<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.180> they<00:02:29.480> don't<00:02:30.020> like<00:02:30.290> bending<00:02:30.650> over

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
right and they don't like bending over

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.010 
right and they don't like bending over
here<00:02:31.070> to<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.340> left<00:02:31.520> so<00:02:32.180> they<00:02:32.300> have<00:02:32.540> all<00:02:32.840> these

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
here to the left so they have all these

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.900 
here to the left so they have all these
you<00:02:33.470> know<00:02:33.500> areas<00:02:34.100> of<00:02:34.280> strength<00:02:34.670> they<00:02:34.880> have

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
you know areas of strength they have

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.510 
you know areas of strength they have
areas<00:02:35.480> of<00:02:35.630> stiffness<00:02:35.990> they<00:02:36.890> have<00:02:37.130> areas<00:02:37.490> of

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
areas of stiffness they have areas of

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.760 
areas of stiffness they have areas of
soreness<00:02:38.120> just<00:02:38.420> from<00:02:38.690> playing<00:02:39.410> in<00:02:39.620> their

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
soreness just from playing in their

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.010 
soreness just from playing in their
field<00:02:40.040> just<00:02:40.280> from<00:02:40.550> from<00:02:40.790> work<00:02:41.240> from<00:02:41.630> moving<00:02:41.870> a

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
field just from from work from moving a

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.110 
field just from from work from moving a
certain<00:02:42.290> way<00:02:42.440> whatever<00:02:42.710> now<00:02:43.520> we<00:02:43.670> have<00:02:43.940> to

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
certain way whatever now we have to

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.580 
certain way whatever now we have to
really<00:02:44.300> be<00:02:44.420> careful<00:02:44.930> when<00:02:45.110> we're<00:02:45.320> training

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
really be careful when we're training

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.140 
really be careful when we're training
that<00:02:45.830> we<00:02:45.920> take<00:02:46.190> these<00:02:46.400> things<00:02:46.730> into<00:02:47.120> account

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
that we take these things into account

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.030 
that we take these things into account
and<00:02:47.570> that<00:02:47.780> sometimes<00:02:47.990> we<00:02:48.560> just<00:02:48.770> give<00:02:48.920> the

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
and that sometimes we just give the

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.410 
and that sometimes we just give the
horse<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.430> benefit<00:02:49.820> of<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:50.000> doubt<00:02:50.030> whether

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
horse the benefit of the doubt whether

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.750 
horse the benefit of the doubt whether
it's<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.750> behavioral<00:02:51.290> issue<00:02:51.440> like<00:02:51.800> bucking<00:02:52.220> or

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
it's a behavioral issue like bucking or

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.400 
it's a behavioral issue like bucking or
whether<00:02:53.060> it's<00:02:53.270> simply<00:02:53.600> something<00:02:53.810> like<00:02:54.260> I

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
whether it's simply something like I

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.870 
whether it's simply something like I
can't<00:02:54.710> get<00:02:54.860> my<00:02:54.980> horse<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.400> bend<00:02:55.670> this

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
can't get my horse to bend this

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.320 
can't get my horse to bend this
direction<00:02:56.680> instead<00:02:57.680> of<00:02:58.070> just<00:02:58.280> you<00:02:58.940> know<00:02:59.030> doing

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
direction instead of just you know doing

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.300 
direction instead of just you know doing
tons<00:02:59.660> of<00:02:59.810> exercises<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:00.710> thinking<00:03:00.950> about<00:03:01.130> how

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
tons of exercises and thinking about how

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.100 
tons of exercises and thinking about how
can<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.580> force<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.060> horse<00:03:02.210> into<00:03:02.450> this<00:03:02.630> position

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
can I force the horse into this position

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.770 
can I force the horse into this position
and<00:03:03.320> make<00:03:03.860> him<00:03:04.070> Bend<00:03:04.310> we<00:03:05.000> really<00:03:05.330> do<00:03:05.510> have<00:03:05.720> to

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
and make him Bend we really do have to

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.050 
and make him Bend we really do have to
condition<00:03:06.710> the<00:03:06.950> horses<00:03:07.280> muscles<00:03:07.490> we<00:03:07.730> have<00:03:07.880> to

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
condition the horses muscles we have to

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.910 
condition the horses muscles we have to
slowly<00:03:08.300> teach<00:03:08.660> lavoris<00:03:09.080> okay<00:03:09.440> this<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:09.770> the

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
slowly teach lavoris okay this is the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.410 
slowly teach lavoris okay this is the
new<00:03:10.070> way<00:03:10.250> that<00:03:10.520> I<00:03:10.550> want<00:03:10.790> you<00:03:10.940> to<00:03:11.060> learn<00:03:11.180> how<00:03:11.390> to

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
new way that I want you to learn how to

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.560 
new way that I want you to learn how to
move<00:03:11.660> and<00:03:12.340> you're<00:03:13.340> we're<00:03:13.490> going<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:13.940> work

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
move and you're we're going to work

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.960 
move and you're we're going to work
those<00:03:14.750> muscles<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.700> basically<00:03:16.700> work<00:03:16.940> the

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
those muscles and basically work the

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
again this is I know this is more

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.310 
again this is I know this is more
discussion<00:03:38.330> and<00:03:38.360> then<00:03:38.600> me<00:03:38.750> kind<00:03:38.960> of<00:03:38.990> telling

been<00:04:49.880> trying<00:04:50.180> to<00:04:50.450> make<00:04:50.600> sure<00:04:50.630> that<00:04:50.810> she's<00:04:51.320> not

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
been trying to make sure that she's not

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.950

going<00:04:51.680> to<00:04:51.740> be<00:04:51.860> uncomfortable<00:04:52.640> so<00:04:52.850> that<00:04:53.270> she

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
going to be uncomfortable so that she

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.010 
going to be uncomfortable so that she
can<00:04:54.370> learn<00:04:55.370> to<00:04:56.000> the<00:04:56.090> best<00:04:56.240> of<00:04:56.360> her<00:04:56.450> ability<00:04:56.810> and

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
can learn to the best of her ability and

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.510

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
that we don't have behavioral problems

that we don't have behavioral problems
start<00:04:58.910> when<00:04:59.630> I<00:04:59.930> begin<00:05:00.320> riding<00:05:00.560> her<00:05:00.800> and<00:05:01.610> I've

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
start when I begin riding her and I've

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.030 
start when I begin riding her and I've
also<00:05:01.850> had<00:05:02.060> some<00:05:02.240> other<00:05:02.390> horses<00:05:02.660> too<00:05:03.020> that<00:05:03.620> have

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
you know just kind of reminded me to be

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.740

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.990

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590
