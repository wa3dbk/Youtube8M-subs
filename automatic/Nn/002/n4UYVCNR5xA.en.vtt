00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:55.249 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:57.349 

I've<00:00:56.249> Martin<00:00:56.730> with<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.850> brackets<00:00:57.210> are<00:00:57.329> going

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
I've Martin with the brackets are going

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.079 
I've Martin with the brackets are going
so<00:00:57.780> maps<00:00:57.989> now<00:00:58.230> going<00:00:58.499> to<00:00:58.620> put<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.699> brackets

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
so maps now going to put the brackets

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:01.759 
so maps now going to put the brackets
into<00:01:00.269> the<00:01:00.449> beading<00:01:00.870> because<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:01.589> a

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
into the beading because it's a

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:03.919 
into the beading because it's a
particularly<00:01:02.249> hard<00:01:02.579> beading<00:01:03.120> these<00:01:03.780> are

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:03.929 
particularly hard beading these are

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:05.750 
particularly hard beading these are
taking<00:01:04.260> quite<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.470> shelf<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.129> put<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.519> but

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
taking quite a shelf to put in but

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.750 
taking quite a shelf to put in but
that's<00:01:06.030> not<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> problem<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:07.280> we<00:01:08.280> actually<00:01:08.580> do

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
that's not a problem and we actually do

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.330 
that's not a problem and we actually do
have<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.420> piece<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.380> wood<00:01:10.980> which<00:01:11.160> is

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
have a a piece of wood which is

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.300 
have a a piece of wood which is
specially<00:01:11.760> shaped<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:12.360> push<00:01:12.600> them<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:12.900> if<00:01:13.050> we

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
specially shaped to push them in if we

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.220 
specially shaped to push them in if we
are<00:01:14.310> struggling<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.850> get<00:01:15.810> them<00:01:15.960> into<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
are struggling to get them into the

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:47.220 
are struggling to get them into the
beading

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.740 

okay<00:01:48.230> so<00:01:48.290> those<00:01:48.530> six<00:01:48.800> brackets<00:01:49.250> in<00:01:49.430> that<00:01:49.750> so

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
okay so those six brackets in that so

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.600 
okay so those six brackets in that so
now<00:01:50.930> we<00:01:50.990> do<00:01:51.350> so<00:01:51.620> simply<00:01:51.860> click<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:53.390> blind<00:01:53.660> in

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
now we do so simply click the blind in

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.860 
now we do so simply click the blind in
using<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:55.730> lecture<00:01:56.060> on<00:01:56.150> the<00:01:56.270> brackets<00:01:56.690> to

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
using the lecture on the brackets to

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.070 
using the lecture on the brackets to
locate<00:01:57.260> into<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.680> hole<00:01:57.860> on<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.940> frame<00:01:59.210> you

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
locate into the hole on the frame you

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.430 
locate into the hole on the frame you
need<00:02:00.320> to<00:02:00.590> give<00:02:00.800> them<00:02:00.950> just<00:02:01.100> dip<00:02:01.430> in<00:02:02.440> sometimes

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
need to give them just dip in sometimes

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.960 
need to give them just dip in sometimes
you<00:02:03.620> need<00:02:03.800> to<00:02:03.950> leave<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.250> brackets<00:02:04.670> up<00:02:04.790> or

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
you need to leave the brackets up or

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.820 
you need to leave the brackets up or
down<00:02:05.150> if<00:02:05.840> it's<00:02:06.050> my<00:02:06.170> exactly<00:02:06.650> in<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.800> right

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
down if it's my exactly in the right

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:16.930 
down if it's my exactly in the right
place<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:15.680> then<00:02:15.860> just<00:02:16.070> check<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.400> operation

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
place and then just check the operation

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.320 
place and then just check the operation
of<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.120> blind<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:22.120> venetian<00:02:23.120> blind

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
of the blind the venetian blind

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330 
of the blind the venetian blind
obviously<00:02:23.750> goes<00:02:23.930> up<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.260> down<00:02:24.440> and<00:02:24.770> it<00:02:25.220> also

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
obviously goes up and down and it also

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:34.610 
obviously goes up and down and it also
tilts

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.170 

okay<00:02:35.620> with<00:02:35.800> a<00:02:35.830> carry<00:02:36.070> straight<00:02:36.340> come<00:02:36.610> filming

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
okay with a carry straight come filming

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.610 
okay with a carry straight come filming
on<00:02:37.300> to<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.480> next<00:02:37.660> one<00:02:37.870> just<00:02:38.110> so<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.290> can<00:02:38.440> see

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
on to the next one just so you can see

00:02:38.620 --> 00:03:03.970 
on to the next one just so you can see
the<00:02:38.800> pair<00:02:39.040> done

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.160 

okay<00:03:04.700> so<00:03:04.760> we<00:03:04.940> fitted<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.360> two<00:03:05.569> perfect<00:03:05.959> fifth

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
okay so we fitted the two perfect fifth

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.600 
okay so we fitted the two perfect fifth
lines<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.650> we're<00:03:06.739> going<00:03:06.860> to<00:03:06.920> fit<00:03:07.040> a<00:03:07.069> standard

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
lines and we're going to fit a standard

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.780 
lines and we're going to fit a standard
one<00:03:07.819> next<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:09.050> it<00:03:09.080> a<00:03:09.200> top<00:03:09.590> explanation<00:03:10.489> into

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
one next to it a top explanation into

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.600 
one next to it a top explanation into
the<00:03:10.940> lintel<00:03:11.810> so<00:03:12.500> we'll<00:03:12.709> quickly<00:03:12.890> fit<00:03:13.280> that<00:03:13.459> and

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
the lintel so we'll quickly fit that and

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.860 
the lintel so we'll quickly fit that and
we'll<00:03:13.730> show<00:03:13.910> you<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.060> finished<00:03:14.420> look<00:03:16.870> there's

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
we'll show you the finished look there's

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.530 
we'll show you the finished look there's
no<00:03:18.080> way<00:03:18.769> that<00:03:19.099> the<00:03:19.280> blind<00:03:19.970> is<00:03:20.150> going<00:03:20.330> to<00:03:20.420> hit

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
no way that the blind is going to hit

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.870 
no way that the blind is going to hit
the<00:03:20.690> recess<00:03:21.140> but<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:22.040> blind<00:03:22.280> doesn't<00:03:22.519> flap

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
the recess but the blind doesn't flap

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.690 
the recess but the blind doesn't flap
around<00:03:23.440> it's<00:03:24.440> well<00:03:24.709> controlled<00:03:25.250> is<00:03:25.459> within
