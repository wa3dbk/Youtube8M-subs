00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.210
 good these fears to a new video 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:07.419
 well it seems that you already know in 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.580
 enough rumors about what they are 

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:12.370
 remasters in hd of upcoming 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.400
 precision remastering games 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.410
 three towards playstation 4 and basic and of 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.619
 team 70 teams go there are enough 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.880
 rumors and let's go over these 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.099
 rumors you already know that they have already followed 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.869
 several and there are already several confirmed 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.269
 done the last of us is already confirmed 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.070
 the subway is also confirmed the 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.680
 to do the tomb raider and good 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.570
 different plus one of the rumors 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.980
 also that they were rumored one of the 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.780
 how did they look at the 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.010
 good detail in the e3 as I say 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.360
 let's hope that some of 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.160
 these or that they deny me the truth 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.180
 I will not say if I see necessary I do not see 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.560
 necessary 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.500
 these remasters some 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.900
 obviously for him because of how good they are 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.520
 the games because it really cool that 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.050
 masterize in order to see them a bit 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.750
 better but I think it's rather the 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.450
 I want to want to play again but I 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.240
 I think we will have more magic 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.790
 nothing more like that for re playing them and 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.840
 especially so 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.700
 collections flames and lessons of what 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.440
 that are in different games and that comes 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.210
 well because surely they will get more 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.860
 cheap and other good we go with joy 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.220
 which guide ascension was rumored according to 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.300
 industry leaders in a state in 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.980
 other industry with information 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.170
 privileged that would come out for crises are 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.300
 four vote which extension is one of the 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.540
 first titles that are rumored to be 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.520
 will come back as remastering in hd for 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.350
 a remastering in the hd but good 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.080
 companies are three were hd but good 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.420
 I do not know what fucking madness is this though 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.110
 well it is rumored that it will come out 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.890
 remastered for precision four 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.290
 then billion souls also took his 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.180
 part of the rumor we make a long time 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.619
 well that's an adventure title 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.050
 graphic we could say of species are 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.509
 three and could leave companies are four 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.509
 with different little things and enemies 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.910
 already added more different comments 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.259
 of the director and little things more then 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.600
 also another one that could be 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.149
 make quite reality is the halo of 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.520
 masterchef collection in halo from 1 to 4 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.590
 remastered for xbox one and these are 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.720
 the typical packs that I would emulate to see 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.979
 because as I say are four games and 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.369
 surely for the price of one and 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.610
 also 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.159
 to try the whole saga directly as 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.799
 I say also rumored instead of 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:19.150
 done so we could see then 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.069
 some details and others of what 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.900
 it could be we will see actions of three 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.760
 confirmed is denied 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.190
 then we also have a new rumor of 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.560
 what we got a rumor from the trilogy 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.870
 from uncharted in hd to playstation 4 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.000
 although company but a journey in hd 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.560
 well this is also a great example of 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.280
 that a pack yes that would seem pretty 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.200
 good since we can try the 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.670
 games of a saga for the price of a 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.410
 I only play and there are always four 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.670
 for surely as uncharted 4 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.200
 it is also falling only it is the 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.239
 winning that comes or something to the next 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.160
 Well, well, we can guide ourselves a bit 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.280
 more and see a little more history about 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.260
 three and his teammates then also a 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.269
 of the hardest hit we could say in 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.170
 the most effective today and for prison 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.670
 four xbox which was also rumored of 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.430
 fact appeared in a catalog of a 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.079
 store and others and it is expected that even 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.540
 announce the e3 we will also see what 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:13.180
 is announcing or not the certain thing is that 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.650
 are three perfect games almost days 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.150
 we could say and really this 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.340
 compilation as it comes 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.709
 for people who have not played any 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.360
 so also surely in the e3 is 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.970
 We may see some ad for more 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.560
 f4 that would not be called more effect 4 it 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.150
 I would call otherwise surely and 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.879
 probably because this is given as a 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.340
 encouragement so that we can others 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.220
 then also final fantasy 12 hd 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.109
 It is also like created that comes out in 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.519
 next generation and so on we'll see what 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.459
 what happened originally is the empress 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:45.220
 season 2 and we have no idea if 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.900
 will come out or not the truth is that the square 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.790
 Enix already said that yes he would like 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.530
 master it and that probably if 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.139
 final fantasy 10 and winds were going well 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.400
 because this one would also come out so 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.200
 sales have gone well as they have already said 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.480
 previously and we will probably see it 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.920
 in e3 or later so nothing 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.230
 those are the rumors that about more 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.760
 arrests in hd although it costs me 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.319
 say it like that because it urges us more 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.280
 directions in hd with ro mastering 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.329
 is and it's already so good for next 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.500
 generation and nothing we see in the 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.500
 next video will be next show
