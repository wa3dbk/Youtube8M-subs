00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.960
 - We arrive at 10:42! 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.620
 20 young basketball guys from Tumba won a unique match with the Swedish national team in basketball. 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.360
 Without knowing how the day would look, they started a very special sports trip with SJ. 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.600
 SJ presents: Landslagschansen! 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.360
 - I have no idea, not yet! 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.040
 It's a lot of surprises, what haven't we been told yet. 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.060
 We know that we should get along with the national team in some way. 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.020
 We should have lunch first, then it will be match tonight. We don't know more than that. 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.160
 It has something to do with the national team. 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.320
 - Maybe he should come and watch the match. - Yes, he comes. 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.400
 - Do you know him or? Are you boys? - Yeah ... He gives tips! 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.860
 - Yeah ... He's heavy! 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.620
 - The dressing room is here! 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.200
 - Chilla, chilla! 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.740
 - I thought that I would build the training a bit as we do with the national team. 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.420
 We will start with some technology and then we will increase the tempo a little. 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.940
 We shoot some and then we will run some dynamic stretching, as we do with the national team. 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.500
 Then we further increase the pace so that there will be some competition in the whole. 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.220
 In the beginning we work together, we compete together and then we will compete individually against each other. 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.820
 - We have had a training with the national team coach. 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.640
 It was noticed that he was extra kind and wanted us to have fun. 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.780
 It has been fun so far and I look forward to the match. 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.680
 - Come on! 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.000
 - The day has been great fun and I have been very happy to have had this chance 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.260
 to go with my team here to BorÃ¥s, meet the national team and talk to them. 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.140
 And to play with real national team coaches. It was really cool!
