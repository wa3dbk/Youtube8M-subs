this<00:00:29.429> board<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.820> like<00:00:30.029> your<00:00:30.510> group<00:00:30.689> if<00:00:30.900> you

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
this board is like your group if you

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.380 
this board is like your group if you
drop<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.590> through<00:00:31.769> you're<00:00:32.759> really<00:00:33.090> close

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
drop it through you're really close

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.850 
drop it through you're really close
you're<00:00:33.780> really<00:00:33.899> close<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.380> ground<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:34.829> you

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
you're really close to the ground so you

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.040 
you're really close to the ground so you
have<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.010> lot<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.250> control<00:00:35.910> over<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.239> board<00:00:36.480> you

have a lot of control over the board you

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.490

matter a lot you can hold out long
slides<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.940> can<00:00:47.969> it's<00:00:48.690> much<00:00:48.930> easier<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.320> slide

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
slides you can it's much easier to slide

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
griptape so that the gas pedals don't

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.550 
griptape so that the gas pedals don't
wear<00:01:04.830> out<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:06.840> yeah<00:01:06.960> overall<00:01:07.260> it's<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.530> really

real buy-in is perfect so going on this
is<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.450> original<00:01:24.860> freeride<00:01:25.860> 41<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:27.420> has<00:01:27.570> some

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
is the original freeride 41 it has some

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.530 
is the original freeride 41 it has some
pretty<00:01:28.020> nice<00:01:28.290> graphic<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.430> but<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.180> one<00:01:30.390> has

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
pretty nice graphic so but this one has

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.190 
pretty nice graphic so but this one has
a<00:01:30.570> w<00:01:31.020> concave<00:01:31.610> as<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:33.000> see<00:01:33.450> just<00:01:33.869> like<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
a w concave as you can see just like the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.630 
a w concave as you can see just like the
925<00:01:34.710> um<00:01:35.659> I<00:01:36.659> have<00:01:37.110> bear<00:01:37.650> 852<00:01:38.549> trucks<00:01:39.020> with

925 um I have bear 852 trucks with
yellow<00:01:41.640> stims<00:01:42.500> stimulus<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.790> bone<00:01:44.790> rest<00:01:45.090> I

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
yellow stims stimulus and bone rest I

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.069 
yellow stims stimulus and bone rest I
can<00:01:45.240> we<00:01:45.479> basically<00:01:45.869> out<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.290> same<00:01:46.500> setup<00:01:46.799> and

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
can we basically out the same setup and

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.550 
can we basically out the same setup and
this<00:01:49.079> board<00:01:49.799> also<00:01:50.009> has<00:01:50.430> two<00:01:50.670> gas<00:01:50.850> pedals<00:01:51.270> and

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
this board also has two gas pedals and

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.289 
this board also has two gas pedals and
as<00:01:52.560> he<00:01:52.710> said<00:01:52.920> they<00:01:53.130> do<00:01:53.369> matter<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.790> lot<00:01:54.000> when

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
as he said they do matter a lot when

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.789 
as he said they do matter a lot when
you're<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:54.630> holding<00:01:54.869> out<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.350> can<00:01:55.470> hold<00:01:55.590> out

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
you're like holding out you can hold out

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.819 
you're like holding out you can hold out
really<00:01:56.100> long<00:01:56.310> sides<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.020> spit<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.320> W

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
really long sides and spit and the W

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.859 
really long sides and spit and the W
concave<00:01:59.250> helps<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.729> lot<00:01:59.880> we<00:02:00.060> doing<00:02:00.360> toeside

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
concave helps a lot we doing toeside

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.249 
concave helps a lot we doing toeside
sites<00:02:01.170> because<00:02:01.860> they<00:02:02.460> help<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.600> your<00:02:03.930> feet<00:02:04.110> get
