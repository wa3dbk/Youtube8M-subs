00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.010
 today let's talk about picking typing 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.929
 one it can be completed 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:13.170
 standard door at the moment 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.000
 price of 42 thousand rubles for an additional 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.920
 fee you can complete the stove 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.270
 door saint 405 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:27.890
 People often call it the Finnish price. 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:32.090
 such a door of 17,000 rubles is completely 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.760
 cast iron tunnel with cast iron door 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:44.129
 the door is equipped 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:50.239
 blown glass dense system 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:54.149
 chrome handle closing 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:58.770
 glass is big enough a little later we 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.530
 compare it with the wishes of the customer 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:06.180
 the stove can be equipped with Finnish 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:14.850
 the door will look like this 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:17.070
 as we see a little bit more saying the words 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.659
 Finnish need to understand that Finnish here 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.710
 just fly for the door 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:27.479
 this door svt 405 for oven 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.040
 you probably have seen her she was in 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.040
 such boxes is inserted 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.430
 the door is very high quality 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.590
 nice beautiful but the door is made for 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.740
 ovens 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.360
 They are for the top and do not have glass blowing then 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:51.070
 have glass of you fast enough 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:52.270
 very good wrought iron system 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:02:03.080
 closures 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:02:06.410
 doors and thoughtful mainstream 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.850
 minus cast iron doors if you are 405 then what 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:13.040
 it is attached to the tunnel 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:16.489
 through the asphyr adapter of this metal then 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:21.620
 have you have a cast iron firebox 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:24.770
 door and saint 405 and adapter from 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.190
 physics firebox in this way becomes not 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:33.470
 fully cast iron 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:36.500
 means less reliable classical 41 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.049
 the simplest configuration has 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.870
 cast iron firebox 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:46.030
 tunnel iron and cast-iron door that 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.030
 there is a fully cast iron firebox 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:54.560
 many say that 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.190
 svt 405 has a big stone glass you 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.269
 Now we compare that is the standard 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:07.180
 firebox 41 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:07.180
 glass width 30 centimeters 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:21.080
 door 405 30 405 door glass width 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:27.160
 34 centimeters ie razin with 4 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:31.090
 centimeter now the height of the glass door 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:38.170
 cast iron firebox 41 height 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:38.170
 height height 20 centimeters now 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:49.100
 glass height svt 405 height 23 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.940
 centimeter 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.400
 that is, as you can see the glass on 41 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:00.050
 standard only on 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:05.090
 three centimeters lower and four 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:08.060
 centimeter already as summarize 2 doors 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.850
 near both have excellent systems 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:15.290
 closures 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:17.209
 good system blowing SVT 405 does not have 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:23.600
 the clean glass system will therefore 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:27.740
 quickly get dirty door 41 is put on 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:30.710
 cast-iron tunnel door light and 405 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.050
 worn on a tunnel made of 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.650
 high-end metal 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.650
 But in general, that's all
