00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
the flaps easy

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.270 
the flaps easy
yeah<00:05:48.250> then<00:05:49.250> push<00:05:49.490> them<00:05:49.669> back<00:05:49.759> into<00:05:49.940> place

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
yeah then push them back into place

00:05:51.280 --> 00:06:00.610 
yeah then push them back into place
let's<00:05:53.080> try<00:05:54.080> with<00:05:54.289> this<00:05:54.319> one<00:05:56.530> yeah<00:05:58.629> there<00:05:59.629> you

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
let's try with this one yeah there you

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.270 
let's try with this one yeah there you
should<00:06:00.889> be<00:06:00.949> able<00:06:01.009> to<00:06:01.129> see<00:06:01.220> it's<00:06:01.340> open<00:06:01.960> it<00:06:03.280> would

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
should be able to see it's open it would

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.770 
should be able to see it's open it would
be<00:06:04.430> much<00:06:04.639> easier<00:06:04.699> but<00:06:05.210> I<00:06:05.270> have<00:06:05.389> to<00:06:05.479> hold<00:06:05.659> a

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
be much easier but I have to hold a

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:12.730 
be much easier but I have to hold a
camera<00:06:05.990> with<00:06:06.259> the<00:06:06.440> other<00:06:06.560> hand<00:06:06.919> so<00:06:11.590> it's<00:06:12.590> got

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
camera with the other hand so it's got

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.339 
camera with the other hand so it's got
by<00:06:12.889> a<00:06:12.919> rubberized<00:06:13.430> texture<00:06:13.759> here<00:06:14.080> so<00:06:15.080> I<00:06:15.110> sort

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:15.349 
by a rubberized texture here so I sort

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:17.140 
by a rubberized texture here so I sort
of<00:06:15.409> its<00:06:15.740> smooth<00:06:16.099> as<00:06:16.280> well<00:06:16.490> so<00:06:16.759> it<00:06:16.879> doesn't

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
of its smooth as well so it doesn't

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.450 
of its smooth as well so it doesn't
really<00:06:17.270> grip<00:06:17.930> onto<00:06:18.139> things<00:06:18.470> but<00:06:18.770> if<00:06:19.250> you're

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
really grip onto things but if you're

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.379 
really grip onto things but if you're
holding<00:06:19.789> it<00:06:19.970> and<00:06:20.090> stuff<00:06:20.389> and<00:06:20.770> uh<00:06:22.210> then<00:06:23.210> it's

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:23.389 
holding it and stuff and uh then it's

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:25.029 
holding it and stuff and uh then it's
going<00:06:23.539> to<00:06:23.599> be<00:06:23.659> more<00:06:23.900> difficult<00:06:23.960> to<00:06:24.440> slip<00:06:24.919> out

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 
going to be more difficult to slip out

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:27.129 
going to be more difficult to slip out
your<00:06:25.190> hand<00:06:25.400> unlike<00:06:26.270> if<00:06:26.539> it<00:06:26.659> didn't<00:06:26.900> have<00:06:27.020> the

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:27.139 
your hand unlike if it didn't have the

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:29.170 
your hand unlike if it didn't have the
case<00:06:27.319> on<00:06:27.530> which<00:06:27.889> because<00:06:28.190> the<00:06:28.400> services<00:06:29.120> are

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.180 
case on which because the services are

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.670 
case on which because the services are
quite<00:06:29.389> smooth<00:06:29.750> though<00:06:29.960> it<00:06:30.110> does<00:06:30.259> have<00:06:30.470> some

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
quite smooth though it does have some

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.100 
quite smooth though it does have some
sort<00:06:30.860> of<00:06:30.979> like<00:06:31.880> smooth<00:06:32.240> rubberized<00:06:32.750> texture

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
sort of like smooth rubberized texture

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.210 
sort of like smooth rubberized texture
around<00:06:33.470> like<00:06:34.159> the<00:06:34.310> outsides<00:06:34.699> of<00:06:34.819> the<00:06:34.909> phone

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.220 
around like the outsides of the phone

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.459 
around like the outsides of the phone
which<00:06:37.220> is<00:06:37.430> slightly<00:06:38.120> useful<00:06:38.389> in<00:06:39.050> case<00:06:39.319> you

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:39.469 
which is slightly useful in case you

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:44.700 
which is slightly useful in case you
might<00:06:39.620> not<00:06:39.860> be<00:06:40.009> holding<00:06:40.219> that<00:06:40.520> part<00:06:42.250> right<00:06:43.250> so

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
might not be holding that part right so

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:51.749 
might not be holding that part right so
om<00:06:45.710> help<00:06:46.069> lock<00:06:46.789> button<00:06:48.129> the<00:06:49.129> same<00:06:49.340> as<00:06:49.550> the<00:06:50.289> the

00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:51.759 
om help lock button the same as the the

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:56.379 
om help lock button the same as the the
volume<00:06:52.780> volume<00:06:53.780> control<00:06:54.259> it's<00:06:54.949> slightly<00:06:55.789> more

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:56.389 
volume volume control it's slightly more

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:59.529 
volume volume control it's slightly more
difficult<00:06:56.419> to<00:06:56.840> press<00:06:57.169> but<00:06:57.500> it's<00:06:57.830> not<00:06:58.490> that<00:06:58.669> not

00:06:59.529 --> 00:06:59.539 
difficult to press but it's not that not

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:04.240 
difficult to press but it's not that not
that<00:06:59.569> much<00:07:00.969> you<00:07:01.969> can<00:07:02.120> see<00:07:02.360> I've<00:07:02.659> I've<00:07:03.650> got<00:07:04.099> this

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.250 
that much you can see I've I've got this

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.809 
that much you can see I've I've got this
um<00:07:05.469> I've<00:07:06.469> got<00:07:06.770> this<00:07:06.860> face<00:07:07.069> recognition<00:07:07.310> thing

00:07:07.809 --> 00:07:07.819 
um I've got this face recognition thing

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:09.339 
um I've got this face recognition thing
and<00:07:08.029> I've<00:07:08.120> got<00:07:08.270> passcode<00:07:08.719> offering<00:07:09.050> because<00:07:09.199> I

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:09.349 
and I've got passcode offering because I

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:13.120 
and I've got passcode offering because I
in<00:07:09.740> case<00:07:10.039> doesn't<00:07:10.250> recognize<00:07:10.669> me<00:07:12.069> which<00:07:13.069> i

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.130 
in case doesn't recognize me which i

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.939 
in case doesn't recognize me which i
think<00:07:13.190> is<00:07:13.370> quite<00:07:13.490> useful<00:07:13.849> my<00:07:14.779> unboxing<00:07:15.590> for

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:15.949 
think is quite useful my unboxing for

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:19.839 
think is quite useful my unboxing for
this<00:07:16.099> phone<00:07:16.370> should<00:07:16.729> be<00:07:16.759> out<00:07:17.599> soon<00:07:18.639> I've<00:07:19.639> been
