00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 Hello my name is Sergey and you 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:10.790
 are on the garbage canal and like 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:15.289
 promised to do a video about the first inclusion 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:19.730
 radio tuner and stereo radio tuner 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.730
 radio engineering firms 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:28.260
 I have already done his brief overview of the state 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:32.460
 the tuner is not very good and now I have it 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:36.000
 hooked up to an amplifier called it 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.420
 by the way Victoria 003 stereo is zero 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.760
 the class 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:44.879
 considered to be the highest class in the USSR 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.030
 that is, according to their data, it is zero class 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.700
 always considered the highest class 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.129
 the thing was expensive for its time now 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.489
 Unfortunately I can not turn it and 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.859
 I can't show you the back because 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.449
 that as you can see here is the body 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.510
 kept on snot 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.290
 it is completely sold out and that's like that in 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.640
 heaped up a little bit and hooked up first 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.630
 the thing that made it soldered the yellow cord 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.340
 this one is 220 power because its 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.030
 it wasn't just pulled out 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.130
 and connected one channel that is, it is stereo 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.049
 but I connected one channel to the amplifier 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.710
 Now I will raise a little 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.200
 and maybe you will see here you see 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:35.909
 far blue and red wire this is me 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.430
 connected to my amplifier what to show 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.200
 you how it works 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.860
 cleaned all the leaves that were there 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.680
 inside I pulled a little thread 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.310
 settings because a little bit they were 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.210
 shot down 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.330
 and the arrow did not go well like that 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.619
 all after connecting the power cord then 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:02.369
 I have lit the scale itself then 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:06.240
 there is all the high part he has worked and 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.030
 after which I connected 2 wires to 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.580
 your homemade 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:18.000
 the amplifier will now play with us 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:20.400
 amphiton speakers I already shot them here 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.610
 let's show you a little bit of his front 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.470
 the panel is our fine tuning goes 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.510
 here 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:38.060
 u1 u2 channels at 34 uk rf ultrashort 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:42.120
 wave buttons on the long-wave 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:46.260
 meter waves medium waves and just 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:50.340
 short wavelengths so the power button 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:53.090
 and the setting knob is a rough one 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.739
 say setting is fine tuning 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.989
 when we twist this regulator 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:03.299
 the exact settings we have here is this antenna 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:07.019
 here this ferrite see the antenna here 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:09.980
 this is now I twist her see she 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:13.049
 spinning is this fine tuning 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.019
 how do you see the threads we stretched now 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:19.220
 everything is precisely regulated plus here 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.980
 shows level 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.400
 when you set up you see the level of 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.829
 we have an arrow deviates 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:33.239
 so as we have another does not work 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:36.900
 here we have now enabled apache ma 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:40.650
 and here I found one station 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:51.690
 Ukrainian station and now I will show you 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:52.840
 how it sounds like this 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.060
 spring 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.390
 You see, we are starting fine-tuning. 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.400
 regulate and we have noise here 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:22.630
 that is, we now find when they are more 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:28.630
 better sound maybe some 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:31.419
 song and listen to how it sounds scale 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.820
 he has an unusual way well how unusual 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:37.210
 it looks the same now somehow 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:40.960
 surprised and kind of here Luxembourg Odessa by 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:44.139
 cities are all painted now this already 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:51.430
 I did not meet us just the range we have 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:54.910
 the street is straight 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:58.660
 sign plus numbers in my it 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:09.190
 distance any frequency in general 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:14.530
 This is how it looks like it promised. 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:18.460
 video made radio tuner completely 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:20.889
 it works but the state will say so 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.200
 not very good body all this 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.950
 restored here just need 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.289
 to glue 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:32.650
 and a little wash it from dust it is dirt 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:35.020
 missing a couple of pens here these here 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:38.380
 but this is also not a problem this is all done 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.500
 such a cool thing 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:45.760
 work everyone thank you subscribe to 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:49.270
 the channel will be a lot of interesting videos very 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:52.120
 a lot of finds there is just no time for everything 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.610
 spread a little time, but I have 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:58.440
 don't worry there are videos there will be 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.440
 thank you all bye bye
