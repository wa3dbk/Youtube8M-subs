00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.879
 Hmm 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.600
 Barn 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:24.019
 I fire today 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.019
 Today I will try to look at the things about feeling 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.450
 It is today Kome' said 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.720
 I will try to see about 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.350
 Although this is also interesting and be 4 a look at how it is 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.100
 The say rice 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.620
 It is the best for Japanese people 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.920
 Major 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:48.320
 It is said that it is the most important thing to do because it is a job 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.320
 But if you look at this letter well 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.859
 Cheong 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.510
 Ten 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:00.120
 Rice 10 + made it 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.120
 It is such a child, this is positive 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:09.090
 I think that this becomes 88 will be said well 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.860
 Well it might be a bit brutish, but this is a double house 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.880
 So it's to be replaced a few people that say 88 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:21.530
 In those rice because farmers hard Tsukazu 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:28.409
 I'm making it but it's about 88 times over time I spend my spare time 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:30.440
 You also said the wind that please make over a much a lot of time and effort 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.000
 88 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.820
 Also because the say that this an important Tteyuu I guess 88 to say rice 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.600
 The number of births 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.990
 It is also the Tteyuu for example Shikoku of 88 places 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.490
 There is a measure called 88 . 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:50.909
 Well then what does 88 mean? 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:57.370
 If you say from the conclusion, rice is 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:02:00.390
 As it is said to hit the punishment and really long time ago Well rice one one leave it is to say a grain of rice 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:04.430
 I think this is really God 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:08.160
 Because it will connect the buying and selling life 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:11.550
 I think that there is a sense of meaning that is important like God 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.040
 So what does this 88 mean? 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.700
 But I do not say I shame 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.340
 8 is 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.260
 I will care what 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.760
 There Yao whether Yorozu the 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.380
 I write 8 million and say it is a god of noon 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.569
 Many keys are included 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.800
 a 8 isn't it 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.720
 then 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:38.330
 For example, Hachiman City Hachiman Shrine There are many in Japan, though 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.660
 After all that 8 is from old days 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.350
 Know God 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.350
 8 is 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.430
 8 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.990
 There is a way to call it 8 but there is also a way to say it 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.640
 It is essential to say that beauty is 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:59.200
 Seeing further , for example 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.150
 This is Kore Machine 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.250
 Because it is the light of the sun 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.760
 Because machine light is god 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:10.280
 Yes is also a symbol of grabbing 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:14.000
 I take the implication say likely to serve as a 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.500
 Or in Well No. 8 the father is Hachiman Shrine 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.520
 Is it a god 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:25.530
 By saying 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:27.050
 I have a talk in a slightly strange attitude place this is a department hospital and the hair of the athlete is an old promise 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.190
 There is a bible 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.190
 I Yea is spring 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.830
 Also 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:40.750
 It 's already a shame, it's a shame 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.590
 Or the sounds Well water spread is basically the Tteyuu 8 because it has a kind of implications 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.020
 I'm fine but 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.640
 mirror 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:50.440
 It is a symptom of 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:53.140
 It is the infinity What if defeat the figure of the 8 next to such Fu 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:57.860
 In other words, infinity 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:00.660
 Those also Toka such surprising infinity Is God 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:04.150
 Really 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.030
 I think that something 0 leads to something like that 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.840
 Because 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.879
 8 In God 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.879
 It feels light at 88 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:22.230
 You can hair is seen Fu say two people I members and like hair This is the 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.550
 Do not told the Old Testament and the New Testament I'd kinda strange story if singing to and say, 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.610
 you know 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.789
 The Mold of the Old Testament can be called Jesus Christ in a New Testament Journey 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.789
 From 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.460
 This is a symbol of these two gods 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.960
 Hmm 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.330
 Also elected it is combined with the Tteyuu 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:45.539
 Japan is also ua 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:46.190
 Although the top of the shrine is the opposite sex Shingu that is not the temple and gay temple of Tteyuu Ise Shrine Nogami is 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.350
 It is not 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.430
 2nd place gold 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.460
 After all it is good 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.870
 I can say that the day of yin and yang 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.370
 That say committee members and 82 one between 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.370
 Express a little bit 8 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.540
 There in I originally say with Japan citation 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.750
 Silver 8 copper 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.849
 It says I eo move of good soil is 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.379
 The 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:13.910
 I've been is built for that to come because you have of still these parts considered transmitted 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:21.860
 Ne 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:24.950
 So rice is 88 , so it is a group of gods and g gods in the front, and the front and back are 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.440
 If you match it, it will be a game 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:31.600
 In other words, is it perfect ? 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:35.050
 Those yet a full of Tteyuu safe clogging rice 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:39.730
 Not get it why we are the true 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.730
 Thank you for eating rice 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:51.540
 Then there is love every day like that, so it is very different even if you take one thing called rice 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:53.770
 I think I can say it 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:57.810
 If I develop it a little more 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.810
 It is the fourth floor which we put 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.040
 This is originally 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:06.050
 This too 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.020
 It is something that is often said, but I wrote this letter 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.230
 The 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.500
 Here 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:16.470
 This is not included 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:19.230
 If you say that this can be seen as that 88, but I change the way of thinking more 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.910
 This would be blowing this way 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.910
 It is spreading in the direction 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:29.010
 It is a light that spreads in eight directions 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.010
 85 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.720
 Say in other words that spread in all directions so say all directions 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.980
 It is light 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:46.060
 I also say 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:47.050
 If you put out the dexterity by spreading the light that you originally have in your elementary school 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.520
 Say 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.940
 Well, originally it takes this 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.190
 A little school here 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.980
 Kioh 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.480
 Close the Ciel machine 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:00.300
 Because it becomes 

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:03.380
 Here of the tree say a big release is more of here 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.409
 It is said that it is an original tree 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.529
 Hmm 

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:10.409
 That's why so you can see many meanings 

00:07:07.529 --> 00:07:16.200
 One by one 

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:17.720
 I feel that it is interesting that there is a sense of meaning called Yuyukai 

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:23.689
 Hey heart 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:25.719
 Thank you very much for explaining it 

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:25.719
 2 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:29.110
