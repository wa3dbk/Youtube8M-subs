00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.519
 robert mÃ©nard good evening and patrick pepper of arvor to release all their clique 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.529
 and your lack of vigor after being around 32 10 we were leaving this is the 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.769
 phone so far the international reciprocal of atlantic rtl for the 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.849
 fishing for this marine ride the pen and its improbable comparison between 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:33.940
 Muslim prayers in the street and the German occupation that 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.290
 they're doing it tonight 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.190
 The report 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.640
 and the human rights league have a tendency that complains about 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.570
 situation 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.809
 to the main sentence already hears the grumbles of robert menard 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:43.650
 4 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.670
 according to you

 the hostess who attracted how to think the world his acts 

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:51.440
 episodes that has tremendously to kick off the political debate in which 

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:52.400
 he holds 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.400
 el alamein marine the pen without the pen right now 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.870
 my game first of all since 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.190
 the League of Human Rights 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.350
 and the mrap that starts m 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.480
 for the plr 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.980
 with the crufc we want to part with it 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.180
 to what we think of what she says she has the right to say it he will embody 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.250
 the suit according to a book sold at the stimulus 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.730
 gevrise emanates that made snow say that the search for consensus 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.000
 enough has improved from 14 hours to 16 hours parallel to a 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.700
 problem of martine aubry white laurent hammered his sister and his inventions 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.020
 several bruises cass 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.070
 the girls have passed 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.270
 victorious ouattara we have zero to the north of austria in doubt the 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.399
 minors to the usual commission of misdemeanors that ask more and more 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.280
 the mayor brought the second point 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.570
 obviously there is a real awkwardness unlike what you say on the 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.000
 comparison between World War II I do not know why the 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.270
 family the pen goes out unable to pose real problems 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.750
 he goes out immediately added a layer 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.920
 third point ouch that after problem it's a real problem that 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.409
 in some cities in paris in the 18th hiller 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.420
 you do not leave real problem because there are not enough mosques for 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.370
 welcome people but on the other hand a real problem because there are some 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.360
 extremist extremists who make the law in the streets is by the police 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.380
 Spanish who bar the streets and that must be yes it's shocking then there is 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.739
 three different media issues she has the right to say what she wants 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.120
 yes there is a comparison that is unfortunate once again powerful 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.310
 she has to learn on the farm and killed 80 points she poses a real 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.749
 problem there is a real problem there is a real problem with Islam that he 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:33.549
 must be approached to have the courage to approach 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.810
 the general attack - the actions to answer the question you were doing 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:38.770
 before giving the floor to Patrick Devedjian 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.050
 you wonder me it was rare but maybe more per month closes what I 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.000
 you have not in the group all happy to have succeeded where I live 18th 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.030
 arrondissement i'm not far from the street myrha but it's true that when i 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.770
 walk me street myrha well I like that I do not feel welcome I do not 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.989
 feel uncomfortable are not welcome 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.019
 on the other hand sales up 20 8 in April and this served him well by 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.560
 students when there was 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.630
 an initiative certainly soup the evening the face bobcats peace a 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.220
 role held 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.850
 peace in the region said m they received his setback to this 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.280
 age there he asserted that it's the same problem is global a real 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.240
 problem in the last ten should moreover be a benefit 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.690
 the answer to the oil spill the answer is yes this is it 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.290
 obeidiate to these people as the marine says the pen 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.590
 diagnosis and that's called mosque of paris are connected it's more 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.690
 complicated than that 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.000
 today the answer points they are these handsets to share 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.840
 of my contradictions today if we want to go to elections a few 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.000
 yes we will go ahead 9 am on one side you tell you that Muslims 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.010
 air and wings in the Muslim organizations of 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.260
 northerners 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.790
 we must double the area today mosques 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.629
 to welcome everyone who wants to pray 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:49.629
 at the same time I will tell you to me brutally 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.589
 the mayor at the msa does the game and marie-laure delorme in english 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:54.489
 born in England 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:55.930
 I do not want 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.060
 which is mosques as much as the churches in my country and that that and 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.650
 I gave it all it's the real problem according to her says my mother and me when 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.299
 I go to a village in Aubrac where play with Patrick Gm who is a 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.500
 church even if I do not care the pyrenees currencies I do not want 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.310
 what minarets in all the villages of france crif and that's the problem the 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.109
 problem we do not dare to say because it's complicated to say 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.879
 sensors of the spectators and buddies they all agree and you 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:25.360
 as soon as it has to be said publicly that he could for a little bit more that's the 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.470
 problem and at the same time and at the same time i'm ap are strongly opposed 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.480
 to the idea contrary to what you just said 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.840
 that the answer c a kind of laikcardic attitude also make 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.880
 serious no but I'm sure and not the reversed 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.240
 the prayer rooms and peace in front of a prayer room and the region the port 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.240
 Algerian and minarets% of voices The voice of Northern Iraq made talk of 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.950
 the burka I'm happy to have money it's against the ban on 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.900
 the burqa i'm my against the veil because it's because we're 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.690
 contradictory 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.330
 I think it remains faso to stigmatize our arguments and it's like 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.840
 that and live it 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.139
 yes but finally realize a rag what one needs a forehand considered 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:03.900
 we must consider 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.040
 our country our national community if we want it to endure if we want 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.610
 to live together I think we have the largest Muslim community 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.539
 europe 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.070
 6 6 million people 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.090
 can we say 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.110
 to 6 million people fico summer we can purely and simply of the 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.789
 card you're nice you have to master it 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:23.949
 ah if we ask them to respect republican laws and I'm for 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.199
 that we make them dream to respect and we ask them to respect eloi de 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:30.259
 the year and secularism to live together I disagree 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:33.539
 with robert I'm small I'm very happy we talked about this posture 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.720
 4 we can not tell them listen now you respect the rules 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.030
 more and more it's your area bother you but note that do you want that 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.030
 you navigate inside a building even that it does not bother me 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.500
 no and you do not have the right to abort minarets needs to have the 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.490
 hands what I'm doing there has been far from the limit value of the help and the 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.510
 support of robert gavenda's intervention i agree with 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.070
 anne-sophie the bubble lines that are not usual but I'm 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.969
 agree to say 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:56.650
 the only 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.840
 spring the only solution the only violence on public officials 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.660
 as the most realistic solution that to say that from this Sunday 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.650
 she has alas 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.380
 I know I'm not saying that we have to accept that people can 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.000
 same time 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.400
 I'm advocating it helps 2nd spouses by punishing the masks this 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.920
 that I can say is that I think the logic is to say for example 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.340
 today there are two hundred thousand immigrants who come to France every year 80% 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.620
 paris in the case of family reunification 80% 90% are Muslim 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.759
 we must stop it 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:32.240
 we have to stop this and because we do not welcome people because we are not 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.259
 not able to accommodate because we are not even able to offer them 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:39.449
 places of prayer go to the recyvalor nations convalescent damien to full 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:42.460
 lungs of newcomers as to all those who - for example 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.610
 a religion his ankle this very time with his club at the prison for life 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.960
 in israel between morocco and nigeria had called the media on sunday 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.419
 and in life I like of course that you would not do 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:56.659
 you would not have to say if he would need in five sets since the decree were saying 

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:59.389
 some churches and savings what you are left savoring your opinion 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:02.069
 half-past seven while working in August next topic
