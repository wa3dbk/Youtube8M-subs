00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.010 
went wrong so I think I was even more
nervous<00:00:36.579> than<00:00:36.760> my<00:00:36.880> teammates<00:00:37.210> which<00:00:37.690> is<00:00:37.840> quite

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
nervous than my teammates which is quite

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.380 
nervous than my teammates which is quite
unusual<00:00:38.079> but<00:00:38.650> uh<00:00:38.730> yeah<00:00:39.730> the<00:00:39.880> luck<00:00:40.000> was<00:00:40.150> with<00:00:40.180> us

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
unusual but uh yeah the luck was with us

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.250 
unusual but uh yeah the luck was with us
today<00:00:41.310> that<00:00:42.310> first<00:00:42.579> game<00:00:42.850> was<00:00:43.690> really<00:00:43.930> tough

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
today that first game was really tough

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.189 
today that first game was really tough
for<00:00:44.290> you<00:00:44.620> and<00:00:45.239> even<00:00:46.239> though<00:00:46.390> you<00:00:46.690> actually

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
for you and even though you actually

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.639 
for you and even though you actually
almost<00:00:47.770> came<00:00:48.160> back<00:00:48.399> after<00:00:49.180> getting<00:00:49.840> ace<00:00:50.350> three

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
almost came back after getting ace three

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.860 
almost came back after getting ace three
times<00:00:50.890> is<00:00:51.340> that<00:00:51.399> even<00:00:52.000> possible<00:00:52.059> should<00:00:52.600> it<00:00:52.719> be

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
times is that even possible should it be

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.020 
times is that even possible should it be
possible<00:00:53.079> I<00:00:53.550> think<00:00:54.550> it<00:00:54.609> would<00:00:54.730> have<00:00:54.760> come<00:00:54.969> back

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
possible I think it would have come back

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.509 
possible I think it would have come back
if<00:00:55.359> a<00:00:55.989> certain<00:00:56.469> individual<00:00:57.039> mistake<00:00:57.309> wasn't

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
if a certain individual mistake wasn't

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.189 
if a certain individual mistake wasn't
made<00:00:57.730> but<00:00:58.210> there<00:00:58.329> were<00:00:58.420> a<00:00:58.449> lot<00:00:58.629> of<00:00:58.660> individual

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
made but there were a lot of individual

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:00.419 
made but there were a lot of individual
mistakes<00:00:59.559> in<00:00:59.710> the<00:00:59.800> first<00:00:59.949> game<00:01:00.160> a<00:01:00.219> lot<00:01:00.309> of

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:00.429 
mistakes in the first game a lot of

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:02.250 
mistakes in the first game a lot of
catches<00:01:00.789> ready<00:01:00.969> and<00:01:01.300> then<00:01:01.480> it<00:01:02.019> just<00:01:02.140> got

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260

catching up tool to you in the first

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.850 
catching up tool to you in the first
game<00:01:15.060> well<00:01:16.060> not<00:01:16.900> exactly<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.380> nurse<00:01:17.560> motor

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
game well not exactly the nurse motor

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.620 
game well not exactly the nurse motor
pressure<00:01:18.130> but<00:01:18.909> we<00:01:18.939> knew<00:01:19.180> we<00:01:19.210> had<00:01:19.329> the<00:01:19.420> blue

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
pressure but we knew we had the blue

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.870 
pressure but we knew we had the blue
side<00:01:19.810> now<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.020> that<00:01:20.530> and<00:01:20.829> we<00:01:21.220> would<00:01:21.460> have<00:01:21.610> to

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
side now and that and we would have to

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.280 
side now and that and we would have to
have<00:01:22.060> a<00:01:22.090> completely<00:01:22.810> different<00:01:23.170> approach

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
have a completely different approach

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.480 
have a completely different approach
because<00:01:23.710> we<00:01:23.829> play<00:01:23.950> a<00:01:23.979> lot<00:01:24.100> of<00:01:24.220> different

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
because we play a lot of different

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.710 
because we play a lot of different
things<00:01:24.700> in<00:01:24.850> blue<00:01:24.970> side<00:01:25.180> and<00:01:25.360> we<00:01:25.420> can<00:01:25.540> first

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
things in blue side and we can first

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.660 
things in blue side and we can first
pick<00:01:25.900> a<00:01:25.930> lot<00:01:26.140> of<00:01:26.259> very<00:01:26.680> strong<00:01:26.890> champions<00:01:27.490> so

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
pick a lot of very strong champions so

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.149 
pick a lot of very strong champions so
we<00:01:28.119> still<00:01:28.299> had<00:01:28.420> a<00:01:28.450> good<00:01:28.630> feeling<00:01:28.750> about<00:01:28.930> it

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
we still had a good feeling about it

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.679 
we still had a good feeling about it
what<00:01:30.159> did<00:01:30.490> you<00:01:30.520> say<00:01:30.790> to<00:01:30.820> each<00:01:31.000> other<00:01:31.180> after<00:01:31.570> the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
and so we've also been scouting them for

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.880 
and so we've also been scouting them for
a<00:02:01.780> long<00:02:01.930> time<00:02:02.170> and<00:02:02.200> we've<00:02:02.530> had<00:02:02.649> a<00:02:02.710> lot<00:02:02.829> of

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
a long time and we've had a lot of

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.310 
a long time and we've had a lot of
information<00:02:03.460> on<00:02:03.520> their<00:02:03.670> pics<00:02:04.170> that's<00:02:05.170> why

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
information on their pics that's why

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.020 
information on their pics that's why
maybe<00:02:05.560> it<00:02:05.740> was<00:02:05.829> a<00:02:05.860> bit<00:02:06.219> of<00:02:06.310> a<00:02:06.399> surprise<00:02:06.490> why<00:02:06.880> we

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
maybe it was a bit of a surprise why we

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.760 
maybe it was a bit of a surprise why we
bent<00:02:07.210> katarina<00:02:07.689> and<00:02:07.899> even<00:02:08.410> though<00:02:08.500> love

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
bent katarina and even though love

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.220 
bent katarina and even though love
perhaps<00:02:08.979> but<00:02:09.910> that<00:02:09.940> was<00:02:10.270> some<00:02:10.810> of<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:10.990> Intel

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
perhaps but that was some of the Intel

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.130 
perhaps but that was some of the Intel
we<00:02:11.260> had<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:11.770> couldn't<00:02:12.370> let<00:02:12.460> him<00:02:12.550> have<00:02:12.820> it<00:02:13.140> was

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
we had and couldn't let him have it was

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.510 
we had and couldn't let him have it was
there<00:02:14.290> any<00:02:14.500> additional<00:02:14.890> pressure<00:02:15.160> on<00:02:15.280> you

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
there any additional pressure on you

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.730 
there any additional pressure on you
because<00:02:15.940> you<00:02:16.060> are<00:02:16.180> definitely<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:17.050> heavy

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
because you are definitely the heavy

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.180 
because you are definitely the heavy
favorites<00:02:18.630> yeah<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:19.660> think<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.470> lot<00:02:20.830> of<00:02:20.860> times

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
favorites yeah I think so a lot of times

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.589 
favorites yeah I think so a lot of times
the<00:02:21.400> LCS<00:02:21.760> teams<00:02:21.970> are<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.209> ones<00:02:22.360> that<00:02:22.450> are

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
the LCS teams are the ones that are

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:23.850 
the LCS teams are the ones that are
considered<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:23.050> have<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.230> pressure<00:02:23.440> because

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
considered to have the pressure because

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.960 
considered to have the pressure because
they<00:02:23.980> are<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.160> one<00:02:24.280> that<00:02:24.310> have<00:02:24.550> everything<00:02:24.879> to

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
they are the one that have everything to

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:25.470 
they are the one that have everything to
lose

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
lose

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.420 
lose
but<00:02:25.750> in<00:02:25.840> our<00:02:25.989> in<00:02:26.349> our<00:02:26.709> position<00:02:27.099> I<00:02:27.159> think<00:02:27.340> we

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
but in our in our position I think we

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
but in our in our position I think we
were<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.700> ones<00:02:27.849> with<00:02:28.000> everything<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.390> lose

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
were the ones with everything to lose

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.350 
were the ones with everything to lose
because<00:02:28.659> we<00:02:28.930> were<00:02:29.080> supposed<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.590> win<00:02:29.709> this<00:02:29.890> we

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
because we were supposed to win this we

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.360 
because we were supposed to win this we
we<00:02:31.360> were<00:02:31.510> such<00:02:31.720> heavy<00:02:31.930> favorites<00:02:32.379> that<00:02:32.560> losing
