00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 I often have a neckerchief in my hand 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.670
 and I do not know how to wear it 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.160
 I have a little bit for you 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.050
 inform and say five today 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.469
 Variants how to wear a neckerchief 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.469
 can 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.180
 hello my love welcome back to 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.670
 a new video and today it should be around 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.720
 five variants how to be neckerchief 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.470
 can carry 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.710
 is not it you too that you yes 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.780
 So I often reach for the qual 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.090
 you just have to wrap around it and that 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.010
 That's it, but I still have it 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.530
 never really busy as you 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.699
 neckerchief in different ways and 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.339
 wisely wear 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.290
 Now I have my mom 1 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:47.460
 and then I got with 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.379
 the topic a bit apart 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:56.879
 set and I want you now the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:01:00.739
 five variants show what the have 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.739
 what I already mentioned and 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:09.810
 I am someone I like so neckerchiefs 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:19.800
 like that and therefore we would actually have 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:22.320
 even variant 1 variant 2 goes 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.409
 actually similar to variant one 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.710
 go in half your neckerchief lays 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:34.579
 around your neck and go now and 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.579
 this turns over and over again 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.310
 and you can play this game for so long 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.590
 do as it is 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.130
 the longer a shell of course the more 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.520
 better called braided scarf 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.520
 variant 2 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.090
 Variant 3 requires a loop 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.659
 scarves and of course a neckerchief on 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.340
 best the colors match 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.979
 possibilities best together now 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.539
 Sting is a bit but it does 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.239
 is actually only the variant 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:12.190
 I want to show you your praise 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:16.610
 scarf around the neck puts her and you 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:21.340
 the neckerchief around the resin and now 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:25.190
 wrap her neckerchief around the local 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.239
 so far down below and down 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.239
 a point 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:42.780
 and now you can go here and you 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:46.440
 put this combination around your neck 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.440
 Variant number three 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.770
 So now I cut my head 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.740
 Bit off because you have to see it here 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.080
 in the variant now actually has 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.000
 not much to do with a neckerchief 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.770
 but I 'm off my book now 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:12.170
 a vest that I feel really comfortable 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.170
 So you halve your heart book down 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:29.100
 and do a little knot like that 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:35.850
 close up as possible that they are here 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:39.000
 So what have you got here now and have 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:48.050
 you two loops now and these two 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:48.050
 loops act as erna for you 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:04:02.370
 Yes 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:04.050
 and you have a first should of course 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.600
 not necessarily worn with a sweater 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.100
 it'll just be a bit too 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.210
 narrow but I find the variant 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.210
 actually really cool 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:22.670
 in the variant now you get 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:27.090
 for possibilities quite long scarf 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:35.880
 loses this shell and makes you 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:41.090
 knot in so you put the knot in 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:45.740
 neck and go and do it here 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:49.260
 So relax loosen up the knot 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:52.070
 the one side you can the one gate 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.070
 plug in 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:05:06.320
 the other the other and that makes 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:11.220
 really really nice and warm here 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:13.350
 Variation 5 you know even more variants 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.930
 how to tie neckerchiefs 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.690
 write normally in the comments or 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:22.110
 do not often know various youtube video 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.840
 So I filmed the variation where you can 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:28.140
 The neckerchief as a west can really on 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:31.080
 All the coolest just has a pass that is 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.120
 not quite so yes if he has a video 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.669

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.490

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:41.580
 I slip on the side again 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.010

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.780
 eyeshadow my dearest in the moment can 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.710
 I really like to say that I really like to wear them 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:52.169
 Today I do not wear it for once 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.760
 below I steer you my tv in 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.250

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.650
