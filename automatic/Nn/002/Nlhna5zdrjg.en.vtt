bringing<00:00:43.260> up<00:00:43.500> north<00:00:43.829> rune<00:00:44.070> right<00:00:44.309> now<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
bringing up north rune right now the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.209 
bringing up north rune right now the
starting<00:00:45.420> area<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:46.050> just<00:00:46.320> call<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.739> tundra

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
starting area I just call it the tundra

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.049 
starting area I just call it the tundra
and<00:00:47.629> the<00:00:48.629> tundra<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.579> one<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.789> two

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
and the tundra is one of the two

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.600 
and the tundra is one of the two
starting<00:00:51.570> areas<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.260> Alliance<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
starting areas for Alliance and the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.880 
starting areas for Alliance and the
reason<00:00:53.910> why<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.059> suggest<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.230> tundra<00:00:55.680> is

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
reason why I suggest the tundra is

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.119 
reason why I suggest the tundra is
because<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.520> initial<00:00:56.760> class<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:58.559> two<00:00:58.770> quest

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
because the initial class the two quest

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.520 
because the initial class the two quest
lines<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.579> you're<00:00:59.760> gonna<00:00:59.850> do<00:01:00.149> first<00:01:00.690> off<00:01:00.960> you
