00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.640 
people were labeling the order 1886 two
gears<00:01:12.900> killer<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.350> there's<00:01:13.470> some

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
gears killer and there's some

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.289 
gears killer and there's some
similarities<00:01:14.280> both<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.090> them<00:01:15.180> are

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
similarities both of them are

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.719 
similarities both of them are
third-person<00:01:15.689> cover<00:01:16.080> based<00:01:16.320> shooters<00:01:16.770> they

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
third-person cover based shooters they

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.249 
third-person cover based shooters they
both<00:01:17.970> had<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.299> same<00:01:18.330> kind<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:19.140> know

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
both had the same kind of you know

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.770 
both had the same kind of you know
movement<00:01:20.040> with<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.610> d-pad<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.390> use<00:01:21.600> your

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
movement with the d-pad that use your

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.310 
movement with the d-pad that use your
weapons<00:01:22.170> or<00:01:22.409> smoke<00:01:22.710> grenades<00:01:23.070> or<00:01:23.250> whatever

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
weapons or smoke grenades or whatever

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.990 
weapons or smoke grenades or whatever
but<00:01:25.320> obviously<00:01:25.799> Gears<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.369> War<00:01:26.460> was<00:01:26.759> last

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
but obviously Gears of War was last

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.300 
but obviously Gears of War was last
generation<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.840> order<00:01:28.320> 1886<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:29.189> this

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
generation and order 1886 is this

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.130 
generation and order 1886 is this
generation<00:01:29.670> it'd<00:01:30.270> be<00:01:30.390> foolish<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.780> compare

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
generation it'd be foolish to compare

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.010 
generation it'd be foolish to compare
graphics<00:01:31.770> because<00:01:32.009> obviously<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:33.119> ps4<00:01:33.450> with

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
graphics because obviously the ps4 with

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.560 
graphics because obviously the ps4 with
you<00:01:34.259> know<00:01:34.380> eight<00:01:34.619> gigs<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.220> memory<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.390> gonna

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
you know eight gigs of memory is gonna

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.830 
you know eight gigs of memory is gonna
have<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:37.170> graphical<00:01:38.040> edge<00:01:38.310> being<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.270> generation

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
have a graphical edge being a generation

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.410 
have a graphical edge being a generation
above<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.409> Xbox<00:01:40.890> 360<00:01:41.369> which<00:01:41.490> had<00:01:41.670> 512<00:01:42.210> mega

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420

above the Xbox 360 which had 512 mega
bit<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:43.259> memory<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.610> we're<00:01:45.149> not<00:01:45.210> really<00:01:45.329> going

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
bit of memory so we're not really going

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.420 
bit of memory so we're not really going
to<00:01:45.600> compare<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.020> graphics<00:01:46.439> but<00:01:46.680> what<00:01:47.189> we<00:01:47.280> can

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
to compare the graphics but what we can

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.700 
to compare the graphics but what we can
do<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.700> say<00:01:47.880> see<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.509> Gears<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.960> War<00:01:49.079> still

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
do is say see that Gears of War still

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.679 
do is say see that Gears of War still
looks<00:01:49.920> great<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.430> went<00:01:50.939> back<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.299> capture<00:01:51.479> some

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
looks great I went back and capture some

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.749 
looks great I went back and capture some
footage<00:01:52.110> from<00:01:52.290> all<00:01:52.500> four<00:01:52.890> gears<00:01:53.130> games

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
footage from all four gears games

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.850 
footage from all four gears games
it<00:01:54.060> looks<00:01:54.299> fantastic<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.020> characters<00:01:55.590> moved

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
it looks fantastic the characters moved
