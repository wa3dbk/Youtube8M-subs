put<00:04:33.560> more<00:04:33.770> in<00:04:33.980> I<00:04:35.080> change<00:04:36.080> these<00:04:36.290> up<00:04:36.560> all<00:04:36.800> the

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
put more in I change these up all the

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.670 
put more in I change these up all the
time<00:04:38.620> we're<00:04:39.620> gonna<00:04:39.680> wipe<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.370> rim<00:04:40.580> of<00:04:40.610> this

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
time we're gonna wipe the rim of this

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.080 
time we're gonna wipe the rim of this
jar<00:04:42.680> and<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:42.919> pickles<00:04:43.250> are<00:04:43.370> kind<00:04:43.580> of<00:04:43.640> floating

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
jar and the pickles are kind of floating

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.780 
jar and the pickles are kind of floating
right<00:04:44.300> this<00:04:44.510> second<00:04:44.990> but<00:04:45.520> that's<00:04:46.520> because

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
right this second but that's because

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.330 
right this second but that's because
they<00:04:47.150> have<00:04:47.360> air<00:04:47.720> in<00:04:48.020> them<00:04:48.229> so<00:04:48.740> we'll<00:04:48.919> get<00:04:49.010> a<00:04:49.070> hot

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
they have air in them so we'll get a hot

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:58.000 
they have air in them so we'll get a hot
lid<00:04:50.150> and<00:04:52.030> ring<00:04:54.160> on<00:04:55.160> finger<00:04:55.700> tight<00:04:56.590> which<00:04:57.590> is

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
lid and ring on finger tight which is

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.430 
lid and ring on finger tight which is
you<00:04:58.460> know<00:04:58.580> go<00:04:59.240> a<00:04:59.270> little<00:04:59.450> bit<00:04:59.660> past<00:04:59.900> the<00:05:00.110> first

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
you know go a little bit past the first

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.680 
you know go a little bit past the first
resistance<00:05:01.040> now<00:05:01.880> we're<00:05:02.030> gonna<00:05:02.120> set<00:05:02.419> this<00:05:02.510> in

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
resistance now we're gonna set this in

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.140 
resistance now we're gonna set this in
