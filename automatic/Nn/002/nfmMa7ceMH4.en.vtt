 Cook give salt and the desired 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.599

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.070
 heat on about half 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.530
 That will take a few minutes and then go 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.100
 with the mascarpone to stir this 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.910
 a little bit and let it melt 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.410
 then we give the rest 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.760
 mustard two tablespoons of lemon juice and 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.850

 simmer briefly and then from the stove 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.560
 to take 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.720
 The steaks we have based long enough 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.600
 and now with one as possible 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.310
 sharp knife against the fiber in about 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.090
 half a centimeter wide strip 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.090
 sliced 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:44.930
 be particularly long strip 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:48.039
 then still shared quickly 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.039
 to rub some more of the cheese 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.510
 and then the finished cooked off 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.700
 Poured tagliatelle in a bowl 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.410
 where he possibly to the 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.360
 sauce to dilute one more 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.940
 noodle water could catch something 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:07.070
 So now the sauce over the pasta and 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:10.370
 mix both together now 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:14.870
 steak strips and add the roughness 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:16.850
 and just fold in and finish 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.860
 is this delicious pasta dish times 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.300
 honestly web to noodles to begrudge 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.340
 really not all days 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.530
 but we also have a special one 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.660
 who I like the world's day 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.460
 really exorbitant and is the day of honor 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.590
 adequate and thereby is the preparation 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.370
 you see, it does not start at all 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.840
 complicated 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.740
 I wish you a lot of fun with it and 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.360

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.000
 videos into it 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:57.360

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.820
 beauty dynamite has become the world men's day 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.430
 an interesting fact for the 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.000
 Embarrassing variant cooked unconditionally 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.310
 look at 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.960
