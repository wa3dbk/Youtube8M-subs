00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
hi there so a friend of mine asked about

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.579 
hi there so a friend of mine asked about
class<00:00:05.009> and<00:00:05.819> how<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.089> produce<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.779> sort<00:00:07.529> of

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
class and how to produce a sort of

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.780 
class and how to produce a sort of
glassy<00:00:08.189> effect<00:00:09.889> which<00:00:10.889> also<00:00:11.160> looks<00:00:11.490> as<00:00:11.700> if

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
glassy effect which also looks as if

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.250 
glassy effect which also looks as if
it's<00:00:12.030> refracting<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.870> light<00:00:14.059> so<00:00:15.059> I'm<00:00:15.420> going

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
it's refracting the light so I'm going

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.470 
it's refracting the light so I'm going
to<00:00:16.289> do<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.470> quick<00:00:16.680> tutorial<00:00:16.920> here<00:00:17.460> now<00:00:17.789> the

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
to do a quick tutorial here now the

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.050 
to do a quick tutorial here now the
layer<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.289> layer<00:00:19.949> style<00:00:20.279> even<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.970> i

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
layer that I the layer style even that i

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.800 
layer that I the layer style even that i
use<00:00:21.420> for<00:00:21.689> my<00:00:21.869> glass<00:00:22.560> layer<00:00:22.970> is<00:00:23.970> quite<00:00:24.300> complex

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
use for my glass layer is quite complex

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.019 
use for my glass layer is quite complex
as<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> lot<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.410> different<00:00:25.740> settings<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:26.640> it

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
as a lot of different settings so it

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.300 
as a lot of different settings so it
would<00:00:27.359> be<00:00:27.510> take<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.470> bit<00:00:28.650> too<00:00:28.800> long<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.189> go

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
would be take a bit too long to go

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.089 
would be take a bit too long to go
through<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:29.640> here<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.349> instead<00:00:31.349> when<00:00:31.980> you

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
through on here so instead when you

through on here so instead when you
download<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:32.969> video<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.660> should<00:00:33.750> find

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
make a new layer here if you want to

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.990 
make a new layer here if you want to
import<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.379> layer<00:00:52.590> style<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.430> go<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.640> layer

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
import a layer style you go to layer

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.779 
import a layer style you go to layer
down<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.170> layer<00:00:55.350> style<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.070> blending<00:00:56.430> options

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
down to layer style and blending options

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.439 
down to layer style and blending options
and<00:00:57.180> then<00:00:58.070> click<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.190> Stiles<00:00:59.760> go<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.270> top

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
now I'm going to take a rounded

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.300 
now I'm going to take a rounded
rectangle<00:01:15.270> I'm<00:01:15.540> going<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:15.990> draw<00:01:16.200> here<00:01:16.530> it's

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
rectangle I'm going to draw here it's

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.230 
rectangle I'm going to draw here it's
also<00:01:17.670> important<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.210> make<00:01:18.390> sure<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:18.810> white

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
also important to make sure it's white

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
apply the layer style to it so i'll go

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.990 
apply the layer style to it so i'll go
down<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.979> layer<00:01:26.159> style<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.790> one<00:01:27.000> options

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
down to the layer style and one options

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.800 
down to the layer style and one options
styles<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.390> then<00:01:30.540> onto<00:01:31.909> glass<00:01:32.909> which<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.689> this

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
styles and then onto glass which is this

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.289 
styles and then onto glass which is this
one<00:01:34.020> here<00:01:34.850> yep<00:01:35.850> there<00:01:36.180> we<00:01:36.270> go<00:01:37.549> okay<00:01:38.549> right<00:01:39.270> so

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
one here yep there we go okay right so

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.740 
one here yep there we go okay right so
there's<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.720> glass<00:01:40.020> layer

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
there's a glass layer

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.450 
there's a glass layer
just<00:01:42.750> click<00:01:42.930> off<00:01:43.080> that<00:01:43.110> yep<00:01:43.800> so<00:01:44.040> their<00:01:44.220> list

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
just click off that yep so their list

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.160 
just click off that yep so their list
now<00:01:45.420> as<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.620> is<00:01:47.870> you<00:01:48.870> know<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.110> not

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
now as it is you know it's not

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.080 
now as it is you know it's not
reflecting<00:01:49.830> refracting<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.550> the<00:01:50.610> light<00:01:50.790> still

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
reflecting refracting in the light still

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.290 
reflecting refracting in the light still
so<00:01:51.420> we'll<00:01:52.080> change<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.470> by<00:01:52.970> pressing<00:01:53.970> the

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
so we'll change that by pressing the

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.730 
so we'll change that by pressing the
ctrl<00:01:54.930> key<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.530> then<00:01:56.430> clicking<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.740> shape

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
ctrl key and then clicking on shape

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.270 
ctrl key and then clicking on shape
layer<00:01:59.040> now<00:01:59.640> on<00:01:59.880> windows<00:02:00.300> I<00:02:00.630> believe<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.830> key

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
layer now on windows I believe the key

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.790 
layer now on windows I believe the key
is<00:02:02.490> control<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.750> may<00:02:03.960> be<00:02:03.990> held<00:02:04.440> I'm

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
is control but it may be held I'm

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.540 
is control but it may be held I'm
nonsense<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:07.010> but<00:02:08.010> it<00:02:08.130> should<00:02:08.280> be<00:02:08.369> one<00:02:08.490> of

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
nonsense so but it should be one of

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.450 
nonsense so but it should be one of
those<00:02:09.270> two<00:02:09.570> keys<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.680> what<00:02:10.979> we've<00:02:11.160> got<00:02:11.190> that

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
those two keys so what we've got that

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.610 
those two keys so what we've got that
selected<00:02:12.030> we<00:02:12.480> can<00:02:12.510> just<00:02:12.780> go<00:02:12.960> down<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.590> our

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
selected we can just go down to our

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.320 
selected we can just go down to our
background<00:02:14.190> go<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.240> filter<00:02:15.600> blur<00:02:16.140> and

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
background go to filter blur and

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.320 
background go to filter blur and
Gaussian<00:02:18.330> blur<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:20.840> in<00:02:22.130> this<00:02:23.130> case<00:02:23.400> I've<00:02:24.120> got

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
Gaussian blur and in this case I've got

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.780 
Gaussian blur and in this case I've got
four<00:02:24.570> pixels<00:02:25.020> then<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:26.010> might<00:02:26.190> increase<00:02:26.460> that<00:02:26.730> a

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
four pixels then I might increase that a

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.770 
four pixels then I might increase that a
little<00:02:27.000> bit<00:02:28.280> right<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:29.640> there<00:02:30.240> we<00:02:30.360> go<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:30.750> now

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
little bit right so there we go so now

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.960 
little bit right so there we go so now
as<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.170> can<00:02:31.260> see<00:02:31.320> it<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:31.830> luring<00:02:32.520> in<00:02:32.790> the

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
as you can see it so luring in the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.510 
as you can see it so luring in the
background<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.990> then<00:02:34.530> we'll<00:02:34.680> just<00:02:34.860> deselect

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
background and then we'll just deselect

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.580 
background and then we'll just deselect
that<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:37.340> there<00:02:38.340> we've<00:02:38.550> got<00:02:38.730> some<00:02:38.910> glass<00:02:39.590> I

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
that and there we've got some glass I

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.490 
that and there we've got some glass I
probably<00:02:41.460> couldn't<00:02:41.970> bit<00:02:42.750> more<00:02:42.930> work<00:02:43.110> on<00:02:43.290> this

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
probably couldn't bit more work on this

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.050 
probably couldn't bit more work on this
one's<00:02:43.770> it<00:02:44.010> suddenly<00:02:44.370> have<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.730> play<00:02:44.940> around

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
one's it suddenly have to play around

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.380 
one's it suddenly have to play around
with<00:02:45.450> get<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.750> truly<00:02:46.350> realistic<00:02:46.709> effect<00:02:47.390> but

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
with get a truly realistic effect but

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.410 
with get a truly realistic effect but
that's<00:02:48.570> just<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.840> quick<00:02:48.959> way<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.260> doing<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.620> and

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
that's just a quick way of doing it and

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.610 
that's just a quick way of doing it and
having<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.510> layer<00:02:51.690> style<00:02:52.020> for<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.350> glass

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
having the layer style for the glass

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.150 
having the layer style for the glass
certainly<00:02:53.220> makes<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.520> very<00:02:53.670> quick<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.120> do<00:02:54.270> I

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
certainly makes it very quick to do I

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.550 
certainly makes it very quick to do I
