00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
want to head over here and other guys

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.350 
want to head over here and other guys
didn't<00:01:10.950> show<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.159> what<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.610> exactly<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.240> do

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
didn't show you what to exactly to do

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.760 
didn't show you what to exactly to do
side<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.720> come<00:01:12.840> over<00:01:12.990> here<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.260> figure<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.619> out

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
side to come over here and figure it out

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.160 
side to come over here and figure it out
myself<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.360> there's<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.450> colfer<00:01:15.780> here<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.080> have

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
myself so there's a colfer here you have

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.749 
myself so there's a colfer here you have
to<00:01:16.259> fill<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.650> up<00:01:16.710> because<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.189> costs<00:01:17.460> money<00:01:17.610> to

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
to fill it up because it costs money to

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.760 
to fill it up because it costs money to
into<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> game<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.570> started<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.439> with<00:01:19.560> like

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
into the game I started this with like

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.590 
into the game I started this with like
200,000<00:01:20.430> three<00:01:20.580> days<00:01:20.729> ago<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.299> don't<00:01:21.479> need

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
200,000 three days ago you don't need

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.630 
200,000 three days ago you don't need
much<00:01:21.780> equal<00:01:22.350> filled<00:01:22.560> with<00:01:22.830> 200,000<00:01:23.369> as<00:01:23.460> well

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
much equal filled with 200,000 as well

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.609 
much equal filled with 200,000 as well
you<00:01:24.270> could<00:01:24.420> develop<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.810> bunch<00:01:25.049> thousand<00:01:25.470> you

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
you could develop a bunch thousand you

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.760 
you could develop a bunch thousand you
want<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:26.509> so<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.570> course<00:01:27.689> like<00:01:27.869> around<00:01:28.049> 4000

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
want to so of course like around 4000

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.789 
want to so of course like around 4000
per<00:01:28.920> game<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.220> four<00:01:29.579> thousand<00:01:29.909> for<00:01:30.030> six<00:01:30.240> hours

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
per game so four thousand for six hours

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.440 
per game so four thousand for six hours
so<00:01:31.799> essentially<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.460> also<00:01:32.579> see<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> reward

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
so essentially you also see a reward

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.130 
so essentially you also see a reward
chess<00:01:33.689> over<00:01:33.960> here<00:01:35.000> this<00:01:36.000> rewards<00:01:36.450> chess<00:01:36.750> you

those five quest on if you only have the
five<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:17.970> have<00:03:18.120> those<00:03:18.300> five<00:03:18.480> quest<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.020> then

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
five to have those five quest and then

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.120 
five to have those five quest and then
essentially<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:20.430> cut<00:03:20.640> down<00:03:20.760> your<00:03:20.820> cost<00:03:21.180> by

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
essentially you cut down your cost by

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.830 
essentially you cut down your cost by

math 80,000 GP per day which is

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.330 
math 80,000 GP per day which is
significant<00:03:27.630> enough<00:03:27.690> for<00:03:28.020> me<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.320> only<00:03:29.040> wants

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
you've done way more quest then you

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.410 
you've done way more quest then you
could<00:03:34.350> just<00:03:34.380> use<00:03:34.590> one<00:03:34.770> of<00:03:34.800> these<00:03:34.920> hosts

343 is a better world than 330 because

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.950 
343 is a better world than 330 because
it's<00:03:53.010> not<00:03:53.220> bots<00:03:53.520> that<00:03:53.790> are<00:03:54.000> hosting<00:03:54.600> but<00:03:54.810> it's

on wall 330 in populated worlds and that

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.500 
on wall 330 in populated worlds and that
is<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.220> reason<00:04:05.550> I<00:04:05.640> believe<00:04:05.790> this<00:04:06.000> clan<00:04:06.330> has

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
is a reason I believe this clan has

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.170 
is a reason I believe this clan has
opened<00:04:06.980> so<00:04:07.980> what<00:04:08.490> he<00:04:08.610> will<00:04:08.730> do<00:04:08.850> is<00:04:09.030> basically

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
opened so what he will do is basically

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.790 
opened so what he will do is basically
put<00:04:09.660> me<00:04:09.990> in<00:04:10.080> the<00:04:10.140> dream<00:04:10.380> make<00:04:10.590> sure<00:04:10.680> your

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
colfur has money in it

trust me only get by two sides of me and
the<00:04:37.710> beginning<00:04:38.039> you<00:04:38.160> may<00:04:38.340> get<00:04:38.550> hit<00:04:38.699> by<00:04:38.820> three

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
the beginning you may get hit by three

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.939 
the beginning you may get hit by three

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
hit by two sides at the end and your

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.279 
hit by two sides at the end and your
textile<00:04:43.410> wants<00:04:43.680> to<00:04:43.740> be<00:04:43.860> lunge<00:04:44.280> i<00:04:45.050> this<00:04:46.050> is<00:04:46.169> my

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
textile wants to be lunge i this is my

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.469 
textile wants to be lunge i this is my
personal<00:04:46.590> theory<00:04:46.949> I<00:04:47.070> believe<00:04:47.370> but<00:04:47.639> I<00:04:47.970> believe

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
personal theory I believe but I believe

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.890 
personal theory I believe but I believe
a<00:04:48.509> textiles<00:04:49.289> still<00:04:49.650> have<00:04:50.160> preference<00:04:50.900> so

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
a textiles still have preference so

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.249 
a textiles still have preference so
lunge<00:04:52.500> it<00:04:52.650> would<00:04:52.740> be<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:53.009> most<00:04:53.190> accurate

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:54.259 
lunge it would be the most accurate

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.560 
lunge it would be the most accurate
because<00:04:55.259> it's<00:04:55.410> in<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.620> attack<00:04:55.889> slot<00:04:56.220> and

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
because it's in the attack slot and

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.600 
because it's in the attack slot and
strength<00:04:57.570> over<00:04:57.810> here<00:04:57.930> because<00:04:58.289> if<00:04:58.830> you<00:04:59.250> get<00:04:59.550> a

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
strength over here because if you get a

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.090 
strength over here because if you get a
bad<00:04:59.910> if<00:05:00.360> you<00:05:00.690> get<00:05:00.840> a<00:05:00.900> bad<00:05:01.350> number<00:05:01.650> basically

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
bad if you get a bad number basically

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.560 
bad if you get a bad number basically
generated<00:05:04.430> and<00:05:05.430> you<00:05:05.729> can't<00:05:06.000> heal<00:05:06.270> enough

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
generated and you can't heal enough

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.870 
generated and you can't heal enough
you'll<00:05:06.960> basically<00:05:07.169> die<00:05:07.650> that<00:05:08.520> is<00:05:08.550> in<00:05:08.789> the

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
you'll basically die that is in the

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.790 
you'll basically die that is in the
beginning<00:05:09.030> phases<00:05:09.930> if<00:05:10.289> you<00:05:10.380> get<00:05:10.500> a<00:05:10.530> bad

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
beginning phases if you get a bad

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.860 
beginning phases if you get a bad
healing<00:05:11.310> range<00:05:11.550> number<00:05:11.789> yeah<00:05:12.330> bad<00:05:12.539> luck<00:05:12.570> in

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
healing range number yeah bad luck in

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.120 
healing range number yeah bad luck in
and<00:05:13.020> keep<00:05:13.139> on<00:05:13.260> hitting<00:05:13.470> zeros<00:05:13.770> or<00:05:13.919> you're<00:05:14.039> not

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
and keep on hitting zeros or you're not

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.670 
and keep on hitting zeros or you're not
hitting<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:14.520> healing<00:05:14.970> from<00:05:15.150> the<00:05:15.270> coffins

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
hitting the healing from the coffins

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.129 
hitting the healing from the coffins
then<00:05:16.680> essentially<00:05:17.340> your<00:05:18.060> gate<00:05:18.360> essentially

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
then essentially your gate essentially

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:20.900 
then essentially your gate essentially
died<00:05:19.289> early<00:05:19.740> pretty<00:05:20.160> mature<00:05:20.310> of<00:05:20.550> your<00:05:20.699> six

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
died early pretty mature of your six

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.140 
died early pretty mature of your six
hours<00:05:21.260> so<00:05:22.260> you<00:05:22.349> want<00:05:22.500> to<00:05:22.590> wait<00:05:22.680> six<00:05:22.860> hours<00:05:23.150> from

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
hours so you want to wait six hours from

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.610 
hours so you want to wait six hours from

anything for six hours and essentially

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.990

which<00:05:34.650> is<00:05:34.830> essentially<00:05:36.139> awesome<00:05:37.139> because

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
which is essentially awesome because

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:39.439 
which is essentially awesome because
it's<00:05:37.560> divided<00:05:37.830> amongst<00:05:38.639> attack<00:05:38.940> strength<00:05:39.270> the

it's divided amongst attack strength the
defense<00:05:39.720> and<00:05:39.870> hip<00:05:39.990> points<00:05:40.320> should<00:05:41.250> roughly

defense and hip points should roughly

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.240 
defense and hip points should roughly
