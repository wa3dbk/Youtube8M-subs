00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
coaching is getting that but we got a

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.120 
coaching is getting that but we got a
good<00:02:00.340> group<00:02:00.460> of<00:02:00.610> kids<00:02:00.670> it's<00:02:01.030> just

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
good group of kids it's just

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.410 
good group of kids it's just
unfortunately<00:02:03.130> it's<00:02:03.550> hard<00:02:03.820> to<00:02:03.910> speed<00:02:04.180> up<00:02:04.300> the

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
unfortunately it's hard to speed up the

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.260 
unfortunately it's hard to speed up the
process<00:02:04.570> of<00:02:05.140> maturation<00:02:05.770> sometimes<00:02:06.729> in<00:02:07.060> and

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
process of maturation sometimes in and

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.779 
process of maturation sometimes in and
even<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.110> upperclassmen<00:02:08.830> I<00:02:08.920> think<00:02:09.160> they<00:02:09.759> have

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
even the upperclassmen I think they have

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.430 
even the upperclassmen I think they have
a<00:02:09.880> tendency<00:02:10.119> to<00:02:10.479> get<00:02:11.050> down<00:02:11.230> themselves

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
a tendency to get down themselves

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.400 
a tendency to get down themselves
because<00:02:11.800> they've<00:02:11.920> been<00:02:11.950> beaten<00:02:12.340> down<00:02:12.370> in<00:02:13.410> when

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
because they've been beaten down in when

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.960 
because they've been beaten down in when
you're<00:02:14.590> as<00:02:15.070> poor<00:02:15.370> as<00:02:15.459> we<00:02:15.580> will<00:02:15.730> pour

but like we still got more work to do we
don't<00:03:41.299> have<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:41.480> game<00:03:41.629> tomorrow<00:03:41.810> so<00:03:42.110> we<00:03:42.170> just

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.199 
don't have a game tomorrow so we just
need<00:03:42.409> to<00:03:42.500> get<00:03:42.560> better<00:03:42.739> every<00:03:42.950> day<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.879> offense
