00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.350
 today a mario player on 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.350
 minecraft it's gone 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.740
 first once a bug command for 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.680
 to have it is simple you already have 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:29.330
 on entry you do this loose guy and 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:32.029
 your nickname zheng tv after how no 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.050
 it's not that it's minecraft two points 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:38.210
 reduced ti commands and and blocks 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.520
 this is done enter and you receive your 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.950
 block command after you look for a 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.560
 lever or whatever 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.780
 a network block here we are so you 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.829
 should also copied there how will that be 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.060
 in the description the video finally there 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.250
 will have a link that will send you 20 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.950
 sites and after you will have to copy everything 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.570
 there how are you so clicks 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.640
 right for the break and you put 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.200
 arrived next and makes you right click 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.059
 on the blog command you do ctrl v 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.059
 when you copied the command to 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.219
 cenon hurun â€‹â€‹that will be displayed here are you 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.409
 call on finish and that's normal 

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:12.200
 hold a small lake because very very 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.420
 long you activate the lever you 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.520
 leave because it may explode no 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.990
 I'm kidding so here's a whole 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.020
 machine that will be created here it is 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.500
 this is the panel we are fighting 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.010
 steaks 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.869
 we're just going to use this panel done 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.049
 right click on it and you will receive 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.270
 all full of 10 different themes 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.320
 so I present to you and where these items this 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.680
 that they can do what they can do 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:40.100
 that's all so it's gone 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.200
 the vstart is to start the level 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.970
 so does it make it right or wanted 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.470
 start the level so when you 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.150
 go through this line down the 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.090
 level it will start and you will have a 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.590
 steam of 2.2 mario is finally here then 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.650
 after what we flag this is 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.310
 at the very end you have to put it 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.790
 this is actually the flag 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.180
 hyper known to the two sets of hunger 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.600
 mario 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.760
 so these bricks ca the bricks that 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.870
 will actually break this case this is 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.140
 when you 're going to jump like that to 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.070
 watch 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.020
 ok me it does not work since lift it 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.240
 has not started yet so here you 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.310
 do something like that 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.700
 so here I like to be a place that 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.120
 blocked 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.800
 here too and in the middle also here is 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.160
 that's what it is sic ans inzaghi who 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.530
 blocked 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.750
 this is a place that bug that will you 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.459
 give count of then coins 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.570
 of gold actually it's going to give you actually 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.380
 gold nuggets that's ugly room 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.820
 it will give you 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:42.580
 I do not remember anymore I think it's ok ah 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.250
 yes that or give you 1 1 spell of 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.900
 mushrooms that will make you grow 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.970
 finally in the real game but there you 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.950
 do not grow up but you're going to have 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.890
 more heart finally here we will see that 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.340
 after that then what is it 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.610
 in use 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.030
 ok we'll just put here unknown him 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.690
 who blogs 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.510
 this is guba how is guba 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.000
 sweatshirt direction that's actually going you 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.190
 allow direction and its stuff 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.140
 chelous who is running 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.700
 the little things strand the kiki who 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.980
 was moving when we jump on mood and 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.420
 if we do not jump kill continuously torah 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.500
 after we are leading 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:23.110
 so here you just put it in 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.120
 underneath finally unblocks just below 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.450
 of your course 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.640
 we're just going to land here and 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.670
 we just want it going up there the 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.060
 what is actually called goumba 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:40.810
 like this here so we go there are two 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.790
 kinds I do not know I did not understand in 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.680
 makes the difference since the guy who 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.879
 share the americans brad i have not too much 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.690
 understood what he said since I 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.760
 American pope 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.530
 so here you go right click here 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.030
 and so that's going to go 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.220
 returns that's all at all 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.160
 so here you can test both 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.470
 I do not know eight banks 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.450
 ok so that's what it is when 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.190
 heinze and for small parts 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.019
 here we are going to put one there 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.030
 it is super well done texture in all 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.730
 case I have to the guy who the crisis all is 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.440
 how do you know it's a pgm the guy who 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.709
 created it we'll also put stuff 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:19.810
 here it is then we all used 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:22.930
 now we will test the trick here 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.470
 then we pass the green line tac will have 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.830
 a small lake 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:30.099
 it's normal because yeah time 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.560
 that hans mario ponant a little bit so 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:34.539
 we jump already higher we have a head of 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.979
 Mario can not remove look 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.340
 yes submitting you sure he will of course 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.990
 on evans ok ah but it's normal that we 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.190
 could not remove it because before 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.849
 that I did my such meaning I was 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.710
 in creative 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:46.690
 so here you can you can 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.990
 remove it actually no you can not 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.490
 remove 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.160
 that's what I said 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.849
 so you already want a lot more 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.080
 high we try that's it then it breaks 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:57.430
 not empty 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.840
 yes it's true it's actually when you 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.020
 receive the mushroom that you could 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.270
 to stop these blocks 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:08.440
 here it is you receive a code of the nugget 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:12.070
 of gold that there you get a name he fights 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.470
 there ok I admit I was a little cheated 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.500
 but it was to show that now 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.250
 watch on cazaubon 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.710
 it is too stylish finally here it is too much 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:26.460
 stylish does it work anymore with 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:29.760
 with his blocks actually I think not too much 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.710
 on good will see that after that after that 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.220

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.220
 Gold nugget 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:39.840

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:46.500

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.140
 this is a mushroom so yeah that 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.990

00:05:52.140 --> 00:06:00.600

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.860
