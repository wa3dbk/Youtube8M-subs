00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.100 

it's<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.850> seemed<00:01:18.119> logical<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.960> would

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
it's this seemed logical that you would

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.719

do<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.530> thing<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.009> then<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.340> would<00:01:20.460> finish

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
do this thing and then you would finish

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.429 
do this thing and then you would finish
in<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.119> place<00:01:21.299> where<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.570> all<00:01:21.689> started<00:01:22.259> I

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
in the place where it all started I

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.080 
in the place where it all started I
think<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.860> was<00:01:22.979> good<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:23.460> love<00:01:23.640> Sheffield
