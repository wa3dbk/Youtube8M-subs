00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.540
 it was definitely a care because 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.040
 than at the courses I could 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.480
 do during my studies I got 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.539
 overview that there was a lot of 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.119
 services that I liked would not it 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.259
 for diversity for the complexity of 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.259
 care or for the relationship 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.740
 the super relationship with the colleague we are 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.239
 we are welcomed very well everywhere 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.670
 there is no me there is no in use 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.920
 or I do not go much ointment 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.450
 trust that is established and then it's 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.910
 rather, here it is rather good child in 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.570
 maintenance and that's it's we know 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.570
 they have to do 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.070
 there are many gestures found 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.660
 regardless of the specificities of 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.400
 services knows of teams that 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.360
 know the services know the 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.699
 way finally our way of 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:58.190
 operate has already begun the affirmed 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:01.729
 she takes care of the patient in his 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.400
 sector and complementarity does not 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:09.070
 for care 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.640
 of their singh affirmation know 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.530
 well places 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.670
 they know well the care in kaunas 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.110
 new doctors who work 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.300
 with us they know our 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.980
 protocols our way of working I 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.630
 am pretty admiring in front of his affine 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.390
 nurses because they have a 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.400
 very important versatility 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.230
 they go from surgical resuscitation 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.620
 in the nation indicated adam service of 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.310
 medicine 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.930
 a patient who lets go of us 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.640
 once we will see him maybe more 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.830
 quickly that someone he has in 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.690
 charge over two weeks 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.240
 and as she performed no passion 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.190
 do not know the record they can 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.600
 to have a look that we do not have because 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.800
 that it is too much of you 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.480
 can not do it alone in that sense 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.520
 must reach the agitated education 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.960
 some are super added therese 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.960
 rating who are Parkinson's 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.720
 ok it's nice to have someone to 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.720
 help you mobilize them 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.570
 voyeur can scholars on 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.250
 face or no show no you wanted 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.260
 not seen clear water because we 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.299
 enjoy more to patronize 2 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.409
 a substitute nurse or even a 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:21.900
 cleanser it's a real continuity of 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:25.409
 care and did not open an appreciation of the 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.939
 quality within the service for our 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.879
 patients believe that after there is more 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.560
 the notion of substitution and of 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.569
 the phoenix wright team or the non hospital 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.280
 when we miss an information have 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.110
 made a phone call we did not know 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.110
 your left we know who to ask 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.569
 we arrive with other acquaintances 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.230
 that the specialty in which 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.360
 work it 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.310
 the staff so actually when a 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.019
 patient arrives in a service with by 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.530
 example let's say a keystone patient 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.420
 is there is a stoma pocket the staff 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.120
 is not going to be lucky for example on 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.440
 the pocket in question the animations 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.599
 medical so suddenly we have there 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.580
 polls obviously there are passions 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.560
 medical and it can happen is that 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.750
 transplant patients or patients 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.790
 surgery or ortho and with things 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.750
 we do not usually manipulate 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.579
 so they will ask us 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.290
 actually of our knowledge by 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.690
 relative to the patient's equipment 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.160
 it's an exchange of dana ten 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.190
 professionals it's an exchange of 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.510
 skills etc 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.459
 it's a link in fact they're a sound 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.349
 a link we have students be 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.060
 locked up that they are in training all the 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.760
 hard snow and super years have pebbles 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.129
 and twitter nathalie and vanessa and I 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.620
 am a field of proximity to make a 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:40.470
 internship at the locum is more 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.470
 huge for students in a few 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.019
 weeks they will see virtually every 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.700
 the care that will not necessarily see 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.109
 on their three years of graduate school 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.389
 also for a young nurse 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.950
 it can be a way when we do not know 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.569
 where she wants to go where she wants to go 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.160
 to place it is also a way of 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.880
 connect her life in which she can 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.880
 to work 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.700
 for the family organization 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.140
 for me it changes absolutely nothing 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.920
 that we are the locum is conceived in 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:14.700
 another anti service we have here 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.859
 we have an imperative they have suffered the 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.180
 changes with another colleague who 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.769
 had everyone predicted that at the 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.230
 we are a little bit after 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.130
 noon a little bit of morning it helps to 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.130
 free time 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.550
 adaptability mobility and not very dignified
