00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.130
let us discuss the relative position of images
firmed by concave mirror.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.700
we’ll discuss some specific cases of image
formation for.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.260
standard location of object at various points
on principle axis of a concave mirror.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.939
like say if we talk about case 1. where we
can say when.

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.779
object is at infinity.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:36.149
if object is located at infinity we know that
incident rays on the mirror are parallel.

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.519
so here if we just have a look on the situation
when there is a concave mirror and from infinity.

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.059
parallel rays are incident on mirror.

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.770
then after reflection all these rays, meet
at the point, which we call focus.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.359
so all reflected rays on meeting out at focus
so here we can say that image produced by

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.410
the concave mirror is found at focus.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.340
similarly if we just have a look on another
case when.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.750
light rays are parallel, coming from infinity
but not parallel to focus these are incident

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.060
on mirror then after reflection they meet
out at a point, which lies in the plane of

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.960
focus perpendicular to principle axis the
plane we call focal plane.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.560
so here we can write when object is at infinity
image is formed.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.300
in focal plane.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:35.370
and here you can see that reflected rays are
all converging so, we can call it.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.370
real image.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.180
or in this situation image can be considered
as highly.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.620
diminished.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.500
because the size of image will be very small
as object is located at infinity.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.350
if we talk about the second case case-2 here
we can see.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.720
when.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.340
object is located, at a point.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.979
beyond centre of curvature of the mirror.

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:09.660
now in this situation we can see if the object
is located beyond centre of curvature.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.430
then from the tip of object say if 2 light
rays are considered for image formation, 1

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.600
is parallel other is.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:23.410
which is incident on pole then after reflection
of these standard ray you can see the image

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.800
thus obtained.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.850
is between, f and c point.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.430
so here we can write.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.020
i is formed.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:41.430
between f and c. it is real because the rays
are, converging.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.310
it is inverted. and.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.580
it is smaller in size so we can write is,
diminished.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.640
we talk about case 3. in this situation.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.550
we consider case 1.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.550
object.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.580
is located at centre of curvature.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.430
here you can see the object is located at
centre of curvature of the.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.430
mirror.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.700
in that situation from the tip of object if
we consider 2 rays which are incident on.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.700
the mirror.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:22.390
1 is passing through focus and other is parallel
to principle axis then after reflection these

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.650
are reflected.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.670
and the converging reflected rays produces
the image.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.440
exactly at centre of curvature again.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.260
so here we can write that i is formed.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.620
at c. due to converging reflected rays it
is real.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.760
it is inverted. and.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.760
you can say.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.930
it is same sized because.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:49.930
in this situation.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.680
by geometry we can prove very easily that
the size of image obtained will be same by

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:03.230
similarity of triangles we can prove it. and
if we talk about a case 4. where it is given

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.120
that when.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.900
object is.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:15.040
between f and c, here you can see in this
situation the object is located between f

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.700
point and c point.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:23.319
so again if we consider 2 rays which are incident
on mirror 1 is parallel. and the other is

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:29.940
incident on pole. so after reflection again
converging rays meet out at a point.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.760
which is producing image.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.120
beyond c so here we can write image is formed.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.970
beyond c because of.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.620
converging rays it is real.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.710
here we can see it is inverted. and by similarity
of triangles we can prove that the image size

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.070
is more then the object size.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.349
so here we can write it enlarged also.

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:03.889
1 more case is there for , the situation lets
continue on the next sheet.

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:11.099
lets continue the discussion on image formation
by concave mirror with case 5.

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:15.819
that is situation when we take.

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:17.599
here object is.

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:22.620
placed at focus, so like this situation here
you can see.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.110
that the object is placed exactly at focus
so from tip of object if we consider 2 rays

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.580
1 is on pole other is.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.460
parallel to, principle axis and say we consider
1 more ray which is passing through centre

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.500
of curvature then you can see.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.710
after reflection all rays become parallel.
and finally parallel rays we can see that

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.400
produce image.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.759
at infinity.

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:53.030
so in this situation we only write that image
is at, infinity in this situation we never

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.600
talk about the nature and orientation of image.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.389
and here you can also write it is.

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:03.659
highly enlarged.

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:07.750
about the case when object is at focused only
these 2 points are discussed and if we talk

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:08.750
about case sixth.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.870
this is when.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.340
object is.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:23.599
between f and p, if object is between focus
and pole. then in this situation here you

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:29.949
can see again if we consider 2 rays 1 which
is incident, on mirror parallel to principle

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:35.479
axis. and the other 1 which is incident on
pole as well as we can consider the ray which

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:39.300
passes through centre of curvature which is
retracing its own path.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.900
then here we can see that now the light rays
are.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.120
diverging after reflection.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.939
so these will produce an image behind the
mirrors so in this situation here we can see.

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:53.569
i is formed.

00:06:53.569 --> 00:07:02.680
behind, mirror. and here we can write it this
virtual because the reflected rays are diverging.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:11.720
and, it is erected. and enlarge. or similarity
you can easily find out the size also.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:17.410
in next section we’ll talk about the mathematical
relations and analysis of image formation

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.560
by which we’ll talk about the.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.340
exact location.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.340
nature.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.860
and orientation of image in various cases.
