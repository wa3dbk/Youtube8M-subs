00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
to switch to an underhand grip on this

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.080 
to switch to an underhand grip on this
tool<00:02:19.090> so<00:02:20.090> that<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.330> can<00:02:20.660> more<00:02:20.840> easily<00:02:22.090> flatten

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.700 
tool so that I can more easily flatten
one<00:02:23.300> side<00:02:23.660> of<00:02:23.840> it<00:02:23.960> what<00:02:24.050> I'm<00:02:24.140> going<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.320> do<00:02:24.500> is

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
one side of it what I'm going to do is

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.520 
one side of it what I'm going to do is
reach<00:02:24.950> over<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.400> my<00:02:25.520> left<00:02:25.850> I<00:02:26.090> have<00:02:26.420> a<00:02:26.720> graphite

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
reach over to my left I have a graphite

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.570 
reach over to my left I have a graphite
marver<00:02:27.860> on<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.940> table<00:02:29.390> it's<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.810> trade<00:02:30.020> cornet

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
marver on the table it's a trade cornet

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.640 
marver on the table it's a trade cornet
graphite<00:02:31.580> marver<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:32.150> I'm<00:02:32.989> going<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:33.350> let

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
graphite marver and I'm going to let

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.810 
graphite marver and I'm going to let
gravity<00:02:33.860> droop<00:02:34.430> this<00:02:34.670> down<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:36.590> where<00:02:36.820> the

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
gravity droop this down to where the

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.630 
gravity droop this down to where the
bottom<00:02:38.300> of<00:02:38.660> it<00:02:38.959> which<00:02:39.260> will<00:02:39.620> end<00:02:39.860> up<00:02:39.980> being<00:02:40.280> the

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
bottom of it which will end up being the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.790 
bottom of it which will end up being the
the<00:02:41.180> front<00:02:41.450> or<00:02:41.630> top<00:02:41.810> of<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.050> flower<00:02:42.320> is<00:02:42.590> going

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
the front or top of the flower is going

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.580 
the front or top of the flower is going
to<00:02:42.920> touch<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.430> graphite<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.870> it's<00:02:45.230> just<00:02:45.410> about

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
to touch the graphite so it's just about

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.870 
to touch the graphite so it's just about
ready<00:02:45.830> I'm<00:02:46.010> going<00:02:46.100> to<00:02:46.190> take<00:02:46.370> it<00:02:46.459> over<00:02:46.580> here<00:02:46.700> now

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
ready I'm going to take it over here now

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.360 
ready I'm going to take it over here now
and<00:02:47.770> here<00:02:48.770> you<00:02:48.890> go<00:02:50.260> so<00:02:51.260> I'm<00:02:51.470> pushing<00:02:51.739> just<00:02:52.250> a

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
and here you go so I'm pushing just a

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.979 
and here you go so I'm pushing just a
little<00:02:52.730> bit<00:02:52.940> but<00:02:53.810> I'm<00:02:53.930> stopping<00:02:54.530> short

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
little bit but I'm stopping short

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.479 
little bit but I'm stopping short
because<00:02:56.989> I<00:02:57.260> don't<00:02:57.500> want<00:02:57.709> to<00:02:57.800> push<00:02:57.950> this<00:02:58.160> wire

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
because I don't want to push this wire

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.120 
because I don't want to push this wire
to<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.570> bottom<00:02:59.959> I<00:03:00.110> don't<00:03:00.170> want<00:03:00.560> it<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.920> be

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
to the bottom I don't want it to be

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.340 
to the bottom I don't want it to be
visible<00:03:02.090> from<00:03:02.270> the<00:03:02.450> other<00:03:02.630> side<00:03:02.959> which<00:03:03.200> will

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
visible from the other side which will

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.890 
visible from the other side which will
become<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.709> front<00:03:04.040> of<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.190> flower<00:03:04.690> so<00:03:05.690> right

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
become the front of the flower so right

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.770 
become the front of the flower so right
now<00:03:06.080> I've<00:03:06.290> got<00:03:06.530> kind<00:03:06.800> of<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:07.070> half<00:03:07.780> spherical

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
now I've got kind of a half spherical

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.699 
now I've got kind of a half spherical
shape<00:03:09.580> and<00:03:10.810> now<00:03:11.810> I'm<00:03:11.959> going<00:03:12.110> to<00:03:12.170> focus<00:03:12.530> on

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
shape and now I'm going to focus on

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.910 
shape and now I'm going to focus on
making<00:03:12.920> some<00:03:13.250> indentations<00:03:14.120> in<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:15.440> glass

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
making some indentations in the glass

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.229 
making some indentations in the glass

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
with my razor tool so I'm going to hold

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.690 
with my razor tool so I'm going to hold

need to heat it a little bit more you
don't<00:03:34.990> need<00:03:35.319> to<00:03:35.500> heat<00:03:35.650> it<00:03:35.680> through<00:03:35.800> you<00:03:36.130> don't

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
don't need to heat it through you don't

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.240 
don't need to heat it through you don't
want<00:03:36.550> to<00:03:36.640> heat<00:03:36.790> it<00:03:37.150> clear<00:03:37.420> through<00:03:37.660> and<00:03:38.250> then

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
want to heat it clear through and then

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.250 
want to heat it clear through and then
make<00:03:39.490> an<00:03:39.610> indentation<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:40.420> curve<00:03:41.050> it<00:03:41.170> around

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
make an indentation and curve it around

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.470 
make an indentation and curve it around
to<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.709> front<00:03:41.950> you<00:03:42.640> want<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:42.880> be<00:03:42.940> able<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.209> see

that<00:03:43.660> indentation<00:03:44.110> from<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.620> front

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.070 

now<00:03:48.760> I'm<00:03:48.940> heating<00:03:49.330> again<00:03:49.600> on<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.840> other<00:03:49.870> side

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
now I'm heating again on the other side

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.340 
now I'm heating again on the other side
opposite<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:50.980> first<00:03:51.250> indentation<00:03:51.730> and<00:03:52.360> again

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
opposite the first indentation and again

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.160 
opposite the first indentation and again
same<00:03:53.709> thing<00:03:53.739> press<00:03:54.370> in<00:03:54.640> and<00:03:55.030> just<00:03:55.900> make<00:03:56.140> a
