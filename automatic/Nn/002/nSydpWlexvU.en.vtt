00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 as I had commented on a video 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.180
 previous many end theories after 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.280
 from the movie the battle of the gods 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.980
 that a series was approaching but only 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.960
 it was in a rumor but at last the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.000
 day when this rumor stopped being what 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.430
 many of us think something very 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.470
 It would hardly happen and it would happen only 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.480
 in simultaneous movies where akira 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.189
 toriyama would continue talking about the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.080
 history of the warriors z and their 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.420
 infinities of battles in the world of 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.369
 dragon ball but many have 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.109
 ask about the plot you 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.660
 they want this series to have 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.030
 again each one of us would have 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.010
 some ideas and theories of this possible 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.500
 plot without mentioning infinity of 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.480
 transformations mergers and enemies that 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.640
 would appear in this as it had 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.559
 mentioned earlier this series 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.200
 will then after the saga 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.300
 from man jimbo I do not know maybe it could be 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.059
 about ten years after this saga and 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.129
 many will say because good just in that 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.840
 time is where I leave the project here 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.750
 It is also when they began to appear 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.030
 characters like bread or vibes 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.980
 this is some things that we could see 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.590
 in the new series of dragon ball the 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.510
 return of this character left good 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.640
 ingredients to be able to resume in the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.620
 new series since if we remember this 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.150
 he had the strength of kid but this 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.040
 character could be one of the 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.140
 protagonists of this and defend the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.850
 planet earth on the other hand there is no need 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.770
 forget that he is a goku student 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.530
 learning techniques like the unforgettable 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.680
 jamea and possibly I do not know maybe a 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.510
 mighty genkidama we could see agoyán 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.670
 in action again by showing us their 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.890
 extraordinary powers that undoubtedly 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.960
 they stopped seeing in dragon ball gt but 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.850
 that we may see them back 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.009
 since this character always had 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.570
 a lot of participation within the sagas 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.670
 showing that he was a character 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.710
 really strong 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.420
 not to mention now gotham and trumps 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.800
 that at the end of dragon ball z we 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.050
 they showed that they had lost 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.490
 totally interest in fights and 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.860
 that they were engaged in another type of 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.930
 activities like the office in the case 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.759
 Trunks and side ghost in it 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.560
 we did not see much just the new look that 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.390
 he had acquired 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.090
 and going to the saga of gt because without 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.280
 comments a few simple viewers of 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.349
 the battles and showing that even 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.080
 bread was much stronger than the same 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.060
 but good enough bullying and 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.950
 Well, maybe we'll see these arrive at a 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.560
 highest level in the super saiyan and 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.840
 reaching level 2 taking incredible 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.910
 battles and more participation either 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.670
 individually using the fusion that 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.860
 I'll mention later then it would be fantastic 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.019
 see them in action fighting in the company of 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.049
 a fan and even the wta leaving in 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.459
 they the responsibility of the earth 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.130
 Now let's return with the aforementioned 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.049
 gottex fusion that many expected the 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.840
 appearance of this charismatic and powerful 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:45.360
 character in dragon ball gt and now with 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.340
 this series we could see this would have a 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.860
 enormous power and could contribute a lot 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.540
 in a situation of problems also without 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.569
 forget any of their witty 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.099
 techniques and jokes within the battle 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.170
 now let's talk about the girls sayayin 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.299
 Hispanidad one more hybrid than the other 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.489
 letting you see that fun was interested in 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.650
 learn martial arts without 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.900
 forget about a surprising power and a 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.280
 great potential and on the other hand 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.800
 they just made it 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.230
 as the little girl who only thought about the 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.200
 Fashion and fun leaving aside your 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.870
 Sayayin power what would you like to see them 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.569
 in super sayayin this maybe could 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.550
 see yourself within this saga of showing what 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.620
 strong that can be demonstrating a 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.630
 prominence within the same having 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.930
 the responsibility of defeating the 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.970
 new rivals going on the plot this 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.830
 could deal with the 12 gods of the 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.959
 destruction that bills mentioned in the 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.819
 battle of the gods since apparently 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.010
 This is one of the weak within 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.840
 this category of gods if we saw that 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.970
 to overcome or equalize bills we had 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.040
 the need for a sayayin god and now 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.019
 we have the super sayayin god that 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.170
 we would need to be able to fight 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.330
 these remaining gods the question that 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.970
 now it occurs to me is how they will put so much 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.980
 enemy in a single series you have 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.840
 thought that this series will have a certain 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.700
 number of chapters thinking about that 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.280
 will have good expectations of audience 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.380
 and acceptance of the fans and not having a 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.630
 final catastrophe as it happened to dragon 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.550
 ball gt having as a difference that 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.160
 this will be done by the very one here 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.819
 thing that did not have gt taking up the subject 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.709
 so is 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.799
 has good acceptance will be followed 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.049
 creating new chapters in conclusion 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.030
 here he has already accustomed us with 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.889
 excellent sagas where we stayed 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.930
 with a good taste in mouth with the 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.150
 closures of these mentioning some 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.919
 like the freezer saga where goku is 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.410
 Transforms into the legendary super 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.599
 sayayin elham emea from father and son to 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.270
 defeat the terrible cell or the fusion of 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:40.710
 goku and vegeta in the saga of usa 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.139
 imagine that we can expect from this 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.960
 new saga one thing is true this 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.180
 series will not disappoint us for another 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.949
 side I would like to see the 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.259
 old warriors within this saga 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:54.630
 like to itch or in chin jano aprilynne 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:56.400
 every time the sagas take place these 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.380
 they lose prominence within the 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.419
 I would like to see that these 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.419
 have more participation or see another 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:06.090
 death of quilín hahaha only joked not 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.039
 I know you think the last 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.639
 ask before finishing this video 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:13.229
 It would be when it will reach Latin America 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.030
 it is an enigma because first 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.070
 we will have to wait for this to be 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.949
 transmitted in Japan and see if the 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.449
 television stations want to buy the rights 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.580
 thinking that he had a good audience 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:26.039
 this has had a lot of acceptance in its 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.349
 country the other and also important would be 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:30.539
 the dubbing having to contact everything 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.490
 the cast and reach an agreement then 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.860
 this may take no more than two years 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.710
 and less of this already in Japanese for 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.839
 internet I know that many of us wait with 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.419
 you crave this series but I know that the wait 

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:45.300
 will be rewarded what they think of this 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:48.539
 new series that they would like to see in this 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.990
 series I am den heever I made 91 until the 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.990
 next
