00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
that I've made myself significantly

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.490 
that I've made myself significantly
larger<00:00:32.710> pot<00:00:33.010> stand<00:00:33.510> got<00:00:34.510> a<00:00:34.540> couple<00:00:34.810> eggs<00:00:35.110> over

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
think it has to stay on there about two

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.660 
think it has to stay on there about two
minutes<00:00:40.059> to<00:00:40.540> really<00:00:40.750> before<00:00:41.679> it<00:00:41.800> really

know how long it takes to cook bacon
right<00:01:55.560> at<00:01:55.710> home<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:55.920> your<00:01:56.130> stove

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.540 

okay<00:02:20.800> it's<00:02:20.950> been<00:02:21.160> seven<00:02:21.700> minutes<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:23.550> this

okay it's been seven minutes and this
bacon<00:02:25.030> is<00:02:25.150> done<00:02:26.790> guns<00:02:27.790> owned<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.650> see<00:02:32.890> here<00:02:33.220> it

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
bacon is done guns owned and see here it

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.860 
bacon is done guns owned and see here it
it's<00:02:34.690> done<00:02:35.430> might<00:02:36.430> even<00:02:36.640> be<00:02:36.850> by<00:02:37.209> some<00:02:37.540> people's

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
it's done might even be by some people's

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.729 
it's done might even be by some people's
standards<00:02:38.410> huh<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.459> little<00:02:40.030> overdone

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
standards huh a little overdone

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.479 
standards huh a little overdone
especially<00:02:41.739> these<00:02:41.860> two<00:02:42.069> small<00:02:42.400> pieces<00:02:44.489> so

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
especially these two small pieces so

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.550 
especially these two small pieces so
anyway<00:02:46.950> takes<00:02:47.950> about<00:02:48.480> seven<00:02:49.480> minutes<00:02:49.660> from<00:02:50.440> a

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
anyway takes about seven minutes from a

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.440 
anyway takes about seven minutes from a
cold<00:02:50.890> pan<00:02:51.310> until<00:02:52.000> we're<00:02:52.510> finished<00:02:52.720> for<00:02:53.280> bacon

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
cold pan until we're finished for bacon

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:03.300 
cold pan until we're finished for bacon
so<00:02:57.269> while<00:02:58.269> this<00:02:58.480> pan<00:02:58.780> is<00:02:58.810> still<00:02:59.050> hot<00:03:02.280> get<00:03:03.280> a

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
so while this pan is still hot get a

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:15.550 
so while this pan is still hot get a
couple<00:03:03.550> eggs<00:03:03.880> in<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:11.610> looking<00:03:12.610> good

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.949 

good<00:03:16.560> point<00:03:16.890> time<00:03:17.190> I<00:03:17.370> could<00:03:17.580> probably<00:03:17.959> blow

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
good point time I could probably blow

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.020 
good point time I could probably blow
the<00:03:19.170> scope<00:03:19.470> right<00:03:19.709> out<00:03:19.890> I<00:03:20.069> can<00:03:20.340> probably<00:03:20.640> have

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
the scope right out I can probably have

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:48.420 
the scope right out I can probably have
enough<00:03:21.330> heat<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.540> cook

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:58.589 

I<00:03:51.120> think<00:03:52.120> we've<00:03:52.329> got<00:03:52.540> enough<00:03:52.569> heat<00:03:53.079> now<00:03:57.599> put

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
I think we've got enough heat now put

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:05.270 
I think we've got enough heat now put
the<00:03:58.750> stove<00:03:59.049> out<00:03:59.730> and<00:04:00.810> just<00:04:03.269> let<00:04:04.269> those<00:04:04.480> eggs

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
the stove out and just let those eggs

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:13.259 
the stove out and just let those eggs
cook<00:04:06.280> right<00:04:06.659> in<00:04:07.659> the<00:04:07.930> hot<00:04:08.109> pan<00:04:12.269> depending<00:04:13.269> on

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
cook right in the hot pan depending on

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.849 
cook right in the hot pan depending on
how<00:04:13.659> you<00:04:13.719> like<00:04:14.049> your<00:04:14.260> eggs<00:04:14.319> I<00:04:15.690> think<00:04:16.690> if<00:04:17.680> you

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859
