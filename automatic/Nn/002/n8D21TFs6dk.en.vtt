00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:24.069
 towards let's see how one of the most characteristic techniques is executed 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:28.640
 of metal thrash in the immediate breath card 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.279
 only the bread 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.670
 percent in the tide execute them not simple by hand with the we pick it up what 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.500
 I played 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.050
 with this part of that with the end we support it or the bridge 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.900
 in such a way that the ropes good mobility what is our hand 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.460
 in this way to contribute a relationship to the strings live with that we get 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.550
 much drier 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.350
 this event imprints the subjects always greater who knows greater strength if 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.520
 we want to climb a little more beaten very suitable to accompany for example the 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.100
 drum hype 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.630
 It is if you use ado 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.820
 as we said in the thrash metal sections 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.820
 percent in idermeta clothing 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.270
 p 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.450
 when these scores 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.640
 sell indicated as perennial 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.740
 gm means palm inc is also called tapado because what we do is 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.350
 cover the ropes with your hand 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.720
 let's see how they are like this and we do not cover the ropes 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.000
 The vibration of Handel agrees 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.400
 if it lengthens 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.830
 then that caused a longer sound are worth as we have seen it in 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.830
 previous lessons 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.100
 as you see while Mariano what the iris sounds and if so, there will be 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.640
 very much however 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.530
 montiel puebla puebla 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.540
 with our right hand what we do is turn off the sound supporting 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.410
 it's more to that release 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.860
 baleares one more 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.080
 stephan the locks accompany with the left hand to cut even more 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.370
 the relationship is not about tightening at all but simply about clothes for 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.370
 ends up finishing inflation 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.779
 several computers in that terrain like the private 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:26.709
 that will not shake us so long 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.699
 This gave them a lot of strength 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:30.650
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.609
 It is a figure 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.579
 combining it with other endorsed with other improved techniques such as 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.439
 example as the highly inc 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:41.819
 bent who 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.389
 it relies heavily on these techniques we gave them mildly 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:50.019
 on the subject we are the same as we have seen in past elections because it is a 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.899
 setback that is a topic that for this type of actions 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:55.929
 it comes in handy for many examples if you remember 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:09.149
 by allowing my companions not my floor in any of the frets 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:12.149
 Four hours ago 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:19.089
 simple of all Chileans from behind ore 

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:22.469
 in this inventory the metal will support this technique 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:24.139
 we'll see 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.539
 concrete the correct way to execute it 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:31.809
 if you see the point of the guitar varies according to the guitar model 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.519
 on Thursday this is going to make several players come 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.449
 then we with the hand in the play 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:42.499
 with the field we support on the ropes 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:47.069
 a little later on according to the choir guitar model the alebrije watching 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.889
 gay but that is the bridge worth to avoid degradation 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.909
 that's something that comes 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:02.139
 is not this is how you can cover all the strings that you want even word 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:03.559
 but chords 

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:04.789
 that day 

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:06.909
 carneiro that goes well is not a topic
