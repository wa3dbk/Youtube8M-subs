00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
video this is due to a faulty wire

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.749 
video this is due to a faulty wire
harness<00:00:11.969> which<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.809> located<00:00:13.280> behind<00:00:14.280> and

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
harness which is located behind and

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.130 
harness which is located behind and
underneath<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.509> glove<00:00:15.690> box<00:00:17.810> here's<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.960> wire

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
underneath the glove box here's the wire

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.670 
underneath the glove box here's the wire
harness<00:00:19.560> part<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:21.020> this<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.350> one<00:00:22.529> that

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
harness part of it this is the one that

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.220 
harness part of it this is the one that
burns<00:00:22.890> out<00:00:23.269> you're<00:00:24.269> going<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.570> want<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.900> detach

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
burns out you're going to want to detach

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.290 
burns out you're going to want to detach
this<00:00:25.680> one<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.670> connected<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
this one this is connected to the

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.929 
this one this is connected to the
resistor<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.930> you'll<00:00:28.050> need<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.230> replace<00:00:28.590> and

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
resistor that you'll need to replace and

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.609 
resistor that you'll need to replace and
then<00:00:29.939> there's<00:00:30.210> two<00:00:30.539> more<00:00:30.570> on<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.080> bottom<00:00:31.439> here

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
then there's two more on the bottom here

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.850 
then there's two more on the bottom here
tucked<00:00:32.009> away<00:00:33.260> just<00:00:34.260> right<00:00:34.410> underneath<00:00:34.649> the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
tucked away just right underneath the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.549 
tucked away just right underneath the
glove<00:00:34.980> box<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> right<00:00:35.700> side<00:00:35.910> over<00:00:35.940> here<00:00:36.559> by

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
glove box on the right side over here by

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.400 
glove box on the right side over here by
the<00:00:37.620> dome<00:00:37.890> light<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.480> then<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> last<00:00:39.840> one<00:00:40.200> is

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
the dome light and then the last one is

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.010 
the dome light and then the last one is
behind<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.460> glovebox<00:00:41.700> which<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.600> really<00:00:42.989> easy

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
behind the glovebox which is really easy

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.090 
behind the glovebox which is really easy
to<00:00:43.290> get<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:45.079> all<00:00:46.079> you'll<00:00:46.350> need<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.559> do<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:47.070> open

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
to get to all you'll need to do is open

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
to get to all you'll need to do is open
up<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.579> glove<00:00:47.760> box<00:00:49.100> remove<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.760> string

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
up the glove box remove the string

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.610 
up the glove box remove the string
that's<00:00:51.449> holding<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.870> up<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:53.480> then<00:00:54.620> these

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
that's holding it up and then these

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.110 
that's holding it up and then these
sides<00:00:56.070> right<00:00:56.850> here<00:00:56.930> just<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.109> push<00:00:58.350> in

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
sides right here just going to push in

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.650 
sides right here just going to push in
towards<00:01:00.120> each<00:01:00.300> other

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
towards each other

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.640 
towards each other
and<00:01:01.399> it'll<00:01:02.399> slide<00:01:03.210> right<00:01:03.359> down<00:01:04.880> and<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:07.380> last

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
and it'll slide right down and the last

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.469 
and it'll slide right down and the last
connector<00:01:08.280> will<00:01:09.270> be<00:01:09.420> located<00:01:09.960> right<00:01:10.110> here

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
connector will be located right here

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.929 
connector will be located right here
once<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.630> detach<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.020> connector<00:01:13.799> you'll<00:01:14.760> be

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
once you detach that connector you'll be

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.320 
once you detach that connector you'll be
able<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.270> pull<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:16.100> complete<00:01:17.100> harness<00:01:17.490> down

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
able to pull the complete harness down

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.300 
able to pull the complete harness down
and<00:01:19.460> out<00:01:20.460> from<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.360> bottom<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.130> here's<00:01:23.130> an

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
and out from the bottom and here's an

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.899 
and out from the bottom and here's an
example<00:01:23.689> here<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.869> my<00:01:25.080> old<00:01:25.290> one<00:01:28.460> she<00:01:29.460> has<00:01:29.610> four

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
example here is my old one she has four

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.780 
example here is my old one she has four
connectors<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.740> one<00:01:31.920> that's<00:01:32.130> up

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
connectors this one is the one that's up

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.990 
connectors this one is the one that's up
here<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.390> these<00:01:34.380> three<00:01:34.860> are<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.460> ones<00:01:35.790> that

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
here and these three are the ones that

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.910 
here and these three are the ones that
are<00:01:36.299> underneath<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.280> glove<00:01:38.280> box<00:01:39.229> once<00:01:40.229> you

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
are underneath the glove box once you

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.380 
are underneath the glove box once you
have<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.220> out<00:01:41.280> you'll<00:01:41.729> be<00:01:41.790> able<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.119> replace

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
have that out you'll be able to replace

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.190 
have that out you'll be able to replace
it<00:01:42.450> with<00:01:42.750> your<00:01:42.780> new<00:01:42.930> one<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.549> also<00:01:45.200> don't

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
it with your new one and also don't

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.740 
it with your new one and also don't
forget<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.560> replace<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.189> resistor<00:01:47.640> as<00:01:47.850> well

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
forget to replace the resistor as well

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.859 
forget to replace the resistor as well
because<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.619> does<00:01:50.040> get<00:01:50.220> burnt<00:01:50.520> inside<00:01:50.970> as<00:01:51.720> you

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
because it does get burnt inside as you

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.590 
because it does get burnt inside as you
can<00:01:52.020> see<00:01:52.170> there<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:53.399> here's<00:01:53.759> an<00:01:54.030> example<00:01:54.119> of

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
can see there and here's an example of

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.860 
can see there and here's an example of
the<00:01:54.960> burnt<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:56.070> melted<00:01:57.409> harness<00:01:58.409> connector
