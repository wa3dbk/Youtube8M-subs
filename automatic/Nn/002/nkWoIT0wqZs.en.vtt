00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:05.350
 hello everyone I am fatal and good today 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.380
 I bring the video how to get the trophy 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.209
 of the best friend between contact order 2 and 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.820
 good to get this trophy we have 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:15.459
 to do 3 so specific launches 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.310
 of partner and good to get this 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:20.470
 we have to make a tag with the couples 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.990
 that are designed in this game by 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.750
 example I'm going to take armor king and 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.160
 there yes but good also I'm going to 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.030
 put another couple in if you want 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.039
 try it with them which is kim and marduk 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.449
 and well to make this trophy the only 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:37.600
 what we have to do is make a 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:39.940
 grip and almost instantly press r1 to 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.050
 that our partner attacks and then 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:47.020
 we can make a good combo and grab it 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.600
 what are we going to do with armor king 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.180
 square x and almost instantly we're going to 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.530
 press r1 to deliver and go to 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.120
 see now 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.120
 let's see let's move 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.410
 and well here at the end of the list we have 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.059
 all the holds that king armor has and 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.800
 good as I said the only thing we're going to 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.270
 to do is square x very easy is a 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.340
 bunch of grips are square x 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.890
 we are not going to touch any 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.820
 direction only square xy ready 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.340
 so square x r 1 and well this is the 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:28.490
 launch special companion costume 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:30.920
 yes, and if I do not know what your grip is 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.560
 make the tag but with armor king without more 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.430
 we can do all three and that's it 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.430
 square x and r1 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.860
 to drop trophy but good and you're 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.420
