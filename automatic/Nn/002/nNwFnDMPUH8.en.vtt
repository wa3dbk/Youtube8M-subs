00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:11.630
 Hello hayidak Naver intellectuals have defined a counseling yijaeman 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:13.460
 While a normal bike is bent and stretched out by contraction of the bench tool 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:19.160
 It's pedaling. 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:24.080
 When wearing the shoes Click the quadriceps muscle, which acts in the opposite liquor shop 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:29.120
 Padding occurs while the strings are contracted and the knee is bent 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:34.339
 That is, it is possible to let the bike go out by acting all the muscles of the front and back of the mu 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:37.940
 It is familiar with familiar bicycle riding in the usual Click shoes 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:43.910
 It did not come to those who are a bunch despite the brave 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:48.649
 The present condition of the current inquiries is that due to the existing anticompetitive dogs and knee circumference 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:53.480
 It appears to be due to muscle overload. 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:55.100
 In this case , while taking medication and physiotherapy, for 3 weeks, 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.870
 Riding 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.190
 If this causes severe pain during exercise better haebosineun overhaul 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.380
 It is assumed to be 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:08.240
 2 If the problem is not resolved after 3 weeks , 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.100
 Please visit 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:18.500
 I'll tell you again about the overall cause of back pain. 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:20.750
 In the first place, we often think that the most common disc disease is low back pain 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.430
 Itgoyo can cause 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:31.210
 Muscles like this behind us , including the disc, we often run 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:35.780
 Here then comes up often salt gel due to the issue of these things in this joint 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:40.520
 There can be back pain caused by a general muscle skeletal abnormality. 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.420
 Secondly, if there is an abnormality in the nervous system, 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.240
 There is 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:48.230
 Also this is due to abnormalities in the blood circulation in the waist part and we will come through 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.480
 I have a number. 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:56.990
 Recently, this stress or various depression caused by these things 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:01.340
 Mental problems are also irrelevant to back pain. 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:06.260
 Especially for women these days , 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:11.209
 The disease in this three-part area can also cause back pain . 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:17.120
 Backache is a disk and it can cause a backache rather than an overall big 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:21.430
 I think it is important to know the causes and to have an accurate diagnosis. 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.430
 Thank you for your reply.
