ahead Wesley you start first well we got
off<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.960> shaky<00:00:16.049> start<00:00:16.580> with<00:00:17.580> also

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
off to a shaky start with also

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.929 
off to a shaky start with also
forgetting<00:00:18.240> in<00:00:18.420> terms<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.869> us<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.490> we<00:00:20.490> bounced

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
forgetting in terms of us and we bounced

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.480 
forgetting in terms of us and we bounced
back<00:00:21.150> without<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.510> 30-point<00:00:22.170> win<00:00:22.350> then<00:00:22.890> we<00:00:23.039> drop

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
back without a 30-point win then we drop

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.380 
back without a 30-point win then we drop
the<00:00:23.699> next<00:00:23.970> two<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:25.730> kind<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.820> start<00:00:27.000> off<00:00:27.119> slow

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
the next two so kind of start off slow

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.689 
the next two so kind of start off slow
but<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:28.140> think<00:00:28.349> we<00:00:28.470> can<00:00:28.619> really<00:00:28.740> get<00:00:29.519> back

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
but I think we can really get back

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.310 
but I think we can really get back
together<00:00:29.939> teams<00:00:30.539> refocus<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:33.020> how<00:00:34.020> about<00:00:34.170> you
