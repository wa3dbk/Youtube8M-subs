looks<00:02:16.330> in<00:02:16.690> good<00:02:16.840> condition<00:02:17.260> still<00:02:17.560> rolls<00:02:17.860> they

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
looks in good condition still rolls they

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.880

made<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.090> few<00:02:19.330> more<00:02:19.510> versions<00:02:19.959> of<00:02:20.080> these<00:02:20.200> but<00:02:20.650> I

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
made a few more versions of these but I

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.890 
made a few more versions of these but I
got<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.670> taxi<00:02:22.030> version<00:02:22.330> because<00:02:22.630> it's<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:23.590> taxi

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
got the taxi version because it's a taxi

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.780 
got the taxi version because it's a taxi
and<00:02:25.900> some<00:02:26.560> places<00:02:27.100> around<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.400> country<00:02:27.459> I

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
and some places around the country I

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.090 
and some places around the country I
believe<00:02:28.150> in<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:29.230> United<00:02:29.560> States<00:02:29.830> and<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.070> think

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
believe in the United States and I think

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.490 
believe in the United States and I think
in<00:02:30.400> Hawaii<00:02:30.760> they<00:02:31.030> actually<00:02:31.450> use<00:02:31.750> limousines

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
in Hawaii they actually use limousines

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.860 
in Hawaii they actually use limousines
as<00:02:33.220> taxis<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:33.940> matter<00:02:34.120> of<00:02:34.180> fact<00:02:34.360> I<00:02:34.450> remember<00:02:34.600> my

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
as taxis a matter of fact I remember my

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.290 
as taxis a matter of fact I remember my
mom<00:02:35.019> and<00:02:35.230> dad<00:02:35.410> telling<00:02:35.830> me<00:02:36.069> when<00:02:36.940> they<00:02:37.060> went<00:02:37.239> to

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
mom and dad telling me when they went to

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.870

their<00:02:37.420> trip<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.690> Hawaii<00:02:38.260> all<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.280> taxi<00:02:39.670> cars

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
their trip to Hawaii all the taxi cars

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.360 
their trip to Hawaii all the taxi cars
they<00:02:40.000> saw<00:02:40.180> over<00:02:40.390> there<00:02:40.480> were<00:02:40.630> limousines

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
they saw over there were limousines

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.490 
they saw over there were limousines
there<00:02:42.819> was<00:02:42.970> no<00:02:43.180> sedans<00:02:43.690> for<00:02:43.989> limousines<00:02:44.380> I

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
there was no sedans for limousines I

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.870 
there was no sedans for limousines I
mean<00:02:44.650> there<00:02:44.769> might<00:02:44.980> have<00:02:45.010> been<00:02:45.280> but<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.670> more

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
mean there might have been but the more

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.930 
mean there might have been but the more
common<00:02:46.239> ones<00:02:46.390> were<00:02:46.510> limos<00:02:46.930> limousine<00:02:47.860> taxis<00:02:48.580> I

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
common ones were limos limousine taxis I

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.120 
common ones were limos limousine taxis I
mean<00:02:49.209> can<00:02:49.600> you<00:02:49.630> believe<00:02:49.959> that<00:02:49.989> that<00:02:50.769> was<00:02:50.920> back

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130

cool<00:03:24.790> cars<00:03:25.060> I<00:03:25.239> don't<00:03:25.390> know<00:03:25.450> if<00:03:25.540> they<00:03:25.630> still

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
cool cars I don't know if they still

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.680 
cool cars I don't know if they still
make<00:03:26.079> them<00:03:26.640> but<00:03:27.640> I<00:03:27.670> have<00:03:27.850> three<00:03:28.120> versions<00:03:28.299> of

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
make them but I have three versions of

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.530 
make them but I have three versions of
it<00:03:29.310> highly<00:03:30.310> recommend<00:03:30.670> if<00:03:30.760> you<00:03:30.850> find<00:03:31.060> any<00:03:31.359> of

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
it highly recommend if you find any of

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.240 
it highly recommend if you find any of
these<00:03:31.660> versions<00:03:31.900> snatch<00:03:32.350> them<00:03:32.590> up<00:03:32.680> I<00:03:32.920> think

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
these versions snatch them up I think

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.979 
these versions snatch them up I think
they<00:03:33.340> made<00:03:33.489> a<00:03:33.519> blue<00:03:33.760> version<00:03:34.269> like<00:03:34.420> this<00:03:34.630> or<00:03:34.959> a

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
they made a blue version like this or a

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.420 
they made a blue version like this or a
different<00:03:35.350> version<00:03:35.560> I'm<00:03:35.799> not<00:03:35.950> really<00:03:36.130> sure

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
different version I'm not really sure

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.130 
different version I'm not really sure
but<00:03:36.970> there<00:03:37.120> was<00:03:37.209> variations<00:03:37.750> within<00:03:37.959> the

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
but there was variations within the

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.660 
but there was variations within the
variations<00:03:38.590> I<00:03:38.680> think<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.070> glitter<00:03:39.340> one<00:03:39.519> is

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
variations I think the glitter one is

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.000 
variations I think the glitter one is
the<00:03:39.790> rarest<00:03:40.180> one<00:03:40.450> out<00:03:41.079> of<00:03:41.140> every<00:03:41.530> out<00:03:41.950> of

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
the rarest one out of every out of

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.460 
the rarest one out of every out of
everyone<00:03:42.489> named<00:03:42.640> me<00:03:42.820> because<00:03:43.239> it's<00:03:44.079> all

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
everyone named me because it's all

seen<00:03:48.880> any<00:03:49.060> more<00:03:49.329> like<00:03:49.510> this<00:03:50.579> over<00:03:51.579> the<00:03:51.670> years

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700
