00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.839
 twain synopsis the adventures of tom 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.550
 sawyer is the story of a few months in the 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.370
 life of this child who lives in a city 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.950
 small southwest from the USA on the shores 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.509
 of the mississippi raised by his aunt cop 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.369
 who wants it from the heart but what 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.680
 submit to a discipline that is done 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.869
 absurd and unpleasant everything contemplates the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.609
 world in a very different way like what 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.310
 do the adults with whom you have to 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.260
 coexist precisely because there is that 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.779
 estrangement entertains us with its 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.000
 fun and noble reactions more 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.860
 wild and rebellious against that universe of 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.899
 the elderly is your friend your 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.940
 klÃ©ber and end the ideal companion of everything 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.739
 who is envied by other children who 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.450
 they contemplate in their life a way of 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.600
 existence that they would like 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.829
 bring together they will live adventures 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.510
 humorous and dramatic of which 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.160
 they can get out more airy than they 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.340
 Any adult could have done it 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.559
 at the end if you want in appearance 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.690
 tom like cuca will end up being led 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.490
 to that context of people who will grow 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.220
 and they will stop being children 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.620
 my opinion the book without a doubt 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.330
 can be read by anyone is 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.370
 a very entertaining book since the 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.770
 story is about a very naughty boy 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.930
 with Xavier during the course of 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.000
 history we will see all the messes in the 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.190
 that the child ends up getting into a 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.260
 innocent many times because of his 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.290
 imagination although we can always 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.510
 smile with every occurrence the black is 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.520
 very interesting very easy to read and each 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.400
 chapter teaches us more about the life of 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.290
 take your personality always tried to 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.060
 find conclusions for everything I read 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.640
 and this book could not be the exception 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.979
 one of the happiest stages of our 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.260
 childhood is all those moments that 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.020
 we share with our family and friends 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.420
 all the pranks games fights are 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.280
 part of our memory and I think that 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.800
 It is what the book teaches us not 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.840
 let's stop being surprised every day because 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.970
 as we grow we forget our curiosity 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.940
 for life for things by 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.890
 people another of the conclusions that I 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.510
 remains of the book is that the acts of love 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.640
 they are more powerful than hate and 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.649
 revenge to forgive is necessary for 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.560
 move forward who can not do it without a doubt 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.649
 dies trapped 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.230
 come out and I will not give you a perfect score 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.180
 since there were at certain times where the 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.550
 rupture becomes slow and tedious but 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.670
 yes I recommend reading it until my brother 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.110
 he liked the story and that he hates to read 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.760
 I hope you liked the review and 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.489
 I hope you tell me that I can improve 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.620
 Why should I apply discuss messi have 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.620
 read the book or if you would like to read it
