although<00:01:40.850> I<00:01:40.880> many<00:01:41.659> other<00:01:41.869> people<00:01:42.200> did<00:01:42.319> enjoy<00:01:42.619> I

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
although I many other people did enjoy I

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.789 
although I many other people did enjoy I
think<00:01:42.979> overall<00:01:43.399> it<00:01:43.909> gotta<00:01:44.179> you<00:01:44.420> know<00:01:44.740> kind<00:01:45.740> of

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
think overall it gotta you know kind of

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.590 
think overall it gotta you know kind of
a<00:01:45.889> negative<00:01:46.069> response<00:01:46.700> to<00:01:46.999> be<00:01:47.090> honest<00:01:47.329> it<00:01:47.450> kind

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
a negative response to be honest it kind

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.879 
a negative response to be honest it kind
of<00:01:47.659> felt<00:01:47.869> just<00:01:48.109> kind<00:01:48.259> of<00:01:48.289> put<00:01:48.499> in<00:01:48.679> and<00:01:48.859> the

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:48.889 
of felt just kind of put in and the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:50.919 
of felt just kind of put in and the
problem<00:01:49.729> basically<00:01:49.939> was<00:01:50.359> they'll<00:01:50.630> just

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
problem basically was they'll just

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.330 
problem basically was they'll just
wasn't<00:01:51.319> end<00:01:51.439> of<00:01:51.529> game<00:01:51.740> modes<00:01:51.920> with<00:01:52.099> it<00:01:52.249> you

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
wasn't end of game modes with it you

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.919 
wasn't end of game modes with it you
could<00:01:52.490> do<00:01:52.609> a<00:01:52.639> season<00:01:53.149> with<00:01:53.270> it<00:01:53.420> but<00:01:53.599> that<00:01:53.749> of

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
could do a season with it but that of

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:55.179 
could do a season with it but that of
course<00:01:53.959> you<00:01:54.319> know<00:01:54.409> just<00:01:54.560> new<00:01:54.859> made<00:01:55.039> up

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
confident but in future titles we could

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:17.740 
confident but in future titles we could
definitely<00:02:15.950> see<00:02:16.310> classic<00:02:16.700> content<00:02:17.090> maybe<00:02:17.599> a

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
definitely see classic content maybe a

their<00:02:24.860> what<00:02:25.130> 20<00:02:25.460> cars<00:02:25.670> in<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:25.910> game<00:02:26.120> possibly

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
their what 20 cars in the game possibly

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.930 
their what 20 cars in the game possibly
21<00:02:27.290> of<00:02:27.410> course<00:02:27.620> if<00:02:27.770> you<00:02:28.250> know<00:02:28.370> mama<00:02:28.610> joined

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
21 of course if you know mama joined

21 of course if you know mama joined
back<00:02:29.930> 4m<00:02:30.590> 2015<00:02:31.430> but<00:02:31.610> yeah<00:02:31.700> they're<00:02:31.820> really

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
pushing themselves and that kind of you

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.600 
pushing themselves and that kind of you
know<00:02:33.350> makes<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:33.770> wonder<00:02:33.950> what<00:02:34.160> else<00:02:34.190> did<00:02:34.520> they

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.340 
know makes you wonder what else did they
push<00:02:34.790> themselves<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.300> do<00:02:35.480> and<00:02:35.690> I'm<00:02:36.140> really

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
push themselves to do and I'm really

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.690 
push themselves to do and I'm really
hoping<00:02:36.530> that's<00:02:36.860> going<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.190> mean<00:02:37.280> kind<00:02:37.580> of<00:02:37.640> a

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
hoping that's going to mean kind of a

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.970 
hoping that's going to mean kind of a
paddock<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.420> maybe<00:02:38.810> bigger<00:02:39.140> online<00:02:39.680> lobbies

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
paddock and maybe bigger online lobbies

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.190 
paddock and maybe bigger online lobbies
of<00:02:40.130> course<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:40.550> know<00:02:40.640> easily<00:02:41.300> get<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.510> 18<00:02:41.930> now

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
of course you know easily get to 18 now

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.480 
of course you know easily get to 18 now
that<00:02:42.410> you<00:02:42.470> know<00:02:42.530> there's<00:02:42.740> no<00:02:42.890> excuse<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.400> be

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
that you know there's no excuse to be

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.820 
that you know there's no excuse to be
honest<00:02:43.700> just<00:02:43.820> add<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.360> couple<00:02:44.900> more<00:02:45.020> cars<00:02:45.410> on<00:02:45.620> to

that kind of online grid of maximum be

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.130 
that kind of online grid of maximum be
am<00:02:49.970> pretty<00:02:50.180> confident<00:02:50.570> but<00:02:50.720> they<00:02:50.840> are<00:02:50.960> going

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
am pretty confident but they are going

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.720 
am pretty confident but they are going
to<00:02:51.200> continue<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.620> just<00:02:51.860> to<00:02:51.950> push<00:02:52.160> and<00:02:52.400> really

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
to continue to just to push and really

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.880 
to continue to just to push and really
you<00:02:53.150> know<00:02:53.270> add<00:02:53.450> a<00:02:53.480> few<00:02:53.750> things<00:02:53.960> that<00:02:54.260> people

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
you know add a few things that people

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.260 
you know add a few things that people
have<00:02:55.010> been<00:02:55.160> really<00:02:55.520> asking<00:02:55.820> for<00:02:55.850> all<00:02:56.030> for<00:02:56.240> a

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
have been really asking for all for a

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.390 
have been really asking for all for a
long<00:02:56.480> time<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.050> I<00:02:57.500> think<00:02:57.560> combustors<00:02:58.250> should

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
long time and I think combustors should

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.770 
long time and I think combustors should
have<00:02:58.520> been<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:58.820> know<00:02:58.910> eagerly<00:02:59.390> waiting<00:02:59.750> to

like<00:04:49.580> with<00:04:49.760> the<00:04:49.820> classic<00:04:50.180> cars<00:04:50.360> there's<00:04:50.630> just

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
like with the classic cars there's just

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.719 
like with the classic cars there's just
too<00:04:51.020> much<00:04:51.229> pace<00:04:51.770> difference<00:04:52.190> between<00:04:52.520> the<00:04:52.610> two

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
too much pace difference between the two

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:54.490 
too much pace difference between the two
cars<00:04:53.000> I<00:04:53.240> was<00:04:53.660> only<00:04:53.750> I<00:04:53.930> would<00:04:54.080> really<00:04:54.260> work

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
cars I was only I would really work

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
hopefully the being Grand Prix mode of

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:57.760 
hopefully the being Grand Prix mode of
course<00:04:56.690> where<00:04:56.870> you<00:04:56.960> can<00:04:57.110> just<00:04:57.139> kind<00:04:57.530> of<00:04:57.560> use

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
course where you can just kind of use

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.350 
course where you can just kind of use
them<00:04:58.040> with<00:04:58.220> a<00:04:58.250> different<00:04:58.550> drivers<00:04:59.000> and<00:04:59.180> maybe

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
them with a different drivers and maybe

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.850 
them with a different drivers and maybe
you<00:04:59.479> could<00:04:59.630> have<00:04:59.720> to<00:04:59.900> come<00:05:00.020> up<00:05:00.110> to<00:05:00.260> tab<00:05:00.560> start

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
you could have to come up to tab start

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.980 
you could have to come up to tab start
bc<00:05:00.949> 1<00:05:01.130> 2015<00:05:01.430> so<00:05:02.300> use<00:05:02.479> you<00:05:02.630> to<00:05:02.750> one<00:05:02.840> of<00:05:02.870> the
