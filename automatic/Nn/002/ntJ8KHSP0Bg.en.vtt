is interesting about his stand and he

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.960 
is interesting about his stand and he
actually<00:03:57.500> mentions<00:03:58.010> this<00:03:58.160> is<00:03:58.400> that<00:03:58.850> it's

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
actually mentions this is that it's

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.729 
actually mentions this is that it's
actually<00:03:59.120> really<00:03:59.480> weak<00:03:59.750> he's<00:04:00.200> not<00:04:00.470> a<00:04:00.500> good

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
actually really weak he's not a good

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.620 
actually really weak he's not a good
fighter<00:04:01.040> at<00:04:01.250> all<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.730> reason<00:04:02.060> he's<00:04:02.239> able<00:04:02.390> to

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
fighter at all the reason he's able to

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.210 
fighter at all the reason he's able to
be<00:04:02.750> such<00:04:03.019> a<00:04:03.049> threat<00:04:03.320> against<00:04:03.620> his<00:04:03.709> opponents

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
be such a threat against his opponents

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.490 
be such a threat against his opponents
is<00:04:04.340> because<00:04:05.150> he<00:04:05.390> sort<00:04:05.570> of<00:04:05.630> uses<00:04:06.019> one<00:04:06.230> of<00:04:06.260> them

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
is because he sort of uses one of them

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.400 
is because he sort of uses one of them
as<00:04:06.739> like<00:04:07.130> a<00:04:07.400> scapegoat<00:04:08.299> and<00:04:08.540> they're<00:04:09.290> not

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
as like a scapegoat and they're not

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.830 
as like a scapegoat and they're not
going<00:04:09.590> to<00:04:09.650> be<00:04:09.769> able<00:04:09.799> to<00:04:10.040> attack<00:04:10.310> him<00:04:10.610> so<00:04:11.030> it's

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
going to be able to attack him so it's

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.410 
going to be able to attack him so it's
kind<00:04:12.049> of<00:04:12.140> cheap<00:04:12.470> how<00:04:12.680> he<00:04:12.739> fights<00:04:13.280> but<00:04:14.090> that's

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
kind of cheap how he fights but that's

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.180 
kind of cheap how he fights but that's
what<00:04:14.570> I<00:04:14.600> love<00:04:14.900> about<00:04:14.930> it<00:04:15.290> I<00:04:15.350> love<00:04:15.560> to<00:04:15.680> build<00:04:16.010> up

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120

hurting<00:04:23.300> Joseph<00:04:23.810> and<00:04:24.260> he<00:04:24.320> actually<00:04:24.470> did<00:04:24.800> get

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
hurting Joseph and he actually did get

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.500 
hurting Joseph and he actually did get
one<00:04:25.250> good<00:04:25.430> punch<00:04:25.640> against<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.150> guy<00:04:26.300> which

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
one good punch against the guy which

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.500 
one good punch against the guy which
could<00:04:26.810> have<00:04:26.900> nearly<00:04:27.289> killed<00:04:27.740> Joseph

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
could have nearly killed Joseph

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.060 
could have nearly killed Joseph
and<00:04:28.630> I<00:04:28.720> thought<00:04:28.930> that<00:04:29.110> was<00:04:29.230> pretty<00:04:29.380> crazy<00:04:29.620> but

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
and I thought that was pretty crazy but

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.620 
and I thought that was pretty crazy but
it<00:04:30.520> was<00:04:30.640> a<00:04:30.670> nice<00:04:30.790> little<00:04:31.000> shocked<00:04:31.270> to<00:04:31.450> see<00:04:31.600> that

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
it was a nice little shocked to see that

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.290 
it was a nice little shocked to see that
happen<00:04:32.200> uh<00:04:32.680> and<00:04:33.010> you<00:04:33.280> getting<00:04:33.790> killed<00:04:34.090> at<00:04:34.240> the

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
happen uh and you getting killed at the

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.610 
happen uh and you getting killed at the
beginning<00:04:34.600> was<00:04:34.750> actually<00:04:35.050> kind<00:04:35.260> of<00:04:35.320> shopping

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
beginning was actually kind of shopping

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.840 
beginning was actually kind of shopping
I<00:04:35.830> thought<00:04:35.860> she<00:04:36.130> was<00:04:36.250> gonna<00:04:36.310> be<00:04:36.490> more<00:04:36.700> of<00:04:36.760> like

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
I thought she was gonna be more of like

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.750 
I thought she was gonna be more of like
deals<00:04:37.270> like<00:04:37.510> right-hand<00:04:38.110> gal<00:04:38.650> but<00:04:39.190> apparently

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
deals like right-hand gal but apparently

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.820 
deals like right-hand gal but apparently
that's<00:04:39.880> not<00:04:40.000> the<00:04:40.240> case<00:04:40.420> for<00:04:41.380> deal<00:04:41.590> i'm

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
that's not the case for deal i'm

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.320 
that's not the case for deal i'm
guessing<00:04:42.190> goons<00:04:42.430> are<00:04:42.610> just<00:04:42.790> really<00:04:43.180> really

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
guessing goons are just really really

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.760 
guessing goons are just really really
expendable<00:04:43.960> and<00:04:44.050> he<00:04:44.170> could<00:04:44.290> just<00:04:44.440> pick<00:04:44.590> them

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
expendable and he could just pick them

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.830 
expendable and he could just pick them
up<00:04:44.830> whenever<00:04:45.040> he<00:04:45.250> wants<00:04:45.670> and<00:04:45.850> you<00:04:46.540> know<00:04:46.630> he's

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
up whenever he wants and you know he's

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.630 
up whenever he wants and you know he's
so<00:04:46.990> charismatic<00:04:47.320> he<00:04:47.650> could<00:04:47.860> get<00:04:47.980> anybody<00:04:48.220> into

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
so charismatic he could get anybody into

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.920 
so charismatic he could get anybody into
his<00:04:48.790> group<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:49.300> i'm<00:04:49.390> sure<00:04:49.540> we<00:04:49.660> haven't<00:04:49.810> even

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
his group and i'm sure we haven't even

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.570 
his group and i'm sure we haven't even
seen<00:04:50.170> half<00:04:50.470> of<00:04:50.650> what<00:04:50.710> he<00:04:50.950> is<00:04:51.040> thrown<00:04:51.340> at<00:04:51.460> them

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
yet otherwise i really liked this

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.680 
yet otherwise i really liked this
episode<00:04:53.890> the<00:04:54.340> pacing<00:04:54.730> was<00:04:54.880> a<00:04:54.940> little<00:04:55.450> off

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
episode the pacing was a little off

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.240 
episode the pacing was a little off
especially<00:04:56.110> in<00:04:56.470> the<00:04:56.560> first<00:04:56.770> half<00:04:56.980> of<00:04:57.130> the

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
especially in the first half of the

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.460 
especially in the first half of the
episode<00:04:57.580> there<00:04:57.760> was<00:04:57.970> a<00:04:58.000> lot<00:04:58.420> of<00:04:58.470> explanation

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
episode there was a lot of explanation

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.380 
episode there was a lot of explanation
however<00:05:00.010> there<00:05:00.400> were<00:05:00.520> some<00:05:00.790> funny<00:05:01.060> scenes

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
however there were some funny scenes

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.090 
however there were some funny scenes
there<00:05:01.630> was<00:05:01.750> one<00:05:01.900> really<00:05:02.230> random<00:05:02.590> scene<00:05:02.920> at<00:05:03.070> the

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
there was one really random scene at the

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.740 
there was one really random scene at the
beginning<00:05:03.460> of<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.640> episode<00:05:03.880> when<00:05:04.600> they're

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
beginning of the episode when they're

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.300 
beginning of the episode when they're
trying<00:05:04.930> to<00:05:05.080> show<00:05:05.230> you<00:05:05.290> how<00:05:05.470> to<00:05:05.530> buy<00:05:05.710> a<00:05:05.740> doner

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
trying to show you how to buy a doner

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.150 
trying to show you how to buy a doner
kebab<00:05:06.790> so<00:05:07.480> there<00:05:08.230> it<00:05:08.380> is<00:05:08.470> they<00:05:08.740> show<00:05:08.920> you<00:05:08.980> how

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
kebab so there it is they show you how

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.710 
kebab so there it is they show you how
to<00:05:09.220> haggle<00:05:09.430> when<00:05:09.730> you're<00:05:09.880> in<00:05:09.940> pakistan<00:05:10.480> so<00:05:10.660> i

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
to haggle when you're in pakistan so i

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.450 
to haggle when you're in pakistan so i
guess<00:05:10.900> that's<00:05:11.080> pretty<00:05:11.230> useful<00:05:11.470> but<00:05:12.220> otherwise

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
guess that's pretty useful but otherwise

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.340 
guess that's pretty useful but otherwise
