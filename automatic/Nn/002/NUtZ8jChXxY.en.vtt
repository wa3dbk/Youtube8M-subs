so if you you know you have a pair of

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.020 
so if you you know you have a pair of
nice<00:02:20.410> trucks<00:02:20.709> you<00:02:20.830> want<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.040> wreck<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.850> have<00:02:21.970> a

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
nice trucks you want a wreck you have a

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.850 
nice trucks you want a wreck you have a
little<00:02:22.360> custom<00:02:22.720> paint<00:02:22.930> job<00:02:23.140> or<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:23.410> decal<00:02:23.830> on

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
them or something these things are great

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.160 
them or something these things are great
I<00:02:27.130> think<00:02:27.910> they're<00:02:28.030> good<00:02:28.209> anyways<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:29.020> they're

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
I think they're good anyways and they're

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.540 
I think they're good anyways and they're
so<00:02:29.350> small<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:29.890> can't<00:02:29.920> even<00:02:30.160> see<00:02:30.310> them

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
so small you can't even see them

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.510 
so small you can't even see them
maintain<00:02:31.150> your<00:02:31.239> same<00:02:31.480> on<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.690> deck<00:02:32.520> and

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520
