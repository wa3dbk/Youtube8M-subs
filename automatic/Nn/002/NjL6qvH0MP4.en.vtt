it's it's that one drink they get you
through<00:06:40.870> something<00:06:41.320> you<00:06:41.800> know<00:06:41.920> but<00:06:42.070> it's<00:06:42.190> not

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:42.340 
through something you know but it's not

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.940 
through something you know but it's not
drinking<00:06:43.180> but<00:06:43.360> it's<00:06:43.480> not<00:06:43.630> drinking<00:06:44.140> but<00:06:44.830> it's

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:44.950 
drinking but it's not drinking but it's

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.280 
drinking but it's not drinking but it's
not<00:06:45.100> drinking<00:06:45.490> every<00:06:45.760> day<00:06:45.990> necessarily<00:06:46.990> right

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.290 
not drinking every day necessarily right

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:48.990 
not drinking every day necessarily right
now<00:06:47.440> that's<00:06:47.650> the<00:06:47.860> difference

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 
now that's the difference

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.300 
now that's the difference
so<00:06:49.300> no<00:06:49.720> pegs<00:06:50.020> right<00:06:50.200> and<00:06:50.470> people<00:06:50.710> went<00:06:50.980> after

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.310 
so no pegs right and people went after

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.820 
so no pegs right and people went after
him<00:06:51.460> but<00:06:51.640> I<00:06:51.700> think<00:06:52.030> peg<00:06:52.420> hey<00:06:53.080> peg<00:06:53.320> nailed<00:06:53.530> it

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:53.830 
him but I think peg hey peg nailed it

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.140 
him but I think peg hey peg nailed it
I<00:06:53.860> think<00:06:54.160> you<00:06:54.220> nailed<00:06:54.340> it<00:06:54.460> a<00:06:54.520> hundred<00:06:54.700> percent

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.150 
I think you nailed it a hundred percent

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.940 
I think you nailed it a hundred percent
I<00:06:55.180> think<00:06:55.450> so<00:06:55.600> too<00:06:55.660> and<00:06:56.260> got<00:06:56.410> it<00:06:56.530> you<00:06:56.620> got<00:06:56.770> to<00:06:56.860> be

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:56.950 
I think so too and got it you got to be

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.290 
I think so too and got it you got to be
well-rounded<00:06:57.280> to<00:06:57.550> some<00:06:57.730> F<00:06:57.880> but<00:06:58.030> not<00:06:58.150> saying

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:58.300 
well-rounded to some F but not saying

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.340 
well-rounded to some F but not saying
