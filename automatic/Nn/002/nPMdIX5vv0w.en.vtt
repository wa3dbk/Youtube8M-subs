00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:07.210
 well there we are seeing the exit of 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.980
 patricia bridge 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.420
 let's see what I was commenting there 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.520
 with one of the engineers he is 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.129
 saying how to put the car and there we go 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.700
 to see the output we have as output the 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.380
 camera and leaves the pit lane straight 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.310
 and let's see how it takes the first curve 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.550
 of the race 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.439
 this curve to the left that is usually 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.990
 take at high speed and then 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.350
 we quickly see that it reaches a curve 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.059
 closed in which it brakes dry 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:38.000
 it quickly accelerates again and 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.280
 we enter a closed curve as there 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.710
 we lift our foot a little and we go back to 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.960
 accelerate thoroughly 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.540
 we find another curve closed to 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.770
 rights that we see as the take 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.770
 quickly very well 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:57.560
 and we advance my mother my mother how is it going 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.000
 this career could perhaps be put in 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.400
 first position there we are seeing 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.610
 raising the finger I think it will do 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:08.950
 a great attention chrono arrives arrives at 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.840
 to get to thoroughly goes through the straight 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:16.390
 we have put a trunk the track must 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.390
 be wet gentlemen can be wet 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.840
 let's see if it can accelerate 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.610
 arriving the meadow a little bit good 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.520
 I hope they do not put any 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.350
 penalty we keep advancing 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.350
 we come again to the curve in depth 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.460
 and left closed curve 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.290
 we step again thoroughly we arrived at the 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.350
 curve we raise the foot a tad for 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.080
 that the car does not spin 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.550
 we quickly left that curve 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.890
 we come to the right closed curve 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.330
 this time yes this time if the chrono can 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.330
 be very good can be very good 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.500
 we return to do the curve reason 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:04.660
 right and we enter halfway 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.660
 in him and we follow gentlemen 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.110
 I do not know if the curators are going to have 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.740
 account of that I think I should stop by 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.030
 the pitlane 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.030
 I should change the tire 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.960
 from here we can not see if the kers 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.580
 It's open 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.580
 the drs sorry 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.930
 we see patricia bridge flying by the 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.930
 track 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.950
 I hope that no drop of 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.430
 rain we went through the goal again and 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.430
 we pass by goal
