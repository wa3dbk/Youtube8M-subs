00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 pam pam hi I'm Ruslan usachev today 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.540
 tell you about the most interesting news 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.130
 and events that took place in Russia 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.139
 in the world for the last time 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.059
 remember how at one time all bombed 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.920
 because google made everyone 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.199
 bind your youtube account and to 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.750
 google + or weird sociality with 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.820
 in circles that no one knows how 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.289
 use but honestly I know 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.029
 one person who of all 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.680
 social networks prefers google 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.449
 plus 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.310
 Perhaps he and she developed that is 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.980
 I do not find another explanation but with 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.140
 time somehow all have reconciled that is 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.210
 even I have on my plus page 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.219
 20 thousand followers walk in a big way 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.739
 Still only catalog video which I either 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.410
 I started it myself or I liked it 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.690
 time heals but suddenly google said 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.309
 In short, we are joking and now do not want everything 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.050
 untie you don't need to call your page 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.190
 to channel comments can be 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.860
 it will just leave that is 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.329
 returns mydean forgotten freedom i 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.980
 just don't understand why not so much 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.079
 it took time to admit it 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.120
 fairly obvious error is the same 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.520
 Now I will return to you and I will say 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.070
 I return you the wall thanks of course but 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.070
 we have somehow got used to the main event 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.869
 years for a great race until people came out 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.420
 new version of the operating system from 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.970
 microsoft windows 10 new browser 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.979
 voice assistant the return of the very 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.900
 start button and a lot of other little 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.640
 addition for the cloud and licensed versions 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.560
 windows 7 and windows 8 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.090
 update for free despite 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.130
 numerous warnings that 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.320
 many more bugs I updated my 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.570
 laptop and you know look funny but 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.360
 about the same situation as google 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.159
 plus I'm used to how windows 8 work 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.110
 all these tiles and now return 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.600
 start button and you need to relearn because 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.990
 which honestly is not the same 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.610
 button that was windows xp 98 and 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.009
 3131 was the start button I don't remember it 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.840
 such a rethinking of the concept 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.000
 start button and also need to this 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.829
 getting used to it turned out that apparently 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.780
 Russia is a country of the second grade therefore 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.119
 voice assistant cortana is not here 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.030
 it works which is very strange because 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.189
 Russia is historically so 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.560
 Power Yes, that is, if in America already 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.690
 practically won different mac 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.239
 what apple operating system 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.090
 here most people still enjoy 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.410
 windows is strange how to solve them 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.180
 Speaker Voice Assistant 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.880
 in Russian because the goal is in Russian 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.080
 already talking though honestly I 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.970
 still not fully understanding why 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.989
 generally need a voice help laptop 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.840
 or work computer 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.510
 ok google why do we need a voice assistant 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.410
 laptops immediately a couple of cool video 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.150
 city trunks 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.370
 astronauts demonstrated how will 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.590
 behave effervescent tablet under conditions 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.600
 weightlessness as you can see you have seen in 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.910
 once again demonstrates what is not 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.040
 guessed they had nothing to do in space 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.810
 pianist sony belousova played 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.840
 classic soundtrack from the game super 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.080
 brothers mario piano stylized 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:56.489
 under 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:57.870
 huge prefix dendi me now 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.989
 stupid to deny playing the console 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.540
 This art sad story zapplink 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.910
 who circled the whole world and I kind of 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.910
 I shall come from afar in Zimbabwe are held 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.720
 Safari and instead of tourists there is a favorite 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.220
 leps forces because he is so kind he 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.310
 would easily contact 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.410
 offends nobody and he ate that enough 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.209
 Awesome that is, it was until recently 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.970
 time until the US does not give 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.230
 vnul his bow archer hunter course 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.870
 proceedings it turned out that he 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.030
 paid 35 thousand dollars for permission 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.650
 on the hunt for some reason, those people who helped 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.299
 him organize hunting in Zimbabwe they 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.040
 decided not to either look wild 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.190
 are you having fun with me 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.780
 national park returned it and then 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.519
 still in a quiet collar was removed so that they would not 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.340
 kindled like it was a regular lion 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.500
 didn't work palmer has already come forward with 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.450
 official recognition he said well 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.639
 I did not know that I somehow do 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.799
 I regret that without any fault I usually 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:55.260
 hunter I seriously don't really understand 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.880
 than the points of such a hunt when doing everything 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.829
 for themselves other people they lead 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.870
 poured and just shoot him okay 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.209
 mind archer shoot type primitive 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.430
 hunter aha primitive hunter who 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.370
 flew in from america on the plane paid 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.680
 35 thousand dollars for a bunch of people and killed 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.480
 animal sounds yes that's antiquity right 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.550
 just hunting but now he too 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.900
 that I seemed known here by this 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.579
 guys i'm lucky they 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.680
 what conclusion from 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.260
 This story can be done well, in principle 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.260
 we have known dentists for a long time 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.270
 this is evil the next news is she and not new 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.900
 even more likely an announcement that concerns my 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.120
 channel you do not even believe what I have 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.380
 there will be a new show wow I don't want it now 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.440
 disclose all the details 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.120
 Everything has its time but I dare to assure you 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.949
 used all his ingenuity and 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.780
 original to come up with a new one 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:45.780
 format so this will be the top 5 tips 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.130
 no of course there will be more in a nutshell i 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.900
 I will do there with interesting ways 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.760
 how to be more productive 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.590
 effective achieve your goals and 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.039
 generally behave as if you were 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.860
 court for more than 24 hours if possible 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.990
 impossible of course to land on a friend and not 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.240
 important project want to make big 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.039
 interesting quality and this one 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.690
 difficult to make a part of me appeared 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:11.520
 I donâ€™t want you yet 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.380
 but I will shift two small ones 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.970
 such hints and clues are perhaps the most 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.440
 observant of you will understand 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.479
 You also noticed that until recently 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.610
 in video bloggers became advertising like there 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.260
 a lot in the rollers up you need to eat and 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.050
 need money to produce more 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.840
 and better videos but why not do 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.700
 this is no ads please all news 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.120
 sorry for the little mess today 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.010
 in the background i'm just me in a new apartment and 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.870
 it will only be this year 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.700
 probably until I rest times things do not 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.680
 The important thing is not to miss the new ones. 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:45.139
