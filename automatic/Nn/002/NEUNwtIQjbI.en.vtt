00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:09.389
 and today we continue another day more guys in 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.469
 you continue and today I want to present you this 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.269
 beautiful this beauty this thing that 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.170
 surprise everyone and as you can 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.510
 see is a curved or flat screen that is 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.130
 converts into a curved screen or a 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.720
 flat screen that becomes a 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.340
 curved screen now I am 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.869
 putting speed video so 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.920
 you can see the difference more 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.570
 Quick 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.120
 now I'm only capturing from a 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.790
 only angle and this is the new wave 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.219
 innovation that brings samsung to the 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.660
 screen you know you've been 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.640
 talking a lot about curved screens 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.219
 but the difference of this is how 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.430
 you can see that only with the 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.579
 remote control we can do curve and 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.510
 we can put it flat again and the 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.280
 user is the one who decides how he wants it 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.410
 see there I'm taking now from a 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.690
 different angle because I take the three 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.300
 angles so that you can see the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.979
 difference and I applied a little bit of 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.790
 fast camera for you to see how 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.690
 the camera 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.780
 change as the screen sorry as the 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.300
 screen changes and I can see and 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.580
 understand what is the advantage of using a 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:22.890
 curved screen because there I saw the same 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.450
 large image be flat and sunken and 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.940
 the difference is that the screens 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.920
 curves like they add to you like that 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.080
 they make you part of what makes you 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.930
 a movie a bit 3d although I know that 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.640
 It is not 3D but it does a little that is 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.190
 you can see it look there when it 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.619
 turn off the screen and you can see how it 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.420
 it gets flat to the screen again 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.820
 then when it turns on only 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.970
 with the remote control the user can 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.910
 change how you want to see how you prefer 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.300
 see this and for me it's something amazing 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.369
 now really it is questioned and when 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.340
 I was watching that screen I came to 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.470
 ask about the use ok and that project 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.420
 I know the security is yours 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.250
 would pay for a screen like this or be 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.960
 they would simply buy curve 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.090
 jose simply flat complexity 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.269
 but what is asked is 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.569
 and it's going to be truly a good 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.569
 moment 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.159
 now we are from the other side of the 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.750
 right side for you to see the 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.360
 difference look at the top corner 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.400
 pay attention to that part and go 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.230
 thinking about the question you 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.989
 would give much use to this to me 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.030
 surprised as techno fanatic as I am 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.400
 a technology fan like as equal 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.420
 to josete the fanatic to me this 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.500
 surprise but you milk that 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.329
 It is also surprising because it is the 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.489
 technology a screen that doubles wow 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:47.159
 it is not completely folded but 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.840
 it doubles but the use the question is 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.879
 about the use 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.849
 and you would use it look how it looks 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:56.220
 you would use it or pay us a little 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.080
 more to have the advantage of being able 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.260
 change or simply compare it 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.900
 flat or just buy it already 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.099
 a curved screen as many come 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.420
 TV 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.819
 this is a prototype yet not what 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.830
 they have in the market they still do not know 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.720
 when it's going to come out they do not have prices 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.910
 they have nothing only samsung was 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.799
 showing and saying I have this 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.319
 technology is yours now that I 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.180
 answer the question if the bid the taste 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.530
 as always a little hand up this has 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.319
 been all for this video we continue 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.630
 reporting from if and is about the best 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:31.880
 in technology this has been all for today 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.880
 Martian speakers and this section
