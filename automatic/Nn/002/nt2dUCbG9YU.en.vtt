00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
like to sort of grab it with my pliers

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.120 
like to sort of grab it with my pliers
and<00:02:27.760> pull<00:02:28.030> on<00:02:28.240> it<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:29.050> know<00:02:29.380> I've<00:02:29.890> got

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
and pull on it so that I know I've got

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.670 
and pull on it so that I know I've got
all<00:02:30.400> of<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.790> wire<00:02:31.030> that's<00:02:31.450> coming<00:02:31.840> out<00:02:31.990> of<00:02:32.440> the

all of the wire that's coming out of the
bead<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.120> then<00:02:34.120> right<00:02:34.390> at<00:02:34.510> 3/8<00:02:34.990> I'll<00:02:35.380> snip<00:02:35.920> it

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
bead and then right at 3/8 I'll snip it

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.730 
bead and then right at 3/8 I'll snip it
with<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.670> flush<00:02:37.030> part<00:02:37.420> of<00:02:37.630> my<00:02:37.780> pliers<00:02:38.080> towards

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740

with the flush part of my pliers towards
the<00:02:38.890> part<00:02:39.130> I'm<00:02:39.310> keeping<00:02:40.890> 3/8<00:02:41.890> about<00:02:42.280> a

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
the part I'm keeping 3/8 about a

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.600 
the part I'm keeping 3/8 about a
centimeter<00:02:44.110> of<00:02:44.380> wires<00:02:44.830> sticking<00:02:45.370> out<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.880> end

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
centimeter of wires sticking out the end

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.720 
centimeter of wires sticking out the end
next<00:02:48.610> grasp<00:02:48.970> that<00:02:49.330> wire<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:50.190> if<00:02:51.190> you<00:02:51.310> need<00:02:51.520> to

next grasp that wire and if you need to

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.630 
next grasp that wire and if you need to
mark<00:02:52.330> a<00:02:52.510> two<00:02:52.930> millimeter<00:02:53.560> spot<00:02:54.010> on<00:02:54.280> your

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
mark a two millimeter spot on your

mark a two millimeter spot on your
pliers<00:02:54.910> with<00:02:55.300> a<00:02:55.330> sharpie<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.440> your<00:02:56.620> loops<00:02:56.830> will

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
pliers with a sharpie so your loops will

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.330 
pliers with a sharpie so your loops will
all<00:02:57.220> be<00:02:57.400> consistent<00:02:58.440> put<00:02:59.440> that<00:02:59.590> wire<00:02:59.860> in<00:03:00.160> there

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
all be consistent put that wire in there

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.570 
all be consistent put that wire in there
so<00:03:00.580> you<00:03:00.670> can't<00:03:00.940> feel<00:03:01.240> any<00:03:01.570> of<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:01.960> coming<00:03:02.140> out

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
so you can't feel any of it coming out

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.370 
so you can't feel any of it coming out
your<00:03:03.580> pan<00:03:04.060> should<00:03:04.480> be<00:03:04.540> positioned<00:03:05.170> like<00:03:05.320> this

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
your pan should be positioned like this

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.090 
your pan should be positioned like this
with<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.040> pliers<00:03:06.310> facing<00:03:07.090> up<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:08.560> all<00:03:08.710> you<00:03:08.890> do

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
with the pliers facing up and all you do

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.740 
with the pliers facing up and all you do
is<00:03:09.430> twist<00:03:10.230> your<00:03:11.230> wrist<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.910> keep<00:03:13.180> twisting

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
is twist your wrist and keep twisting

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.940 
is twist your wrist and keep twisting
until<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:15.220> wire<00:03:15.640> has<00:03:16.540> crossed<00:03:16.930> over<00:03:17.260> itself

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
until that wire has crossed over itself

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.180 
until that wire has crossed over itself
and<00:03:18.780> then<00:03:19.780> we're<00:03:20.050> just<00:03:20.080> going<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.500> grab<00:03:20.830> this

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
and then we're just going to grab this

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.230 
and then we're just going to grab this
and<00:03:22.180> bend<00:03:22.570> it<00:03:22.690> back<00:03:22.990> and<00:03:23.470> that<00:03:24.340> centers<00:03:25.000> the

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
and bend it back and that centers the

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.100 
and bend it back and that centers the
loop<00:03:25.980> over<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.010> bead<00:03:27.340> it<00:03:27.640> also<00:03:28.210> uncross<00:03:28.870> 'iz

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
loop over the bead it also uncross 'iz

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.500 
loop over the bead it also uncross 'iz
it<00:03:29.260> from<00:03:29.470> itself<00:03:29.890> and<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:30.280> should<00:03:30.550> be<00:03:30.730> nice<00:03:31.450> and

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
it from itself and it should be nice and

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.860 
it from itself and it should be nice and
closed<00:03:32.020> right<00:03:32.380> now<00:03:33.300> and<00:03:34.300> you're<00:03:34.450> just<00:03:34.480> going

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
closed right now and you're just going

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.460 
closed right now and you're just going
to<00:03:34.960> do<00:03:35.170> that<00:03:35.380> with<00:03:35.710> all<00:03:36.070> of<00:03:36.130> your<00:03:36.640> bead<00:03:36.820> dangles

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
to do that with all of your bead dangles

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.170 
to do that with all of your bead dangles
like<00:03:38.470> I<00:03:38.620> said<00:03:38.800> it's<00:03:38.950> a<00:03:39.040> great<00:03:39.160> idea<00:03:39.400> to<00:03:39.670> trim

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
like I said it's a great idea to trim

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.890 
like I said it's a great idea to trim
them<00:03:40.360> all

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
them all

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.720 
them all
you<00:03:41.170> know<00:03:41.260> string<00:03:41.620> them<00:03:41.800> all<00:03:41.920> trim<00:03:42.340> them<00:03:42.520> all

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
you know string them all trim them all

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.390 
you know string them all trim them all
and<00:03:43.060> then<00:03:43.600> make<00:03:43.870> all<00:03:44.080> your<00:03:44.230> loops<00:03:44.530> at<00:03:44.800> once<00:03:45.040> and

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
and then make all your loops at once and

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.130 
and then make all your loops at once and
it's<00:03:45.520> just<00:03:45.670> a<00:03:45.790> nice<00:03:45.970> project<00:03:46.270> to<00:03:46.630> sit<00:03:46.870> and

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
it's just a nice project to sit and

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.560 
it's just a nice project to sit and
listen<00:03:47.260> to<00:03:47.620> some<00:03:47.830> music<00:03:47.980> or<00:03:48.400> a<00:03:48.460> good<00:03:48.700> book<00:03:48.940> okay

with<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.830> largest<00:04:15.460> so<00:04:15.910> that<00:04:16.060> each<00:04:16.209> group<00:04:16.600> of

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
with the largest so that each group of

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.529 
with the largest so that each group of
three<00:04:16.979> would<00:04:17.979> have<00:04:18.009> a<00:04:18.220> bigger<00:04:18.729> one<00:04:19.000> and<00:04:19.329> a

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
three would have a bigger one and a

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:20.279 
three would have a bigger one and a
smaller<00:04:19.900> one

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
smaller one

of<00:04:26.380> three<00:04:26.949> beads<00:04:27.400> so<00:04:27.760> I'll<00:04:27.850> put<00:04:28.090> three<00:04:28.300> on<00:04:28.540> each

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
of three beads so I'll put three on each

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.060 
of three beads so I'll put three on each
and<00:04:29.370> let<00:04:30.370> me<00:04:30.490> show<00:04:30.760> you<00:04:30.820> how<00:04:31.150> we<00:04:31.210> do<00:04:31.420> that

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
and let me show you how we do that

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.800 
and let me show you how we do that

nose pliers to twist it open on the
other<00:04:44.030> side<00:04:47.830> and<00:04:48.830> I'm<00:04:49.040> going<00:04:49.310> to<00:04:49.370> start<00:04:49.730> down

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
other side and I'm going to start down

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.880 
other side and I'm going to start down
this<00:04:50.180> end<00:04:50.540> I'm<00:04:50.780> going<00:04:51.020> to<00:04:51.140> slide<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:51.620> jump

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
this end I'm going to slide the jump

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.970 
this end I'm going to slide the jump
ring<00:04:52.130> through<00:04:52.600> one<00:04:53.600> of<00:04:53.720> the<00:04:53.840> large<00:04:54.110> links<00:04:54.740> of

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
ring through one of the large links of

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.160 
ring through one of the large links of
chain<00:04:55.010> and<00:04:55.660> then<00:04:58.240> just<00:04:59.240> so<00:04:59.330> it's<00:04:59.420> not<00:04:59.600> crowded

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
chain and then just so it's not crowded

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.320 
chain and then just so it's not crowded
I'm<00:05:00.290> going<00:05:00.530> to<00:05:00.650> reposition<00:05:01.100> my<00:05:01.490> chain<00:05:02.090> nose

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
I'm going to reposition my chain nose

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.360 
I'm going to reposition my chain nose
pliers<00:05:02.690> so<00:05:03.050> I'm<00:05:03.200> grabbing<00:05:03.650> it<00:05:03.740> with<00:05:03.920> the<00:05:04.070> side

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
pliers so I'm grabbing it with the side

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.190 
pliers so I'm grabbing it with the side
just<00:05:05.270> so<00:05:05.390> that<00:05:05.540> there's<00:05:05.720> a<00:05:05.780> little<00:05:05.900> bit<00:05:06.170> more

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
just so that there's a little bit more

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.190 
just so that there's a little bit more
room<00:05:06.620> to<00:05:06.650> put<00:05:07.100> my<00:05:07.130> dangles<00:05:07.730> on<00:05:07.910> I'm<00:05:08.840> going<00:05:09.080> to

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
room to put my dangles on I'm going to

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:16.050 
room to put my dangles on I'm going to
put<00:05:09.260> on<00:05:09.560> one<00:05:09.830> group<00:05:10.160> of<00:05:10.690> three<00:05:11.800> dangles<00:05:14.980> and

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
put on one group of three dangles and

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.640 
put on one group of three dangles and
then<00:05:17.060> this<00:05:17.180> is<00:05:17.360> where<00:05:17.510> the<00:05:17.660> bent<00:05:17.900> nose<00:05:18.170> chain

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
then this is where the bent nose chain

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.040 
then this is where the bent nose chain
nose<00:05:18.890> come<00:05:19.250> in<00:05:19.400> handy<00:05:19.910> because<00:05:20.540> you<00:05:20.630> can<00:05:20.750> get

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
nose come in handy because you can get

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.490 
nose come in handy because you can get
into<00:05:21.230> tight<00:05:21.560> spaces<00:05:22.060> and<00:05:23.060> now<00:05:23.660> I'm<00:05:23.870> just<00:05:23.900> going

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
into tight spaces and now I'm just going

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.460 
into tight spaces and now I'm just going
to<00:05:24.530> make<00:05:24.890> sure<00:05:25.570> that<00:05:26.570> jump<00:05:26.960> ring<00:05:27.200> is<00:05:27.350> very

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
to make sure that jump ring is very

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.790 
to make sure that jump ring is very
securely<00:05:28.340> closed<00:05:28.820> and<00:05:29.380> then<00:05:30.380> I'm<00:05:30.500> going<00:05:30.770> to

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
securely closed and then I'm going to

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.390 
securely closed and then I'm going to
work<00:05:31.100> my<00:05:31.370> way<00:05:31.580> down<00:05:31.610> this<00:05:32.180> chain<00:05:33.220> adding<00:05:34.220> a

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
work my way down this chain adding a

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.300 
work my way down this chain adding a
group<00:05:34.640> of<00:05:34.880> three<00:05:35.330> bead<00:05:35.630> dangles<00:05:36.350> to<00:05:36.650> each<00:05:37.130> of

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
group of three bead dangles to each of

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.760 
group of three bead dangles to each of
these<00:05:37.430> large<00:05:37.790> links<00:05:38.360> and<00:05:38.770> occasionally

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
these large links and occasionally

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.150 
these large links and occasionally
perhaps<00:05:40.310> catching<00:05:41.120> in<00:05:41.510> one<00:05:42.350> of<00:05:42.500> these<00:05:42.650> smaller

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
perhaps catching in one of these smaller

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.390 
perhaps catching in one of these smaller
chains<00:05:43.700> in<00:05:44.150> the<00:05:44.300> jump<00:05:44.630> ring<00:05:44.950> just<00:05:45.950> to<00:05:46.100> kind<00:05:46.340> of

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
chains in the jump ring just to kind of

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.790 
chains in the jump ring just to kind of
hold<00:05:46.550> it<00:05:46.760> all<00:05:46.880> together<00:05:47.120> so<00:05:48.110> there<00:05:48.410> I've

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
hold it all together so there I've

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.820 
hold it all together so there I've
attached<00:05:49.460> all<00:05:49.880> of<00:05:50.270> my<00:05:50.480> bead<00:05:50.720> dangles<00:05:51.350> in

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
attached all of my bead dangles in

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.630 
attached all of my bead dangles in
clusters<00:05:52.340> of<00:05:52.370> three<00:05:52.580> with<00:05:53.150> jump<00:05:53.540> rings<00:05:53.660> and

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
clusters of three with jump rings and

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.270 
clusters of three with jump rings and
when<00:05:55.640> I<00:05:55.670> kind<00:05:56.000> of<00:05:56.090> ended<00:05:56.330> up<00:05:56.450> doing<00:05:56.930> was

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
when I kind of ended up doing was

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.260 
when I kind of ended up doing was
alternating<00:05:58.280> one<00:05:58.820> jump<00:05:59.240> ring<00:05:59.510> would<00:05:59.900> grab<00:06:00.290> a

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
alternating one jump ring would grab a

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.630 
alternating one jump ring would grab a
this<00:06:02.270> silver<00:06:02.750> chain<00:06:03.050> on<00:06:03.410> one<00:06:03.680> link<00:06:03.980> and<00:06:04.370> then

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:04.640 
this silver chain on one link and then

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.660 
this silver chain on one link and then
the<00:06:04.940> other<00:06:05.180> and<00:06:05.480> the<00:06:05.840> next<00:06:06.110> jump<00:06:06.380> ring<00:06:06.670> would

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:07.670 
the other and the next jump ring would

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.530 
the other and the next jump ring would
grab<00:06:07.970> this<00:06:08.360> black<00:06:08.750> chain<00:06:09.230> and<00:06:09.860> I<00:06:10.850> just<00:06:11.090> kind<00:06:11.420> of

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.540 
grab this black chain and I just kind of

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.500 
grab this black chain and I just kind of
kept<00:06:12.140> going<00:06:12.200> that<00:06:12.710> way<00:06:12.980> and<00:06:13.310> what<00:06:14.030> you<00:06:14.150> end<00:06:14.330> up

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
kept going that way and what you end up

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.230 
kept going that way and what you end up
with<00:06:14.720> this<00:06:14.870> is<00:06:15.110> very<00:06:15.440> full<00:06:16.250> it's<00:06:16.910> actually

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
with this is very full it's actually

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.710 
with this is very full it's actually
quite<00:06:17.630> heavy<00:06:18.520> bracelet<00:06:19.520> and<00:06:19.790> it<00:06:20.300> really<00:06:20.480> is

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 
quite heavy bracelet and it really is

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.220 
quite heavy bracelet and it really is
just<00:06:20.780> a<00:06:21.110> fun<00:06:21.530> kind<00:06:22.070> of<00:06:22.220> party<00:06:22.790> bracelet<00:06:23.420> this

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 
just a fun kind of party bracelet this

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.990 
just a fun kind of party bracelet this
would<00:06:24.470> be<00:06:24.590> great<00:06:24.860> to<00:06:25.160> do<00:06:25.370> with<00:06:25.730> all<00:06:26.920> crystals

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
would be great to do with all crystals

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.240 
would be great to do with all crystals
or<00:06:29.000> it<00:06:29.330> would<00:06:29.480> be<00:06:29.510> wonderful<00:06:29.900> with<00:06:30.740> just<00:06:31.130> a

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
or it would be wonderful with just a

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.640 
or it would be wonderful with just a
monochromatic<00:06:31.820> scheme<00:06:32.660> you<00:06:33.170> could<00:06:33.350> do<00:06:33.500> it

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
monochromatic scheme you could do it

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.250 
monochromatic scheme you could do it
with<00:06:33.890> all<00:06:34.130> pearls<00:06:34.850> of<00:06:35.090> one<00:06:35.330> color<00:06:35.720> it's

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260 
with all pearls of one color it's

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.350 
with all pearls of one color it's
actually<00:06:36.650> a<00:06:36.680> very<00:06:36.800> simple<00:06:37.430> project<00:06:37.670> to<00:06:38.120> put

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 
actually a very simple project to put

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.450 
actually a very simple project to put
together<00:06:38.600> it's<00:06:39.260> just<00:06:39.380> time<00:06:39.800> consuming

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
together it's just time consuming

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.679 
together it's just time consuming
because<00:06:40.790> of<00:06:40.970> the<00:06:41.090> number

00:06:41.679 --> 00:06:41.689 
because of the number
