00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.770 

I<00:04:11.520> said<00:04:12.520> at<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:12.670> beginning<00:04:12.790> of<00:04:13.120> this<00:04:13.270> review

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
I said at the beginning of this review

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.780 
I said at the beginning of this review
that<00:04:14.080> I<00:04:14.110> was<00:04:14.290> using<00:04:14.500> this<00:04:14.710> lens<00:04:15.010> more<00:04:15.400> on<00:04:15.670> my

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
that I was using this lens more on my

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.210 
that I was using this lens more on my
gx7<00:04:16.239> than<00:04:16.660> I<00:04:16.750> was<00:04:16.930> on<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:17.170> GM<00:04:17.410> one<00:04:17.620> that's

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
gx7 than I was on the GM one that's

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.340 
gx7 than I was on the GM one that's
because<00:04:18.580> I<00:04:18.610> find<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.090> GM<00:04:19.360> 1<00:04:19.570> quite<00:04:19.870> limiting

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
because I find the GM 1 quite limiting

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.560 
because I find the GM 1 quite limiting
for<00:04:20.530> my<00:04:20.620> kind<00:04:20.890> of<00:04:21.040> photography<00:04:21.549> it's<00:04:22.270> a<00:04:22.390> great

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
for my kind of photography it's a great

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.840 
for my kind of photography it's a great
little<00:04:22.690> camera<00:04:23.050> but<00:04:23.920> for<00:04:24.070> my<00:04:24.190> kind<00:04:24.490> of<00:04:24.580> picture
