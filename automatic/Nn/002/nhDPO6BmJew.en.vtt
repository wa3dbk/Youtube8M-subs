00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:14.629
 gonzÃ¡lez had just 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.320
 we have a new member in the 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.259
 zoo of chapultepec that is our 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.689
 hippo breeding that was born just the 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:29.259
 flag day on February 24 , 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:32.830
 this year is in excellent 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.780
 health status with your mother this is 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:39.070
 important to comment because the mother 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:42.100
 since he was born that is to say he has had all 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.540
 the care for this breeding is 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.640
 breastfeeding saying still feeds 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.620
 fully of breast milk and something 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.109
 curious is that it feeds it under water 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.129
 that is , the way it feeds the 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:01:00.460
 mother to breeding is in the water under the 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:03.640
 water and that is a little bit to her 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.070
 test solids breeding as pasture 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.140
 Hydroponic loves how to try it and 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.060
 also lie on the grass when it is 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.380
 outside while the mother is 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.270
 feeding 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:18.520
 weaning occurs at around 67 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.320
 months is when the mother stops 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.020
 give milk to the young and she 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.299
 gradually begins to feed on 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.300
 what what the mother eats that in this 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:36.400
 case is carrot 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:38.580
 a balanced and alfalfa girl the fresh 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.950
 of the mother has some care 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.490
 extraordinary that this is what is 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.500
 it is an innate behavior of 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.530
 mothers but sometimes it happens that you do not 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.110
 have they have we had cases not of 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.610
 hippos properly speaking of other 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:01.300
 species for example of dromedaries that 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:04.030
 the mother gives birth and until she ends up seeing 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.360
 their function as a mother is not to say no 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.220
 breastfeeding does not take care of them and you have to 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.560
 do it then is when the doctors 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.840
 veterinarians come into action to 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.060
 carry out the feeding so 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.180
 artificial 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:22.319
 handling is done with the animals after 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:25.440
 having passed the critical period of 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.590
 the pups to place the microchip and 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.349
 I can also review them , the 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.050
 physical containment of the specimens but 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.900
 now we are letting a bit pass 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.180
 more time because the female really 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.310
 she has been very aggressive and nervous 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.709
 when doctors treat like 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.980
 approach but I'll tell you something 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.140
 we all think that there are always 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.549
 a betting pool between the workers and 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:56.489
 doctors and it's almost a fact that it's 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:03:00.000
 a mani that is famous since it 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:03.239
 announced his birth in the media 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.239
 communication has even a twitter in 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.370
 end and it has been wonderful the people of 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.410
 day that was announced to the following the 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.040
 next weekend we had a 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:18.269
 influx of visitors is atypical 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.610
 on a March day a weekend of 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.070
 march by 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.730
 for he wanted a lot of people have come to 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:28.040
 visit her know her name now she gives 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.560
 follow up how much he weighs 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.640
 right now it is weighing over 90 kilograms 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.580
 when he was born he weighed between 30 and 35 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.130
 then yes to the has been an answer 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.340
 very favorable regarding the birth of 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.200
