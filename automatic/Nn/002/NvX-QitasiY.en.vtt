00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hey my loves so i thought i was 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.109
 do my very different video 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.809
 Today, it's about how I wear mine 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.070
 schal continue mostly the same technique 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.179
 always the one I used 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.920
 I think I'll take a look 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.420
 meetings and so on and looking for the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.369
 most beautiful things also out themselves 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.730
 Wear and the world today 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.020
 show and then we start right away 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.789
 so I have such a scarf 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.390
 Just pick a long one 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.340
 a bit thinner and a technique of it 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.489
 so you go take the start behind you 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.820
 you have a shorter page and here 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:40.050
 a longer and beats in you once 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.510
 then rum with the longer side then make 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.110
 this is a bit bigger this one 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.649
 hole this round then aim that here 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.680
 the little piece high just so that one 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.530
 hand by stretch can take that 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.920
 longer pieces and we reach the target 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.710
 is through her only two ends 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.290
 bit back and forth and we already have 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.650
 the first one here you can still one 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:12.030
 pull and turn slightly back and forth 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:15.119
 and that is the first variant exactly like that 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.900
 variant 2 16v we take ours 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.030
 scold us once make it 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.360
 from a hose scarf so rather 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.939
 Just knot the end book for us 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.659
 together 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.430
 and then we have a boy 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.729
 works like a hose already so 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:38.810
 a good knot then train that 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:44.180
 all over once and agrees to that over us 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.180
 then we have a hose scarf exactly 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.439
 so variants 3 and 4 I am now closing 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.570
 say that I am quite similar 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.350
 we take ourselves socially and search the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:01.189
 Take the middle and put it behind 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:07.409
 us so then I reach through here once 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:09.239
 and look at it that's the way it is 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.899
 the most well-known variant is most of them 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.180
 carry 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.769
 but we can also change that 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.510
 by doing this a bit again 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:24.480
 lure and once here and go through 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:29.099
 turn and grab the rest here and and 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:32.420
 once it solves it exactly and then we have 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.420
 now such a variant here 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.319
 ok so my dear that's it i hope 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.689
 I could give you some inspirations 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.810
 give and then see you again soon 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.810
 on
