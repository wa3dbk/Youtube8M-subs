00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
to it it's a neat one and I think it

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.080 
to it it's a neat one and I think it
could<00:03:31.440> work<00:03:31.470> for<00:03:31.769> a<00:03:31.829> lot<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.160> characters<00:03:32.549> the

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
could work for a lot of characters the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.300 
could work for a lot of characters the
best<00:03:33.299> way<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.540> describe<00:03:33.959> it<00:03:34.170> is<00:03:34.230> it<00:03:34.590> looks<00:03:34.859> gray

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
best way to describe it is it looks gray

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.900 
best way to describe it is it looks gray
and<00:03:35.940> so<00:03:36.769> you<00:03:37.769> can<00:03:37.980> kind<00:03:38.190> of<00:03:38.340> compare<00:03:38.730> it<00:03:38.760> to

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
and so you can kind of compare it to

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.240 
and so you can kind of compare it to
another<00:03:39.090> grey<00:03:39.569> body<00:03:40.349> dowel<00:03:40.799> this<00:03:41.069> is<00:03:41.220> a
