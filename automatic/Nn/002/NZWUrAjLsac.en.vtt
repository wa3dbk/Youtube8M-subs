00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 everyone loves that looks like a circle 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.140
 birthday cake for the first 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.599
 Birthday and how I made it 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.179
 you see in the video now 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.679
 Incidentally, I make a wonderful cake 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.179
 recipe as I believe could 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.670
 actually take whatever you like 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.189
 Bisquit I take now 200 grams of sugar 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.609
 1 packet of vanilla sugar and four eggs 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.960
 and hit that on her then needs 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.510
 200 milliliters of oil and 200 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.859
 milliliter of liquid at choice 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.730
 I thought that me 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.460
 apple market take from bms without sugar and 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.680
 This is a bit of water in the water 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.280
 Principle I know is vaccinating the train though 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.710
 no matter 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.219
 yes, that's terrible with water 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.440
 and then that goes with it and then needs 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.579
 you still 200 grams of flour and a pack 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.039
 baking powder I have about 70 grams 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.170
 apple sauce taken or apple 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.890
 make and then the rest of the water and 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.979
 now caritas at 100 milliliters if 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.580
 your super made it looks so 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.130
 which has doubled then you can do that 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.090
 and thanks, then slowly easy 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.090
 shine 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.810
 And if that is underweight you can 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.810
 on the liquid as 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:35.869
 So now the flour is baking powder 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:39.860
 mixed in and you can do that 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.740
 then simply and raise or with 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.149
 the daring machine and next to it 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.560
 I'll just do that quickly with the 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.560
 Stir in the kitchen 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.180
 that's what the dough looks like now and at the 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.509
 wants to acquire 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.310
 because I take it in bowls 1 then 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.780
 Just remove as many as you 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.990
 wanted and tried that evenly 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.990
 divide 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.620
 so now it gets really funny in the 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.810
 background heard my dishwasher 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.459
 I ordered food coloring 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.019
 and that's what amazon can do for you 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:31.730
 deserved to be in front and that was his 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:35.690
 whole moment shows you it looks 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.950
 and I take but only the blue resp 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.320
 I wondered if I might 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.900
 but mix we look again and 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.820
 hofer so in Germany ali gave it 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.410
 last as here i think that gets 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.900
 but also at his shop which 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.299
 is linked 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:54.410
 and now I will color I have 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:56.329
 wants itself never done so 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.880
 Not many tips today because 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.620
 it will be absolute for me too 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.660
 self-experiment but I just try 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.660
 to get six different shades of blue 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.180
 since no berben he succeeded I have here 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.980
 the wild colors are taken from these 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.390
 both and I really have now 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.190
 I think I made six different ones 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.840
 to create shades of blue 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.360
 I looked at the dosage 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.190
 These colors are almost a little bit like 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.120
 Practically with the other one must be so 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.660
 with toothpicks purely fumble and now 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.780
 go on 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.760
 so I have the back tube to 160 degrees 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.580
 circulating air preheated and these are the 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.760
 shape with which I later quasi 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.740
 to cut out the cake 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.410
 and now I have to try all six 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.030
 Somehow it's nice to paint here 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.880
 to get sheet metal and I do that 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.490
 so now that has really better 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.220
 worked as expected and that is what I have 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:14.430
 just that spotted and then 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.200
 always looked if that goes out nicely 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.320
 Here you can get a little close 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.650
 but basically should be different from everyone 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.300
 color one-off going out and now must 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.210
 They only really do the rest 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.280
 So do not distribute pendant if that is not 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.940
 looks nice and that's what it is for 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.370
 my first try is beauty farm 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:40.460
 it comes now in the tube and I 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:43.169
 so estimate the 20 minutes 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:46.530
 I'll take a look, but I believe it 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:48.419
 it takes another 20 to 25 minutes 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.870
 I think I will need it for sure 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.280
 both the colors are still yes at the moment 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.380
 same as before 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.450
 I already have a clean one here 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.590
 dishcloth prepared for it 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.710
 I overthrow her 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:05.160
 so left biscuit or biscuit dough 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.710
 but something like that is so afraid that 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.410
 Otherwise he would not be baking paper 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.860
 let eat or no idea what means 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.930
 their 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.870
 I just like it now so I feel 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.760
 me safer that was now 20 minutes 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.840
 and i made the chopsticks sample 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:24.840
 and as you can see that looks good and 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.760
 So now I'm supporting for more than 20 years 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.190
 minutes you would not have them inside 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.950
 and I'll let you know 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.950
 10 is today I am for them 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.050
 namely all alone at home and have 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.250
 only two hands and one reform has one 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.620
 tendonitis 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:44.010
 and then that was all and so 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.320
 further but we did it with 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.560
 a tear whereby I do not know if 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.570
 because not even from the application emerged 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:55.700
 is and now comes the hour of 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:58.620
 truth, whether that will end 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.720
 But I will let it cool down first 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.460
 before i exhibitor respectively 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.360
 no and i am now on one 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:08.660
 birthday party as happy from la 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.660
 jolla 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:15.780
 I'm just sort of circles there now 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.610
 off and with the remaining dough the 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.250
 I will still paybox 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:24.900
 but then it could be easy 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:26.370
 first so only as an idea cake pops 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.070
 you could make it out of it 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.810
 it would be a pity the way too 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.400
 throw 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:35.640
 So the color looks almost a bit 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.950
 gestic from that intense is that and me 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.410
 have now all in plastic wrap 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.720
 and then it will be tomorrow 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:46.410
 I like it very much 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.870
 think it's really cool and yes me 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.530
 I will continue to process this tomorrow 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.110
 or 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:54.600
 then comes his turn and me 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.850
 show it then the final result on 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.630
 In any case, they are still easy 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.630
 in the refrigirator 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:10.400
 thanks is done than just the simple 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:15.800
 cream on syringe and then comes 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:18.819
 the next lid on it and that's how it looks 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.819
 then finished
