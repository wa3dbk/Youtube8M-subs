 generation a product line that we 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.520
 of Milan we decided to make 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.829
 with the clear aim of allowing the 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.140
 communication between motorcyclists so 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.600

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.760

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.840
 generation is called that way 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.820
 not just because the three intercom models 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.180
 who are part of it represent one 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.979

 but also because within this one 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.729
 line we added two new ones 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.909
 cutting-edge products that are the 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.530

 to illustrate to you now those that are the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.790
 unique features that are common to 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.520
 all three of our models 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.750
 intercom only later me 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.790
 I'm going to focus on 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.439
 characteristics of every single bit e 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.590
 on the characteristics of our two 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.840
 new products absolutely innovative 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.240
 and unique on the market and the function taken away 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.690
 the universal inter with this ours 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.920
 revolutionary function allow 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.630
 err communication between the 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.580
 motorcyclists who share the same 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.200
 passion for the bike but who can 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.980
 also use the intercoms of 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.110
 different brands 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.060
 this means that with the function 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.670
 removed the universal inter with is 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.440
 You can match one of ours 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.360

 other intercoms of brands other than 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.970
 that land then leaves that yours 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.010

 possible to have gps in the background 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.350

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.330
 Follow the instructions of your GPS 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.010

 stop communicating with 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.910
 other motorcyclists 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.280

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.370
 redesigned to increase quality e 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.920

 only one software to facilitate the 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.060
 setting mode e 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.660

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.750
 for the telephone call 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.370
 let's now analyze those that 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.560
 are the technical characteristics of the 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.739
 our bt we start with our top of 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.599
 range invite next this intercom 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.730
 represents the forefather of ours 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.220
 intercom line and allows one 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.079
 communication up to six people with a 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.659

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.069
 moreover we have the possibility to have 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:48.260
 two connections toto all 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.319

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.379
 two bluetooth connections one 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.590
 generally used for the telephone 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.739
 and the other for the gps great news is the 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.090
 fm radio with six storable stations 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.250
 so that your music is your radio

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.659
 our btx 2 which represents a banking 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:16.699

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:18.380
 intercom you can connect up to 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.720
 three helmets and has a range of 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.389
 about 800 meters 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.419
 invitation x2 involves conversations or pilot 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.669
 passenger or motorcycle act not 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.889
 let's forget that even at di fix ii is 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.720
 possible to connect an intercom of 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.360
 others but different from milan because 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.400
 has a connection and torture 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.800
 let's move on to our basic intercom 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.690
 or our bp x1 and represents 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.940
 however a high quality product 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.380
 let's say a cutting-edge product 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.810
 this intercom is perfect for those who don't 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.340

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.620
 need to communicate with others 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.330
 motorcyclists but is excellent for the 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.250
 passenger pilot communication e 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.669
 provides a range of about 10 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.740
 meters 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.810
 to remember that also the dt xoom 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.970
 has a talk to all connection 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.650
 plus an extra connection to be able to 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.740
 match with yours of these many 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.120
 the smokes mobile milan is always careful 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.650

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.450
 all your needs 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.490
 and that is why all the myths of the 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.110
 our next generation line are 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.150
 available for purchase either in single or 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.350
 inverse of tron 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.210
 as I have already mentioned to you at the beginning of 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.160
 this tutorial within the line 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.360
 next generation and ambition we have 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.820
 added two more new products 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.100
 cutting edge and one of these is ours 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.380
 remote clothes the bitters and much more not 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.120
 is that a remote control or bluetooth that is 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.010
 position on the value of your bike 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.290
 and it is possible without taking your hands off 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.690
 from the handlebar manage all the 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:40.200
 functionality of our next btp 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.850
 meetic on the ebit x1 our glass 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.860
 many very easy to install e 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.639
 moreover thanks to these two thicknesses that 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.710
 we of the Milan 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:48.360
 we insert directly into the package 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.940
 we guarantee maximum adherence 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.410
 stability all types of handlebars la 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.890
 second novelty of the next line 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.330
 generation is the g8 avoid the mild games it is 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.949
 a 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.900
 to professional with technology 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:02.780
 bluetooth that allows you to communicate 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:05.060
 practically without limits up to 12 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.250
 kilometers in the open field 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.400
 however, they are not useful among the radio 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.719
 and the bp games helmet is ideal for the 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.819
 motorbike or for groups of 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:15.379
 bikers mainly because they can 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:18.500
 combine with any type of intercom 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:20.120
 milan a milan to have more 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.280
 details on the use of our new ones 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.169
 products of the nextel and ration line not 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.530
 miss my next tutorials
