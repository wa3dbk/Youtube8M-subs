pattern and there are a lot of no
changes<00:01:01.370> going<00:01:01.550> on<00:01:01.790> but<00:01:02.210> it<00:01:02.780> could<00:01:02.960> be<00:01:03.160> broken

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
changes going on but it could be broken

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.680 
changes going on but it could be broken
down<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:04.550> explained<00:01:04.970> pretty<00:01:05.239> simply

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
then pulling off to the index finger of

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.570 
then pulling off to the index finger of
your<00:01:32.810> left<00:01:32.840> hand<00:01:33.110> which<00:01:33.410> is<00:01:33.440> already<00:01:34.190> waited

your left hand which is already waited
under<00:01:34.850> note<00:01:35.740> and<00:01:36.740> then<00:01:37.130> hammering<00:01:37.640> on<00:01:38.020> also<00:01:39.020> if

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
under note and then hammering on also if

under note and then hammering on also if
your<00:01:39.470> left<00:01:39.650> hand<00:01:40.030> some<00:01:41.030> note<00:01:41.240> in<00:01:41.479> between

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
your left hand some note in between

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.249 
your left hand some note in between
those<00:01:41.990> two<00:01:42.200> in<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:43.190> case<00:01:43.520> of<00:01:43.759> the<00:01:44.030> first<00:01:44.780> set

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
those two in the case of the first set

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:55.280 
those two in the case of the first set
of<00:01:45.290> notes<00:01:45.590> we<00:01:46.340> have<00:01:46.869> 2012<00:01:47.950> 17

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.750 

so<00:01:56.290> that<00:01:56.620> whole<00:01:56.800> pattern<00:01:57.040> of<00:01:57.250> starting<00:01:57.640> with

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
so that whole pattern of starting with

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.300 
so that whole pattern of starting with
your<00:01:57.910> right<00:01:58.060> hand<00:01:58.350> pulling<00:01:59.350> off<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.860> the<00:02:00.010> left

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
your right hand pulling off to the left

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.830 
your right hand pulling off to the left
the<00:02:00.580> next<00:02:00.880> finger<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:01.390> then<00:02:01.540> hammering

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
the next finger and then hammering

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.900 
the next finger and then hammering
something<00:02:02.080> up<00:02:02.320> that's<00:02:03.040> what<00:02:03.220> I<00:02:03.280> do<00:02:03.340> for<00:02:03.730> this

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
something up that's what I do for this

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.400 
something up that's what I do for this
whole<00:02:04.120> part<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:04.720> it's<00:02:04.900> basically<00:02:05.320> just

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
whole part and it's basically just

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.580 
whole part and it's basically just
several<00:02:06.010> groupings<00:02:06.520> of<00:02:06.820> three<00:02:07.090> notes<00:02:07.930> you

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
several groupings of three notes you

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.680 
several groupings of three notes you
know<00:02:08.679> played<00:02:09.190> really<00:02:09.399> quickly

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
know played really quickly

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.530 
know played really quickly
it<00:02:11.170> starts<00:02:11.650> off<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:14.260> know<00:02:14.380> relatively<00:02:15.010> simply

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
it starts off you know relatively simply

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.410 
it starts off you know relatively simply
alternating<00:02:16.540> between<00:02:17.940> what<00:02:18.940> is<00:02:19.090> four

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
alternating between what is four

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.150 
alternating between what is four
patterns<00:02:19.840> are<00:02:20.020> like<00:02:20.050> four<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.709> can<00:02:20.830> even<00:02:20.980> call

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
patterns are like four you can even call

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.620 
patterns are like four you can even call
the<00:02:21.280> chords<00:02:21.660> arpeggiator<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:25.030> try<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.450> keep

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
the chords arpeggiator and I try to keep

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.840 
the chords arpeggiator and I try to keep
a<00:02:25.780> lot<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:26.050> notes<00:02:26.260> in<00:02:26.500> common<00:02:26.950> swishing<00:02:27.730> these

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
a lot of notes in common swishing these

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.520 
a lot of notes in common swishing these
chords<00:02:28.239> so<00:02:28.510> it<00:02:28.690> kind<00:02:29.020> of<00:02:29.050> sounds<00:02:29.380> like<00:02:29.440> a

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
chords so it kind of sounds like a

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.880 
chords so it kind of sounds like a
graduation<00:02:29.830> not<00:02:30.670> something<00:02:31.440> not<00:02:32.440> really

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
graduation not something not really

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.940 
graduation not something not really
wacky<00:02:33.250> going<00:02:33.580> on<00:02:33.700> but<00:02:34.420> so<00:02:35.230> first<00:02:35.560> we've<00:02:35.770> got

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
wacky going on but so first we've got

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.690 
wacky going on but so first we've got
2012<00:02:36.550> 17<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:41.440> for<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:41.770> second<00:02:42.130> one<00:02:42.250> we<00:02:42.310> keep

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
2012 17 and for the second one we keep

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.110 
2012 17 and for the second one we keep
the<00:02:42.910> 20<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.480> 12<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:44.080> shift<00:02:44.950> at<00:02:45.190> 17<00:02:45.790> down

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
the 20 and the 12 and shift at 17 down

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.020 
the 20 and the 12 and shift at 17 down
to<00:02:46.420> 50
