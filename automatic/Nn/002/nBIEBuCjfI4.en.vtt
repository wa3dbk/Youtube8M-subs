even run into research through the eyes
of<00:00:33.329> pigeon<00:00:35.690> in<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.870> end<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.350> have<00:00:37.710> developed<00:00:38.040> a

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
of pigeon in the end I have developed a

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.280 
of pigeon in the end I have developed a
system<00:00:38.850> called<00:00:38.879> h<00:00:39.800> lda<00:00:40.800> s<00:00:41.420> which<00:00:42.420> means<00:00:42.719> one's

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
system called h lda s which means one's

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.170 
system called h lda s which means one's
life<00:00:43.950> decoding<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.260> application<00:00:46.260> system<00:00:48.320> but

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
life decoding and application system but

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.119 
life decoding and application system but
lately<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.449> have<00:00:51.660> been<00:00:51.690> inquired<00:00:52.649> by<00:00:52.829> many

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
lately I have been inquired by many

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.410 
lately I have been inquired by many
fences<00:00:54.770> they<00:00:55.770> complained<00:00:56.370> about<00:00:56.489> difficulty

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
fences they complained about difficulty

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.979 
fences they complained about difficulty
to<00:00:57.829> take<00:00:58.829> photo<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.399> eyes<00:01:00.920> pigeon<00:01:02.059> so<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.600> take

to take photo of eyes pigeon so I take

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.469 
to take photo of eyes pigeon so I take
this<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.379> make<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.860> video<00:01:05.210> just<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:08.390> let<00:01:09.390> you

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
this I make this video just to let you

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.510 
this I make this video just to let you
know<00:01:09.659> but<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.320> not<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.710> difficult

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
know but it's not that difficult

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.899 
know but it's not that difficult
what<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.360> need<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:12.960> really<00:01:13.549> good<00:01:14.549> camera

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
what you need it's really good camera

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.260 
what you need it's really good camera
with<00:01:15.900> cross<00:01:16.409> lens<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.670> take<00:01:18.060> the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
with cross lens so that you can take the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.429 
with cross lens so that you can take the
photo<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:19.500> within<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.670> very<00:01:21.090> closely<00:01:21.409> to<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
photo in within a very closely to the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.950 
photo in within a very closely to the
dance<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.869> I<00:01:25.640> think<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.390> not<00:01:27.689> too

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
dance and I think it is not too

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.520 
dance and I think it is not too
difficult

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
difficult

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.749 
difficult
nowaday<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.820> easily<00:01:30.259> buy<00:01:31.490> cross<00:01:32.490> bands

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
nowaday you can easily buy cross bands

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.130 
nowaday you can easily buy cross bands
something<00:01:33.750> like<00:01:34.189> well<00:01:35.189> 300<00:01:35.880> dollars<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.900> then

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
something like well 300 dollars and then

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.569 
something like well 300 dollars and then
the<00:01:40.579> most<00:01:41.579> important<00:01:42.180> thing<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.600> such<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.579> first

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
the most important thing is such a first

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.069 
the most important thing is such a first
fried<00:01:44.990> so<00:01:45.990> with<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.829> fresh<00:01:47.759> fried<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.360> fresh

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
fried so with this fresh fried a fresh

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.289 
fried so with this fresh fried a fresh
light<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:50.220> can<00:01:50.720> cut<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.049> mic<00:01:52.229> into<00:01:52.939> eyes<00:01:53.939> of

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
light you can cut the mic into eyes of

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.899 
light you can cut the mic into eyes of
pigeon<00:01:54.659> either<00:01:55.290> from<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.829> top<00:01:56.130> from<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
pigeon either from the top from the

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.380 
pigeon either from the top from the
bottom<00:01:57.240> or<00:01:57.689> from<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.439> side<00:01:58.850> all<00:01:59.850> depends

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
bottom or from the side all depends

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.370 
bottom or from the side all depends
though

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
though

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.139 
though
what<00:02:03.380> you<00:02:03.469> like<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:05.200> usually<00:02:06.200> it<00:02:06.740> wouldíve<00:02:07.219> my

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
what you like and usually it wouldíve my

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.670 
what you like and usually it wouldíve my
spot<00:02:08.830> in<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:10.009> ice<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:10.610> of<00:02:11.000> course<00:02:11.269> you<00:02:11.510> try<00:02:11.810> to

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
spot in the ice and of course you try to

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.369 
spot in the ice and of course you try to
locate<00:02:13.010> this<00:02:13.310> white<00:02:13.730> spot<00:02:13.970> at<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.690> place<00:02:15.019> you

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
locate this white spot at the place you

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.460 
locate this white spot at the place you
worked<00:02:15.769> so<00:02:16.280> that<00:02:16.489> you<00:02:16.670> can<00:02:17.049> see<00:02:18.049> the<00:02:18.110> whole

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
worked so that you can see the whole

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.970 
worked so that you can see the whole
picture<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.790> ice<00:02:20.290> so<00:02:21.290> it's<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.739> simple

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
picture of the ice so it's that simple

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.800 
picture of the ice so it's that simple
of<00:02:22.370> course<00:02:24.160> some<00:02:26.140> details<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.440> have<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.590> find

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
of course some details you have to find

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.869 
of course some details you have to find
you<00:02:29.810> have<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:30.049> try<00:02:30.349> yourself<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:31.310> find<00:02:31.670> the

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
you have to try yourself and find the

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:36.789 
you have to try yourself and find the
best<00:02:32.090> solution<00:02:32.690> for<00:02:32.870> instance<00:02:35.140> if<00:02:36.140> you<00:02:36.500> put

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
best solution for instance if you put

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.199 
best solution for instance if you put
the<00:02:37.010> ice<00:02:37.250> too<00:02:37.879> far<00:02:38.150> away<00:02:38.420> from<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:39.620> lens

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
the ice too far away from the lens

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.960 
the ice too far away from the lens
usually<00:02:41.209> it<00:02:41.329> can<00:02:41.480> be<00:02:42.940> overexposed<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.950> light

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
usually it can be overexposed to light

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.199 
usually it can be overexposed to light
or<00:02:46.970> if<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:47.660> put<00:02:47.900> through<00:02:48.230> calls<00:02:48.590> then<00:02:49.190> is<00:02:49.459> to

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
or if you put through calls then is to

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.800 
or if you put through calls then is to
talk<00:02:50.450> so<00:02:51.019> what<00:02:51.950> is<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.569> best<00:02:55.060> distance<00:02:56.060> and

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
talk so what is the best distance and

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.220 
talk so what is the best distance and
this<00:02:57.799> also<00:02:58.340> have<00:02:58.970> something<00:02:59.269> to<00:02:59.569> do<00:02:59.690> with<00:02:59.720> the

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
this also have something to do with the

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.869 
this also have something to do with the
strength<00:03:01.209> well<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.569> light

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
strength well the light

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:10.509 
strength well the light
are<00:03:04.879> you<00:03:05.090> needed<00:03:05.359> I<00:03:05.510> to<00:03:05.569> use<00:03:06.139> so<00:03:08.019> secondly<00:03:09.519> of
