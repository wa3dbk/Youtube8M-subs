00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.079
 we wanted to create this DVD in order to 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.290
 show the importance of stretching in 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.579
 sports practice indeed it is 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.530
 active to dynamics in the phase 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.329
 warm-up or passive at half-time 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.199
 and a fan match or even in 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.180
 specific sessions 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.300
 they will be an indispensable tool for 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.920
 the sportsman's wellbeing the interest here and 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.839
 to show and bring to technicians 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:01:04.710
 and practitioners an optimal correction 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:01:05.970
 on learning a stretch the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.470
 stretching are known and proposed to 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.030
 long time ago by educators and 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.260
 physiotherapists before by the nations 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.240
 louder now speaks truly 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.220
 stretching are a real 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.320
 It is necessary to have an area of 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.729
 many books are devoted to it and 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.810
 even many scientific studies 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.490
 we know that stretching 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.689
 regularly is an effective factor of 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.950
 fight against injuries along 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.760
 term 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.900
 on the other hand any doctor a 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.540
 physiotherapist has experienced 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.799
 let's continue in his office the stretching 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.689
 are an integral part of the arsenal 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.220
 therapeutic as well as the 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.350
 muscle building or work for 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.490
 pray it's finally I would say that 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.890
 footballer is certainly among the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.300
 most real sportsmen do not get 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.430
 shoot because a denominational leak 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.110
 for a footballer and for all those 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.180
 who supervise the teams whose technip 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.950
 loses just about all coaches do not 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.510
 suggest periods of stretching at 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.280
 training course before or after 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.510
 the game can be considered a 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.370
 sect 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.100
 when it's probably objective 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.659
 matic deferred when we will stretch 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.860
 before a match or after a match before 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.530
 during training or 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.850
 after but exaggerating can almost 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.010
 consider footballer that we can 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.840
 stretch at any moment then started to 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.149
 shoot there are different techniques 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.739
 of magnetic other passive ethics to 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.409
 tourism assets is a technique of 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.069
 contract released in revocation 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.599
 it is advisable to have a good 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.610
 anatomy knowledge I speak to 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.680
 educators 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.080
 will iterate little and know a few 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.340
 simple rules the positioning of the 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.410
 basin is a good example 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.480
 finally definitely what's right 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.670
 to teach patients is to 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.960
 feel the painful tension again 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.910
 two muscle groups there you were 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.320
 in conclusion we must always remember 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.750
 that stretching is unique to everyone 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.760
 we intensity their repetition before 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.380
 the moment when are realized as 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.240
 much technical as on the subject 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.160
 of a very young apprenticeship for us 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.450
 around the age of 12, and that's all 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.100
 along with his football life that everyone 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.200
 go and must learn to master 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.459
 techniques will retain the ones that are me 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.150
 the most profitable for his well-being 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.150
 and very powerful
