found<00:00:18.359> footprints<00:00:18.720> just<00:00:19.590> in<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.800> little<00:00:20.390> water

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
found footprints just in a little water

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.200 
found footprints just in a little water
at<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.720> side<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.109> road

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
at the side of the road

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.099 
at the side of the road
they've<00:00:24.210> clear-cut<00:00:24.840> now<00:00:25.730> so<00:00:26.730> I'm<00:00:27.689> guessing

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
they've clear-cut now so I'm guessing

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.560 
they've clear-cut now so I'm guessing
there's<00:00:28.320> still<00:00:28.470> something<00:00:28.710> around<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.429> just

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
there's still something around I just

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.120 
there's still something around I just
I'm<00:00:30.570> not<00:00:30.630> sure<00:00:30.750> when<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.470> footprints<00:00:31.949> got

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
I'm not sure when the footprints got

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.840 
I'm not sure when the footprints got
there<00:00:33.920> she's<00:00:34.920> hard<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.190> tell<00:00:35.489> us<00:00:35.640> what's

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
there she's hard to tell us what's

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.190 
there she's hard to tell us what's
written<00:00:36.059> sometimes<00:00:36.540> unless<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:37.020> really

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
written sometimes unless it's really

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.760 
written sometimes unless it's really
fresh<00:00:38.030> snow<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.210> great<00:00:39.450> snow<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.200> fantastic

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
fresh snow is great snow is a fantastic

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.959 
fresh snow is great snow is a fantastic
way<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.719> see<00:00:42.719> who's<00:00:42.960> been<00:00:43.200> there<00:00:43.410> when<00:00:43.649> but<00:00:44.309> in

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
way to see who's been there when but in

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.049 
way to see who's been there when but in
the<00:00:45.750> mine<00:00:45.930> where<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.469> water<00:00:46.739> she's<00:00:47.730> hard<00:00:47.940> to

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
the mine where the water she's hard to

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.000 
the mine where the water she's hard to
tell

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
tell

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.889 
tell
so

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
so

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.459 
so
this<00:00:53.440> is<00:00:53.620> probably<00:00:53.860> considered<00:00:54.160> road<00:00:54.760> hunting

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
this is probably considered road hunting

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.990 
this is probably considered road hunting
although<00:00:56.469> I'm<00:00:56.680> just<00:00:56.920> on<00:00:57.040> the<00:00:57.070> way<00:00:57.340> up<00:00:57.579> to<00:00:57.820> where

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
although I'm just on the way up to where

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.299 
although I'm just on the way up to where
I'm<00:00:58.180> going<00:00:58.350> what<00:00:59.350> if<00:00:59.469> I<00:00:59.559> see<00:00:59.739> something<00:01:00.129> and

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
I'm going what if I see something and

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.280 
I'm going what if I see something and
it's<00:01:01.090> get<00:01:01.300> about<00:01:01.620> also<00:01:02.620> I<00:01:03.010> get<00:01:03.250> it

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
it's get about also I get it

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.820 
it's get about also I get it
these<00:01:05.950> clear<00:01:06.280> cuts<00:01:08.490> no<00:01:09.490> and<00:01:09.910> they<00:01:10.000> do<00:01:10.060> it<00:01:10.830> it's

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
these clear cuts no and they do it it's

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.860 
these clear cuts no and they do it it's
kind<00:01:12.010> of<00:01:12.070> messed<00:01:12.340> up<00:01:12.460> their<00:01:12.640> migration<00:01:13.390> so

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
kind of messed up their migration so

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.420 
kind of messed up their migration so
where<00:01:14.050> they<00:01:14.170> were<00:01:14.290> last<00:01:14.590> year<00:01:14.920> is<00:01:15.040> not<00:01:15.220> where

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
where they were last year is not where

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.310 
where they were last year is not where
they<00:01:15.550> are<00:01:15.670> this<00:01:15.850> year

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.980 

because<00:01:21.100> where<00:01:21.700> they<00:01:21.850> would<00:01:22.000> bed<00:01:22.180> down<00:01:22.450> isn't

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
because where they would bed down isn't

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.219 
because where they would bed down isn't
there

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
there

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.749 
there
