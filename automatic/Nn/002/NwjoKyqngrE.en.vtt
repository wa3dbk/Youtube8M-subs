00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.380
 The wild horse from North America 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.220
 the legendary musclecars from the usa 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.910
 both listening patterns on the name 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:08.110
 of course history of 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.840
 america pays or ross of prayer 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:16.770
 The history of America already 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.770
 freedom of your course 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.190
 The 54-year-old Konrad Gerber is the 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.380
 the head of a family farm 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.990
 of horses and especially mustangs 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:46.290
 needs a lot of love and passion with 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.470
 mustafa that 's very different 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:54.690
 that's just normal 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.690
 That's what makes fascination happen 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.170
 precision 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.490
 that is more important than the cs and the 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.510
 teach mio 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.510
 This is 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.900
 since the 16th century we know the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:53.890
 Eyes are the wild horses 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:57.100
 relatively small but very strong 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.410
 is also the new model of ford 51 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:04.350
 years after the first generation he is 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.350
 arrived in his sixth generation 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:14.280
 if you have the product and the car extremely 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:20.720
 for parallel so I would have that 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.720
 Beefy was aggressive 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.830
 That's that's what's on the beach 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.590
 the new one comes as cabriolet and as 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.870
 Coupe in Switzerland on the market 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.530
 modern with 4 cylinders and traditional 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:48.239
 with five liter v8 engine 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:50.609
 our v8 makes 426 hp the new looks 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.000
 still looking like a real ford 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.000
 mustang 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.349
 design optically 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.810
 he does not just look good he drives 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.599
 also so three hardness levels for the 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.289
 steer much sport and new with 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:47.289
 single wheel suspension 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:02.240
 the trend could be for us ps junkies though 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.740
 even more scream but just that 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.289
 must then have adapted 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.150
 nobody would have been here a few years ago 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:18.919
 on a mustang with four cylinders 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:24.069
 wagered madness as the corporation 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:24.069
 he's known for being the whole world 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.670
 madness absolute madness very direct 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:39.760
 of course, lektor claim very well 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:44.310
 through the street just makes power yes 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.310
 fun is just fun 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.890
 No, then you can hang up to 15000 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.620
 Franks cost around three to four 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:08.550
 then you get that sort of horse too 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:12.150
 car from 43,000 francs is the mustang 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:16.530
 as v8 to have our test car costs 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:20.630
 including accessories 48,500 francs and that 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.630
 is almost a bargain
