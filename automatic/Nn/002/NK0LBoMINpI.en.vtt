00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.510
 cruises.de the cruise travel office 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.849
 on the Internet 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.500
 today it's about a shipping company of 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.880
 I know that many of you there are completely 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.619
 are particularly interested because you are there 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.529
 not so much information gets 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.619
 and I still have old material 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.269
 on the hard disk had the disney 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.560
 magic not published yet 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.960
 I was then that is already one 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.359
 actually 2010 with it 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.859
 have turned on there but until today is 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.279
 this material is not published 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.840
 been 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.550
 and I thought to myself when I want that 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.960
 you in no case denied and 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.050
 That's why we're watching the Disney 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.760
 magic in detail to the disney magic is 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.050
 the first cruise ship of the disney 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.710
 cruise line since 1998 she is in action 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.399
 294 meters long 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.710
 then built at fincantieri in italy 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.760
 with 877 cabins and she looks like that 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.190
 a bit like such a classic 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.920
 ocean liner yes we'll look at how 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.629
 that looks like if the disney magic too 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.390
 A trip that started back then was in 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.110
 dover and there you can see right 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.330
 good mood 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.090
 so yes if you have children or or 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.590
 older children already so yes there are the 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.170
 Of course totally thrilled and from the 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.570
 cottage of course that is clear 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.520
 mickey mouse minnie mouse and donald duck 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.110
 Come on, we'll look at it all the time 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.840
 This urge to look the way stone is 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.670
 only one dummy you have so out 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.410
 optical reasons set there because 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.340
 the whole thing just like such a small one 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.750
 should look 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.930
 There is another one now 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.910
 slide that is now the food 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.660
 area that is meant for younger for 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.060
 Familys 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.810
 there are cartoons 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.940
 For example, shown on the 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.040
 giant screen is but still again 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.800
 Now here are the dress broken 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.000
 that is now an area of ​​only for 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.530
 Adults is there so you can certainly 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.910
 also have his rest that is also possible 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.070
 On such a business ship is now 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.460
 not so there is now sound reinforcement 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.810
 so to speak, the whole day is indeed the 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.180
 Of course you can do sport as well 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.720
 For example, if you play basketball 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.720
 you want them the 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.880
 or table football 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.660
 Let's see what else is there 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.380
 for dining options for example 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.120
 pinocchio tip yes pizza course one 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.260
 I have to on every cruise ship 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.880
 I think there is no cruise ship where 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.370
 There are no pizza or soft drinks 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.960
 Incidentally included in the travel price so there 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.790
 you do not need a softdrink package or 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.200
 so but the price is also a 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.930
 a bit higher would be in between 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.380
 sometimes hunger groupies galley is there 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.450
 here 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.220
 or are there snacks or at 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.340
 of course, totally popular with children 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.560
 icecream we look purely times 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.240
 then of course are lots of disney 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.200
 to see again and again 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.610
 The ship can be there then 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.130
 take pictures or you can too 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.630
 photograph yourself if you want 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.860
 the style is not so cheesy 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.810
 colorful or as you might think 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.910
 could be like that but relative 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.610
 Top just how to get one 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.080
 of the three main restaurants pure lima so 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.210
 a touch of French 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.340
 is every evening somewhere else and rotated 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.670
 then always with his people with the 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.680
 man sitting at the table and the cellars 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.860
 After that you could eat after that 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.320
 to go to the studio for example around there 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.630
 to sing karaoke if you enjoy it 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.700
 yes then there is an area of 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.380
 is not for adults only because it is there 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.750
 somehow not adult-free goes no 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.340
 but because 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.620
 the adults still a little rest 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.300
 shall have and may want 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.390
 yes there is, for example, there 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:36.070
 this rock in bar with great live music 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.930
 there was already principle quite good mood 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.720
 and where would it be a bit quieter 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.910
 maybe that's what a piano is for 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.660
 entertainer as the saying goes 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.130
 the right thing 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.130
 great view of the way out 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:55.400
 yes, the theater on board of course with 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.900
 Disney shot in the quality 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.310
 simply terrific as one that you do 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.670
 for example, from the 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.670
 Disney leisure parks 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:20.100
 then there is also a cinema there then 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.340
 also to see current films from Disney 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.830
 and the sub-brands so to speak so the 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.479
 Immediately recognizable as disney 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.759
 of course I can go shopping 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.680
 on board so i think if you have kids 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:33.660
 then you should have this with you 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.580
 children do not live in this because 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.930
 otherwise it can be incredibly expensive 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.370
 and then the credit card is at one time 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.139
 locked because the limit is overdrawn 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.900
 or soja that would not be nice though 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:45.389
 you can already see how everything is designed 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.630
 is really with attention to detail so 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:50.639
 whoever disney in any way must 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.620
 you just say that is very accurate 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.120
 really obmann and children with it or has 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.150
 not that is my assessment 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.800
 but suitable for everyone 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.860
 yes here at American shipping companies 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.270
 very popular an art auction one sees 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.660
 Not necessarily with disney 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.699
 motives but also so who so 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.280
 what have ever hang in the living room 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:14.130
 Today the Canada beat a nice one 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.660
 promenade deck is yes there it is 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.430
 is such a place where I always completely 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.889
 especially like to stay because of it 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:24.180
 white is shady and can be there too 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:26.639
 jog and take place on the disney magic 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.860
 really quite succeeded this area 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.990
 So it is pleasant to see there is still there 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.810
 a little something going on we go into it 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.599
 Of course, a gym is also a must 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.949
 board we do not look so full 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:40.320
 this trip and a quick look too 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:41.789
 again in an outside cabin the cabin 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.729
 The cabins are for at least 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:47.430
 he always thought of three people for four 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:51.630
 and yes that's just the design 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:53.220
 as it was then in 2010 and that 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.690
 was now no balcony cabin but just 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.020
 just an outside cabin yes and you 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:00.210
 here has two rooms in the room 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.919
 tubs and sinks and then 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.960
 a second, which of course was perfect 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:06.810
 for families is another 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:10.080
 sink and then a toilet yes 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:12.690
 so in a nutshell of the disney 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.630
 magic and that was really one of those days 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.340

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.960
