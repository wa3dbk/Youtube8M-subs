00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.530

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.720
 this plateau another founder of by means of internet dating this 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.310
 times ludovic office you have you create the attractive ward site that gets 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.710
 wants none of us face you psychiatrist philippe bruno 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.529
 you are the president of the international observatory of the couple 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.410
 teaching director in sexology and university paris 5 finally 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.780
 a sociologist specializing in private relationships in singly françois singly 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.360
 we are experiencing a mutation in the love relationship a change 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.190
 maybe including a return to reality do you agree 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.650
 with that analysis agree with that in fact we realized 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.570
 than 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.350
 we had passed quickly with the website of all virtual 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.440
 is a rather individualistic approach 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.730
 and for 100 th it generated a lot of people who were so dissatisfied 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.870
 decided met quite disappointed 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.960
 I then understood that I was disappointed 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.820
 because already a lot too many people on a site from the moment 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.100
 where you put millions of people on the same site bah have 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.460
 spent a crazy time meeting someone who matches you 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.360
 % and patata for a beggar feeling of lack of confidence because you 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.950
 do not know necessarily exit you will fall that is to say that you creator 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.600
 of internet sites acts 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.350
 dedicated to dating especially 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.250
 you tried trying to create the events to bring back to the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.790
 reality turns out real life 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.950
 and not stay in the virtual 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.390
 we're going a little bit further from that then we create a few 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.540
 events but its output 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.970
 allows our members to create events that is to say we put 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.960
 set up a calendar of events so everyone can create an event 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.990
 whatever it may be for a drink at home - up to a pic nic - 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.630
 weekend sports or traveling but the idea is that instead of 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.500
 meet in this face to face we will meet in a group way a 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.930
 little more natural is that what is the real is really 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.950
 it is to recreate a user-friendliness simply 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.620
 in fact that's why it's 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.830
 it's to recreate the trust is such mark percent the key element 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.060
 causing a meeting for tomorrow that space 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.659
 it's an element of trust and how we find 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.340
 consciousness generally we go in his circle of friends we will see his colleagues 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.750
 and we meet people but from the moment we have exhausted this circle 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.279
 relationship in which one feels confidence 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:16.599
 we need to go elsewhere and get out of this circle of relationships and 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.519
 the idea of ​​nine was to just say, well, you met people 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.849
 that match you in a universe of trust eric dubus way that is 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.930
 much more natural than chance to meet a little supermarket shape 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:29.949
 you're going to have millions of profiles and you have access to the tnt but this 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:32.499
 that all the same websites so no interest 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:36.129
 immediate commercial merchantile to do everything for that 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.169
 people stay hooked every entrepreneur builds his business 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.099
 with the values ​​of the banking sector to say either we do that the inter has taken 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.640
 form 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.110
 in a past that will iron from the moment you have a couple 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.739
 married they are going to talk about it around him will talk about it around them 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.799
 of all the single friends who will see and maybe a power by a 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.469
 shot to see but said single so the purpose of this business 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:58.819
 it is to cease the golden yield served dry the service rendered those who 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:59.980
 aspire to play 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.090
 for another purpose it is from here that he is ready to face 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.940
 thanks to this relationship was simply for the purpose that I 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.049
 was really not good for her the people who create 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.349
 sites of their goals first maybe that's fun but 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.689
 it's about making money and it works very well to win a lot 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:16.949
 of money like the people who create TV channels or homes from 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:20.439
 production or yoghurt in its goal it's good to earn 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.719
 money because there is a time when you have to pay your employees you have to be able to 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:25.730
 to say that these fights moderating tonight is a marc darman 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.109
 that I try the flora to notice la rochelle some tells us about it 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.979
 in fact we would meet m and I change an entrepreneur is true that I 

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:35.699
 always been passionate about it always makes me dream of gold to get into 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:36.619
 this adventure 

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:38.759
 I think it must be done with its values ​​that is to say that it depends 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:41.809
 what is your goal so concrete your business are you already thinking about the 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:44.929
 resale maybe your goal this war the money in the short term 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:48.889
 and percent and savary gilles if your goal is to have an adventure our 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.419
 goal is to please your customers is that people are 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.469
 happy and who speaks your site and you develop in the long run you 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:57.049
 dream not necessarily like that anyway if I understand you go away 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:57.910
 the principle that 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.980
 it will work from the moment when the customer has to be heard so he 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.600
 was happy when we come back in my opinion for general rick hillier has 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.070
 cracked or downright because you've created fugue pieces to stay 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.730
 of the same place in fact we do not necessarily know but the fact more of 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.010
 common lifestyles but when in fact we give the power of the vote to 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.019
 rolling 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:16.529
 who are inside the site 

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:20.329
 but in fact we realize that percent made the way it was happening 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.839
 because a man who takes him as an example a man of 35 years who get involved 

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:24.800
 living in ile-de-france 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.410
 it is primarily women 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.430
 who are on the site looking for a 35 year old man from france who voted 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.260
 for him and decide whether he makes it on the site or not with the interest that 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.780
 become much more involved in its inscription and create this climate of 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.840
 trust 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.840
 we realize with this vote and we see that objectively that men or 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.419
 women when they choose new members actually this is the 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.610
 way he will write and that's what he spent time on his 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.419
 inscription what is it doing in life and that's something 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.889
 that we actually consent to bypass the word in the psp pipeline 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.380
 with this very good voting system weekend to all players find again 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.430
 monday because of that we thank them for your fidelity gallous trémouilles 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.950
 the gunners 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:58.980
 on France 5 good evening
