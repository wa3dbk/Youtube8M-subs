00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.330
 In good weather, the winners met 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.309
 of ecp viva training with john 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.269
 beemelmanns on the good land peace in 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.189
 ratingen a 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.619
 among the lucky winners is too 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.930
 jennifer the with her horse from bremen 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.000
 came to rheinland that is then 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.740
 this is a ten-year-old Hanoverian 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.580
 has been with me since he was three years old 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:34.290
 I am telekom turn 33 years old 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.870
 I've been riding for four years now as both 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.920
 we had to live because of injury 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.940
 pausing always found in between 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.789
 This season started to ride fans 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.239
 already placed and yes it was times 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.559
 watch 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.809
 continue the piece piece by piece 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.420
 the problem is working for us ahead 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.539
 stay is that we in the basic work 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.670
 still make many things more correct 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.609
 Things have to work up again 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.739
 For example, leaning on a theme is a topic 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.259
 actually near the end of the season can 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.129
 daniel to ride 

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:07.380
 provided the horse stays healthy 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.890
 I stay healthy it for me 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.899
 actually so the most important on the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.240
 fantastic facilities have the winners 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.610
 the possibility of useful tips from 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.330
 to get dressage trainer jean the m1 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.770
 to discuss and address problems 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.840
 Of course, people are coming here 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.880
 not because everything works perfectly at home 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.050
 but because they have things in what 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.119
 that you want to improve 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.160
 and I hope that I have some tips 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.200
 can be on the way so that you can 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.910
 with home a little further 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.069
 you can work, you just come for 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.959
 such a little opinion that you can do it 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:42.599
 An idea tells how the man does that 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:44.069
 and where there are the difficulties and 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:46.140
 with what opportunities I can get a 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.950
 professional for home improve so this year 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.630
 always the right thiekötter 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.539
 Strictly down the leg tries beautiful 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.099
 to get deep in the saddle 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.200
 so now you go to the 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:00.080
 Gathered gallop gathered a horse 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.270
 times 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.650
 assembled gathered sorrow always like that 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.210
 what you imagined in the meeting 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.990
 not gathered there yet 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.810
 gather more even more early in the morning 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.390
 even more norms just risk something 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:24.150
 so if you gallop on the spot 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:26.250
 want to let go great even times 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.530
 sweep as possible forward 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.420
 like to gallop and always direction 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.570
 horses go by hand if you like 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.970
 This is quite important that 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.010
 one always from below one 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.020
 confirmation and instructions 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.090
 and I can only do that for myself 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.130
 even to say if the whole year like 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.230
 I have ridden sport myself 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.790
 never ridden without lessons and wind 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.440
 Only one apprentice loaded down 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.510
 said human telling me what's up 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.850
 out 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:58.740
 and I think so riding this alone 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.610
 would I can not make a fun of 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.890
 mülheim 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.500
 I have my 8 year old Rhineland 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.720
 Wallach chips with the mainly 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.910
 L and M jump and once more 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.380
 is so my horse is from the 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.940
 behind the gallop quite lazy 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.230
 that's why the flying changes work 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.480
 usually not so good in the course 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.550
 for not look but make it work 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.570
 you have to do that a bit 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.580
 off and I wanted me once bit 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.050
 a few tips maybe a bit 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.050
 trot canter transitions rich 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:37.379
 that the Thuringian bit longer 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:38.780
 galloping out the right way so nice 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.920
 in front of the hands 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.360
 Of course the tour is for one 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.940
 Lappers as important as the 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.980
 safe door in dressage rider because the 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.220
 Courses have become much more technical 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.190
 it is important that you with 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.269
 three gallop spiders in the combination 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.859
 or with 4 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.049
 and then of course comes later 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:00.780
 the permeability persists 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.769
 assembled gathered the 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.329
 tons of choice 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.819
 otherwise the viewer is recommended 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:08.790
 Tactics a bit more diligent 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.099
 so now exaggerated me in front 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.829
 gallop as before with both in 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.700
 direction horses mouth soya so now 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.560
 catch again 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.180
 There were really good tips for that 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.250
 I also definitely have my coach at home 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.900
 and I'll give it to you if you can 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.880
 Work I take in any case 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.820
 that brave rich but 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.360
 Attacking should also be consistent 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:34.590
 Riding should be consistent on the thighs 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.449
 help the things I react to 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.059
 every case 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:41.659
 Although nice choice ride on this system 

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:43.279
 of course, and rbb is a man 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:45.740
 with a great deal of experience and 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:49.360
 to be allowed to train someone like him 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.360
 and of course something unique
