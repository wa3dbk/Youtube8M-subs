00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.729
 hello how about one more time here from 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.680
 classes every Mexico demanding a very 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:12.920
 strong greeting and let's talk a little 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.450
 in previous video is in question the 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.820
 Facebook 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.409
 I showed you some sheets of ladies that are 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:24.650
 those that were already taking root 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:27.260
 I want you to see the results is a 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.599
 Very good size sheet 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:35.390
 beautiful I would say with excellent this root 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:38.030
 but it's not the only one that means that 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.030
 the next few days I will be preparing what 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.130
 which is a special substrate precisely 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.920
 for new tenants those who have 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.620
 developed in this case is not much 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:52.190
 well I put it here is this part to see 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.699
 another lady here is the lack another 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.320
 lady one also lacks a lot to see 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:01.160
 This little one I think has more 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:04.110
 than the others to see this other 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.390
 is coming out but very very poor 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.820
 now it is normal that some copies 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.120
 you get to lose the sheet if you 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.120
 note 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.130
 that is all tangled is the bad 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.140
 they knew how to twist the key plants of 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.909
 jaime barÃ³ 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.060
 similar to how nice they already saw 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.700
 beautiful 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.120
 to see what was so badly fought if you have 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.050
 quite 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.530
 is here 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.690
 and this is the giant variety that is 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.580
 if you realize it is really beautiful 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:45.160
 and the 'twisted' of the house that I will see 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.840
 how the hell am I going to accommodate her because 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.090
 well how was it 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.160
 that's like for one more video but that 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.130
 we already have it little by little and with 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.920
 time meanwhile this is the view 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.470
 general of some of the sheets I have 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.560
 others there in the room that are the 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.540
 that I am preparing also but for the 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.370
 moment that's what I have to them 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.530
 you guys and girls for 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.330
 fans of African violets 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.870
 we are seeing each other and I leave them with our 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:17.050
 view of my little this ice ax and it 's 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.380
 in good condition it looks beautiful not us 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.380
 we see
