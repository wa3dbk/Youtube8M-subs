wanted to give you a quick update to let

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.750 
wanted to give you a quick update to let
you<00:00:44.610> know<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:46.020> think<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.469> shampoo<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.430> a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
you know that I think the shampoo is a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.729 
you know that I think the shampoo is a
little<00:00:48.149> bit<00:00:48.300> drying<00:00:48.840> now<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.289> don't<00:00:49.379> know<00:00:49.620> if

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
little bit drying now I don't know if

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.860 
little bit drying now I don't know if
it's<00:00:49.890> because<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.640> had<00:00:51.180> my<00:00:51.360> hair<00:00:51.629> colored

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
it's because I had my hair colored

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.529 
it's because I had my hair colored
differently<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.680> last<00:00:52.890> time<00:00:53.300> because<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.449> was

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
differently the last time because it was

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.689 
differently the last time because it was
going<00:00:54.690> along<00:00:54.899> fine<00:00:55.350> for<00:00:55.590> me<00:00:55.680> until<00:00:56.010> then<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.550> I

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
going along fine for me until then and I

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.069 
going along fine for me until then and I
didn't<00:00:57.059> really<00:00:57.149> feel<00:00:57.270> like<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.600> was<00:00:57.809> drying

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
didn't really feel like it was drying

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.729 
didn't really feel like it was drying
but<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.489> used<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.940> always<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.510> only<00:01:00.840> foils<00:01:01.559> in

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
but I used to always have only foils in

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.820 
but I used to always have only foils in
my<00:01:01.859> hair<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.370> really<00:01:02.699> only<00:01:03.059> maybe<00:01:03.270> 25%<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.710> my

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
my hair so really only maybe 25% of my

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.500 
my hair so really only maybe 25% of my
hair<00:01:05.010> was<00:01:05.189> getting<00:01:05.309> colored<00:01:05.790> but<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.299> last

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
hair was getting colored but this last

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.140 
hair was getting colored but this last
time<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.110> went<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.740> had<00:01:07.799> her<00:01:08.189> do<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.670> full

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
time that I went I had her do a full

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.620 
time that I went I had her do a full
process<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.409> medium<00:01:10.860> brown<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:12.240> cover<00:01:12.450> up

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
process of a medium brown to cover up

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.510 
process of a medium brown to cover up
some<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.869> my<00:01:12.900> Gray's<00:01:13.320> up<00:01:13.500> at<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.710> top<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:13.950> then

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
some of my Gray's up at the top and then

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.780 
some of my Gray's up at the top and then
do<00:01:14.760> some<00:01:15.119> foils<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.689> top<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:17.369> I

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
do some foils on top of it and so I

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.490 
do some foils on top of it and so I
don't<00:01:17.909> know<00:01:18.060> if<00:01:18.240> doing<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.509> full<00:01:18.990> process

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
don't know if doing that full process

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.499 
don't know if doing that full process
made<00:01:19.710> my<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.220> rest<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.670> my<00:01:20.759> hair<00:01:20.790> drier<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.479> I

could<00:01:21.689> really<00:01:21.960> tell<00:01:22.229> but<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.770> seemed<00:01:23.040> like

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
could really tell but it seemed like

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.980

that<00:05:06.870> I'm<00:05:06.990> loving<00:05:07.500> right<00:05:07.530> now<00:05:07.710> is<00:05:08.250> the<00:05:09.110> one<00:05:10.110> and

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
that I'm loving right now is the one and

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.130 
that I'm loving right now is the one and
only<00:05:10.350> argan<00:05:11.100> oil<00:05:11.280> and<00:05:11.670> I<00:05:12.030> got<00:05:12.210> this<00:05:12.360> at<00:05:12.540> Sally's

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140

only argan oil and I got this at Sally's
and<00:05:14.060> this<00:05:15.060> would<00:05:15.570> be<00:05:15.600> 45<00:05:16.200> dollars<00:05:16.650> in<00:05:16.860> Moroccan

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.640 
and this would be 45 dollars in Moroccan
oil<00:05:17.400> world<00:05:17.790> and<00:05:18.120> it<00:05:18.930> was<00:05:19.760> 20<00:05:20.840> and<00:05:21.840> Sally<00:05:22.260> so

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
oil world and it was 20 and Sally so

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.890 
oil world and it was 20 and Sally so
it's<00:05:23.160> you<00:05:23.700> know<00:05:23.820> less<00:05:24.120> than<00:05:24.150> half<00:05:24.510> the<00:05:24.690> price

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
it's you know less than half the price

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.450 
it's you know less than half the price
for<00:05:25.140> probably<00:05:25.440> the<00:05:25.530> same<00:05:25.800> amount<00:05:25.830> and<00:05:26.310> this

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
for probably the same amount and this

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.400 
for probably the same amount and this
stuff<00:05:26.640> is<00:05:26.790> great<00:05:27.000> and<00:05:27.270> this<00:05:27.690> smells<00:05:27.960> good<00:05:28.170> too

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410

the<00:05:28.620> other<00:05:28.650> argan<00:05:29.640> oil<00:05:29.790> that<00:05:29.880> I<00:05:30.000> was<00:05:30.180> using

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
the other argan oil that I was using

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.810 
the other argan oil that I was using
that<00:05:30.570> was<00:05:30.780> a<00:05:30.980> less<00:05:31.980> expensive<00:05:32.280> dupe<00:05:32.670> a

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
that was a less expensive dupe a

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.330 
that was a less expensive dupe a
drugstore<00:05:33.060> dupe<00:05:33.600> it<00:05:34.590> didn't<00:05:34.890> have<00:05:35.010> the<00:05:35.160> great

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
drugstore dupe it didn't have the great

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.590 
drugstore dupe it didn't have the great
scent<00:05:35.610> no<00:05:35.760> I<00:05:35.790> don't<00:05:36.030> think<00:05:36.060> this<00:05:36.270> is<00:05:36.330> exactly

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
scent no I don't think this is exactly

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.070 
scent no I don't think this is exactly
Moroccan<00:05:37.470> oil<00:05:37.560> scent<00:05:37.980> but<00:05:38.480> it<00:05:39.480> still<00:05:39.810> smells

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
Moroccan oil scent but it still smells

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.910 
Moroccan oil scent but it still smells
really<00:05:40.440> good<00:05:40.740> it's<00:05:40.950> really<00:05:41.280> like<00:05:41.550> a<00:05:41.580> soft<00:05:42.920> not

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 
really good it's really like a soft not

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.390 
really good it's really like a soft not
quite<00:05:44.160> baby<00:05:44.490> powder<00:05:44.850> but<00:05:45.270> soft<00:05:46.080> maybe<00:05:46.440> vanilla

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
quite baby powder but soft maybe vanilla

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.090 
quite baby powder but soft maybe vanilla
baby<00:05:47.820> powder<00:05:48.210> mix<00:05:48.930> up<00:05:49.170> of<00:05:49.290> some<00:05:49.530> sort<00:05:49.800> but<00:05:50.040> it

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
baby powder mix up of some sort but it

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.240 
baby powder mix up of some sort but it
smells<00:05:50.880> great<00:05:51.090> so<00:05:51.780> my<00:05:51.960> next<00:05:52.140> step<00:05:52.260> is<00:05:52.560> I<00:05:52.680> take<00:05:52.950> a

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.220 
smells great so my next step is I take a
dime<00:05:53.610> sized<00:05:53.910> amount<00:05:53.940> of<00:05:54.360> this<00:05:54.450> in<00:05:54.600> my<00:05:54.720> hand<00:05:54.990> and
