I<00:02:02.920> thought<00:02:03.920> grab<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.370> cameras<00:02:04.790> give<00:02:05.030> you<00:02:05.150> a

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
I thought grab the cameras give you a

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.090 
I thought grab the cameras give you a
better<00:02:05.420> view<00:02:06.340> of<00:02:07.340> what<00:02:07.520> we're<00:02:07.670> doing<00:02:09.100> I'll

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
better view of what we're doing I'll

00:02:10.100 --> 00:03:03.620 
better view of what we're doing I'll
trust<00:02:10.399> you<00:02:10.550> can<00:02:10.700> see<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.030> floor

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.150 

so<00:03:04.630> I'd<00:03:04.930> say<00:03:05.730> that's<00:03:06.730> pretty<00:03:07.030> much<00:03:07.150> dry<00:03:08.160> so
