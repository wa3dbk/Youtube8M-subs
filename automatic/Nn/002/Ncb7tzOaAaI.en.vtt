photo<00:01:16.420> type<00:01:16.960> bags<00:01:17.260> and<00:01:17.650> so<00:01:17.830> therefore<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:18.640> has

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
photo type bags and so therefore it has

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.090

the typical photo stuff that you would

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.010 
the typical photo stuff that you would
need<00:01:21.250> for<00:01:21.310> think<00:01:21.670> tank<00:01:21.909> but<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.420> thing<00:01:22.630> is<00:01:22.659> is

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
need for think tank but the thing is is

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.550 
need for think tank but the thing is is
that<00:01:23.200> this<00:01:23.650> one<00:01:23.890> also<00:01:24.450> removes<00:01:25.450> so<00:01:26.350> therefore

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
that this one also removes so therefore

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.469 
that this one also removes so therefore
