going<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.629> be<00:00:40.010> rolling<00:00:41.010> out<00:00:41.250> 11<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.820> these

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
going to be rolling out 11 of these

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.959 
going to be rolling out 11 of these

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
electric and meets the 2025 standard

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.240 
electric and meets the 2025 standard
already<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.180> 2015<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.469> mean<00:00:52.770> that's<00:00:52.949> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
already in 2015 so I mean that's the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.049 
already in 2015 so I mean that's the
main<00:00:53.640> point<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.360> like<00:00:55.020> Mercedes

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
main point is I like Mercedes

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.819 
main point is I like Mercedes
twin-turbocharged<00:00:57.059> v8<00:00:57.539> but<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.500> get<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
twin-turbocharged v8 but you get the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.099 
twin-turbocharged v8 but you get the
same<00:00:59.010> kind<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.280> power<00:00:59.489> from<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.030> v6<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.870> an

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
same kind of power from a v6 and an

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.770 
same kind of power from a v6 and an
electric<00:01:01.590> engine<00:01:02.180> combined<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
electric engine combined in the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.960 
electric engine combined in the
drivetrain<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.710> can<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:04.949> green<00:01:05.280> but<00:01:05.610> you

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
drivetrain so you can be green but you

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.550 
drivetrain so you can be green but you
can<00:01:06.090> also<00:01:06.270> have<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.869> kind<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.080> power<00:01:07.320> that

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
can also have the kind of power that

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.200 
can also have the kind of power that
someone<00:01:08.310> who<00:01:08.400> doesn't<00:01:08.700> care<00:01:08.850> about<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
someone who doesn't care about the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.420 
someone who doesn't care about the
environment<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:10.080> Sun<00:01:10.320> normally<00:01:10.710> yes<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.100> most

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
environment the Sun normally yes so most

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.890 
environment the Sun normally yes so most
people<00:01:11.580> think<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.000> hybrid<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.510> terms<00:01:12.720> of

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
people think of hybrid in terms of

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.890 
people think of hybrid in terms of
consumption<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.130> economy<00:01:14.580> but<00:01:15.030> electric

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
consumption and economy but electric

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.480 
consumption and economy but electric
power<00:01:16.049> has<00:01:16.290> has<00:01:16.650> full<00:01:17.040> torque<00:01:17.280> available

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
power has has full torque available

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.520 
power has has full torque available
available<00:01:17.880> immediately<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:19.049> think<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.380> as

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
available immediately so think of it as

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.910 
available immediately so think of it as
a<00:01:19.560> turbocharger<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.119> low<00:01:21.689> rev<00:01:22.650> range

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
a turbocharger so in that low rev range

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.760 
a turbocharger so in that low rev range
it<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.790> get<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.090> electric<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.290> then

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
it you get the electric and that it then

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.890 
it you get the electric and that it then
it<00:01:25.860> kicks<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.970> gasoline<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.659> get<00:01:27.869> a

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
it kicks in the gasoline and you get a

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.359 
it kicks in the gasoline and you get a
pretty<00:01:28.140> seamless<00:01:28.560> driving<00:01:28.890> experience<00:01:29.280> all

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
pretty seamless driving experience all

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.890 
pretty seamless driving experience all
