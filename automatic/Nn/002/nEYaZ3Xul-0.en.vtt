 It's cold. 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:19.420
 I have made a unique donation of ripper in Korea, but I do not know how to write it hot. 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:24.970
 And the story of one victim in the second only talk a good fit stuck 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:29.980
 Uh, I 've come a long way to be a man . 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:34.510
 What've been holding it for five hours so this is unlike J communion languages 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:40.329
 I can feel that when talking to a baseball jjikge 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:44.049
 It hung outward one such match is more Korean in Korea is now doing in the present world 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:49.749
 People also come to rescue come a lot less gold coming more clogging example 

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:53.440
 I'm looking for something that's a bit of what people are doing. 

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:57.850
 I 'm going to lose money this way , 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:02.499
 The check did not state so far coming in contact even as designed 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:06.340
 Directly to one of Parliament-type and direct with me since come rattling more to do today 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:10.299
 Each tent Now we have a story, and every time there is talk film 2 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:16.240
 Somehow tell people coming in terrible conditions 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:20.380
 I wonder if there is a misplaced return to wait for that help. 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.210
 I want people to come here and tell them 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.899
 I want to be in insurance 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.280
 We are talking about what is already detailed in this way 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.240
 To show you. 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:35.289
 I'm sure you'll come here to analyze and transfer me. 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:39.429
 I think I studied like that because in fact , those who sponsored in Korea 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:43.539
 Out to students hasijyo wonder actually look at the site and the key color than water 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:48.549
 How could you see this kind of helping children? Yes . 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:51.640
 This opportunity becomes a stand both kage fact remains, albeit less so those in Korea 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:56.069
 I really want to thank you for your support. 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:02:01.960
 I am here today with my arms. Thank you so much. 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:06.400
 So even people over something so big extractors raising donations Namo Organization yireongeo 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:09.610
 Now I'm a student so I'm doing what keys do not work hard as one 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.570
 I think it would be a great help to do this . 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.610
 Although ahkkado 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:19.660
 We want to continue talking there is removed so we have to listen to him talk 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:24.580
 How do you know how to listen to him talk about me to him another value 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.800
 I'm stripping people from the law of pain, and now I'm crying again. 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.430
 It's too hard to talk about it. 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:35.380
 But still, at this camp, people are no longer able to do it anymore. 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:40.209
 Deoraguyo I like to go just like now, and bought like to give a little something Care 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:45.190
 So just itneungeonji even think I'd be good at things like writing 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:49.810
 Uninstalled in this situation and now Known issues: Resolved cases significantly so pretty and so Jail 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:54.190
 So if you give me one tent, it does not end with it . 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:57.580
 So while the story is being matched with each other, and people exchanges and also use their 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:02.620
 It seems like there are so many things that do not seem to be inside. 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:08.320
 I also had an earthquake in the fourth tent to see a tent, 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.850
 It's just that we can protect and do it . 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.610
 It's a short time 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:19.560
 I'm afraid I have been able to check with my own eyes now 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:21.180
 I guess you gotta go it is somewhat better in tough situations as 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.500
 But on the note 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:30.300
 Know how urgent the state should be doing nicely out all again led the morning 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:34.770
 I would not mind a bit when he found so slowly that tteseo angeuraedo 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:39.450
 Gateumyeon back in place, we'll be better for me to tell people so long-term 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:43.290
 How else can give such a way that harmony is known, in addition to weakness as 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:48.450
 If you like something more joteulgeot a framework to be able to just invest criticism 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:52.350
 When's together as a single example, that you would be with all the time, as described in 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:56.310
 2, Beta 3, is not it awful're supposed to be this way again in this situation summary 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:04:00.270
 I've been through it. 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:04.680
 Yes, of course I am here again, but if you can help me in the future, 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:09.000
 Crisis can be found just as hard as jellyfish example 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:15.780
 Thank you 1 next month 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:19.799
 For example, the fact that the world is seen as a sprint come from countries that aid the country 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:23.280
 The fact that South Korea is almost exclusively dedicated to the fact that, indeed tens of years ago, 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:27.000
 I have received a lot of support from the three countries. 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:32.130
 I'm proud of being stacked in Korea to be born again so I can help wrappers 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:36.780
 Thank you very much for your kindness, 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:40.470
 After that, the director told me to do as much as he could. 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:45.440
 Thank you for letting us know that you are awake . 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.440
