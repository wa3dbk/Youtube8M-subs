00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 you 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:21.460
 Hi, girls, I hope so good today 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.720
 I bring you the French manicure is something 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.430
 super easy to do 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:30.090
 he does not have any vouchers and I have thrown him 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:36.129
 a layer the giants what happens is that 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.239
 I did not plan to record it and the layer 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.370
 cast 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.460
 then he starts recording it since 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.329
 I started since I started painting what 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.329
 what is white 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.870
 and that's something I do with a brush 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.280
 because it is much easier 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.949
 but it can also be done with the 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.309
 nail lacquer brush 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.900
 as forums come and be more comfortable 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.760
 OK 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.390
 there are also templates for sale 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.610
 to put to make it easier to 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.510
 paint what in the white zone is worth 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.090
 some very expensive after several and if not you 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.270
 you love a brush or a vertex of the lacquer 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.450
 of nails you can try 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.929
 to see how it is with the templates 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.929
 OK 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.470
 I have done what is the guiding target 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:37.060
 because I like it 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.060
 I do not like it with a smile 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.590
 you can also do the manipulation 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.290
 French manicure following what is 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.830
 the shape of your guardiola is very 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.830
 beautiful and original 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.349
 Y 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.910
 when they are very well dry we start it 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.330
 to apply the foot 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.800
 if we are not going to mix the colors and 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:57.569
 let's make a christ in the nails 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:03:01.799
 the stu going so super simple 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:04.889
 and they are very relevant, as you can see 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.769
 very easy to make them and nothing 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:10.870
 encourage you to worry and tell me 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.290
 that maybe it has gone 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.120
 due above they liked the video 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.970
 subscribe is worth to keep watching the 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.739

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.890
