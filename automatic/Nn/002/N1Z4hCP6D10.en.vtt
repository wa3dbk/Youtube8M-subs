00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:07.020
 well we have our two layers off we 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.059
 are going to start working on our food 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.530
 u this is also the hardest boot whatever 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.660
 makes sense 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.160
 You have already worked hard and now you can 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.839
 what you have already made of course 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.300
 do not confuse 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.500
 therefore this layer will take a little longer 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.449
 but no problem 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.170
 before you know it they can put your finger in it 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.029
 you solve this without problem 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.010
 we turn our green side again 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.769
 think more upstairs when I say the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.649
 green side I mean the top 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.230
 of your cube with you have started the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.850
 blue side interaction could go to the 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.540
 green it is a different color for you 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.640
 no problem 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.230
 love it in your mind when I say 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.379
 I green cubes 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.960
 that I mean your top 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.360
 in this step a lima also goes to ours 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.399
 sea ​​blocks look at our corner blocks 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.050
 we can not watch for a while 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.140
 have any color 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.699
 green or not to we don't look at 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.100
 and if we are some of them are cubes 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:09.479
 here we can look at four different ones 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:12.240
 recognize shapes or in other words you have 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.040
 no form at all no 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.659
 snowflake green and you have a teach you 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.299
 with a block 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.189
 in other words, you have two green and shapes 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.530
 this one small l 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.759
 along with your middle block or you have 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.890
 two 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.799
 are cubes green and form life 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.110
 line with your middle block ie 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.619
 your plus is of course already ready and that 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.200
 case you can skip them immediately 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.290
 we are going to start with what you have to do 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.180
 if you don't have any green blocks now 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.979
 is this your not your form no 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.930
 problem wait a while soon 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.659
 in no time from the real estate cube 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.180
 the green area was top and you do 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.180
 the movement or the algorithm 4 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.439
 rbr the cent 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.680
 two fnv paves and as you see I come 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.020
 little hell out if you have your little l 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.980
 then turn these 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.010
 until they come in 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.990
 top left corner is like this 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.740
 and with the green plains top doe 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.740
 I just the same 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:24.300
 Fri. 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:29.310
 bfm mind and as you see us and come 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:33.050
 I now like the lion and elise line like 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.730
 from left to right or so naturally 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.940
 and then with the green surface is top 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.020
 do you again 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:45.000
 Fri. 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:49.310
 church are essential nv accent and like you 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.310
 cordon looks beautiful that green plus
