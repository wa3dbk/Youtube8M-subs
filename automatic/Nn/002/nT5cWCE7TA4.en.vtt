 we are here on the ifa and have 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.280
 some of our valued colleagues 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.990
 met and asked each one 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.250
 cool app to imagine what's going on 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.120
 Come out, you see behind the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.120

 here is franz form channals web and me 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.150
 imagine the facebook app today 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.119
 I would say we start directly 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.500
 face is an app by justin müller and 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.239

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.710
 wallpapers here together he has 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.110
 also a website there you can get the 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.180
 download free the left loud 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.670
 I think faces points but that is 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.300
 just the app and the collects there are 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.580

 in the month's view you can see march here 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.559
 april may and so on here with me 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.559
 click once we see the 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.170
 wallpapers form june 2013 and me 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.370
 say for example i like this 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.110
 Wallpaper then I can here 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.660
 click on it and I can do it down 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.729
 vision and the whole then just as a picture 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.979
 Save or buy as a print edition 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.330
 order me home or me 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.670
 Wish it back up here 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.229
 It can conduct a double capcom 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.210
 set as my wallpaper 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.680
 and the whole thing was here 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.509
 saved and I have it as 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.160
 Wallpaper here are numerous with 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.369
 This is really a very cool one 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.740
 app costs the place tor 79 cents den 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.090
 developer or the artist you could 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.800
 really support but as I said 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.679
 the website is there too 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.539
 I'm a valentin from the channel for free 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.520
 Valentin Müller and I also have one 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.530
 little app for you i would have you 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.179
 keeper luca and wants to show 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.160
 this is a little game for android 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.649
 and ios and in principle it works here 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.729
 because you have a little folk 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.739
 then it looks a bit similar 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.239
 like the lemmings for example who 

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:53.239
 still remembers the lemmings and 

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:55.280
 in principle there is so to speak a 

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:57.259
 Great master and this bar and 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.239
 You can direct this back and forth 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.670
 and well, he can walk around with it and 

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:04.310
 when moving the whole here top 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.479
 you have a kind of circle here and there 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.530
 then imagine these little ones 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.170
 typical captain looks though though 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.880
 the circle here surrendered and came the whole 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.900
 Then here simply overturn leave the 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.130
 was the wrong direction 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.900
 I can do that with two tips and it 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.220
 just leave here again because 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.500
 I like to leave all this over here 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.110
 allowed the little orange pinkl thing 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.879
 not orange pink do not touch that 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.560
 fall down I see it coming and 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.150
 my bridge disappears when i die 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.230
 bridge but make it smaller here so that 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.880
 she should not get there but 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.990
 should arrive here and throw that 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.030
 whole now 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.990
 so i can now my little people 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.400
 run over here 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.020
 the traps here among us are on target 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.280
 and I got the level and the 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.540
 sense of the whole game is just that 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.430
 to do it again and again for all levels 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.780
 which comes with nice animations 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.680
 really cute does not cost too many 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.240
 is a nice game in between 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.610
 hello together on me a heart is here 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.740
 what's up with ifa here in Berlin? 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.480
 I do not know for those, though 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.010
 the channel colleague of kristen we do 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.500
 This show epileptic several times in the 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.240
 month then subscribed as a kolab 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.190
 our channel and I'll show I now 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.640
 my app of a timelapse and knows 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.260
 she's frame labs on it's the app 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.490
 really easy to use and 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.500
 I'll show you the most important ones 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.330
 functions up here you can the 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.340
 I have the video resolution 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.230
 highest then the important ones 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.180
 most important setting option like 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.880
 often a photo should be taken 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.590
 every tenth of seconds or maybe rum 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.080
 every second as well as set with me 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.480
 or just a minute almost the 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.400
 white balance manually wants to design too 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.320
 everything possible 16 more 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.030
 hiring options hidden for 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.570
 example one comes here on the 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.270
 front camera so now and you could go to 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.040
 for example, the video frame rate 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.750
 adjust manually 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.480
 but now I see only one time 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.690
 little video what we recorded with it 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.690
 to have 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.430

 give you the app on your phone 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.250
 then search for google chrome or the 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.340
 browser stop on an android phone 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.329
 have a file from any one 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.889
 android game 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.930
 Download her and then you can 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.669
 with the emulator states in my case 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.440
 is now here for example pokémon 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.330
 rubin i am a huge pokemon fan 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.760

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.860
 bot then you see already here 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.419
 You can just get the gameboy advance 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.800
 play games here we have the 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.120
 you normally feel on the 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.729
 gameboy just faded in here 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.229
 that i can just change my game status 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.479
 go in and just a little bit 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.160
 Playing Pokemon is someone like that 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.500
 am and have the example of lara 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.500
 normal book just like it 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.090
 knows yes there is the whole in one 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.590
 free version and in one 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.200
 pro version at the free version 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.550
 you have to use the memory function of the 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.710
 save game at the pro version 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.539
 You can also over the strings here 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.919
 function does not save in principle 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.600
 you can also do something special 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.000
 well take the free version and 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.810
 Anyone who likes to play game example 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.160
 Well advised with the app in any case 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.500
 and it's me again, I have one too 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.270
 app for you she's called two pet so now 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.710
 fits on the ipad one works 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.720
 looks for a hotspot in 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.400
 In my case, the upper left corner and 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.139
 if you touch this hot spot then 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.150
 opens here so a national 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.340
 Access menu and with these chambers 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.080
 Just jump in handy or me 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.180
 do that before you go again just once 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.550
 the music app or just mine 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.650
 twitter yes definitely cool 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.270
 if you're up here now in the 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.490
 navigation bar then you can see that 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.620
 freewheel is activated when you look at it 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.520
 you can press the ipad up here 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.690
 and turn off 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.460
 here are a few settings 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.260
 which one can do the most important 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.240
 Settings are actually here petz 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.520
 you got to choose your standards already 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.060
 and set which apps in there 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.889
 belong 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.910
 Let's go back to the next one 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.979
 most important would probably be the 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.960
 hotspot itself how can you go anywhere 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:59.580
 Do something pretty practical with it 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.770
 not always bother I keep him 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.090
 the corner set yes in principle that was 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.550
 even the most important settings 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.389
 you can still play around here 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.370
 interactions there you can design something 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:10.430
 changed or a whole lot of fun 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.080
 in order to 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.800
 okay that were as the five apps for 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.870
 this video 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.189
 I hope there was something for everyone reading 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.259
 like feedback in the comments there 

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:20.520
 if she knows a cool app she writes 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:22.590
 Also, just put them in one 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.879
 next epileptic episodes will follow 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.099
 look at the colleagues over 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:27.300
 can also be an abo I find 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:29.250
 a description spox our video 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.569
 just like to the five featured apps 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.569
 So until the next issue
