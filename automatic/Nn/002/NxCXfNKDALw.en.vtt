00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 how are you welcome to the course of 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.740
 basic computing my name is daniel 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.230
 gomez 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:12.120
 in this video I'm going to talk about the 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.120
 hard drive of your computer 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.510
 in this video I will explain what is the 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.050
 hard disk 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:26.590
 Hard disk function 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.769
 and how to prevent the loss of our 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.769
 data 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.230
 What is the hard drive 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.560
 It is a magnetic disk that is part of 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.260
 a computer 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.500
 It is used to store our 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.160
 data 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:50.040
 the limited limit capacity is measured 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.040
 in gigabytes or terabytes 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.510
 the hard drive 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.950
 formed by a series of discs called 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.950
 dishes 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.009
 the motor makes the dishes turn to 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.270
 to be able to write and read in different 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.270
 parts of the dishes 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.450
 the function of the head is to read and 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.450
 write data on the dishes 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.409
 how to prevent the loss of our 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.409
 data 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.100
 it is very important not to bring magnets to the 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:37.440
 computer since this will make it 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.440
 erase the information on the hard disk 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.750
 it is also important that we turn off 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.860
 our computer when we are not 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:52.170
 using because heat is what 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.170
 makes the electronic fail 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.330
 also to prevent the loss of 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.340
 our data is important to give 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.070
 regular hard disk maintenance 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.490
 to learn how to maintain 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:13.840
 your computer sees a computer course 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.840
 basic dotcom diagonal maintenance 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.750
 It is also important to make a copy to 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.510
 our reservation data for yes yes 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.540
 our hard drive will fail 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.409
 we will have a copy to be able to restore 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.409
 Our information 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:42.160
 to review in this video we talked 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:46.260
 about what is the hard drive 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.260
 Hard disk function 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.700
 and how to prevent the loss of our 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.700
 data 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.370
