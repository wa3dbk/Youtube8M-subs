00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.760 
would sleep with a metronome under the
pillow<00:03:16.040> at<00:03:16.220> night<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.930> I'm<00:03:18.110> not<00:03:18.140> saying<00:03:18.590> that

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
pillow at night and I'm not saying that

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.160 
pillow at night and I'm not saying that
your<00:03:18.890> drummer<00:03:19.160> has<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.519> do<00:03:19.670> that<00:03:19.820> but<00:03:20.780> that

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
your drummer has to do that but that

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.500 
your drummer has to do that but that
just<00:03:21.380> what<00:03:21.950> that<00:03:21.980> does<00:03:22.370> is<00:03:22.549> ingrain<00:03:23.060> a<00:03:23.090> sense

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
just what that does is ingrain a sense

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.820 
just what that does is ingrain a sense
of<00:03:23.660> time<00:03:23.930> okay<00:03:24.700> so<00:03:25.700> I<00:03:26.560> would<00:03:27.560> encourage

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
of time okay so I would encourage

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.440 
of time okay so I would encourage
Germany<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.610> have<00:03:28.730> one<00:03:28.850> of<00:03:28.940> these<00:03:29.000> pocket

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
Germany to have one of these pocket

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.880 
Germany to have one of these pocket
metronomes<00:03:29.900> our<00:03:30.080> drummer<00:03:30.350> used<00:03:30.620> to<00:03:30.709> have<00:03:30.799> an

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
metronomes our drummer used to have an

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.699 
metronomes our drummer used to have an
hour<00:03:31.070> commute<00:03:31.459> each<00:03:31.730> way<00:03:31.760> to<00:03:32.060> his<00:03:32.390> job<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:32.930> so

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
hour commute each way to his job and so

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.229 
hour commute each way to his job and so
he<00:03:33.950> would<00:03:34.070> put<00:03:34.250> on<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.370> metronome<00:03:34.850> for<00:03:34.880> at<00:03:35.150> least

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
he would put on a metronome for at least

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.150 
he would put on a metronome for at least
half<00:03:35.390> of<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.780> time<00:03:35.810> and<00:03:36.350> while<00:03:36.920> he<00:03:37.040> was

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
half of the time and while he was

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.440 
half of the time and while he was
driving<00:03:37.370> he<00:03:37.670> would<00:03:37.820> drive<00:03:37.970> like<00:03:38.150> this<00:03:38.239> and<00:03:38.390> he

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
driving he would drive like this and he

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.759 
driving he would drive like this and he
had<00:03:38.540> a<00:03:38.570> drum<00:03:38.810> stick<00:03:38.930> in<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.260> other<00:03:39.320> hand<00:03:39.590> and

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
had a drum stick in the other hand and

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.100 
had a drum stick in the other hand and
he<00:03:39.830> would<00:03:39.950> just<00:03:40.070> go<00:03:42.310> 22:32<00:03:43.310> did<00:03:43.760> you<00:03:44.360> did<00:03:44.989> you

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
he would just go 22:32 did you did you

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.620 
he would just go 22:32 did you did you
do<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.410> do<00:03:45.590> Dean<00:03:46.280> didn't<00:03:46.970> just<00:03:47.180> do<00:03:47.269> quarter

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
do to do Dean didn't just do quarter

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
metronome and then he'd kind of changed

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.970 
metronome and then he'd kind of changed
the<00:03:52.519> time<00:03:52.760> and<00:03:53.120> do<00:03:53.900> it<00:03:54.019> at<00:03:54.110> that<00:03:54.140> speed<00:03:54.470> and<00:03:54.890> it

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
the time and do it at that speed and it

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.590 
the time and do it at that speed and it
was<00:03:55.070> just<00:03:55.280> he<00:03:55.400> was<00:03:55.430> just<00:03:55.580> drilling<00:03:56.180> in<00:03:56.450> the

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
was just he was just drilling in the

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.050 
was just he was just drilling in the
sense<00:03:56.840> of<00:03:56.930> time<00:03:57.170> and<00:03:57.380> I<00:03:57.440> can<00:03:57.680> I<00:03:57.890> could<00:03:58.519> hear<00:03:58.940> it

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
sense of time and I can I could hear it

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.780 
sense of time and I can I could hear it
and<00:03:59.180> feel<00:03:59.600> it<00:03:59.630> over<00:04:00.080> a<00:04:00.110> couple<00:04:00.410> months<00:04:00.860> time<00:04:01.730> I

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
and feel it over a couple months time I

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.030 
and feel it over a couple months time I
could<00:04:02.239> just<00:04:02.390> feel<00:04:02.690> the<00:04:02.930> difference<00:04:02.959> and<00:04:03.890> our

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
could just feel the difference and our

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.080 
could just feel the difference and our
worship<00:04:04.190> team<00:04:04.580> just<00:04:05.480> just<00:04:05.930> how<00:04:06.110> much<00:04:06.290> more

there<00:04:09.500> was<00:04:09.739> when<00:04:10.040> we<00:04:10.160> would<00:04:10.340> play<00:04:10.430> a<00:04:10.519> song<00:04:10.850> so

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
there was when we would play a song so

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.620 
there was when we would play a song so
so<00:04:13.250> those<00:04:13.549> are<00:04:13.700> some<00:04:13.850> things<00:04:14.120> that<00:04:14.420> I<00:04:14.450> would

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
so those are some things that I would

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.229 
so those are some things that I would
pay<00:04:14.780> attention<00:04:14.900> to<00:04:15.410> and<00:04:15.920> if<00:04:16.400> you<00:04:16.489> want<00:04:16.640> to<00:04:16.760> show

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
hey I want to check out what this guy

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
hey I want to check out what this guy
says<00:04:26.120> I<00:04:26.330> mean<00:04:26.539> not<00:04:26.660> that<00:04:26.690> I<00:04:26.840> know<00:04:26.930> everything

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780

but<00:04:27.990> I've<00:04:28.200> just<00:04:28.260> seen<00:04:28.770> over<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.340> years<00:04:29.610> it

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
but I've just seen over the years it

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.520 
but I've just seen over the years it
makes<00:04:30.060> a<00:04:30.180> huge<00:04:30.450> difference<00:04:30.570> if<00:04:31.110> your<00:04:31.230> drummer

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
makes a huge difference if your drummer

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.520 
makes a huge difference if your drummer
is<00:04:32.540> is<00:04:33.540> playing<00:04:33.990> with<00:04:34.110> a<00:04:34.139> time<00:04:34.380> machine

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
is is playing with a time machine

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.530 
is is playing with a time machine
instead<00:04:35.010> of<00:04:35.070> metronomes<00:04:35.580> now<00:04:36.000> now<00:04:36.300> they<00:04:36.419> have

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
instead of metronomes now now they have

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.990 
instead of metronomes now now they have
drum<00:04:36.750> machines<00:04:37.080> you<00:04:38.040> know<00:04:38.160> cheap<00:04:38.730> drum

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
drum machines you know cheap drum

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.270 
drum machines you know cheap drum

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
machines you know $400 $200 I didn't it

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.030 
machines you know $400 $200 I didn't it
couldn't<00:04:45.240> be<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:45.900> he<00:04:46.380> could<00:04:46.500> practice<00:04:46.680> to

couldn't be and he could practice to
that<00:04:47.220> or<00:04:47.430> she<00:04:47.639> could<00:04:47.790> practice<00:04:48.210> to<00:04:48.389> that<00:04:48.570> but

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
that or she could practice to that but

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.840 
that or she could practice to that but
the<00:04:49.530> main<00:04:49.680> thing<00:04:49.919> they've<00:04:50.160> got<00:04:50.370> to<00:04:50.520> have<00:04:50.610> that

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
the main thing they've got to have that

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.670 
the main thing they've got to have that
sense<00:04:51.090> of<00:04:51.270> timing<00:04:51.480> otherwise<00:04:52.020> I<00:04:52.080> would<00:04:52.530> rather

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
sense of timing otherwise I would rather

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.460 
sense of timing otherwise I would rather
have<00:04:52.919> no<00:04:53.160> drummer
