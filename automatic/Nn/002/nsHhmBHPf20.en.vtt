hard<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.739> find<00:02:41.040> where<00:02:41.370> her<00:02:41.550> swirl<00:02:41.940> is<00:02:42.239> because

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
hard to find where her swirl is because

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.800

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
worry too much about the swirl because

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:57.020 
worry too much about the swirl because
once<00:02:48.720> I've<00:02:50.690> came<00:02:51.690> through<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:55.640> once<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.760> comb

weird

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.990 

I'll<00:04:13.060> just<00:04:13.410> bring<00:04:14.410> those<00:04:14.680> around<00:04:15.480> there<00:04:16.480> we<00:04:16.630> go

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
I'll just bring those around there we go

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.960 
I'll just bring those around there we go
so<00:04:19.000> I<00:04:19.030> just<00:04:19.239> do<00:04:19.420> the<00:04:19.540> little<00:04:19.690> smooth<00:04:21.810> thing<00:04:22.810> and

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.830 

I<00:04:27.970> mean<00:04:28.290> she<00:04:29.290> usually<00:04:29.470> gets<00:04:29.800> a<00:04:30.150> flat<00:04:31.150> hairdo<00:04:31.720> at

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
I mean she usually gets a flat hairdo at

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.510 
I mean she usually gets a flat hairdo at
the<00:04:31.960> back<00:04:32.140> anyway<00:04:32.590> because<00:04:32.920> she's<00:04:33.340> usually

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
the back anyway because she's usually

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.760 
the back anyway because she's usually
leaning<00:04:34.150> on<00:04:34.300> something<00:04:34.870> or<00:04:35.140> laying<00:04:35.500> on

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
leaning on something or laying on

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.850 
leaning on something or laying on
something<00:04:36.310> but<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:39.580> up<00:04:39.670> like<00:04:39.880> that<00:04:39.910> and<00:04:40.240> then

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
something but it up like that and then

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.740 
something but it up like that and then
her<00:04:41.860> front<00:04:42.310> part<00:04:42.760> has<00:04:44.610> these<00:04:45.610> little<00:04:45.910> wispy

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
her front part has these little wispy

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.570 
her front part has these little wispy
ends<00:04:47.560> right<00:04:47.770> here<00:04:49.320> and<00:04:50.320> so<00:04:50.620> I<00:04:50.650> kind<00:04:51.100> of<00:04:51.160> like<00:04:51.340> to

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
ends right here and so I kind of like to

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.200 
ends right here and so I kind of like to
bring<00:04:51.820> those<00:04:52.060> out<00:04:53.190> from<00:04:54.190> the<00:04:54.340> rest

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
bring those out from the rest

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.050 
bring those out from the rest
and<00:04:56.170> I'll<00:04:56.380> probably<00:04:56.680> instead<00:04:57.370> of<00:04:57.490> a<00:04:57.550> hair<00:04:57.820> bow

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
and I'll probably instead of a hair bow

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.350 
and I'll probably instead of a hair bow
today<00:04:58.450> I'll<00:04:58.630> probably<00:04:58.870> do<00:04:59.350> her<00:04:59.620> little<00:04:59.830> clip

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.380 
today I'll probably do her little clip
which<00:05:01.360> usually<00:05:01.840> goes<00:05:02.080> right<00:05:02.530> in<00:05:02.770> here<00:05:03.390> and

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
which usually goes right in here and

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.180 
which usually goes right in here and
holds<00:05:04.750> back<00:05:04.810> some<00:05:05.320> of<00:05:05.350> her<00:05:05.560> hair<00:05:05.620> and<00:05:06.040> then<00:05:06.160> you

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
holds back some of her hair and then you

have a lot of them and they all don't
get<00:06:32.810> much<00:06:33.230> attention<00:06:33.550> so<00:06:34.550> I<00:06:35.350> am<00:06:36.350> going<00:06:36.680> to<00:06:36.830> try

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 
get much attention so I am going to try

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.520 
get much attention so I am going to try
to<00:06:37.130> adopt<00:06:37.670> the<00:06:38.120> method<00:06:38.660> of<00:06:39.080> one<00:06:39.700> baby<00:06:40.700> per<00:06:40.820> week

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530 
to adopt the method of one baby per week

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.120 
to adopt the method of one baby per week
so<00:06:42.530> that<00:06:42.680> I<00:06:42.710> can<00:06:43.040> really<00:06:44.380> have<00:06:45.380> some<00:06:45.680> time<00:06:45.920> with

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.130 
so that I can really have some time with

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.360 
so that I can really have some time with
them<00:06:46.340> so<00:06:46.700> I<00:06:47.020> think<00:06:48.020> she'll<00:06:48.500> be<00:06:48.530> the<00:06:48.770> next<00:06:49.100> one

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370

them so I think she'll be the next one
because<00:06:52.090> she's<00:06:53.090> just<00:06:53.300> so<00:06:53.420> sweet<00:06:53.570> so<00:06:54.380> anyways
