blending this in so if you notice I'm

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.040 
blending this in so if you notice I'm
using<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.729> dual<00:01:11.940> fiber<00:01:12.240> brush<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.929> I'm<00:01:13.020> using

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
using a dual fiber brush and I'm using

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.340 
using a dual fiber brush and I'm using
circular<00:01:13.920> motions<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.640> blend<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.119> in

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
circular motions to blend this in

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.350 
circular motions to blend this in
sometimes<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.530> stop<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.190> blend<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:17.789> other<00:01:18.030> way

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
sometimes I stop and blend the other way

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.749 
sometimes I stop and blend the other way
in<00:01:18.570> circular<00:01:19.020> motions<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.830> wax<00:01:20.160> on<00:01:20.429> wax

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
in circular motions like a wax on wax

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.749 
in circular motions like a wax on wax
off<00:01:21.090> type<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.630> deal<00:01:21.899> and<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.920> really<00:01:23.280> like<00:01:23.520> this

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
off type of deal and I really like this

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.910 
off type of deal and I really like this
because<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.390> dual<00:01:24.539> fiber<00:01:24.869> brush<00:01:25.229> deposits

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
because the dual fiber brush deposits

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.650 
because the dual fiber brush deposits
the<00:01:26.100> minerals<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.789> lot<00:01:27.000> more<00:01:27.210> lightly<00:01:27.479> than

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
the minerals a lot more lightly than

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.169 
the minerals a lot more lightly than
let's<00:01:28.110> say<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.289> kabuki<00:01:28.800> brush<00:01:28.830> so<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.729> add<00:01:29.940> about

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
let's say a kabuki brush so I add about

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:32.419 
let's say a kabuki brush so I add about
two<00:01:30.509> layers<00:01:30.899> of<00:01:31.050> well<00:01:31.409> buffed<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:31.979> minerals

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429 
two layers of well buffed in minerals

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:35.670 
two layers of well buffed in minerals
and<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.789> comes<00:01:33.000> out<00:01:33.119> perfect

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
and it comes out perfect

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.710 
and it comes out perfect
my<00:01:36.370> favorite<00:01:36.820> concealer<00:01:37.150> from<00:01:37.510> bareMinerals

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
my favorite concealer from bareMinerals

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.960 
my favorite concealer from bareMinerals
is<00:01:38.290> called<00:01:38.530> well-rested<00:01:39.070> that's<00:01:39.700> what<00:01:39.880> I'm

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
is called well-rested that's what I'm

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.060 
is called well-rested that's what I'm
using<00:01:40.210> right<00:01:40.360> here<00:01:40.840> I<00:01:41.050> really<00:01:41.710> like<00:01:41.890> it

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
using right here I really like it

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.650 
using right here I really like it
because<00:01:42.190> it's<00:01:42.520> a<00:01:42.610> lighter<00:01:42.850> tone<00:01:43.210> that<00:01:43.420> I<00:01:43.510> can

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
because it's a lighter tone that I can

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.210 
because it's a lighter tone that I can
highlight<00:01:44.020> with<00:01:44.290> and<00:01:44.560> it<00:01:44.680> takes<00:01:44.920> away<00:01:45.190> all

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
highlight with and it takes away all

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.030 
highlight with and it takes away all
redness<00:01:46.090> if<00:01:46.420> you're<00:01:46.990> more<00:01:47.200> dark<00:01:47.530> complected

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
redness if you're more dark complected

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.890 
redness if you're more dark complected

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.130 
supposed to put one layer and buff it in
for<00:04:52.430> a<00:04:52.460> good<00:04:52.610> 45<00:04:52.880> seconds<00:04:53.480> if<00:04:53.600> it's<00:04:53.750> not<00:04:53.900> enough

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
for a good 45 seconds if it's not enough

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.930 
for a good 45 seconds if it's not enough
coverage<00:04:54.560> go<00:04:54.860> ahead<00:04:55.040> and<00:04:55.160> add<00:04:55.280> a<00:04:55.310> second<00:04:55.760> layer
