 let's see what's next 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.610
 most likely we will go immediately to 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.610
 passport control by signs 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.439

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.760
 detectors travel speed 8 kilometers 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:22.260
 an hour and then we go our own corridor 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.040
 he is here for non-eu cars 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.040

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.060
 introduction and we are still burning red 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.490
 traffic light 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.420
 waiting for the green light we drive up 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.580

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.190
 and passport control pretty quickly we 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.220
 as always here we are going to go alone 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:46.450
 that is the barrier and we will be officially 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.090
 on the territory of estonia eu now 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.370

 speed limit 50 in populated 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.510
 points in 90 out of settlements on 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.750
 sitting with a history going it is unlikely you 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.940
 of course I will talk a little 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.820
 she shop limited to Russian in brief 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.740
 explained why the navigator so wanted 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.080
 so we went to Peter of usually on 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.300
 this border our milovke very huge 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.640
 queues because the track beat and rig 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:17.080
 Moscow River naturally all go from here 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:19.330
 in the same place on the Pechora go mostly our 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.569
 Russians are those who live in school in slippery 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.999
 areas Estonians do such 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.319
 the hatch really doesn't make sense but us 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:27.920
 very lucky today 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.780
 there was no queue for some reason 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.620
 limit it was very happy but 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.830
 was in light shock of this fact 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.930

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.090

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:19.370

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.370
 crooked signs 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:27.150
