00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.510
 your eyebrows are one of you 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.130
 most important features in your face and 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.600
 I work at every day 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.670
 I'm going to show you today what my 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.840
 current eyebrows 10 which is the 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.809
 products that I use for that 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.139
 first the mac brow duo in or ipad 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.150
 then a tweezerman tweezers i got from this 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.060
 a pink ribbon version 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.850
 a brush and brush and stacey this 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.630
 is the number seven and eyebrow gel and 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.250
 this is the l'oreal brow artists plumper 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.170
 as you can see I have already done this side 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.940
 I always wear my eyebrow powder 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.110
 if my foundation is still wet I have 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.450
 so my foundation and my concealer 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.760
 applied I have not powdered yet 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.379
 I do it only when I'm moving well 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.640
 signed and that I do for the powder 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.739
 just picks up better on a wet 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.300
 background and like me 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.250
 eyebrow pencil would use would 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.170
 I first powder and then draw some 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.370
 better picks on a dry surface 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.199
 very logical 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.629
 i use mac eyebrow powder 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.829
 this is the woman you save it i know 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.149
 not sure if this is still in it 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.230
 assortment is there but I find this whole 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.420
 very nice 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.590
 the nsd set brow bar is also nice though 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.899
 you can also just have a matte brown 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.010
 use eye shadow or an eye shadow 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.439
 in a matte shade that matches your hair color 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.390
 For example, I have the urban here 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.619
 decay naked basics palette and there is one 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.680
 color and which I sometimes use for my 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.350
 Eyebrows use is namely 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.790
 brown shade this one that can also be very good 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.380
 so you don't even have one 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.790
 use eyebrow powder 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.880
 what I do first is an eyebrow 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.490
 comb all the way down 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.950
 this does not look so nice, but you can 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.090
 you nicely draw that top line 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.799
 so i grab a bit of one 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.049
 eyebrow powder I turned out darkest 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.869
 my palette you dip my brush in there 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.790
 and then I start with the top line or 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.350
 its actually a straight line 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.090
 must sit 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.689
 sees the hairs start here 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.260
 it is not pretty full I go there slowly 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:53.200
 gently 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:55.530
 I draw a line there so I start 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.530
 with that 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:04.360
 and then I continue that line slowly 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.920
 follow to the side and I make myself 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.580
 always quite a bit longer than they 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.580
 are like that 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.790
 as you can see it does n't really make a corner 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.310
 in my eyebrow I don't think so 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.290
 nice i just make them nice around i add 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.610
 the existing lines 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.920
 well now i can lift everything and i brush 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.040
 the equally well through so I am the worst 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.780
 remove hard lines this is already one 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.760
 world of difference 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.200
 now i'm going to update the bottom line 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.240
 I can do that well now and then I follow 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.920
 just the line that is at the bottom 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.260
 should sit there now so not yet 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.260
 so beautiful in it then I start here 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.239
 you see I do it very gently 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:59.320
 a little bit at a time 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:03:01.890
 this way you actually prevent mistakes 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.890
 I almost finished 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.290
 draw a little further through here and 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.519
 when you think you're done then 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.920
 it always good along from a distance 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.780
 view it is symmetrical 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.670
 well I notice that this one is a bit lighter 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.690
 is still than in other eyebrows I can 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.280
 do two things 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.620
 can I make this lighter or this one 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.070
 making darker now lighter is not 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.260
 so difficult 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.010
 just grab that brush and you go 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.290
 slowly so gently through that 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:33.960
 brushed eyebrow and brush 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:37.620
 then you automatically become a little lighter 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.120
 see where i think he got some 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.760
 needs the road just now 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.860
 a little bit with such a mine now 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.720
 I use eyebrows last 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.370
 always an eyebrow gel but then 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.740
 also at the very end so I'm going now 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.840
 just the eye makeup we just do mommy 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.310
 everything just the rest of her makeup and 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.020
 in the end i do that john that one more 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.390
 powder and so on and because I 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.010
 different and that powder goes into that jo 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.750
 hanna that just looks a bit dirty 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.310
 so I am going to powder now I would still 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.060
 part of this step 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.140
 they pack my so I pack my mac and prep 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.310
 prime transparent finishing powder 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.530
 pressed 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.280
 and with that I just powder everything 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.280
 just off 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.650
 now I will continue with the rest and then I will go 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.960
 later on the eyebrow gel 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.460
 and you also see sometimes 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.620
 people who make an eyebrow whole 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.120
 tight with concealer and the 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.440
 I don't think so because I like it 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.640
 find that bit of eyebrows 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.220
 to keep naturally 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.990
 and I think if I see them this way updated now 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.430
 you still a little crazy I go too 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.540
 not so out when i have no makeup 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.340
 I just wear my eyebrows 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.350
 not at all i am doing this alone 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.970
 combination with a whole look 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.080
 and I think it's nice to have one 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.430
 bit natural to keep but it is 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.110
 but just what you love you can do it too 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.940
 still update with concealer everything a lot 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.280
 tighten up but this is what I do myself 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.010
 the nicest thing is mine and makeup is there 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.450
 on the very last step is now the gel and 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.280
 which brings in my eyebrow so that my 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.780
 I keep my eyebrows up nicely 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.060
 wants it to rise that way and not to 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.800
 down and lift your face nice and 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.750
 then just the shape remains yours 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.630
 eyebrows good so I use that gel 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.630
 that comic through it nicely up 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.509
 it also gives just that extra for 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.280
 your eyebrows 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:20.669
 I just passed by that excellent one 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:22.470
 hairs get down so voila 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.180
 this is how I raise my eyebrows 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.500
 so i hope you enjoyed it too
