is a rather almost a fixed silicone case
but<00:00:46.420> it's<00:00:46.539> not<00:00:46.629> the<00:00:46.659> thinnest<00:00:47.079> case<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:47.469> world

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
but it's not the thinnest case the world

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:50.069 
but it's not the thinnest case the world
holds<00:00:48.010> it<00:00:48.100> just<00:00:48.309> fine<00:00:48.579> and<00:00:48.909> what<00:00:49.449> you<00:00:49.569> do<00:00:49.809> is

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
holds it just fine and what you do is

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.889 
holds it just fine and what you do is
you<00:00:50.739> kind<00:00:51.100> of<00:00:51.280> these<00:00:51.670> little<00:00:52.030> prongs<00:00:52.629> right

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899

you kind of these little prongs right
here<00:00:53.249> well<00:00:54.249> finger<00:00:54.579> things<00:00:54.819> you<00:00:55.089> form<00:00:55.449> them

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
here well finger things you form them

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.180

will<00:00:58.870> fit<00:00:58.899> and<00:00:59.379> then<00:01:00.039> it<00:01:00.339> just<00:01:00.519> simply<00:01:00.729> snaps

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
will fit and then it just simply snaps

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.530 
will fit and then it just simply snaps
