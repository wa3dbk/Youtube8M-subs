 squares where you have tape here on the radio is not just about

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.110

 I feel like I'm in tune 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.240
 I remember that I was getting some mango stick that my uncle had over there in 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.230
 a farm and she was already starting to tell football 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.200

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.760
 mine was my thing it was like 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.109
 as a like improvisation 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:49.200

 celtic and is that the rumba in the evening to head a ball 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.949
 in those came 1 - you palms that is more like the house and that 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:34.389

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:39.420
 going through one of the best is pa in my life and that is the father being a 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.309
 Spectacular girl of a beautiful girl 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:46.869

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.299
 say that not many publisher hear country and how are they going to che the port to 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.579
 brown because in this larra 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.339
 the communication oil 

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:01.449
 always navata the girl who soon won the consumption was heard from the 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:02.570
 authority 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.090
 sometimes I do not know from the station slogan as they are that as for women 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.900
 because it presupposes a committed man yes clear 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.890
 the north of Fabian will always be the temptations 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.600
 and more on this bridge was the radio and the television too 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.190
 but it's in having as a fixed goal because you know yes 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.940
 or we know that if we are here or there we will not get anywhere 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.370
 is to have something fixed high to have a goal to have vision 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.749
