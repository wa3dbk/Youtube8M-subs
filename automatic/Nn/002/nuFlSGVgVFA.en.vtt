 Today I propose to make a slide for 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.250
 small 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:40.420
 toys we need a package from under 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:43.820
 milk products cardboard boxes 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.739
 different types of glue at different stages of work 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.800
 I will use glue pencil glue 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.440
 pva and hot glue for those who do not have 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.969
 hot glue you can use any 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.410
 another glue with similar features 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:02.719
 cocktail scissors 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.960
 pen or pencil small scissors 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:09.440
 ruler colored paper or paper for 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.420
 scrapbooking and else i will use 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.039
 self-adhesive film but instead 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.619
 Of course, you can use color 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:18.259
 I also need paper 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.090
 a small piece of corrugated cardboard like 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.220
 playground on which will be located 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:28.780
 slide for a start glue colored paper and 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.780
 make a platform for your slide 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.390
 now glue the box self-adhesive 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.830
 film or colored paper as anyone 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.400
 like the top of the box with each 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.700
 parties 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:55.380
 draw rectangles of size 8 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:58.170
 centimeters by 6 and 2 centimeters so 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.869
 let's do in each direction that is four 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.400
 rectangle now these rectangles 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.180
 need to cut 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:11.700
 cut a few pieces of the straw and in 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:15.180
 sticking them in this way cut out 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.920
 glue a small piece of cardboard 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.850
 colored paper or self-adhesive 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.570
 film 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.769
 my case is the size of this piece 6 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:28.880
 and 8 millimeters at 6 and 8 millimeters he 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:34.130
 should enter exactly-exactly 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.130
 here we glue here 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:52.950
 if your box had a cork 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:55.540
 need to remove need to make a roof 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.390
 measure this distance to me 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.950
 it turns out 4 centimeters and this 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.730
 I get a distance of seven 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.069
 centimeters 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.519
 I do not exclude that other boxes can 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:09.129
 have a friend a different size so you need 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:12.459
 will measure independently draw 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:16.900
 roof pattern and so my height 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:19.659
 four centimeters here four centimeters 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.959
 here I have 7 centimeters I take with 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:25.060
 a small margin of 7 and 4 and draw 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.150
 triangle adding one by one 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.290
 centimeter with flaps for 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:35.189
 gluing such parts will require two 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.189
 scratching the bonding place 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:53.240
 now the top of the roof is width 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.240
 the width of the box is this distance 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:04.100
 length from above the top of the triangle to 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.100
 its base glue the roof 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:19.470
 glue the roof of the box cut out 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.519
 several rectangles of size 18 on 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.080
 6 centimeters 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.660
 glue them together and good 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.950
 dry under a heavy object 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:36.090
 cut out another rectangle with 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:40.700
 a small margin above and below and with 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:46.080
 sides add half a centimeter 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:52.640
 align the central part of our 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.640
 the cut parts excess cut off 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.530
 we scratch the places of the folds 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.390
 side parts are reinforced with additional 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.250
 stripes 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.130
 glue the details with colored paper or 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:24.730
 self-adhesive film 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:28.450
 glue the parts together now need 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.990
 glue the house to the base and slide to 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.630
 house 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:35.550
 instead of gluing we decorate 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:38.490
 small pieces of colored paper or 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:42.010
 self-adhesive film on all sides 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:52.300
 let's make two songs from the tubes 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:58.350
 tubing at an angle we glue the tubules 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:06:02.010
 on the other hand we will make 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.010
 flat ladder 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:16.710
 back side glue two crossbars 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:20.030
 that's all the slide is ready you can please 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:22.800
 small dolls and you can decorate more 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:27.600
 here is an artificial platform 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:29.660
 greens which is sold fix stores 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.460
 price 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.910
 all good work and see you in
