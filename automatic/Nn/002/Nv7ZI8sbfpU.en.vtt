00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
because of the insane amount of lag that

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.630 
because of the insane amount of lag that
people<00:01:21.369> are<00:01:21.670> experiencing<00:01:22.479> and<00:01:22.810> I<00:01:23.380> mean<00:01:23.640> I've

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
helps I because I haven't have I five

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.280 
helps I because I haven't have I five
4670k<00:01:44.170> with<00:01:44.770> a<00:01:44.799> gtx<00:01:45.509> 760<00:01:46.509> which<00:01:46.659> is<00:01:46.810> not<00:01:46.990> the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
4670k with a gtx 760 which is not the

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.090 
4670k with a gtx 760 which is not the
greatest<00:01:47.619> of<00:01:48.040> graphics<00:01:48.579> cards<00:01:49.680> it's<00:01:50.680> about

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
greatest of graphics cards it's about

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.760 
greatest of graphics cards it's about
equal<00:01:51.789> to<00:01:52.030> I<00:01:52.060> guess<00:01:52.479> around<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.259> gtx<00:01:53.770> 670<00:01:54.549> um

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
equal to I guess around the gtx 670 um

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.779 
equal to I guess around the gtx 670 um
and<00:01:56.770> I<00:01:57.219> run<00:01:57.490> bf3<00:01:57.939> on<00:01:58.479> ultra<00:01:59.020> at<00:01:59.259> 60<00:02:00.039> plus<00:02:00.460> frames

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
and I run bf3 on ultra at 60 plus frames

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.020 
and I run bf3 on ultra at 60 plus frames
per<00:02:01.000> second<00:02:01.420> so<00:02:02.229> when<00:02:02.920> I<00:02:02.950> got<00:02:03.310> on<00:02:03.340> this<00:02:03.700> game

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
per second so when I got on this game

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.870 
per second so when I got on this game
and<00:02:04.420> I<00:02:04.509> was<00:02:04.630> getting<00:02:04.899> 50<00:02:05.799> frames<00:02:06.070> per<00:02:06.399> second

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
and I was getting 50 frames per second

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.080 
and I was getting 50 frames per second
and<00:02:07.119> what<00:02:07.689> they<00:02:07.899> did<00:02:07.930> to<00:02:08.410> as<00:02:08.560> low<00:02:08.769> as<00:02:09.100> 10<00:02:09.549> frames

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
and what they did to as low as 10 frames

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.450 
and what they did to as low as 10 frames
per<00:02:10.359> second<00:02:10.810> I<00:02:11.019> was<00:02:11.859> like<00:02:12.010> what<00:02:12.609> is<00:02:13.000> going

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
per second I was like what is going

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.930 
per second I was like what is going
on<00:02:13.900> so<00:02:14.900> um<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.560> went<00:02:15.740> into<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.130> settings<00:02:16.550> I

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
on so um I went into the settings I

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.360 
on so um I went into the settings I
noticed<00:02:17.570> that<00:02:17.660> full<00:02:18.200> screen<00:02:18.560> mode<00:02:18.800> was<00:02:19.190> not

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
noticed that full screen mode was not

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.550 
noticed that full screen mode was not
actually<00:02:19.880> on<00:02:20.090> full<00:02:20.480> screen<00:02:20.720> but<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:21.140> was<00:02:21.290> still

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
actually on full screen but it was still

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.830 
actually on full screen but it was still
windows<00:02:22.100> it<00:02:22.550> looks<00:02:22.880> full<00:02:23.150> screen<00:02:23.510> because

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
windows it looks full screen because

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.600 
windows it looks full screen because
obviously<00:02:24.020> my<00:02:25.990> my<00:02:26.990> resolution<00:02:27.680> is<00:02:27.890> equal<00:02:28.400> to

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
obviously my my resolution is equal to

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.130 
obviously my my resolution is equal to
my<00:02:28.730> screen<00:02:29.030> resolution<00:02:29.690> is<00:02:29.810> my<00:02:29.960> native

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
my screen resolution is my native

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.210 
my screen resolution is my native
resolution<00:02:30.500> um<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.480> changed<00:02:33.470> that<00:02:33.680> full

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
resolution um so I changed that full

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.530 
resolution um so I changed that full
screen<00:02:34.550> mode<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:35.600> full<00:02:35.990> screen<00:02:36.230> I<00:02:37.390> turned<00:02:38.390> off

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
screen mode to full screen I turned off

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.490 
screen mode to full screen I turned off
ambient<00:02:39.140> occlusion<00:02:39.380> I<00:02:41.050> turned<00:02:42.050> off<00:02:42.200> any

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
ambient occlusion I turned off any

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.410 
ambient occlusion I turned off any
aliasing<00:02:43.340> because<00:02:43.760> that's<00:02:43.940> really<00:02:44.120> not

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
aliasing because that's really not

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.540 
aliasing because that's really not
necessary<00:02:44.630> when<00:02:45.260> you're<00:02:45.410> running<00:02:45.590> at<00:02:46.130> full

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
necessary when you're running at full

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.540 
necessary when you're running at full
resolution<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.630> I<00:02:48.350> turn<00:02:48.590> off<00:02:48.710> post<00:02:49.040> process

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
resolution and I turn off post process

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.370 
resolution and I turn off post process
which<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:49.880> wasn't<00:02:50.240> really<00:02:50.360> sure<00:02:50.450> about<00:02:50.870> but

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
which I wasn't really sure about but

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.740 
which I wasn't really sure about but
when<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:51.650> was<00:02:51.890> when<00:02:52.580> I<00:02:52.640> was<00:02:52.730> noticing<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.540> lag

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
when I was when I was noticing the lag

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.560 
when I was when I was noticing the lag
spikes<00:02:54.230> it<00:02:54.980> would<00:02:55.220> really<00:02:55.370> heavy<00:02:55.910> on<00:02:56.150> my<00:02:56.300> cpu

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
spikes it would really heavy on my cpu

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.410 
spikes it would really heavy on my cpu
