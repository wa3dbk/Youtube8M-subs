game theory is one of those particular
concepts<00:00:07.580> that<00:00:07.700> pupils<00:00:07.939> can<00:00:08.389> find<00:00:08.809> either

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:09.350 
concepts that pupils can find either

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.669 
concepts that pupils can find either
very<00:00:09.770> easy<00:00:10.129> or<00:00:11.030> very<00:00:11.450> difficult<00:00:11.750> depending<00:00:12.440> on

how its taught Kelly the focus needs to

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.670 
how its taught Kelly the focus needs to
be<00:00:15.769> on<00:00:15.920> firms<00:00:16.730> but<00:00:17.390> a<00:00:17.450> good<00:00:17.689> way<00:00:17.900> to<00:00:17.960> start<00:00:18.320> is

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
be on firms but a good way to start is

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.019 
be on firms but a good way to start is
by<00:00:19.130> considering<00:00:19.790> the<00:00:20.150> prisoner's<00:00:20.599> dilemma

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029 
by considering the prisoner's dilemma

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.190 
by considering the prisoner's dilemma
using<00:00:23.029> the<00:00:23.119> prisoner's<00:00:23.540> dilemma<00:00:23.689> gives

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.200 
using the prisoner's dilemma gives

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.990 
using the prisoner's dilemma gives
pupils<00:00:24.649> the<00:00:24.770> opportunity<00:00:25.369> to<00:00:25.520> focus<00:00:25.700> on

pupils the opportunity to focus on

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.210 
pupils the opportunity to focus on
examples<00:00:26.329> that<00:00:26.599> they<00:00:26.720> may<00:00:26.869> be<00:00:26.930> used<00:00:27.050> to<00:00:27.439> from

individually or they could decide to
collude<00:01:07.240> in<00:01:08.240> this<00:01:08.870> case<00:01:09.200> what<00:01:09.650> we're<00:01:09.800> able<00:01:09.950> to
