welcome<00:00:00.870> to<00:00:00.989> lecture<00:00:01.319> online<00:00:01.469> and<00:00:01.890> here<00:00:02.460> we're

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
welcome to lecture online and here we're

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.150 
welcome to lecture online and here we're
going<00:00:02.909> to<00:00:03.060> discover<00:00:03.629> another<00:00:04.230> result<00:00:04.950> of

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
going to discover another result of

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.490 
going to discover another result of
relativistic<00:00:05.970> effects<00:00:06.420> let's<00:00:07.020> say<00:00:07.200> we<00:00:07.319> have<00:00:07.470> a

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
relativistic effects let's say we have a

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.230 
relativistic effects let's say we have a
spaceship<00:00:08.010> traveling<00:00:08.460> very<00:00:08.610> fast<00:00:08.730> with

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
spaceship traveling very fast with

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.930 
spaceship traveling very fast with
velocity<00:00:09.750> u<00:00:09.780> relative<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.940> stationary

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
velocity u relative to the stationary

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.209 
velocity u relative to the stationary
reference<00:00:12.090> frame<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:13.080> let's<00:00:13.740> say<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:14.040> the

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
reference frame and let's say that the

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.310 
reference frame and let's say that the
very<00:00:14.490> front<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.059> spaceship<00:00:15.870> there<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.199> a

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
very front of the spaceship there is a

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.050 
very front of the spaceship there is a
flashing<00:00:16.740> light<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.460> let's<00:00:17.670> say<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:17.940> the

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
flashing light and let's say that the

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.120 
flashing light and let's say that the
light<00:00:18.270> flashes<00:00:18.900> at<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.080> frequency<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.680> 100

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
light flashes at a frequency of 100

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.179 
light flashes at a frequency of 100
Hertz<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:20.520> 100<00:00:20.880> flashes<00:00:21.539> per<00:00:21.810> second<00:00:22.289> but

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
Hertz so 100 flashes per second but

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.490 
Hertz so 100 flashes per second but
since<00:00:23.580> as<00:00:23.910> space<00:00:24.359> ship<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.689> moving<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.260> fast

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
since as space ship is moving so fast

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.660 
since as space ship is moving so fast
that<00:00:26.810> by<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.869> time<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.680> next<00:00:29.039> flash<00:00:29.279> occurs

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
that by the time the next flash occurs

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.970 
that by the time the next flash occurs
the<00:00:30.179> first<00:00:30.449> flash<00:00:30.810> will<00:00:31.109> have<00:00:31.260> moved<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.949> a

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
the first flash will have moved to a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.010 
the first flash will have moved to a
distance<00:00:32.520> right<00:00:32.700> here<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.450> distance<00:00:33.899> of

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
distance right here the distance of

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.540 
distance right here the distance of
course<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.559> going<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.829> be<00:00:34.890> equal<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.309> speed

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
course is going to be equal to the speed

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.020 
course is going to be equal to the speed
of<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.790> light<00:00:36.450> C<00:00:37.050> times<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.010> period<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.730> time

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
of the light C times the period the time

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.119 
of the light C times the period the time
between<00:00:39.210> flashes<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.710> will<00:00:40.829> be<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
between flashes so that will be the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.610 
between flashes so that will be the
distance<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.940> flash<00:00:42.180> travels<00:00:42.840> as<00:00:43.050> it's

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
distance that the flash travels as it's

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.619 
distance that the flash travels as it's
going<00:00:43.860> towards<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.309> observer<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.940> then<00:00:45.480> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
going towards the observer and then the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.240 
going towards the observer and then the
next<00:00:45.930> slash<00:00:46.140> will<00:00:46.379> occur<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.710> course<00:00:46.950> by<00:00:47.070> then

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
next slash will occur of course by then

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.799 
next slash will occur of course by then
the<00:00:47.700> spaceship<00:00:48.090> will<00:00:48.270> have<00:00:48.390> moved<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
the spaceship will have moved the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.540 
the spaceship will have moved the
distance<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.379> far<00:00:49.649> which<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> speed<00:00:50.370> as<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
distance this far which is a speed as a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.569 
distance this far which is a speed as a
spaceship<00:00:51.030> times<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.989> period<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:53.370> course

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
spaceship times the period and of course

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.850 
spaceship times the period and of course
the<00:00:54.030> period<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.510> course<00:00:54.750> as<00:00:54.960> seen<00:00:55.440> by<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
the period of course as seen by the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.959 
the period of course as seen by the
observer<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.210> earth<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:58.730> that<00:00:59.730> means

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
observer on the earth and that means

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.880 
observer on the earth and that means
that<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.690> wavelength<00:01:01.199> which<00:01:01.379> normal<00:01:01.800> would

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
that the wavelength which normal would

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.619 
that the wavelength which normal would
have<00:01:01.980> been<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.309> long<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.879> going<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.329> be<00:01:03.420> much

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
have been this long is going to be much

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.240 
have been this long is going to be much
shorter<00:01:03.660> now<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:04.470> going<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.650> be<00:01:04.710> compressed

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
shorter now it's going to be compressed

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.640 
shorter now it's going to be compressed
because<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.390> spaceship<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.990> moving<00:01:07.350> towards

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
because the spaceship is moving towards

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.620 
because the spaceship is moving towards
the<00:01:07.740> absorber<00:01:08.189> giving<00:01:08.700> observer<00:01:09.210> given<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the absorber giving observer given the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.810 
the absorber giving observer given the
Doppler<00:01:10.049> shift<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.369> observed

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
Doppler shift and so the observed

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.060 
Doppler shift and so the observed
wavelength<00:01:12.450> then<00:01:12.990> will<00:01:13.170> only<00:01:13.350> be<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.770> long

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
wavelength then will only be this long

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.710 
wavelength then will only be this long
and<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.670> find<00:01:14.880> out<00:01:15.030> what<00:01:15.150> that's<00:01:15.270> equal<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
and to find out what that's equal to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.200 
and to find out what that's equal to
that<00:01:16.020> has<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.320> be<00:01:16.409> equal<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.680> C<00:01:17.369> times<00:01:17.400> t<00:01:17.939> minus

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
that has to be equal to C times t minus

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.870 
that has to be equal to C times t minus
u<00:01:19.049> times<00:01:19.290> T<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:20.100> that's<00:01:20.280> going<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.520> be<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
u times T so that's going to be the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.120 
u times T so that's going to be the
observed<00:01:21.600> wavelength<00:01:21.869> by<00:01:22.290> observer<00:01:22.740> which<00:01:22.979> is

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
observed wavelength by observer which is

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.850 
observed wavelength by observer which is
equal<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.369> C<00:01:23.670> minus<00:01:23.939> u<00:01:24.180> times<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.810> period<00:01:25.290> and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
equal to C minus u times the period and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.890 
equal to C minus u times the period and
again<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.369> period<00:01:26.640> as<00:01:26.880> observed<00:01:27.330> by<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
again the period as observed by the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.990 
again the period as observed by the
observer<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.619> earth<00:01:28.740> because<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.670> period

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
observer on the earth because the period

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.880 
observer on the earth because the period
as<00:01:30.270> observed<00:01:30.900> by<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.200> person<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
as observed by the person on the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.590 
as observed by the person on the
spaceship<00:01:32.310> let's<00:01:32.610> say<00:01:32.729> that's<00:01:32.880> observer<00:01:33.299> B

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
spaceship let's say that's observer B

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.840 
spaceship let's say that's observer B
that's<00:01:34.229> going<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.710> equal<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:34.979> simply<00:01:35.520> 1

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
that's going to be equal to simply 1

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.510 
that's going to be equal to simply 1
over<00:01:36.180> F<00:01:36.390> which<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.290> frequency<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
over F which is the frequency of the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.640 
over F which is the frequency of the
light<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.090> spaceship<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.229> observer

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
light on the spaceship so this observer

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.370 
light on the spaceship so this observer
sees<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.610> frequency<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.420> light<00:01:42.780> at<00:01:42.990> 100

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
sees the frequency of the light at 100

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.469

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
observer or of the spaceship so let's

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.680 
observer or of the spaceship so let's
plug<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.700> number<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.150> we<00:02:27.270> have<00:02:27.420> over

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
plug in the number that we have over

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.360 
plug in the number that we have over
here<00:02:27.900> well<00:02:28.050> I<00:02:28.080> didn't<00:02:28.470> have<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.650> number<00:02:28.920> so

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
here well I didn't have a number so

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.490 
here well I didn't have a number so
let's<00:02:29.640> say<00:02:29.850> that<00:02:29.880> we<00:02:30.210> plug<00:02:30.510> in<00:02:30.690> this<00:02:31.170> equal<00:02:31.470> to

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
let's say that we plug in this equal to

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.210 
let's say that we plug in this equal to
0.8<00:02:32.460> C<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.240> figure<00:02:34.200> out<00:02:34.260> what<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:34.950> equal

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
0.8 C and figure out what that is equal

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.830 
0.8 C and figure out what that is equal
to<00:02:35.250> alright<00:02:35.880> so<00:02:36.060> in<00:02:36.150> this<00:02:36.240> case<00:02:37.040> gamma<00:02:38.840> which

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
to alright so in this case gamma which

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.720 
to alright so in this case gamma which
is<00:02:39.870> going<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.200> be<00:02:40.260> 1<00:02:40.500> over<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:41.100> square<00:02:41.310> root<00:02:41.580> of

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
is going to be 1 over the square root of

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.900 
is going to be 1 over the square root of
1<00:02:42.420> minus<00:02:42.450> v<00:02:43.140> square<00:02:43.170> over<00:02:43.680> C<00:02:43.890> square<00:02:44.100> that's

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
1 minus v square over C square that's

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.550 
1 minus v square over C square that's
going<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.240> be<00:02:45.330> equal<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.540> 1<00:02:45.810> over<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.230> square

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
going to be equal to 1 over the square

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.550 
going to be equal to 1 over the square
root<00:02:46.770> of<00:02:46.920> 1<00:02:47.430> minus<00:02:47.840> 0.8<00:02:48.840> squared<00:02:49.320> of<00:02:49.500> course

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
root of 1 minus 0.8 squared of course

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.960 
root of 1 minus 0.8 squared of course
remember<00:02:50.130> that<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.490> C's<00:02:51.060> cancel<00:02:51.420> out<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.970> so

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
remember that the C's cancel out and so

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.300 
remember that the C's cancel out and so
we<00:02:54.030> have<00:02:54.120> point<00:02:54.420> 8<00:02:54.570> we<00:02:55.080> square<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.590> we

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
we have point 8 we square that we

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.570 
we have point 8 we square that we
subtract<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:56.910> from<00:02:56.970> 1<00:02:58.130> we<00:02:59.130> don't<00:02:59.310> take<00:02:59.430> the

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
subtract that from 1 we don't take the

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.230 
subtract that from 1 we don't take the
square<00:02:59.850> root<00:03:00.000> of<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:02.240> everything

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
square root of that and everything

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.100 
square root of that and everything
inverse<00:03:04.580> okay<00:03:05.580> so<00:03:05.790> we<00:03:06.060> have<00:03:06.150> gamma<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.840> equal

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
inverse okay so we have gamma is equal

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.760 
inverse okay so we have gamma is equal
to<00:03:07.290> 1<00:03:07.620> point<00:03:07.920> 6<00:03:08.310> 6<00:03:08.760> 7<00:03:09.150> which<00:03:09.870> means<00:03:10.200> that<00:03:10.560> the

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
to 1 point 6 6 7 which means that the

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.640 
to 1 point 6 6 7 which means that the
period<00:03:11.280> as<00:03:11.610> seen<00:03:12.270> by<00:03:12.870> an<00:03:13.080> observer<00:03:13.170> on<00:03:13.530> the

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
earth is equal to 1 point 6 6 7 times

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.370 
earth is equal to 1 point 6 6 7 times
the<00:03:17.130> period<00:03:17.460> as<00:03:17.730> seen<00:03:18.180> by<00:03:18.390> an<00:03:18.420> observer<00:03:18.630> over

the period as seen by an observer over
here<00:03:19.650> now<00:03:21.050> remember<00:03:22.050> that<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.830> speed<00:03:23.640> of

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.780 
we factor out a C Square from the
radical<00:05:29.910> times<00:05:30.900> the<00:05:31.080> square<00:05:31.440> root<00:05:31.470> of<00:05:31.790> C

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
radical times the square root of C

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.370 
radical times the square root of C
squared<00:05:32.850> minus<00:05:33.540> u<00:05:33.720> squared<00:05:34.080> that's<00:05:34.290> the

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
squared minus u squared that's the

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.920 
squared minus u squared that's the
difference<00:05:34.740> of<00:05:34.920> squares<00:05:35.460> so<00:05:36.090> I<00:05:36.210> can<00:05:36.360> see<00:05:36.510> right

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
difference of squares so I can see right

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.260 
difference of squares so I can see right
there's<00:05:37.140> a<00:05:37.230> C<00:05:37.470> minus<00:05:37.860> u<00:05:38.100> times<00:05:38.880> C<00:05:39.210> Plus<00:05:40.200> u<00:05:40.770> and

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
there's a C minus u times C Plus u and

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.630 
there's a C minus u times C Plus u and
the<00:05:42.270> whole<00:05:42.420> thing<00:05:42.630> divided<00:05:42.930> by<00:05:43.260> and<00:05:43.650> if<00:05:44.490> I<00:05:44.610> then

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
the whole thing divided by and if I then

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.270 
the whole thing divided by and if I then
squared<00:05:45.570> is<00:05:45.780> and<00:05:45.990> put<00:05:46.170> on<00:05:46.290> either<00:05:46.470> radical<00:05:47.100> I

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
squared is and put on either radical I

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.330 
squared is and put on either radical I
can<00:05:47.610> say<00:05:47.850> this<00:05:48.000> is<00:05:48.180> equal<00:05:48.450> to<00:05:48.690> C<00:05:49.500> minus<00:05:49.890> u

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
can say this is equal to C minus u

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.420 
can say this is equal to C minus u
quantity<00:05:51.000> squared<00:05:51.780> of<00:05:52.500> course<00:05:52.740> this<00:05:52.950> cancels

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
quantity squared of course this cancels

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.640 
quantity squared of course this cancels
out<00:05:53.610> we<00:05:53.940> can't<00:05:54.210> forget<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:54.570> T<00:05:54.990> sub<00:05:55.170> not<00:05:55.410> in<00:05:55.560> the

out we can't forget the T sub not in the

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.710 
out we can't forget the T sub not in the
denominator<00:05:55.800> right<00:05:56.250> there<00:05:56.640> and<00:05:56.820> of<00:05:57.630> course

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720

you<00:05:57.930> can<00:05:58.140> see<00:05:58.290> that<00:05:58.320> this<00:05:58.920> C<00:05:59.250> minus<00:05:59.430> u<00:05:59.790> will

cancel out this C minus u and finally we

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.060 
cancel out this C minus u and finally we

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
can say that this is equal to the square

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.810 
can say that this is equal to the square

that the frequency that observed it is

divided by speed of light which is C
minus<00:07:11.630> 0.8<00:07:12.470> C<00:07:12.740> times<00:07:13.580> the<00:07:13.880> original<00:07:14.330> frequency

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:20.980 
minus 0.8 C times the original frequency
which<00:07:15.200> we<00:07:15.380> said<00:07:15.590> was<00:07:15.800> 100<00:07:16.190> Hertz<00:07:19.150> and<00:07:20.150> so<00:07:20.840> this

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:20.990 
which we said was 100 Hertz and so this

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.670 
which we said was 100 Hertz and so this
becomes<00:07:21.320> 1.8<00:07:22.070> C<00:07:22.340> divided<00:07:22.790> by<00:07:22.880> 0.2<00:07:23.660> C<00:07:23.960> and<00:07:24.229> the

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:24.680 
becomes 1.8 C divided by 0.2 C and the

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.500 
becomes 1.8 C divided by 0.2 C and the
C's<00:07:24.889> will<00:07:25.100> cancel<00:07:25.490> out<00:07:25.580> so<00:07:25.639> would<00:07:25.940> be<00:07:26.090> 1<00:07:26.270> point

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:26.510 
C's will cancel out so would be 1 point

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.350 
C's will cancel out so would be 1 point
8<00:07:26.570> divided<00:07:26.930> by<00:07:26.960> 0.2<00:07:27.410> which<00:07:27.560> is<00:07:27.850> 9<00:07:28.850> so<00:07:29.210> that

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360 
8 divided by 0.2 which is 9 so that

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.260 
8 divided by 0.2 which is 9 so that
would<00:07:29.510> be<00:07:29.660> the<00:07:29.900> square<00:07:30.200> root<00:07:30.410> of<00:07:30.560> 9<00:07:30.979> times<00:07:31.340> 100

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:32.270 
would be the square root of 9 times 100

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.290 
would be the square root of 9 times 100
Hertz<00:07:32.510> and<00:07:33.310> of<00:07:34.310> course<00:07:34.550> the<00:07:34.729> square<00:07:35.000> root<00:07:35.090> of<00:07:35.150> 9

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:35.300 
Hertz and of course the square root of 9

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.690 
Hertz and of course the square root of 9
is<00:07:35.330> the<00:07:35.510> same<00:07:35.900> as<00:07:36.080> 3<00:07:36.470> so<00:07:36.919> this<00:07:37.070> would<00:07:37.280> be<00:07:37.430> 3

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:37.700 
is the same as 3 so this would be 3

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.690 
is the same as 3 so this would be 3
times<00:07:38.030> 100<00:07:38.360> Hertz<00:07:38.690> or<00:07:38.930> 300<00:07:39.770> Hertz<00:07:41.620> which<00:07:42.620> means

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:42.700 
times 100 Hertz or 300 Hertz which means

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.159 
times 100 Hertz or 300 Hertz which means
that<00:07:43.700> if<00:07:44.000> you<00:07:44.150> have<00:07:44.180> a<00:07:44.270> spaceship<00:07:44.780> that's

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:45.169 
that if you have a spaceship that's

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:47.350 
that if you have a spaceship that's
moving<00:07:45.470> at<00:07:45.710> 0.8<00:07:46.160> C<00:07:46.400> 80<00:07:46.700> percent<00:07:47.060> speed<00:07:47.240> of

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 
moving at 0.8 C 80 percent speed of

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.630 
moving at 0.8 C 80 percent speed of
light<00:07:47.510> and<00:07:47.720> it<00:07:48.229> has<00:07:48.440> a<00:07:48.470> flashing<00:07:49.070> light<00:07:49.280> at<00:07:49.550> the

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:49.640 
light and it has a flashing light at the

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.810 
light and it has a flashing light at the
very<00:07:49.850> front<00:07:50.620> it's<00:07:51.620> flashing<00:07:51.950> at<00:07:52.190> a<00:07:52.220> frequency

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:52.820 
very front it's flashing at a frequency

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.600 
very front it's flashing at a frequency
of<00:07:53.120> 100<00:07:53.330> Hertz<00:07:53.720> and<00:07:54.020> far<00:07:54.650> away<00:07:54.770> somebody<00:07:55.340> on<00:07:55.580> a

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:55.610 
of 100 Hertz and far away somebody on a

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.219 
of 100 Hertz and far away somebody on a
stationary<00:07:56.240> reference<00:07:56.360> frame<00:07:56.750> seeing<00:07:57.110> the

00:07:57.219 --> 00:07:57.229 
stationary reference frame seeing the

00:07:57.229 --> 00:07:59.469 
stationary reference frame seeing the
spaceship<00:07:57.620> approach<00:07:58.010> at<00:07:58.220> point<00:07:58.460> 8<00:07:58.580> C<00:07:58.850> will<00:07:59.330> see

00:07:59.469 --> 00:07:59.479 
spaceship approach at point 8 C will see

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:03.490 
spaceship approach at point 8 C will see
the<00:07:59.630> frequency<00:08:00.320> of<00:08:00.500> D<00:08:01.250> of<00:08:01.490> the<00:08:01.910> light<00:08:02.090> at<00:08:02.500> 300

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:03.500 
the frequency of D of the light at 300

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.380 
the frequency of D of the light at 300
Hertz<00:08:03.680> and<00:08:03.979> that's<00:08:04.820> how<00:08:04.970> you<00:08:05.030> do<00:08:05.150> a<00:08:05.180> problem

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:05.390 
Hertz and that's how you do a problem

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.840 
Hertz and that's how you do a problem
like<00:08:05.570> that
