the<00:03:28.530> emotional<00:03:29.040> explanation<00:03:29.760> better<00:03:29.970> it

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
the emotional explanation better it

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.210 
the emotional explanation better it
makes<00:03:30.690> everything<00:03:30.989> so<00:03:31.170> much<00:03:31.530> more<00:03:31.590> relatable

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.250 
makes everything so much more relatable
and<00:03:32.550> to<00:03:32.850> me<00:03:33.000> it's<00:03:33.239> less<00:03:33.450> important<00:03:34.019> to<00:03:34.110> know

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
and to me it's less important to know

how star flies than it is to know how
