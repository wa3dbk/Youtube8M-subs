no the Tristar seems to come out in two
different<00:00:25.099> I<00:00:26.900> guess<00:00:27.900> varieties<00:00:28.619> or

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
different I guess varieties or

formations of strawberries I'm not sure

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.030 
formations of strawberries I'm not sure
I<00:00:32.610> went<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.270> dropped<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:36.620> I'm<00:00:37.620> not<00:00:37.770> gonna<00:00:37.860> eat

I went and dropped it I'm not gonna eat
this<00:00:38.160> one<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.579> not<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> problem<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.450> dropped

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
this one so not a problem that I dropped

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.040 
this one so not a problem that I dropped
it<00:00:40.070> the<00:00:41.070> one<00:00:41.219> variety<00:00:41.430> looks<00:00:42.180> all<00:00:42.510> deformed

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
it the one variety looks all deformed

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.410 
it the one variety looks all deformed
and<00:00:43.370> kind<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.430> odd<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.969> typically

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
and kind of odd and it typically

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.750 
and kind of odd and it typically
clusters<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.170> seeds<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.649> your<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:46.920> end<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.309> find

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
clusters of seeds in your one end I find

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.060 
clusters of seeds in your one end I find
these<00:00:47.969> are<00:00:48.120> very<00:00:48.360> bitter<00:00:48.600> they're<00:00:48.870> not<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
these are very bitter they're not the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.010 
these are very bitter they're not the
typical<00:00:50.280> strawberry<00:00:50.820> taste<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.899> know

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
typical strawberry taste so you know

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.689 
typical strawberry taste so you know
what<00:00:52.110> I'm<00:00:52.170> gonna<00:00:52.260> do<00:00:52.440> add<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
what I'm gonna do add it to the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.520 
what I'm gonna do add it to the
strawberry<00:00:54.090> pile<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.870> ones<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.230> do<00:00:55.320> come

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
strawberry pile the ones that do come

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.689 
strawberry pile the ones that do come
out<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> regular<00:00:56.309> strawberry

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
out and the regular strawberry

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.420 
out and the regular strawberry
configuration<00:00:57.480> are<00:00:57.660> fairly<00:00:57.989> small<00:00:58.370> this<00:00:59.370> is

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
configuration are fairly small this is

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.180 
configuration are fairly small this is
about<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.300> size<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.899> nickel<00:01:01.379> Canadian

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190

a play-by-play on the taste as I go but
for<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.689> most<00:01:09.840> part<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.290> deformed<00:01:10.710> ones

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
for the most part it's the deformed ones

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.080 
for the most part it's the deformed ones
that<00:01:11.010> are<00:01:11.100> coming<00:01:11.340> out<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.549> here<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:11.700> I'm<00:01:11.909> not

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
that are coming out of here so I'm not

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.249

strawberry

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
strawberry

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:28.249 
strawberry
flavor<00:01:22.670> but<00:01:25.939> not<00:01:26.960> quite<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.079> traditional

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
flavor but not quite the traditional

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.810 
flavor but not quite the traditional
strawberry<00:01:28.920> flavor<00:01:29.189> maybe<00:01:29.399> a<00:01:29.520> little<00:01:29.700> more

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
strawberry flavor maybe a little more

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.990 
strawberry flavor maybe a little more
sugary<00:01:30.890> so<00:01:31.890> we're<00:01:31.979> gonna<00:01:32.070> jump<00:01:32.369> over<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
sugary so we're gonna jump over to the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.270 
sugary so we're gonna jump over to the
seascape<00:01:33.329> ones<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:34.049> wasn't<00:01:34.829> supposed<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.130> let

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
seascape ones I wasn't supposed to let

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.669 
seascape ones I wasn't supposed to let
go<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.549> fruit<00:01:35.789> this<00:01:36.000> year<00:01:36.270> but<00:01:36.869> through<00:01:37.530> my

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
go to fruit this year but through my

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:39.560 
go to fruit this year but through my
lack<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:38.009> attention<00:01:38.280> sometimes<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.330> all<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
lack of attention sometimes and all the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.480 
lack of attention sometimes and all the
rain<00:01:39.780> we've<00:01:40.020> been<00:01:40.229> getting<00:01:40.560> some<00:01:41.159> fruit<00:01:41.369> of

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
rain we've been getting some fruit of

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.950 
rain we've been getting some fruit of
produced<00:01:41.820> anyway<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.179> we<00:01:42.420> might<00:01:42.450> as<00:01:42.630> well<00:01:42.750> do<00:01:42.929> a

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
produced anyway so we might as well do a

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.240 
produced anyway so we might as well do a
taste<00:01:43.229> test<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.649> year<00:01:45.470> this<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.530> my<00:01:46.679> seascape

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
taste test this year this is my seascape

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.719 
taste test this year this is my seascape
strawberry<00:01:48.710> bed<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:50.429> just<00:01:50.610> been

strawberry bed and it's just been

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.120 
strawberry bed and it's just been
propagating<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:51.450> wild<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.950> know<00:01:53.039> what

little<00:02:16.410> bit<00:02:16.620> more<00:02:16.769> firm<00:02:18.110> which<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.260> very<00:02:19.470> find

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
little bit more firm which is very find

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.220 
little bit more firm which is very find
that<00:02:20.430> very<00:02:20.640> appealing<00:02:20.940> these<00:02:21.690> plants<00:02:22.140> are

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
that very appealing these plants are

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.789 
that very appealing these plants are
propagating<00:02:22.709> widely<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:24.350> are<00:02:25.350> doing<00:02:25.620> quite

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
propagating widely and are doing quite

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.340 
propagating widely and are doing quite
well<00:02:25.859> we<00:02:26.250> had<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.400> lot<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.720> lot<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:27.750> them<00:02:27.900> die<00:02:28.079> off

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
well we had a lot of lot of them die off

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.250 
well we had a lot of lot of them die off
but<00:02:28.620> now<00:02:29.160> they're<00:02:29.370> just<00:02:29.780> mmm<00:02:30.780> they're<00:02:31.079> doing

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
but now they're just mmm they're doing

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.509 
but now they're just mmm they're doing
quite<00:02:31.350> well<00:02:31.440> I'm<00:02:31.680> very<00:02:31.920> impressed<00:02:32.160> with<00:02:32.370> this

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
quite well I'm very impressed with this

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.150 
quite well I'm very impressed with this
variety<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:33.150> strawberry<00:02:33.769> so<00:02:34.769> this<00:02:34.890> is<00:02:35.040> the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
variety of strawberry so this is the

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.240 
variety of strawberry so this is the
Alpine<00:02:35.310> bed<00:02:35.810> it's<00:02:36.810> been<00:02:37.019> moved<00:02:37.230> you've<00:02:37.920> had<00:02:38.130> to

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
Alpine bed it's been moved you've had to

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.420 
Alpine bed it's been moved you've had to
go<00:02:38.340> into<00:02:38.549> quarantine<00:02:39.109> I<00:02:40.130> believe<00:02:41.130> it<00:02:41.280> was<00:02:41.370> a

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
go into quarantine I believe it was a

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.240 
go into quarantine I believe it was a
slug<00:02:41.760> attack<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.900> has<00:02:43.620> eaten<00:02:43.799> some<00:02:44.100> of<00:02:44.190> the

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
slug attack that has eaten some of the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.610 
slug attack that has eaten some of the
foliage<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.790> some<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.209> fruit<00:02:45.450> but<00:02:45.750> you're

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
foliage and some of the fruit but you're

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.990 
foliage and some of the fruit but you're
still<00:02:46.829> is<00:02:47.040> still<00:02:47.220> producing<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:48.630> this<00:02:48.810> is

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
still is still producing so this is

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.300 
still is still producing so this is
quite<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.030> bit<00:02:51.209> smaller<00:02:51.540> of<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.780> fruit<00:02:52.100> this<00:02:53.100> is<00:02:53.160> a

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
quite a bit smaller of a fruit this is a

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.120 
quite a bit smaller of a fruit this is a
wild<00:02:53.639> variety<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:54.500> you'd<00:02:55.500> expect<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:55.950> would<00:02:56.010> be

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
wild variety so you'd expect it would be

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.800 
wild variety so you'd expect it would be
a<00:02:56.160> smaller<00:02:56.489> fruit<00:02:56.760> because<00:02:57.000> typically

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
a smaller fruit because typically

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.020 
a smaller fruit because typically
through<00:02:58.079> selection<00:02:58.410> are<00:02:58.709> our<00:02:59.340> more<00:02:59.609> domestic

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
through selection are our more domestic

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.030 
through selection are our more domestic
varieties<00:03:00.450> are<00:03:00.660> larger<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.530> little<00:03:01.769> bit<00:03:01.889> less

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
varieties are larger a little bit less

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.860 
varieties are larger a little bit less
flavorful<00:03:02.459> sometimes<00:03:03.150> but<00:03:03.480> we're<00:03:03.630> gonna<00:03:03.720> go

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
flavorful sometimes but we're gonna go

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.650 
flavorful sometimes but we're gonna go
ahead<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.139> test<00:03:04.350> this

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.750 

so

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
so

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.600 
so
it's<00:03:11.300> a<00:03:11.390> little<00:03:12.010> less<00:03:13.010> firm<00:03:13.310> than<00:03:13.519> the

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
it's a little less firm than the

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.780 
it's a little less firm than the
seascape<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.780> trier<00:03:15.019> star<00:03:15.640> it's<00:03:16.640> God

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
seascape and the trier star it's God

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.830 
seascape and the trier star it's God
that's<00:03:17.209> a<00:03:17.360> medium<00:03:17.629> flavor<00:03:21.099> lots<00:03:22.099> of<00:03:22.220> seeds

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
that's a medium flavor lots of seeds

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.140 
that's a medium flavor lots of seeds
good<00:03:23.840> good<00:03:24.170> good<00:03:24.230> flavor<00:03:24.830> not<00:03:25.220> quite<00:03:25.430> as<00:03:25.549> sweet

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
good good good flavor not quite as sweet

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.059 
good good good flavor not quite as sweet
so<00:03:26.299> I'm<00:03:26.390> not<00:03:26.480> sure<00:03:26.540> that<00:03:26.720> it's<00:03:27.049> a<00:03:27.170> it's<00:03:27.799> a<00:03:27.860> great

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
so I'm not sure that it's a it's a great

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.770 
so I'm not sure that it's a it's a great
wine<00:03:28.280> variety<00:03:28.870> maybe<00:03:29.870> in<00:03:30.049> in<00:03:31.480> in<00:03:32.480> small

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
wine variety maybe in in in small

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.039 
wine variety maybe in in in small
quantities<00:03:33.319> just<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:34.239> maybe<00:03:35.239> round<00:03:35.599> off<00:03:35.840> the

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
quantities just to maybe round off the

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.600 
quantities just to maybe round off the
flavor<00:03:36.260> so<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.530> don't<00:03:36.709> end<00:03:36.829> up<00:03:36.980> with<00:03:37.160> uh<00:03:37.190> a

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
flavor so you don't end up with uh a

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.940 
flavor so you don't end up with uh a
really<00:03:37.970> strong<00:03:38.269> sweet<00:03:39.200> flavor<00:03:39.530> a<00:03:39.650> really

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
really strong sweet flavor a really

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.430 
really strong sweet flavor a really
strong<00:03:40.340> you<00:03:41.150> know<00:03:41.239> zesty<00:03:41.780> flavor<00:03:42.049> or<00:03:42.260> anything

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
strong you know zesty flavor or anything

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.089 
strong you know zesty flavor or anything
like<00:03:42.709> that

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
like that

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.460 
like that
so<00:03:43.970> maybe<00:03:44.150> this<00:03:44.329> might<00:03:44.540> be<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:45.049> number<00:03:45.319> to

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
so maybe this might be the number to

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.240 
so maybe this might be the number to
just<00:03:45.680> add<00:03:45.829> a<00:03:45.860> little<00:03:46.040> bit<00:03:46.310> in<00:03:47.379> to<00:03:48.379> the<00:03:48.560> little

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
just add a little bit in to the little

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.759 
just add a little bit in to the little
bit<00:03:49.370> of<00:03:49.400> balancing<00:03:49.940> into<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.269> wine<00:03:50.420> but<00:03:50.769> we'll

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
bit of balancing into the wine but we'll

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.849 
bit of balancing into the wine but we'll
see<00:03:51.920> what<00:03:52.069> the<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.390> raspberries<00:03:53.650> taste<00:03:54.650> like

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
see what the the raspberries taste like

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.770 
see what the the raspberries taste like
him<00:03:55.040> see<00:03:56.000> if<00:03:56.090> they<00:03:56.180> can<00:03:56.329> provide<00:03:56.569> that

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
him see if they can provide that

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.150 
him see if they can provide that
balancing<00:03:57.319> because<00:03:57.680> we're<00:03:57.829> gonna<00:03:57.920> do

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
balancing because we're gonna do

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.240 
balancing because we're gonna do
raspberry<00:03:58.640> strap<00:03:59.530> we're<00:04:00.530> gonna<00:04:00.620> likely<00:04:01.099> do<00:04:01.220> a

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
raspberry strap we're gonna likely do a

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.240 
raspberry strap we're gonna likely do a
raspberry<00:04:01.730> strawberry<00:04:01.910> one<00:04:02.329> when<00:04:02.510> we're<00:04:02.690> into

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
raspberry strawberry one when we're into

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.430 
raspberry strawberry one when we're into

really<00:04:36.260> nice<00:04:36.440> method<00:04:37.130> of<00:04:37.220> production<00:04:37.610> could

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
really nice method of production could

I'm<00:04:43.430> not<00:04:43.580> sure<00:04:43.729> this<00:04:43.849> is<00:04:44.060> probably<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:45.050> most

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
I'm not sure this is probably the most

appropriate<00:04:45.560> place<00:04:45.950> to<00:04:45.979> put<00:04:46.870> strawberries

appropriate place to put strawberries

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.300 
appropriate place to put strawberries
but<00:04:47.960> I<00:04:48.020> figured<00:04:48.349> I'd<00:04:48.470> give<00:04:48.620> it<00:04:48.650> a<00:04:48.770> shot<00:04:49.010> so

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
but I figured I'd give it a shot so

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.190 
but I figured I'd give it a shot so
unfortunately<00:04:50.060> no<00:04:50.300> taste<00:04:50.539> test<00:04:50.840> with<00:04:51.020> these

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
unfortunately no taste test with these
