 with our author weighs 10.3 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.790
 I remove bytes 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.980
 Once you have had the downloaded 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.960
 this folder will appear 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.960
 and disappear all these files 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.100
 possible are going to right click the 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.650
 first and extra here from this folder 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.370
 are you going to look like this from mexis what 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.250
 It matters is this 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.500
 that is, what matters 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.659
 and well what we are going to do now 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.570
 is 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.210

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.900
 browser 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.490
 and they're going to go to this page that's the same 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.930
 I'll leave them in the description of 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.380
 video which is this the page in the 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.300
 they were putting the servers is 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:05.060
 similar to delta one 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.490

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.060
 extra 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.490
 but before that they are going to have to 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.840

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.840

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.510
 translate very well 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:43.189
 but well, you understand a little bit 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.189
 here you can be explaining 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.500

 your password here they put Persian or 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.240
 British English the truth is that no 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.240
 matter that I put 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.660
 but with which it owns 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.750
 downtown time I think I put time 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:18.280
 from the center and here it says how many fingers 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:22.410
 has a hand and well here they put 5 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.690
 will give you a position once you are 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.770
 and register them and they all give you this click 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.640
 right to this extract here 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.900
 is going to extract these two files 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.750
 those two files 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.590
 they are going to hit us here 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.879
 here 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.390
 that I already have it here would be this give you 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.390
 Double click 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.710
 and in this case what is going to do this is 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.400
 download the files 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.299
 necessary for 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.299
 to play 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:07.440
 and then good once when 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.440
 when they are downloaded they will ask for this 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.459
 A) Yes 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.730
 and that we are recording with qantas already 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.400
 I think it does not look like that 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:24.080
 let's move on 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:26.300
 fraps to teach them that if it serves then 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.120
 good friends here we are already in the game 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.080
 let's see the vice has opened well 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.590
 player 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:37.500
 play brain and as we see there is only 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.150
 one and there is nothing of players fails 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.969
 because there is nothing of players because 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.889
 this 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:44.360
 this project is new practically 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.479

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.360
 but even in the course of this 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.889
 week and the other week maybe it's already going to 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.240

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.939

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.480
 it could not be done 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.630
