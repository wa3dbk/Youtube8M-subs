00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 all the parish priests of the town of 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.560
 fourth along with the association 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.420
 antiracket fourth closing have 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.840
 organized for a big Friday 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.480
 torchlight procession to take back the city 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.220
 yes of course the title says says it all 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.170
 what we want to say with this 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.020
 manifestation down the quarter hands 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.519
 after all that happened in 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.179
 these last days but with the climate of 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:31.800
 distrust of institutions 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.759
 we want to show that the union is the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.800
 power 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.930
 this is a small initiative but wants 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.480
 be just a beginning of a series of 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.540
 activities to redevelop the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.450
 territory to make people understand that there are people 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.350
 good fourth is that it is bothered by 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.230
 to be in the hands of four 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.360
 thugs or people who don't want the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.480
 well certainly it is the fourth future 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.090
 she last Sunday at the end of 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.940
 Holy Mass had a lot of words 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.210
 harsh towards those who heard it 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.040
 protecting well of course I think we 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.140
 priests 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.830
 I think we're fighting for it 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.689
 legality in a very very way 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.250
 strong we are putting in the forefront 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.759
 we are putting our faces like it 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.939
 they say 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.130
 and I think it's the thing is a reality 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.049
 We cannot not evangelical 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.060
 take sides with the poor of 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.600
 those who are in difficulty and today i 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.939
 our poor are those who do not 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.009
 they can start a business they can't 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.060
 start a job because they have to pay 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.100
 the lace 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.439
 we are on the side of the traders who 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.899
 in the morning they wake up to bring the 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.090
 bread at home and then are also visited 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.310
 only for 50 euros but this cannot 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.710
 happen in a civilized city such as 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.810
 we should be the fourth one she has 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.640
 threatened to leave by fourth if 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.799
 there wasn't a massive one 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.750
 presence of his brothers 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.030
 as well as of all citizens of 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.590
 guard arrived this news is you 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.450
 true it is a provocation because I believe that 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.680
 if in the end we do not come not 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.360
 listened to but 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.430
 we are also supported for these 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.980
 initiatives means that it is not there 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.680
 interest in creating a future is one 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.020
 city is one and a community that does not fail 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.300
 believes in their own children and does not believe that 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.950
 there may be a better future and one 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.110
 community that has no hope this is 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.060
 possible that a mother last night me 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.220
 he came to talk he said I am afraid 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.290
 when I take my son to the gym 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.209
 in the pool I'm afraid to get off the 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.940
 car now to go home a little more 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.500
 late but this is life 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.800
 and then we have to beat the 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.630
 return to say that if Friday night does not 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.270
 there is fourth in the middle of the road but we are 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.400
 the usual four characters that yes 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.650
 they beat for these things means that 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.930
 we can not do anything that is finished 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.150
 so I said Saturday morning if 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.830
 there are no people or I give the keys to the 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.020
 bishop i know someone to someone 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.150
 maybe you would like this one 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.370
 what but I think that now beyond the 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.140
 joke we all have to be the 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.350
 bishop the first who gave his 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.459
 his approval will be present will be 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.900
 in the first row 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.850
 we have had a large man prepared 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.860
 banner with the title down the le 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.590
 fourth hands will be carried by children 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.950
 because if today we say hands down from 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.870
 fourth and for the future because it is that 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.940
 which to us the queen's at heart is not 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.890
 care about the future of these children all 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.860
 we must be there starting from 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.850
 traders anticipate the closing of 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.150
 half an hour 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.040
 Friday night to be there at the torchlight procession e 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.890
 to guarantee the opening of your shop 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.350
 forever, therefore, take advantage of dear ones 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.420
 Traders of this initiative is a 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.790
 invitation to all associations to all 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.010
 political movements to all those who 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.290
 these nodes are part of this good part 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:54.810
 fourth not to come up with flags with 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.090
 concessions to be there personally 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.670
 let's put the face individually in 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.640
 this initiative without hiding 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.560
 behind flags or slogans because there is a 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.450
 just slogans hands down from fourth and if 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.720
 we all agree if we all do 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.880
 we beat for this initiative that 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.959
 I repeat it will be the beginning of a big e 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.660
 other initiatives 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.720
 and then we could have won on these 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.140
 four 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.200
 let's say criminal one last thing 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.370
 I also thank those who work 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.350
 inside the hypercoop 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.000
 we also asked them for the center 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.270
 commercial we have that tired to them 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 a hand of solidarity was just right 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.920
 this morning they are meeting yes for 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.090
 evaluate how to support this 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.090
 torchlight procession initiative
