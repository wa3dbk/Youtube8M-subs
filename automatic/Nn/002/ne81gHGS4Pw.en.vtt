00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.840
 me 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.340
 ben 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:31.490
 Though it is school communication technology that is about this bike ex trigger 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:35.690
 This bike's concept is that bye 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.970
 I made it to be a bike that would give me an interest in going 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:43.260
 Thank you 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:48.570
 You can use visible light communication technology to transmit that information. 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:51.690
 Have young people interested in bikes in a form that suggests new ways of enjoyment 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:57.510
 We are thinking and introducing if it becomes an opportunity 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:02.010
 It will be understood when you get that look . The round part of the part on the head lamp is 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:07.070
 It has become a light of LED and there are a lot of three colors here 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:15.240
 It is a mechanism to send out information by blinking 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:18.270
 The light source of the visible light communication is attached to two places on the head lamp and the light. 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.229
 About a year and a half ago 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:26.850
 And we are allowed to proceed to develop it is in conjunction with the development of point-like 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:32.570
 Mr. Kazuhiro has been researching the technology of visible light communication for over 10 years. 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:35.230
 I had that technology , so let me consult, this time with this show model 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.830
 In the form of say to apricot kernel together 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:43.240
 I will consider 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:46.280
 Casio communicates using a smartphone camera 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.240
 We have developed a path port communication technology 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:53.530
 You can use it just by installing the app called Camera 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:59.170
 It is also adopted as an extrigger 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:02.400
 It flashes or tries to receive the signal by pointing the smartphone's camera to the car 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.400
 It is something to do 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:10.270
 This visible light communication technology is to compensate the performance of the camera of the smartphone 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.320
 In addition to the flashing of the plateau, Akahi method 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:19.260
 Hilo modulation method using three colors of blue is adopted 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:25.269
 But the communication speed is about 6 bit per second 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:31.780
 In addition, it is possible to transmit from station equipment play as well as led 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:33.390
 Also it features can deliver the information from digital signage and smartphones screen of 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.900
 Masu know Tei 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:40.689
 Hmm 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:44.709
 It is the application of planning camera It is the front plateau of that now 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:49.810
 We are now aware that we have found the Planning Division 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:53.490
 a Recognize the antigen, and in the image that the bike is talking accordingly 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.660
 Content is displayed by spouting 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.660
 It is ten o'clock 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:06.390
 That slow at the moment 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.080
 And the key of information rather than Do not communication data exchange and is is assumed that it the information itself 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.900
 Become 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.500
 I 'm exchanging only that id code and using it as a key data from the server 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.570
 The 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.340
 I'm taking the form of a download that over 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:26.670
 djs 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:29.220
 Well it seems to be linked to the smartphone or after that the communication function is on the meter in the vehicle 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.530
 That it is with proofï½°ï½°ï½°ï½° 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.530
 Are thinking of how to use say say to communicate 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:41.340
 Lips trigger not only sends out information but also sends out information from outside with camera 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.680
 Can also 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.680
 It has an interactive communication function 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:55.260
 For example , users are users among bikers 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:59.550
 It is like exchanging messages by exchanging that information . 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:05.460
 The rest is bike and store pitch convenience store 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:11.220
 In the usage that pasolin stand or the information bike itself from the store receives 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:13.510
 Assuming a say and how to use, such as collect the ne Alta information is by bike run 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:21.850
 I am 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:26.360
 Perform the Tteyuu It is now ho ride that red of a fall in that lamp Colors It is 8 likely to be 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:34.219
 Oh, I can't put the lamp in front of you 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:34.969
 Why does not the light turn on while traveling with the children this time, when you stop the parking lot or not at all communication 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:39.500
 Do 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:45.490
 Then you can receive information from the store as it can be done without problems with reception 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:51.200
 The part is equipped with a camera, and it is possible at present to have a medical examination there 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:53.639
 It will be talked about in the future, but the performance of recognition on the camera side will be improved 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.759
 Fast in 3 colors 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:05:01.620
 You can exchange information by flashing in the fall season 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:04.770
 If you can do it, for example, blink the head lamp of the head lamp LED 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:10.669
 If you can use it to send information 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.669
 I think that a good ride would also enable that correspondence. 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.610
 Taking advantage of the feature that that bike sends information 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:22.610
 a 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:28.189
 For example, by capturing information on the bike into the user 's smartphone 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:28.969
 Let me introduce you from the practical usage such as maintenance management 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:34.400
 got 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:36.600
 Share information by communication between bikes or connect with an internet server 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:43.070
 Well, comprehensive information 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:43.070
 We assume that it becomes the making of opportunity to do sharing 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.380
 ana
