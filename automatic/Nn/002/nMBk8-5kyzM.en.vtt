00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
before your splits into two oh and

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.279 
before your splits into two oh and
another<00:00:47.670> thing<00:00:47.940> if<00:00:48.270> your<00:00:48.450> HP<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.870> odd<00:00:49.050> by

another thing if your HP is odd by
chance<00:00:49.590> yeah<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.250> abusive<00:00:50.850> I've<00:00:51.030> read<00:00:51.239> peers

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
chance yeah you abusive I've read peers

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.200 
chance yeah you abusive I've read peers
triple<00:00:51.899> smack<00:00:52.170> attack<00:00:52.500> with<00:00:52.680> one<00:00:52.829> HP<00:00:53.039> left<00:00:53.399> so

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
triple smack attack with one HP left so

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.470 
triple smack attack with one HP left so
I<00:00:54.510> guess<00:00:54.719> that's<00:00:54.870> something<00:00:55.110> nice<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.500> have

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
I guess that's something nice to have

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.580 
I guess that's something nice to have
during<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.719> phase<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:57.989> should<00:00:58.170> also<00:00:58.469> use

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
during this phase you should also use

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.979 
during this phase you should also use
time<00:00:59.160> distortion<00:00:59.699> as<00:00:59.789> much<00:01:00.000> as<00:01:00.149> possible<00:01:00.359> so

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
time distortion as much as possible so

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.920 
time distortion as much as possible so
you<00:01:01.079> can<00:01:01.260> reset<00:01:01.829> any<00:01:02.010> or<00:01:02.190> debuff<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.930> you're

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
you can reset any or debuff that you're

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.460 
you can reset any or debuff that you're

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
colors so yeah one method is just to

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.750 
colors so yeah one method is just to
rinse<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:24.620> repeat<00:02:24.980> whatever<00:02:25.310> I<00:02:25.400> just<00:02:25.459> said

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
rinse and repeat whatever I just said

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.440 
rinse and repeat whatever I just said
and<00:02:26.269> eventually<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.350> better<00:02:27.560> take<00:02:27.859> down<00:02:28.040> fear

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
and eventually you better take down fear

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.550 
and eventually you better take down fear
but<00:02:29.450> if<00:02:29.570> you<00:02:29.660> ever<00:02:29.750> hit<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.049> wrong<00:02:30.200> colored

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
but if you ever hit the wrong colored

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.870 
but if you ever hit the wrong colored
fear<00:02:30.769> you're<00:02:30.920> pretty<00:02:31.160> much<00:02:31.250> just<00:02:31.370> gonna<00:02:31.549> screw

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
fear you're pretty much just gonna screw

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.229 
fear you're pretty much just gonna screw
over<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.120> run<00:02:32.359> entirely<00:02:33.670> so<00:02:34.670> yeah<00:02:34.880> good<00:02:35.120> luck

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
over the run entirely so yeah good luck

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:42.970 
over the run entirely so yeah good luck
with<00:02:35.299> that<00:02:40.930> another<00:02:41.930> way<00:02:42.109> to<00:02:42.170> do<00:02:42.380> is<00:02:42.560> just<00:02:42.680> to

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
with that another way to do is just to

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.360 
with that another way to do is just to
die<00:02:43.579> and<00:02:43.910> then<00:02:44.030> wait<00:02:44.329> until<00:02:44.420> they<00:02:44.750> change<00:02:45.370> but

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
die and then wait until they change but

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.860 
die and then wait until they change but
make<00:02:46.549> sure<00:02:46.579> they<00:02:46.790> finished<00:02:47.150> changing<00:02:47.329> before

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
make sure they finished changing before

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.500 
make sure they finished changing before
you<00:02:47.989> revive<00:02:48.410> or<00:02:48.620> us<00:02:48.709> you'll<00:02:49.130> get<00:02:49.459> a<00:02:49.489> hat<00:02:49.760> the

you revive or us you'll get a hat the
whole<00:02:50.660> purpose<00:02:50.989> of<00:02:51.230> dying<00:02:51.470> just<00:02:51.739> to<00:02:51.859> remove

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
whole purpose of dying just to remove

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.890

your hats or your beard or DPS both of
them<00:02:54.019> at<00:02:54.170> once

them at once

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.699 
them at once
but<00:02:55.850> first<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:56.359> want<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.570> DPS<00:02:57.049> as<00:02:57.260> much<00:02:57.500> as

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
but first you want to DPS as much as

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.530 
but first you want to DPS as much as
possible<00:02:58.010> before<00:02:58.430> you<00:02:58.670> decide<00:02:59.060> that<00:02:59.090> it's

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
possible before you decide that it's

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.309 
possible before you decide that it's
time<00:02:59.600> to<00:02:59.750> die

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
time to die

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.140 
time to die
I<00:03:01.349> guess<00:03:02.010> it's<00:03:02.189> up<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.459> you<00:03:02.549> to<00:03:02.640> decide<00:03:02.879> what

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390
