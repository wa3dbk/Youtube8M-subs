00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.629
 Greetings to all HDblog readers 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.849
 still 2013 still sony with a 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.450
 so not advanced media player 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.240
 a smartphone is called walkman f800 80 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.869
 and it is a series of devices that 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.539
 offer multimedia performance e 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.820
 mp3 player we say advanced now no 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.039
 electrical classics no longer exist 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.490
 we talk about media players yes 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.890
 Android is the Android system 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.450
 obviously personalized by sony but with 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.270
 some differences from the range 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.829
 xperia in fact the applications menu 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.719
 it has no customization 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.750
 but it is the same as android then 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.480
 we have widgets and we have applications 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.379
 within the classic screen of 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.570
 android devices 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.070
 rates are how it comes to screen for 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.390
 regarding the use 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.640
 of the user interface 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.670
 the user interface that moves 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.260
 through the swipe of the home with 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.210
 widgets and applications 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.750
 we also have a series of physical keys 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.640
 in the side part and therefore we have 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.799
 a chance to move forward e 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.250
 back stopping the songs put in 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:17.110
 pause and manage the volume these rates 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.670
 they are very comfortable because also from 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.509
 screen off so when we have it 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.180
 maybe off we can press play 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.950
 back and forth to move for 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.810
 run away from a song or go back to 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.899
 previous song up here indeed 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.300
 you saw how the song changed 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.630
 and if compared to the previous one 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.100
 we had 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.180
 within the notifications network 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.560
 we find both the part dedicated to 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.659
 notifications is that of the settings 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.729
 settings for are the classic of 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.640
 android the operating system is the 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.110
 version 4.1.1 that will probably be able to 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.850
 be updated in the future but it is 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.789
 important to note that in the community 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.780
 in addition to the bluetooth wifi we also find 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:02.869
 the nfc sony with fc has now created a 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.990
 real control system between 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.250
 the various sony devices that are foxes 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.830
 tablet or smartphone 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.830
 here we have the nfc logo the dimensions 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.540
 they are rather contained for example now 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.180
 we can put it next to one 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.910
 smartphone of the competition but right 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.760
 to understand the size and weight is 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.900
 obviously very very light not 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.849
 having a particularly hardware 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.980
 powerful despite the le 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:32.660
 hardware performance is not 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.019
 as exciting as those of a top range 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.970
 smart phone z1 the quality of 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.959
 internet usage usage for 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.540
 example of all functions 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.829
 seems rather multimedia 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.870
 satisfactory internet you can 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:47.660
 display without any particular problems 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.250
 we can obviously steal it was screen shots 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.890
 go and view ours 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.140
 information 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.030
 magnifying Olympic read the screen 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.030
 without particular problems even with a 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.190
 double tap you can also see the 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.440
 overturning 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.190
 so here on the screen 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.690
 performance all in all not bad with 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.610
 the possibility of entering the 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.960
 multitasking like we did here for 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.030
 see all the apps we have 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.030
 open 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.250
 also present the fm radio which 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.190
 surely it will be useful for those 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.670
 he loves listening to the radio of course now 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.290
 mp3s and web radio are those that 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.330
 they are the most popular and thanks to 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.400
 android you can download any 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.870
 type of application directly from the 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.440
 play stop play store that is present 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.239
 riserva plays games is a swim device 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.680
 multimedia, therefore also games 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.100
 can be done without any 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.380
 problem 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.530
 no missing maps a reader is not missing 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.410
 video is wanted as well as not missing 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.300
 dlna that will allow us here it is of 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.540
 connect the device with others 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.360
 devices such as televisions or sources 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.100
 external for example see photo or 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.900
 other than we have the interface 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.880
 more photos than should be the 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.530
 dedicated interface software 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.720
 therefore, with devices from one device 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.989
 Interesting 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.940
 the question is does a reader make sense today 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.220
 multimedia of this type with android 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.250
 but since it works very nice 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.870
 etc. but that is very similar 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.570
 to what a smartphone can offer 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.810
 and it costs you not so far from 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.220
 a mid-range or mid-range sony 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.930
 low 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.490
 the question we turn to you do it 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.310
 to know maybe in the comments 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.620
 probably if you find an offer 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.870
 interesting on smartphone platform 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.860
 the things you can do are exactly 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.180
 the same as sony and 880 the only one 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.949
 difference 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.530
 this walkman allows you to be 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.910
 compatible with the standard 100 92 kg 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.800
 enzo 24 bit 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.720
 so far as sound is concerned 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.310
 clearly better than a 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.009
 thanks smartphone not only of the
