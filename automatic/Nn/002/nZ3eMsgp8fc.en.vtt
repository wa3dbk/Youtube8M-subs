 hello how about good people in this video 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.010
 I will teach you how to use the 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.300
 this ervin educator who serves 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.200
 to change weapons and do it 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.960
 the biggest case this 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.580
 with that they have to open their 2004 review 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.550
 and open that the toilet 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.850
 we give in ok we wait for him to load the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.850
 bar 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.930
 and then here we give in the first 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.760
 option that is here they say where 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.340
 many have problems that do not come out 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.430
 to do what is wrong bigger team 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.500
 it's the first trick I did in my 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.970
 previous video of how to put tricks to 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.290

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:06.440
 well here we click and choose the 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.440
 127 then let's just boil 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.440
 the cabin for that we have to pass 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.690
 obstacles 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.780
 I'm going to pause the video and now 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.479
 when I 'm in the cabin 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.390
 well once we have arrived more 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:37.229
 to the cabin 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.229
 to her 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.430
 and we go to where the machine is 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:49.110
 to write 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:49.110
 and we give in keeping save the game 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.229
 after 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:10.899
 a game to load charge game 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.620
 and we choose the one that we keep that is this 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.620
 come on, yes 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.380
 and we wait for him to load the game that 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.380
 we have saved 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:31.290
 then we're going to 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:33.750
 If it did not become big, I'm going to 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.160
 explain again so that they understand 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.440
 best 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:42.410
 we passed the first obstacle that is 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.480
 annihilate the zombies that will appear 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.340
 when we enter the house that is the 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.800
 first after we jump for the 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.460
 windows and we eliminate those that come out 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.090
 there are three or two 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.450
 I am playing in professional mode 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.500
 4 came out but it's normal how easy 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.510
 it's 1 2 or 3 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.510
 well then we save the game 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.879
 let's say yes 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.680
 after 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.349
 let's continue without collecting or charging 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.349
 load match 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.269
 and we choose the one we keep 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.330
 then we're going to 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.770
 what is 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:39.819
 the state in us simple will be what 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:43.180
 what is the big briefcase 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.900
 good but first they must choose what 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.810
 I say here 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:52.459
 load everything that is the game before 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:57.790
 when they start it before coming to the 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.790
 cottage do this give here 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.560

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.560
 to get out 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.669
 I'll do it again do it again 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.440
 As you see here, it has already returned to what it is 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:24.070
 the normal state I have nothing I'm going to 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.070
 make another game 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.120
 x 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:32.480
 we hope to take out the game all with a 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.480
 suit 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.729
 is loading 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.729
 we passed the first obstacles 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:30.080
 Clear 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.170

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:48.780
 once we have killed ourselves 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:52.160
 we choose this 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.160
 then we go to the cabin 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.490
 we keep the game 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.380
 we left the game 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.660

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:38.539
 state 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:40.990
