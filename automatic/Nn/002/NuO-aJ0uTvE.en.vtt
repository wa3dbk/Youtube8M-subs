00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
the five beeps that means the cycle is

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.940 
the five beeps that means the cycle is
done<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.930> end<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.320> unit<00:02:08.590> shuts<00:02:08.740> off

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
done the end the unit shuts off

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.270 
done the end the unit shuts off
automatically<00:02:09.640> so<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:11.530> took<00:02:11.710> about<00:02:11.830> four

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
automatically so that took about four

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:21.060 
automatically so that took about four
minutes<00:02:15.690> as<00:02:16.690> you<00:02:16.870> can<00:02:17.050> see<00:02:19.470> these<00:02:20.470> are<00:02:20.710> the<00:02:20.860> two
