00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.430 
like today we'll have guys that will do
flexibility<00:03:30.060> training<00:03:30.540> probably<00:03:31.049> at<00:03:31.260> least

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
flexibility training probably at least

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.259 
flexibility training probably at least
twice<00:03:31.650> today<00:03:31.980> they'll<00:03:32.640> do<00:03:32.819> it<00:03:32.940> at<00:03:33.060> shoot

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
after the game and do some flexibility

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.070 
after the game and do some flexibility

daily routine to do some type of
flexibility<00:03:42.900> work<00:03:43.140> for<00:03:44.040> us<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.879> more

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
flexibility work for us the more

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.699 
flexibility work for us the more
flexible<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:45.629> are<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.079> less<00:03:46.290> chance<00:03:46.560> you

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
flexible you are the less chance you

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.860 
flexible you are the less chance you
have<00:03:46.890> of<00:03:46.920> being<00:03:47.250> injured<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.780> you<00:03:48.780> know

have of being injured and you know
normally<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:50.099> more<00:03:50.250> flexible<00:03:50.459> guys<00:03:50.940> are

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
normally the more flexible guys are

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.809 
normally the more flexible guys are
you're<00:03:51.480> better<00:03:51.690> athletes<00:03:52.200> so<00:03:52.860> you<00:03:53.579> know<00:03:53.640> we're

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
you're better athletes so you know we're

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.039 
you're better athletes so you know we're
gonna<00:03:53.910> make<00:03:54.000> sure<00:03:54.390> that<00:03:54.540> our<00:03:54.599> guys<00:03:54.840> stay

accountable in the flexibility

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.589 
accountable in the flexibility
department<00:03:56.790> they're<00:03:56.910> gonna<00:03:57.000> do<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:57.359> at<00:03:57.480> least

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.380 
and our strength training with our guys
we<00:04:07.380> try<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:07.620> get<00:04:07.800> them<00:04:07.890> handling<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.550> medicine

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
we try to get them handling a medicine

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.960 
we try to get them handling a medicine
ball<00:04:09.540> just<00:04:09.780> like<00:04:09.960> a<00:04:09.990> basketball<00:04:10.260> so<00:04:11.220> if<00:04:11.790> we're

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
ball just like a basketball so if we're

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.580 
ball just like a basketball so if we're
going<00:04:12.240> through<00:04:12.420> a<00:04:12.510> movement<00:04:12.870> of<00:04:13.110> pattern<00:04:13.470> or

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
going through a movement of pattern or

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.380 
going through a movement of pattern or
whatever<00:04:13.860> we're<00:04:14.610> gonna<00:04:14.700> have<00:04:14.910> them<00:04:14.970> step<00:04:15.210> in

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
whatever we're gonna have them step in

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.090 
whatever we're gonna have them step in
jab<00:04:15.600> and<00:04:15.810> hold<00:04:15.960> that<00:04:16.079> medicine<00:04:16.560> ball<00:04:16.739> just

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
jab and hold that medicine ball just

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.009 
jab and hold that medicine ball just
like<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.310> basketball<00:04:17.910> so<00:04:18.420> if<00:04:18.510> they're<00:04:18.690> doing<00:04:18.720> a

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
like a basketball so if they're doing a

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.990 
like a basketball so if they're doing a
lunge<00:04:19.290> for<00:04:19.620> example<00:04:20.040> we're<00:04:20.400> gonna<00:04:20.489> step<00:04:20.850> out

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
lunge for example we're gonna step out

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.060 
lunge for example we're gonna step out
in<00:04:21.150> jab<00:04:21.480> with<00:04:21.660> the<00:04:21.690> lunge<00:04:21.989> and<00:04:22.230> back<00:04:22.290> up<00:04:22.860> to<00:04:22.890> a

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
in jab with the lunge and back up to a

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.460 
in jab with the lunge and back up to a
basketball<00:04:23.610> position<00:04:24.270> so<00:04:24.750> every<00:04:24.960> functional

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
basketball position so every functional

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.320 
basketball position so every functional
movement<00:04:25.830> that<00:04:25.920> we<00:04:26.070> do<00:04:26.280> in<00:04:26.490> there<00:04:26.670> we<00:04:27.090> wanted

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
movement that we do in there we wanted

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.760 
movement that we do in there we wanted
to<00:04:27.420> think<00:04:27.660> about<00:04:27.930> how<00:04:28.590> it<00:04:28.710> relates<00:04:28.980> to<00:04:30.710> how<00:04:31.710> it

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
to think about how it relates to how it

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.320 
to think about how it relates to how it
relates<00:04:32.070> on<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.280> basketball<00:04:32.760> court<00:04:32.790> whether

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
relates on the basketball court whether

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.520 
relates on the basketball court whether
they're<00:04:33.510> doing<00:04:33.600> a<00:04:33.780> step<00:04:34.050> up<00:04:34.230> for<00:04:34.410> example

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
they're doing a step up for example

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.680 
they're doing a step up for example
we're<00:04:35.220> gonna<00:04:35.310> have<00:04:35.430> them<00:04:35.550> step<00:04:35.820> and<00:04:36.060> raise<00:04:36.450> the

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
we're gonna have them step and raise the

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.000 
we're gonna have them step and raise the
ball<00:04:36.840> up<00:04:37.050> kind<00:04:37.320> of<00:04:37.350> like<00:04:37.440> they're<00:04:37.650> going<00:04:37.800> in

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
ball up kind of like they're going in

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.680 
ball up kind of like they're going in
for<00:04:38.190> a<00:04:38.250> layup<00:04:38.430> so<00:04:39.000> we're<00:04:39.090> gonna<00:04:39.180> try<00:04:39.390> to<00:04:39.450> teach

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
for a layup so we're gonna try to teach

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.480 
for a layup so we're gonna try to teach
those<00:04:39.930> movements<00:04:40.470> as<00:04:40.590> they<00:04:40.740> go<00:04:40.919> as<00:04:41.070> well

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
those movements as they go as well

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.060 
those movements as they go as well
stepping<00:04:42.090> into<00:04:42.240> a<00:04:42.419> lunge<00:04:42.750> all<00:04:43.320> kinds<00:04:44.010> of

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
stepping into a lunge all kinds of

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.440 
stepping into a lunge all kinds of
different<00:04:44.220> things<00:04:44.370> whatever<00:04:44.850> way<00:04:45.000> we<00:04:45.180> can<00:04:45.210> be

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
different things whatever way we can be

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.050 
different things whatever way we can be
creative<00:04:45.780> with<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.230> ball<00:04:46.470> or<00:04:46.910> movements<00:04:47.910> with

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
creative with the ball or movements with

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.790 
creative with the ball or movements with
guys<00:04:48.240> in<00:04:48.510> the<00:04:48.600> weight<00:04:48.750> room<00:04:48.780> we<00:04:49.110> try<00:04:49.290> to<00:04:49.350> do<00:04:49.560> and

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
guys in the weight room we try to do and

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.940 
guys in the weight room we try to do and
get<00:04:49.890> them<00:04:49.980> thinking<00:04:50.190> about<00:04:50.340> basketball
