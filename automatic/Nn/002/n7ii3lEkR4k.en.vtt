the<00:00:33.239> opacity<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:34.050> lowered<00:00:34.559> which<00:00:34.710> meaning<00:00:34.980> you

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
the opacity is lowered which meaning you

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.250 
the opacity is lowered which meaning you

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
support for editing chroma key but

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.139 
support for editing chroma key but
basically<00:01:42.720> all<00:01:42.990> you're<00:01:43.470> going<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.680> do<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.189> drop

you know lit between the two subjects

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.030 
you know lit between the two subjects
and<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:34.450> that<00:02:34.630> you<00:02:34.690> don't<00:02:34.840> cause<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.410> lot<00:02:35.920> of

shadows shadows really mess up the way

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.930

something<00:03:13.209> you<00:03:13.360> know<00:03:13.540> it's<00:03:13.720> blurry<00:03:14.080> in<00:03:14.380> the

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
something you know it's blurry in the

evenly<00:03:16.750> matched<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:17.380> you<00:03:17.500> know<00:03:17.590> makes<00:03:17.859> a

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
evenly matched and you know makes a

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.729 
evenly matched and you know makes a
video<00:03:18.880> look<00:03:19.030> that<00:03:19.239> much<00:03:19.420> better<00:03:19.660> so<00:03:19.959> I<00:03:20.380> mean

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
video look that much better so I mean

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.289 
video look that much better so I mean
again<00:03:20.980> if<00:03:21.130> you<00:03:21.250> want<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:21.489> invest<00:03:21.880> in<00:03:22.030> some

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
again if you want to invest in some

way<00:03:43.209> I<00:03:43.269> can<00:03:43.389> explain<00:03:43.510> non<00:03:44.380> you<00:03:44.680> know<00:03:44.850> mostly

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
way I can explain non you know mostly

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.270 
way I can explain non you know mostly
simple<00:03:46.269> terms<00:03:46.540> how<00:03:46.840> chroma<00:03:47.500> key<00:03:47.739> is<00:03:47.889> and<00:03:48.160> how

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
simple terms how chroma key is and how

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.930 
simple terms how chroma key is and how
it<00:03:48.459> works

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
it works

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.750 
it works
so<00:03:49.600> I'm<00:03:49.900> driven<00:03:50.739> you<00:03:50.920> just<00:03:51.100> remember<00:03:51.519> chroma

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
so I'm driven you just remember chroma

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.610 
so I'm driven you just remember chroma
key<00:03:51.970> is<00:03:52.030> an<00:03:52.209> overlaying<00:03:52.630> of<00:03:52.870> em<00:03:53.079> you<00:03:53.380> know<00:03:53.470> in

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
key is an overlaying of em you know in

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.979 
key is an overlaying of em you know in
the<00:03:53.680> image<00:03:53.950> or<00:03:54.130> video<00:03:54.220> upon<00:03:54.910> a<00:03:54.940> solid<00:03:55.750> color

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
whether it be green blue you know they

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.819 
whether it be green blue you know they
even<00:03:58.510> have<00:03:58.660> a<00:03:58.720> black<00:03:58.989> and<00:03:59.019> white<00:03:59.319> screen<00:03:59.590> so

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
even have a black and white screen so

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.349 
even have a black and white screen so
there's<00:03:59.980> a<00:04:00.010> lot<00:04:00.160> of<00:04:00.280> different<00:04:00.970> type<00:04:01.090> of<00:04:01.120> a

video equipment out there people use in
chroma<00:04:04.389> keying<00:04:04.630> and<00:04:05.049> you<00:04:05.170> know<00:04:05.380> it<00:04:05.440> comes<00:04:05.620> down

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
chroma keying and you know it comes down

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.190
