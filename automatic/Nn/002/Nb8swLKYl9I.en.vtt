00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
sugar on the first few tries people

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.070 
sugar on the first few tries people
often<00:01:26.280> tell<00:01:26.460> me<00:01:26.490> they<00:01:26.909> don't<00:01:27.360> succeed<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
often tell me they don't succeed the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.960 
often tell me they don't succeed the
first<00:01:28.320> two<00:01:28.500> or<00:01:28.530> three<00:01:28.619> times<00:01:28.920> they<00:01:29.070> try<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.820> be

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
first two or three times they try so be

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.160 
first two or three times they try so be
patient<00:01:30.180> it'll<00:01:30.720> come

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.870 

so<00:01:36.170> we're<00:01:36.680> gonna<00:01:36.800> make<00:01:37.040> sure<00:01:37.070> if<00:01:37.400> the<00:01:37.520> cons<00:01:37.730> are

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
so we're gonna make sure if the cons are

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.390 
so we're gonna make sure if the cons are
well<00:01:38.060> coated<00:01:38.330> with<00:01:38.630> butter<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:39.110> well<00:01:39.890> toasted

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
well coated with butter and well toasted

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.310 
well coated with butter and well toasted
before<00:01:40.730> we<00:01:40.850> add<00:01:41.000> our<00:01:41.030> sugar<00:01:41.480> and<00:01:41.750> I'm<00:01:42.140> going<00:01:42.260> to

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
before we add our sugar and I'm going to

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.740 
before we add our sugar and I'm going to
teach<00:01:42.500> you<00:01:42.680> a<00:01:42.710> technique<00:01:42.920> of<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:43.610> flip<00:01:43.880> so

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
teach you a technique of the flip so

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.500 
teach you a technique of the flip so
this<00:01:45.650> is<00:01:45.890> how<00:01:45.980> we<00:01:46.040> do<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.340> flip<00:01:46.550> pick<00:01:47.210> up<00:01:47.330> our

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
this is how we do the flip pick up our

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.540 
this is how we do the flip pick up our
pan<00:01:47.690> and<00:01:47.720> if<00:01:47.960> your<00:01:48.050> pan<00:01:48.260> is<00:01:48.290> heavy<00:01:48.710> for<00:01:49.010> you<00:01:49.160> you

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
pan and if your pan is heavy for you you

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.420 
pan and if your pan is heavy for you you
can<00:01:49.700> use<00:01:49.850> two<00:01:50.090> hands<00:01:50.770> but<00:01:51.770> we<00:01:51.860> give<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.220> pan<00:01:52.400> a

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
can use two hands but we give the pan a

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.250 
can use two hands but we give the pan a
little<00:01:52.520> shake<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:52.910> we<00:01:53.090> move<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:53.510> pecans<00:01:53.870> back

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
little shake and we move the pecans back

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.960 
little shake and we move the pecans back
and<00:01:54.470> forth<00:01:54.680> from<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:55.040> back<00:01:55.220> to<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.490> front<00:01:55.760> of

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
and forth from the back to the front of

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.970 
and forth from the back to the front of
the<00:01:56.120> pan<00:01:56.330> and<00:01:56.630> as<00:01:57.050> they<00:01:57.290> approached<00:01:57.650> approach

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
the pan and as they approached approach

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.160 
the pan and as they approached approach
this<00:01:58.160> front<00:01:58.460> lip<00:01:58.670> you<00:01:58.910> see<00:01:59.180> they<00:01:59.390> just<00:01:59.420> want<00:01:59.900> to

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
this front lip you see they just want to

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.200 
this front lip you see they just want to
flip<00:02:00.410> so<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:01.010> just<00:02:01.220> give<00:02:01.460> your<00:02:01.670> pan<00:02:01.880> a<00:02:01.910> little

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
flip so you just give your pan a little

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.750 
flip so you just give your pan a little
more<00:02:02.330> umph<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:03.590> pecans<00:02:03.920> naturally<00:02:04.490> flip

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
more umph and the pecans naturally flip

more umph and the pecans naturally flip
toward<00:02:05.420> you

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
toward you

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.320 
toward you
we're<00:02:06.920> gonna<00:02:07.070> keep<00:02:07.340> roasting<00:02:07.640> our<00:02:07.970> pecans

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
we're gonna keep roasting our pecans

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.960 
we're gonna keep roasting our pecans
until<00:02:09.020> they're<00:02:09.230> slightly<00:02:09.410> Brown<00:02:10.070> we<00:02:10.760> want

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
until they're slightly Brown we want

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.730 
until they're slightly Brown we want
them<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.150> be<00:02:11.390> toasted<00:02:11.960> and<00:02:12.050> kind<00:02:12.230> of<00:02:12.320> crunchy

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
them to be toasted and kind of crunchy

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.410 
them to be toasted and kind of crunchy
when<00:02:12.860> we<00:02:12.980> eat<00:02:13.160> them<00:02:13.340> so<00:02:13.610> if<00:02:13.670> we<00:02:13.820> put<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.150> sugar

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
when we eat them so if we put the sugar

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.780 
when we eat them so if we put the sugar
on<00:02:14.540> too<00:02:14.690> soon<00:02:15.110> they<00:02:15.830> won't<00:02:15.980> be<00:02:16.160> crunchy<00:02:16.580> enough

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
on too soon they won't be crunchy enough

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.190 
on too soon they won't be crunchy enough
so<00:02:16.910> we<00:02:17.030> want<00:02:17.210> to<00:02:17.270> make<00:02:17.390> sure<00:02:17.420> they're<00:02:17.810> nicely

inside a Tupperware or a baggie for
about<00:02:33.800> a<00:02:33.830> month<00:02:34.130> so<00:02:35.230> make<00:02:36.230> a<00:02:36.260> lot<00:02:36.560> while<00:02:36.800> you're

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
about a month so make a lot while you're

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.729 
about a month so make a lot while you're
making<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:37.450> okay<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:38.510> these<00:02:38.780> look<00:02:39.140> like

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739

making it okay so these look like
they're<00:02:39.920> ready<00:02:40.100> for<00:02:40.190> their<00:02:40.400> sugar<00:02:40.640> they're

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
they're ready for their sugar they're

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.850 
they're ready for their sugar they're
nicely<00:02:41.330> toasted<00:02:41.510> brown<00:02:41.959> they're<00:02:42.500> evenly

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
nicely toasted brown they're evenly

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.920 
nicely toasted brown they're evenly
coated<00:02:43.220> with<00:02:43.489> butter<00:02:43.700> they're<00:02:44.450> nice<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:44.720> hot

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
coated with butter they're nice and hot

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.470 
coated with butter they're nice and hot
so<00:02:45.410> they'll<00:02:45.680> melt<00:02:45.920> our<00:02:46.220> sugar<00:02:46.520> so<00:02:47.180> we're<00:02:47.330> now

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
so they'll melt our sugar so we're now

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.690 
so they'll melt our sugar so we're now
just<00:02:47.750> going<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:48.050> take<00:02:48.260> our<00:02:48.560> third<00:02:48.950> cup<00:02:49.220> light

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
just going to take our third cup light

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.520 
just going to take our third cup light
brown<00:02:49.910> sugar<00:02:50.150> and<00:02:50.750> we're<00:02:50.870> going<00:02:51.050> to<00:02:51.080> sprinkle

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
brown sugar and we're going to sprinkle

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.100 
brown sugar and we're going to sprinkle
it<00:02:51.650> on<00:02:51.830> to<00:02:52.160> our<00:02:52.190> pecans<00:02:52.670> I<00:02:53.000> like<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:53.870> use<00:02:54.080> just

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
it on to our pecans I like to use just

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.740 
it on to our pecans I like to use just
regular<00:02:54.489> CNH<00:02:55.489> light<00:02:56.060> brown<00:02:56.330> sugar

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
regular CNH light brown sugar

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.470 
regular CNH light brown sugar
I<00:02:56.959> find<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:57.530> melts<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.220> best<00:02:58.760> I<00:02:58.790> have<00:02:59.120> tried

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
I find it melts the best I have tried

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.850 
I find it melts the best I have tried
organic<00:03:00.230> sugars<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:01.160> they<00:03:01.340> tend<00:03:01.820> to<00:03:02.030> clump<00:03:02.450> up

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
organic sugars and they tend to clump up

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.550 
organic sugars and they tend to clump up
so<00:03:03.860> we'll<00:03:04.040> sprinkle<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:05.390> pecans<00:03:05.780> or<00:03:06.320> the

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
so we'll sprinkle the pecans or the

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.880 
so we'll sprinkle the pecans or the
walnuts<00:03:06.980> or<00:03:07.190> whatever<00:03:07.489> nuts<00:03:07.970> you<00:03:08.450> prefer<00:03:08.890> with

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
walnuts or whatever nuts you prefer with

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.190 
walnuts or whatever nuts you prefer with
our<00:03:10.190> brown<00:03:10.430> sugar<00:03:10.459> and<00:03:11.060> we'll<00:03:11.330> let<00:03:11.690> it<00:03:11.810> sit<00:03:12.170> for

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
our brown sugar and we'll let it sit for

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.670 
our brown sugar and we'll let it sit for
a<00:03:12.440> few<00:03:12.500> seconds<00:03:13.310> and<00:03:13.489> melt<00:03:14.270> I<00:03:14.660> do<00:03:15.140> have<00:03:15.350> to<00:03:15.470> say

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
a few seconds and melt I do have to say

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.440 
a few seconds and melt I do have to say
that<00:03:15.950> pecans<00:03:16.340> and<00:03:16.580> walnuts<00:03:16.850> work<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.269> best

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
that pecans and walnuts work the best

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.180 
that pecans and walnuts work the best
for<00:03:17.780> this<00:03:17.930> technique<00:03:18.440> because<00:03:18.860> they<00:03:19.010> have

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
for this technique because they have

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.680 
for this technique because they have
nooks<00:03:19.550> and<00:03:19.670> crannies<00:03:20.000> that<00:03:20.030> hold<00:03:20.360> onto<00:03:20.540> the

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
nooks and crannies that hold onto the

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.690 
nooks and crannies that hold onto the
sugar<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.050> the<00:03:21.170> butter<00:03:21.290> smoother<00:03:22.190> nuts<00:03:22.430> like

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
sugar and the butter smoother nuts like

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.949 
sugar and the butter smoother nuts like
almonds<00:03:23.209> or<00:03:24.010> cashews<00:03:25.120> tends<00:03:26.120> to<00:03:26.450> do<00:03:26.570> better<00:03:26.750> in

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
almonds or cashews tends to do better in

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.820 
almonds or cashews tends to do better in
the<00:03:27.050> oven<00:03:27.380> so<00:03:28.250> our<00:03:28.700> pecans<00:03:29.630> are<00:03:30.080> nicely

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
the oven so our pecans are nicely

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.229 
the oven so our pecans are nicely
toasted<00:03:31.190> our<00:03:32.150> sugar<00:03:33.019> is<00:03:33.110> melting<00:03:33.739> our<00:03:34.400> butter

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
toasted our sugar is melting our butter

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.170 
toasted our sugar is melting our butter
looks<00:03:35.570> great<00:03:36.280> as<00:03:37.280> soon<00:03:37.519> as<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.760> sugar<00:03:37.940> is

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
looks great as soon as the sugar is

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.000 
looks great as soon as the sugar is
melted<00:03:38.209> we're<00:03:38.870> going<00:03:38.900> to<00:03:39.170> just<00:03:39.440> pour<00:03:39.769> our

pecans onto a plate and allow them to
cool

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920
