00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
able to use this lens in order focus and

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.670 
able to use this lens in order focus and
to<00:00:22.320> see<00:00:22.470> how<00:00:22.560> fast<00:00:22.830> all<00:00:23.100> focuses<00:00:24.289> as<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.529> can

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
to see how fast all focuses as you can

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.599 
to see how fast all focuses as you can
see<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.010> near-field<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:27.380> is<00:00:28.380> pretty<00:00:29.189> good<00:00:29.429> on

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
see the near-field is is pretty good on

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.250 
see the near-field is is pretty good on
this<00:00:29.760> lens<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.330> only<00:00:30.510> problem<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.019> I'm

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
this lens the only problem is that I'm

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.319 
this lens the only problem is that I'm
using<00:00:31.439> auto<00:00:31.769> focus<00:00:32.189> on<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> moving<00:00:32.640> subject<00:00:32.910> and

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
using auto focus on a moving subject and

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.900 
using auto focus on a moving subject and
I'm<00:00:33.390> not<00:00:33.570> moving<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.290> good<00:00:34.469> speed<00:00:34.770> which<00:00:35.760> I

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
I'm not moving in a good speed which I

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.350 
I'm not moving in a good speed which I
should<00:00:36.090> more<00:00:36.300> use<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.809> manual<00:00:37.590> focus<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.360> but

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
should more use the manual focus to but

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.319 
should more use the manual focus to but
in<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.840> moment<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.219> think<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.879> should<00:00:42.030> be

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
in this moment you I think you should be

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.180 
in this moment you I think you should be
able<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.660> get<00:00:43.020> an<00:00:43.140> idea<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.800> near-field

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
able to get an idea of the near-field

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.950 
able to get an idea of the near-field
which<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.670> around<00:00:45.059> here<00:00:45.890> to<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> eyes<00:00:47.780> which<00:00:48.780> i

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
which is around here to the eyes which i

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.160 
which is around here to the eyes which i
think<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.320> ok<00:00:49.620> actually<00:00:50.390> so<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.449> give<00:00:51.989> this

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
think is ok actually so to give this

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.090 
think is ok actually so to give this
lens<00:00:52.670> what<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.699> think<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.170> good<00:00:55.530> points<00:00:56.039> of

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
lens what I think is the good points of

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.760 
lens what I think is the good points of
it<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.059> it's<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.809> fast<00:00:58.079> lens<00:00:58.379> with<00:00:58.739> a

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
it is that it's it's a fast lens with a

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.760 
it is that it's it's a fast lens with a
very<00:00:59.039> fast<00:00:59.280> autofocus<00:01:00.320> the<00:01:01.320> good<00:01:01.500> thing<00:01:01.680> is

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
very fast autofocus the good thing is

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.160 
very fast autofocus the good thing is
the<00:01:01.890> build<00:01:02.100> quality<00:01:02.280> which<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.879> made<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.690> metal

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the build quality which is made in metal

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.590 
the build quality which is made in metal
and<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:05.339> manual<00:01:05.790> focus<00:01:06.119> ring<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.420> really

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
and the manual focus ring is really

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.240 
and the manual focus ring is really
smooth<00:01:06.930> which<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.590> think<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:08.040> very<00:01:08.100> good

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
smooth which is I think it's very good

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.580 
smooth which is I think it's very good
for<00:01:08.610> video<00:01:08.760> photographers<00:01:10.189> and<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.960> lens

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
for video photographers and the lens

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.410 
for video photographers and the lens
also<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.130> an<00:01:14.220> aperture<00:01:14.640> ring<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.060> front

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
also have an aperture ring in front

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.210 
also have an aperture ring in front
which<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.840> very<00:01:16.049> pleasant<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.530> use<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
which is very pleasant to use on the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.050 
which is very pleasant to use on the
Panasonic<00:01:18.090> bodies<00:01:18.860> not<00:01:19.860> quite<00:01:20.159> sure<00:01:20.189> if<00:01:20.640> that

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
Panasonic bodies not quite sure if that

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.289 
Panasonic bodies not quite sure if that
is<00:01:21.390> how<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.470> works<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:23.009> other<00:01:23.549> camera<00:01:23.939> bodies

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
is how it works on other camera bodies

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.539 
is how it works on other camera bodies
but<00:01:24.540> I've<00:01:25.020> been<00:01:25.229> testing<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.860> Panasonic

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
but I've been testing it on a Panasonic

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.480 
but I've been testing it on a Panasonic
which<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.110> brand<00:01:28.320> through<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.009> camera

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
which is the brand through the camera

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.920 
which is the brand through the camera
body<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.939> lens<00:01:30.119> which<00:01:30.390> works<00:01:30.630> excellent

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
body and the lens which works excellent

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.319 
body and the lens which works excellent
other<00:01:33.930> things<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.560> would<00:01:34.680> say<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.880> don't

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
other things I would say that I don't

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.569 
other things I would say that I don't
find<00:01:36.689> any<00:01:36.900> problems<00:01:37.860> with<00:01:37.979> chromatic

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
find any problems with chromatic

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.359 
find any problems with chromatic
aberration<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.479> lens<00:01:39.689> but<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.860> have<00:01:41.220> to

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
aberration on this lens but I have to

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.389 
aberration on this lens but I have to
say<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.990> that's<00:01:42.990> my<00:01:43.229> opinion<00:01:43.560> because<00:01:43.950> many

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
say that that's my opinion because many

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.969 
say that that's my opinion because many
people<00:01:44.549> are<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.299> little<00:01:46.020> bit<00:01:46.259> more<00:01:46.470> depending

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
people are a little bit more depending

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.429 
people are a little bit more depending
on<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.280> judge<00:01:47.549> different<00:01:48.149> what<00:01:48.810> they<00:01:48.990> see<00:01:49.049> and

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
on the judge different what they see and

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.469 
on the judge different what they see and
what<00:01:49.590> experiences<00:01:50.100> they<00:01:50.159> have<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.180> would

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
what experiences they have so I would

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.249 
what experiences they have so I would
say<00:01:51.720> that

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
say that

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.200 
say that
judge<00:01:52.560> for<00:01:52.710> yourself<00:01:52.850> when<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.939> try<00:01:54.149> this

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
judge for yourself when you try this

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.590 
judge for yourself when you try this
lens<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.810> see<00:01:54.960> if<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.259> like<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.649> or<00:01:55.740> not<00:01:55.920> in

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
lens and see if you like it or not in

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.420 
lens and see if you like it or not in
about<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.719> chromatic<00:01:58.200> aberration<00:01:58.890> things<00:01:59.280> if

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
about the chromatic aberration things if

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.100 
about the chromatic aberration things if
they<00:01:59.579> have<00:01:59.790> any<00:01:59.969> I'm<00:02:00.299> not<00:02:00.479> sure<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.659> don't<00:02:00.930> think

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
they have any I'm not sure I don't think

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.410 
they have any I'm not sure I don't think
they<00:02:01.200> have<00:02:01.350> any<00:02:02.250> at<00:02:02.340> all<00:02:02.520> but<00:02:02.790> that's<00:02:02.969> my<00:02:03.180> taste

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
they have any at all but that's my taste

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.080 
they have any at all but that's my taste
and<00:02:03.689> perhaps<00:02:03.810> I'm<00:02:04.049> wrong<00:02:04.250> but<00:02:05.250> what<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.909> say

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
and perhaps I'm wrong but what I can say

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.150 
and perhaps I'm wrong but what I can say
is<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.509> really<00:02:07.170> love<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.530> colours<00:02:07.979> of

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
is that I really love the colours of

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.839 
is that I really love the colours of
this<00:02:08.280> lens<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:09.660> really<00:02:10.170> like<00:02:10.700> how<00:02:11.700> it

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
this lens and I really like how it

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.340 
this lens and I really like how it
renders<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.300> image

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
renders the image

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.320 
renders the image
I<00:02:13.440> can<00:02:14.070> agree<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.790> not<00:02:14.970> an

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
I can agree that this is not an

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.630 
I can agree that this is not an
extremely<00:02:15.960> sharp<00:02:16.350> Lance<00:02:16.680> but<00:02:17.070> it's<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.370> sharp

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
extremely sharp Lance but it's a sharp

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.760 
extremely sharp Lance but it's a sharp
Lance<00:02:17.850> actually<00:02:18.450> but<00:02:18.630> it's<00:02:18.750> not<00:02:18.900> extremely

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
Lance actually but it's not extremely

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
Lance actually but it's not extremely
sharp<00:02:20.990> but<00:02:21.990> I<00:02:22.440> really<00:02:22.920> like<00:02:23.130> this<00:02:23.310> Lance<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.760> I

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
sharp but I really like this Lance and I

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.690 
sharp but I really like this Lance and I
like<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.150> shoot<00:02:24.330> with<00:02:24.600> it<00:02:24.720> wide<00:02:25.650> open<00:02:26.040> on<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.520> F

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
like to shoot with it wide open on the F

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.640 
like to shoot with it wide open on the F
1.7<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:29.340> think<00:02:29.760> this<00:02:30.030> is<00:02:30.600> one<00:02:30.960> of<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.440> must

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
1.7 and I think this is one of the must

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.270 
1.7 and I think this is one of the must
to<00:02:31.950> have<00:02:31.980> in<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.670> collection<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.390> lenses<00:02:34.280> well

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
to have in the collection of lenses well

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.490 
to have in the collection of lenses well
that's<00:02:35.640> my<00:02:35.820> opinion<00:02:36.300> so<00:02:36.540> try<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:36.930> out<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.410> see

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
that's my opinion so try it out and see

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.340 
that's my opinion so try it out and see
what<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:38.010> think<00:02:38.220> about<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.840> as<00:02:39.990> I<00:02:40.170> said

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
what you think about it and as I said

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.410 
what you think about it and as I said
before<00:02:40.500> very<00:02:40.950> fast<00:02:41.250> autofocus<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:42.150> it's<00:02:42.270> very

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
before very fast autofocus and it's very

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.180 
before very fast autofocus and it's very
pleasant<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.930> work<00:02:43.020> with<00:02:43.080> in<00:02:43.530> low-light

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
pleasant to work with in low-light

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.900 
pleasant to work with in low-light
conditions<00:02:45.470> so<00:02:46.470> as<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.280> can<00:02:47.400> see<00:02:47.550> on<00:02:47.700> this

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
conditions so as you can see on this

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.240 
conditions so as you can see on this
shot<00:02:48.180> I've<00:02:48.510> been<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:49.260> older<00:02:49.560> folks<00:02:49.770> is<00:02:49.950> moving

shot I've been the older folks is moving

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.280 
shot I've been the older folks is moving
around<00:02:50.490> a<00:02:50.730> bit<00:02:50.880> there<00:02:51.120> because<00:02:51.510> I'm<00:02:51.870> not

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
around a bit there because I'm not

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.460 
around a bit there because I'm not
really<00:02:52.850> keeping<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:54.150> camera<00:02:54.690> in<00:02:54.960> a<00:02:55.080> proper

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
really keeping the camera in a proper

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.100 
really keeping the camera in a proper
way<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:55.680> or<00:02:56.340> keeping<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.180> still<00:02:57.450> as<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.870> should

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
way so or keeping it still as it should

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.440 
way so or keeping it still as it should
be<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.650> it's<00:02:59.160> worth<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.610> mention<00:02:59.760> that<00:03:00.120> there

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
be and it's worth to mention that there

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.500 
be and it's worth to mention that there
is<00:03:00.570> no<00:03:01.070> optical<00:03:02.330> as<00:03:03.530> stable<00:03:04.530> assess<00:03:04.980> iblis

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
is no optical as stable assess iblis

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.310 
is no optical as stable assess iblis
stabilization<00:03:06.510> on<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.780> so<00:03:08.480> so<00:03:09.480> we<00:03:09.870> really<00:03:10.170> need

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
stabilization on it so so we really need

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.970 
stabilization on it so so we really need
to<00:03:10.350> keep<00:03:11.070> it<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:12.300> keep<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.660> still<00:03:12.930> not<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.650> get

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980
