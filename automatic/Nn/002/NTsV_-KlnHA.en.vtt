00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.109
 I am the sonja and today I show 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.050
 Have a salad in the summertime 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.689
 is refreshing and you have bread too 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.340
 right there you need a baguette 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.630
 or even katar I'll cut that in then 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.769
 Slices calls that a bit 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.410
 apart 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.129
 then it comes on the baking sheet I have 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.620
 then basil oil comes over it and then 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.149
 It will last for eight to ten minutes 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.300
 Oven roasted at 220 degrees golden brown 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.579
 and then I still have the tomatoes 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.610
 then I cut the quarter I die 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.360
 strunk remove red onion that is 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.309
 mild 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.160
 then I cut them too small and 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.570
 then I'm here without them 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.960
 out of the box I have now 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.810
 rinsed off and habs drain and 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.229
 then you need basilikum and the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.890
 dressings I make from salt sugar 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.200
 pepper white wine vinegar and good 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:22.470
 olive oil and now I have to first 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:26.130
 cut the package so then comes my 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:30.590
 about three tablespoons and over it 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.100
 is there really big crunchy good 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.680
 work 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.140
 basil oil has it takes good olive oil 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.390
 But I think there is a whole 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.159
 great taste and now comes 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.890
 it for eight to ten minutes in the 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.680
 oven my parquet is beautiful now 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.200
 prepared that I cool off 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.670
 I'll have my onion and mine 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.540
 cut tomatoes 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.210
 I have already touched out here 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.390

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.930
 water on white wine vinegar now comes my 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.860
 uli 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:11.039
 oil to do that with you then well and 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:19.620
 is also suitable then I want too 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:24.720

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.880
 I this my tomato on it myself 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.600
 that moral and read that five minutes 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:36.380
 Then the onions will also pull 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:39.480
 crumble and then do not taste 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.530
 so my tomatoes and onions are now 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.020

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:50.450

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.459
 then the croutons take the marinades 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.470
 taste and you will be there too 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.840

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:14.310
 great salad for hot summer days and 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.970
 it also sekt and is not too heavy too 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.790
