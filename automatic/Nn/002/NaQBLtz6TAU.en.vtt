to<00:01:53.009> see<00:01:53.159> Sasuke<00:01:53.399> back<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:54.030> been<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.210> very<00:01:54.450> long

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
to see Sasuke back it's been a very long

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.899 
to see Sasuke back it's been a very long
time<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.380> animation<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.189> what<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.430> zetsu<00:01:56.790> is

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
time the animation of what the zetsu is

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.760 
time the animation of what the zetsu is
getting<00:01:57.149> blown<00:01:57.420> away<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.110> when<00:01:58.290> Sasuke<00:01:58.469> was

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
getting blown away and when Sasuke was

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.289 
getting blown away and when Sasuke was
moving<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.250> everything<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.759> just<00:01:59.790> really

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
moving and everything it just really

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.969 
moving and everything it just really
looked<00:02:00.509> at<00:02:00.630> almost<00:02:00.899> like<00:02:01.110> fan<00:02:01.380> animation

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
looked at almost like fan animation

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.230 
looked at almost like fan animation
which<00:02:02.100> really<00:02:02.310> sucks<00:02:02.579> because<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.909> was<00:02:03.030> looking

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
which really sucks because I was looking

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.580 
which really sucks because I was looking
forward<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.689> scene<00:02:03.869> for<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.110> long<00:02:04.259> time<00:02:04.500> at

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
forward to the scene for a long time at

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.780 
forward to the scene for a long time at
all<00:02:04.710> wondering<00:02:05.040> why<00:02:05.159> they<00:02:05.340> didn't<00:02:05.610> throw<00:02:05.759> it

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
all wondering why they didn't throw it

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.490 
all wondering why they didn't throw it
in<00:02:06.060> it's<00:02:06.270> possible<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.780> they<00:02:06.899> animated<00:02:07.320> this

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
in it's possible that they animated this

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.139 
in it's possible that they animated this
in<00:02:07.680> an<00:02:07.770> earlier<00:02:08.099> batch<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.670> they<00:02:08.729> just<00:02:08.970> saved

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
in an earlier batch and they just saved

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.820 
in an earlier batch and they just saved
this<00:02:09.270> little<00:02:09.390> piece<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.899> threw<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.410> onto<00:02:10.560> this

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
this little piece and threw it onto this

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.380 
this little piece and threw it onto this
episode<00:02:11.310> because<00:02:11.610> they<00:02:11.700> also<00:02:11.970> followed<00:02:12.330> up

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
episode because they also followed up

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
in that scene with Sasuke because I was

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.620 
in that scene with Sasuke because I was
supposed<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.040> happen<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.550> bit<00:02:59.670> earlier<00:03:00.390> and

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
supposed to happen a bit earlier and

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.600 
supposed to happen a bit earlier and
they<00:03:00.750> kind<00:03:00.990> of<00:03:01.020> just<00:03:01.080> held<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.680> back<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.160> just

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
they kind of just held it back and just

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.400 
they kind of just held it back and just
decided<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.030> stick<00:03:03.270> it<00:03:03.390> onto<00:03:03.510> this<00:03:03.810> episode<00:03:04.230> if

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.690 
decided to stick it onto this episode if
I'm<00:03:04.530> not<00:03:04.650> mistaken<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.250> might<00:03:05.580> have

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
I'm not mistaken that might have

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.150 
I'm not mistaken that might have
happened<00:03:06.120> before<00:03:06.440> moderate<00:03:07.440> showed<00:03:07.650> up<00:03:07.830> again

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
happened before moderate showed up again
