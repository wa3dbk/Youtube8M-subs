00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
there's the one and two buttons which

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.300 
there's the one and two buttons which
are<00:01:57.370> pretty<00:01:57.610> equivalent<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.450> a<00:01:58.479> and<00:01:58.810> B<00:01:59.050> and

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
are pretty equivalent to a and B and

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.800 
are pretty equivalent to a and B and
then<00:02:00.310> you<00:02:00.520> get<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.790> plus<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:01.210> minus<00:02:01.300> button

which are pretty compatible with select

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.219 
which are pretty compatible with select
and<00:02:04.870> start<00:02:05.400> so<00:02:06.400> basically<00:02:07.030> you<00:02:07.600> can<00:02:07.750> tell<00:02:07.990> that

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
and start so basically you can tell that

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.850 
and start so basically you can tell that
these<00:02:08.679> two<00:02:09.190> are<00:02:09.490> pretty<00:02:10.149> much<00:02:10.360> alike<00:02:10.860> although

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
these two are pretty much alike although

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.830 
these two are pretty much alike although
not<00:02:12.130> in<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.310> shape<00:02:12.520> and<00:02:12.790> color

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
not in the shape and color

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.000 
not in the shape and color
pretty<00:02:15.560> good<00:02:15.860> in<00:02:16.099> concept<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:17.500> if<00:02:18.500> they<00:02:18.920> ever

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
pretty good in concept and if they ever

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.570 
pretty good in concept and if they ever
release<00:02:19.370> some<00:02:19.910> Sega<00:02:20.360> Master<00:02:20.750> System<00:02:21.050> games

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
release some Sega Master System games

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.250

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
this would be pretty compatible with

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.479 
this would be pretty compatible with
them<00:02:24.440> too<00:02:26.379> moving<00:02:27.379> on<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.800> Super<00:02:28.340> Nintendo

of<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.319> Wii<00:02:54.319> Remote<00:02:54.680> kind<00:02:55.400> of<00:02:55.549> like<00:02:55.640> the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
of the Wii Remote kind of like the

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.069 
of the Wii Remote kind of like the
nunchuck<00:02:56.209> I<00:02:57.940> think<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.120> reason<00:02:59.299> why<00:02:59.599> it's

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
nunchuck I think the reason why it's

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.930 
nunchuck I think the reason why it's
only<00:03:00.230> compatible<00:03:00.769> with<00:03:01.099> game<00:03:01.340> Cuban<00:03:01.700> classic

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
only compatible with game Cuban classic

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.509 
only compatible with game Cuban classic
controllers<00:03:02.720> is<00:03:03.079> because<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.920> Gamecube<00:03:04.400> in

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
controllers is because the Gamecube in

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.400 
controllers is because the Gamecube in
classic<00:03:05.030> controller<00:03:05.420> have<00:03:05.750> more<00:03:06.049> buttons

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
classic controller have more buttons

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.440 
classic controller have more buttons
than<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.680> Super<00:03:06.890> Nintendo<00:03:07.160> controller<00:03:07.610> and

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
than the Super Nintendo controller and

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.449 
than the Super Nintendo controller and
that<00:03:08.599> makes<00:03:08.840> pretty<00:03:09.500> much<00:03:09.620> some<00:03:09.920> good<00:03:10.129> sense

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
that makes pretty much some good sense

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.800 
that makes pretty much some good sense
it<00:03:11.299> does<00:03:11.480> have<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.989> d<00:03:12.709> x<00:03:13.250> and<00:03:13.670> y<00:03:13.849> buttons<00:03:14.269> start

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
it does have a d x and y buttons start

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.059 
it does have a d x and y buttons start
button<00:03:15.110> and<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:16.400> joystick<00:03:16.879> so<00:03:17.859> make<00:03:18.859> some

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
button and the joystick so make some

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.949 
button and the joystick so make some
pretty<00:03:19.250> good<00:03:19.430> sense<00:03:19.639> something<00:03:20.600> that<00:03:20.780> really

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
pretty good sense something that really

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.280 
pretty good sense something that really
baffles<00:03:21.590> me<00:03:21.799> is<00:03:21.980> that<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.400> Nintendo<00:03:22.910> 64<00:03:23.290> games

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
baffles me is that the Nintendo 64 games

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.349 
baffles me is that the Nintendo 64 games
are<00:03:24.560> compatible<00:03:25.370> with<00:03:25.609> the<00:03:25.639> game<00:03:26.000> Cuban

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
are compatible with the game Cuban

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.300 
are compatible with the game Cuban
classic<00:03:26.569> controller<00:03:27.109> but<00:03:27.799> they<00:03:27.920> don't<00:03:28.160> have

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
classic controller but they don't have

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.069 
classic controller but they don't have
enough<00:03:28.549> buttons<00:03:29.709> I'm<00:03:30.709> serious<00:03:31.010> here<00:03:31.959> look<00:03:32.959> at

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
enough buttons I'm serious here look at

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.650 
enough buttons I'm serious here look at
the<00:03:33.170> controllers<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:34.430> gamecube<00:03:35.090> controllers

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660

two<00:03:36.230> buttons<00:03:36.920> behind<00:03:37.840> well<00:03:39.340> tell<00:03:40.340> you<00:03:40.459> this

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
two buttons behind well tell you this

two buttons behind well tell you this
give<00:03:41.870> this<00:03:42.610> dab<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:44.210> start<00:03:44.600> button<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:45.140> AMD

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
give this dab the start button the AMD

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
button the control pad the joystick and

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:56.260 
button the control pad the joystick and
even<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:50.150> l<00:03:50.450> r<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.650> z<00:03:53.230> button<00:03:54.340> but<00:03:55.340> when<00:03:56.150> they

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
even the l r and z button but when they

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.480 
even the l r and z button but when they
made<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.630> gamecube<00:03:57.260> controller<00:03:57.650> they

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
made the gamecube controller they

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.810 
made the gamecube controller they
replace<00:03:59.530> the<00:04:00.530> 4c<00:04:01.070> buttons<00:04:01.430> with<00:04:02.090> a/c<00:04:02.720> joystick

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
replace the 4c buttons with a/c joystick

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.930 
replace the 4c buttons with a/c joystick
sure<00:04:04.820> it<00:04:05.120> had<00:04:05.330> Y<00:04:06.110> and<00:04:06.500> X<00:04:06.710> button<00:04:07.160> but<00:04:07.550> that's

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
sure it had Y and X button but that's

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.020 
sure it had Y and X button but that's
still<00:04:08.300> didn't<00:04:08.570> compare<00:04:09.020> to<00:04:09.860> the<00:04:10.010> 4c<00:04:10.640> buttons

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
still didn't compare to the 4c buttons

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.350 
still didn't compare to the 4c buttons
so<00:04:11.330> we're<00:04:12.170> pretty<00:04:12.380> much<00:04:12.500> screwed<00:04:13.240> when<00:04:14.240> it

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
so we're pretty much screwed when it

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.590 
so we're pretty much screwed when it
comes<00:04:14.540> to<00:04:14.750> this<00:04:15.970> something<00:04:16.970> odd<00:04:17.120> about<00:04:17.150> the

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
comes to this something odd about the

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.800 
comes to this something odd about the
genesis<00:04:18.140> games<00:04:18.440> is<00:04:19.220> that<00:04:19.489> some<00:04:20.390> of<00:04:20.540> them<00:04:20.660> are

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
genesis games is that some of them are

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.350 
genesis games is that some of them are
compatible<00:04:21.530> with<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:21.950> wii<00:04:22.100> remote<00:04:22.520> although

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
compatible with the wii remote although

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.080 
compatible with the wii remote although
dnes<00:04:24.170> only<00:04:24.590> has<00:04:24.710> two<00:04:24.980> primary<00:04:25.280> buttons<00:04:25.880> and

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
dnes only has two primary buttons and

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.930 
dnes only has two primary buttons and
the<00:04:26.120> Genesis<00:04:27.080> has<00:04:27.260> three<00:04:28.780> however<00:04:29.780> unlike<00:04:30.020> the

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
the Genesis has three however unlike the

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.030 
the Genesis has three however unlike the
Nintendo<00:04:31.940> 64<00:04:32.210> games<00:04:32.780> this<00:04:33.380> is<00:04:33.710> pretty

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
Nintendo 64 games this is pretty

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.810 
Nintendo 64 games this is pretty
explained<00:04:34.610> with<00:04:34.820> on<00:04:35.230> some<00:04:36.230> of<00:04:36.530> the<00:04:37.250> Genesis

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
explained with on some of the Genesis

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.080 
explained with on some of the Genesis
games<00:04:38.950> some<00:04:39.950> of<00:04:40.040> the<00:04:40.130> buttons<00:04:40.310> do<00:04:40.700> the<00:04:40.850> same

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
games some of the buttons do the same

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.820 
games some of the buttons do the same
thing

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
thing

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.210 
thing
like<00:04:43.690> inside<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:44.930> Hedgehog<00:04:45.290> one<00:04:45.680> two<00:04:46.010> and

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
like inside the Hedgehog one two and

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.380 
like inside the Hedgehog one two and
three<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:47.180> all<00:04:47.480> do<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.020> same<00:04:48.110> action<00:04:48.760> jump<00:04:49.760> or

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
three the all do the same action jump or

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.730 
three the all do the same action jump or
when<00:04:50.690> you're<00:04:50.840> ducking<00:04:51.080> use<00:04:51.830> blast<00:04:52.340> processing

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
when you're ducking use blast processing

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.120 
when you're ducking use blast processing
well<00:04:55.750> then<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:57.170> wii<00:04:57.290> remote<00:04:57.620> is<00:04:57.830> pretty

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
well then the wii remote is pretty

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.250 
well then the wii remote is pretty
compatible<00:04:58.460> because<00:04:59.090> then<00:04:59.420> both<00:04:59.870> the<00:04:59.900> two

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
compatible because then both the two

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.350 
compatible because then both the two
buttons<00:05:00.590> will<00:05:00.800> do<00:05:00.920> the<00:05:01.070> same<00:05:01.250> thing<00:05:01.550> or<00:05:01.790> if<00:05:02.150> two

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
buttons will do the same thing or if two

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.300 
buttons will do the same thing or if two
buttons<00:05:02.720> do<00:05:02.900> the<00:05:03.140> same<00:05:03.380> action<00:05:03.770> and<00:05:03.980> one<00:05:04.130> does

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
buttons do the same action and one does

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.390 
buttons do the same action and one does
a<00:05:04.340> different<00:05:04.760> one<00:05:04.910> then<00:05:05.390> pretty<00:05:06.230> easy<00:05:06.400> one

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
a different one then pretty easy one

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.770 
a different one then pretty easy one
action<00:05:07.790> a<00:05:07.970> different<00:05:08.450> action<00:05:08.570> pretty<00:05:09.530> simple

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
action a different action pretty simple

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.110
