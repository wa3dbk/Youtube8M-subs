00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.230
 the sweet recipe are a delight to 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:14.559
 prepare and to taste the today we have 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.660
 a red fruit tiramisu let's see the 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.300
 Ingredients for the mixture of tiramisu 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.640
 half a cup of granulated sugar 400 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.880
 grams of milk cream 200 grams of 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.220
 cream cheese 100 grams of sour cream 30 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.170
 finger biscuits 100 grams of cocoa 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.539
 powder dried fruits to decorate 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.360
 almonds nuts pistachios and cranberries 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.100
 for the mixture of tiramisu 2 cups of 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.800
 mix of red berries strawberries blackberries 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.140
 cranberries cherries half a cup of water 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.120
 a quarter cup of sugar one 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.820
 teaspoon vanilla one 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.990
 cinnamon stick vodka and wine to liquor 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.470
 taste 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:53.530
 let's say we already have the mixture 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:57.190
 strawberries blackberries and we also add some 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.660
 cherries and we put the sugar we're going to 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.020
 put the sugar so that they go 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.090
 releasing it as all the juices will 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.740
 let's put then also the 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.320
 exquisite cinnamon so that we go 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.610
 releasing also as flavor 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.880
 we are not going to hydrate them 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.640
 but the sugar that we had 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:20.729
 helped him to let go let's say that a 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.729
 juguito the fruit 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.320
 and with that we are going to do now then 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.710
 a syrup with which we will bathe 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.600
 little fingers then we have what the juice 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.789
 that we release the fruits we are going to 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.850
 add sugar and we will add 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:40.069
 also water first we integrate 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.509
 we dissolve the sugar we try 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:43.189
 obviously it will not dissolve us from the 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.289
 everything but the idea is that if not 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.329
 integrate well with water 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.009
 the juices that we have here and 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.789
 let's then start to assemble the 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.789
 milk cream 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.549
 what's important here in the cream feels 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:06.579
 be the skill at any time 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.579
 of week that we return of client 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.239
 Here we are already seeing how the 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.239
 texture 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:20.390
 Look, he's already won us a lot 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.390
 we have then 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.630
 the cream cheese 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:37.550
 it's the sour cream and we add the sugar 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.840
 we also take it to integrate in the 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.840
 mixer 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.569
 and we are then integrating cream 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.489
 sour cream cheese and sugar 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.489
 and then we're going to add it 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.960
 to the milk cream we already have 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.050
 market 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.180
 and here the syrup as I say is not a 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.460
 syrup completely thick but no longer 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.010
 it served and we were not integrated 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.410
 dissolved the sugar and right now then 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.840
 extra fire we are going to add the best 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.180
 if we want then they can use 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.700
 Well, what I brought them to be 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.210
 in a wine let's say that a grape wine 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.550
 that gives also as within being as 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.160
 is under our red fruits and a 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:40.820
 vodka that also works perfect 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:42.410
 for that we're going to add the cream 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.640
 milk so that we integrate well and 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.330
 here we have well integrated the 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.330
 products 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.120
 and here we are adding the cream of 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.360
 milk that we had right now assembled 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.819
 to be able to just be integrated 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.750
 Then we have cream cheese 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:09.610
 cream cream greg and sugar 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.610
 we have then in a removable mold 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.100
 life is for the perfect fit 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:18.930
 presented as the producer 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.780
 let's put a first layer 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.139
 of the cream to be able to insure 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.139
 little fingers 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:43.790
 and we're going to start lining the mold and 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:48.580
 we go then then to bathe 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:52.349
 soak your fingers well 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.349
 to be able to go forming the layers 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.520
 we are going to put the layer of 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:03.520
 berries 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.740
 this is important when they go to 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.740
 work the desserts leave it 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:46.180
 a good minimum cooling time 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:48.160
 two hours and then we will decorate with 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.640
 the nuts 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:57.040
 here we have almonds we have some 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:59.550
 patitas the cranberries we have some 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.550
 More expensive 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:33.910
 we can also use a tape and 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:35.890
 we have already then the cost in this 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.260
 dessert is ideal to serve after 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:40.510
 a light lunch and for many more 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:43.260
