because it dried yeah it doesn't take

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.070 
because it dried yeah it doesn't take
that<00:02:49.400> long<00:02:49.459> to<00:02:49.640> dry<00:02:49.970> but<00:02:50.239> eventually<00:02:50.660> you'll

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
that long to dry but eventually you'll

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.680 
that long to dry but eventually you'll
get<00:02:51.260> something<00:02:52.540> white<00:02:53.560> on<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.800> card<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:56.540> if
