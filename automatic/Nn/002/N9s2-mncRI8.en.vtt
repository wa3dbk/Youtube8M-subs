 hello guys once more you know 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.920
 about the leader of the chip ca 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.230
 I'm here with our matrix friend who 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.230
 for the second time it has been installing the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.230
 cache we installed a 2010 blazer 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:28.680
 2.422.480 153 same key installed 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.420
 four months you noticed her 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.460
 different 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:38.630
 power consumption 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.700
 now changed more full 7 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:49.890
 now we are here with omega that before and 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:52.970
 right omega 98 is a correct omega 4.1 and 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.550
 automatic mechanical transmission 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.470
 now that it has been behaving already 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.370
 we just installed the chip that can 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.370
 realize this 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.439
 the air conditioner connected chip installed 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.439
 on sea ​​ice on panel erased 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.940
 it arrived like this 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.920
 then check it out 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.470
 second it reached 100 per hour 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.200
 we are the anchieta highway at the height of 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.200
 kilometer 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.200
 28 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.220
 there already start 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.780
 You drove it goes a little further. 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:49.210
 the difference in the output of that south 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.479
 already already 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.780
 the mother mix gives more 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.430
 So it's good, I 'll not have a short video here. 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.780
 To say that in the car there is a Corinthian 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.780
 born but ok 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.259
 speak personal alert matter be 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.060
 knows the equipment is more than the 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.649
 other colleagues there that sometimes stays in the 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.509
 You have a customer who has already installed 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.069
 Then I was in another car here. 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.620
 matrix is ​​the living proof of that, that's right 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.370
 said 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.370
 leaves
