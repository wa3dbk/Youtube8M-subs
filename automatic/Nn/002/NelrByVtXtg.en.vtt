00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
 me 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.360
 File is is the heart 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.900
 Let's enjoy different cameras 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:20.680
 I want to start a single-lens camera 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:27.040
 Though it seems to be difficult, anyone with a little bit of professionalism will be able to take a photo as long as you have it 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.760
 Master the aperture and shutter speed, and the photo is the star for the aperture and shutter speed. 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:34.000
 if 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:39.790
 To move the background beautifully , or to capture the decisive moments of sports events and sports scenes 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.670
 If you think you can do it aperture shutter speed so hard 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:46.320
 A little divorced 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:52.650
 Please take a look at the video. If you master this, the picture will change greatly 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:59.190
 The aperture is a fortune-telling eye. The lens comes with an aperture blade. 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:01:01.400
 You can control the amount of light by closing and opening this aperture 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.400
 It is 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:12.960
 I I will reduce it is the value of the diaphragm and the diaphragm blades is I'm open As you can see 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:18.360
 So you can take a picture that broke the background 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:25.020
 Conversely, if you increase the aperture value 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:26.620
 The aperture is closed and you can take a clear, well-focused picture from the front to the far 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.920
 I can 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.070
 Let's actually do it 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.570
 Load dial 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.210
 a 2 / 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:42.740
 It will be fit, and it will become aperture priority auto. 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:50.020
 You can set the aperture as you like 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.020
 The camera will adjust the shutter speed automatically according to the aperture value . 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.290
 This f is the aperture value now 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:04.140
 This way the aperture 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:09.470
 If you try it, the aperture will open and you will be able to take a picture with a blurred background 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.470
 For example, it is the best for picking up people and children 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:28.760
 On the contrary, if you increase the aperture value like this 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:33.370
 The aperture closes and you can take a photo that is in focus from the front to the far side . 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.370
 It's perfect for taking a memorial photo 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:55.659
 Shutter priority auto is mode dial this 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:03:00.790
 yourself shutter speed by doing this you will be together at the s 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:04.080
 It is the value of this time aperture could be set to favorite stand of 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:08.940
 The camera will make adjustments automatically 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:12.210
 The shutter speed is the value of s here. 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:19.260
 Shutter speed so small 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:20.740
 If you can do it slowly, for example , to make the night scene bright and take a stream of water 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.560
 It is optimal 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.560
 It is recommended to use a tripod to shoot 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:39.569
 Conversely As you can see the value of this shutter speed 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:44.690
 If you can enlarge it 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.690
 It's best to take one round of what is moving 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:08.489
 Today I think I have taken surprisingly easy was the aperture and soccer speed 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.489
 Because there is a great position, let's adjust variously 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.400
