00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.270
 plus 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:43.949
 what amphibians are amphibians are a 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.870
 group of living vertebrate animals 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.000
 in the water or in humid areas its 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.820
 main characteristics are that 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.760
 they have bare skin they do not have hair 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.500
 feathers or scales are oviparous 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.019
 females lay the eggs in the water of 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.879
 the ponds rivers and lagoons of these 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.309
 eggs are born the tadpoles that 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.559
 they will change until they become adults 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.570
 Adult amphibians breathe through lungs and 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.759
 through the skin the tadpoles 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.820
 breathe through gills that allow them 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.409
 capture the oxygen in the water 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.899
 some amphibians like frogs do not 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.140
 others have a tail like the salamander if 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:21.300
 the amphibians have it, so they are 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.000
 oviparous vertebrate animals that have 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.740
 bare skin adults breathe for 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.440
 lungs the tadpoles have gills 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:36.479
 that is life many and an amphibian 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.399
 when it is born it is called tadpole and its 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.270
 body changes a lot until it becomes 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.770
 adult 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.539
 the metamorphosis is the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.000
 together of changes that occurs in your 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.399
 body with the passage of time 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.549
 females lay the eggs in the water of 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.850
 Each egg is born a tadpole with tail at 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.159
 tadpole the hind legs come out 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.319
 then the front legs come out and 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.319
 at the end loses the tail and becomes 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.579
 in an adult frog the same thing happens with 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.050
 the wax worm 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.340
 notice 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.619
 the worm lives and when it feeds 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.780
 makes great brews a silk cocoon 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.780
 where will it stay until it becomes 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.940
 finally in butterfly it is important that 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.980
 know that the solÃ¡ worm is not a 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.360
 amphibian but I've put it for you 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.360
 that you see what metamorphosis is 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:33.560
 what fish are fish are animals 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.960
 aquatic living in the water 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.810
 sweet as salty they all have the 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.000
 following common characteristics its 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.610
 body is covered with scales have 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.470
 several fins for swimming are oviparous 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.990
 they put the eggs in the water and not the 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.590
 incubated from them come the offspring that 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.030
 they call fry the fish breathe 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.040
 through some organs called 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.790
 gills that are located behind 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.739
 head 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.200
 the skeleton of the fish may be 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.329
 formed by the cartilage bones or 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.790
 Bony fish have the skeleton formed 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.129
 by bones are the largest group of 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.590
 some fish live in the sea as the 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.890
 mullet and others in rivers and lakes as 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.510
 the trout the cartilaginous fishes 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.180
 they have skeleton formed by cartilage 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.780
 the shark and the ray are examples of 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.780
 cartilaginous fish 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.450
 i 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.590
 April 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.390
