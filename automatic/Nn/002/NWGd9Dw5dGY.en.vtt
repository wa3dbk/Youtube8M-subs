00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
hi my name is dave Andrews today I'm

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.380 
hi my name is dave Andrews today I'm
going<00:00:04.799> to<00:00:04.859> show<00:00:04.950> you<00:00:04.980> how<00:00:05.190> to<00:00:05.250> make<00:00:05.430> Linux<00:00:05.940> run

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
going to show you how to make Linux run

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.940 
going to show you how to make Linux run
that<00:00:06.629> faster<00:00:07.109> let's<00:00:07.740> go<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.890> our<00:00:07.950> computer<00:00:09.950> I'm

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
that faster let's go to our computer I'm

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.999 
that faster let's go to our computer I'm
gonna<00:00:11.130> pull<00:00:11.250> up<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.460> terminal<00:00:11.700> here<00:00:12.860> and<00:00:13.860> one

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
gonna pull up a terminal here and one

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.499 
gonna pull up a terminal here and one
thing<00:00:14.190> you<00:00:14.370> can<00:00:14.490> do<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.700> make<00:00:14.849> your<00:00:14.969> Linux<00:00:15.330> run

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
thing you can do to make your Linux run

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.080 
thing you can do to make your Linux run
faster<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.170> choice<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.190> file<00:00:17.460> system<00:00:17.940> that

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
faster is the choice of file system that

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.279 
faster is the choice of file system that
you<00:00:18.240> used<00:00:18.449> when<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.810> installed<00:00:19.170> your

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
you used when you installed your

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.800 
you used when you installed your
computer<00:00:19.770> if<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.730> type<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:20.970> mountain<00:00:21.449> command

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
computer if I type the mountain command

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.740 
computer if I type the mountain command
you<00:00:22.199> can<00:00:22.350> see<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.039> root<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.490> my<00:00:23.970> file

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
you can see that the root of my file

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.390 
you can see that the root of my file
system<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.830> using<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.400> file<00:00:26.640> system<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.289> ext3

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
system is using the file system the ext3

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.080 
system is using the file system the ext3
now<00:00:29.400> ext3<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.269> very<00:00:30.599> secure<00:00:31.489> very<00:00:32.489> solid

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
now ext3 is a very secure very solid

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.479 
now ext3 is a very secure very solid
very<00:00:33.329> stable<00:00:33.780> file<00:00:34.230> system<00:00:34.739> but<00:00:35.219> there<00:00:35.370> are

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
very stable file system but there are

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.100 
very stable file system but there are
other<00:00:35.610> file<00:00:35.880> systems<00:00:36.120> available<00:00:36.870> such<00:00:37.079> as

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
other file systems available such as

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.369 
other file systems available such as
riser<00:00:37.559> file<00:00:38.430> system<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.899> are<00:00:40.020> actually

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
riser file system that are actually

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.270 
riser file system that are actually
optimized<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.430> store<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> lot<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.239> small<00:00:42.570> files

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
optimized to store a lot of small files

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.069 
optimized to store a lot of small files
and<00:00:44.280> Linux<00:00:44.969> uses<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.270> whole<00:00:45.510> lot<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.870> small

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
and Linux uses a whole lot of small

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.369 
and Linux uses a whole lot of small
files<00:00:46.550> small<00:00:47.550> text<00:00:47.940> files<00:00:47.969> for<00:00:48.600> configuration

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
files small text files for configuration

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.470 
files small text files for configuration
and<00:00:49.590> things<00:00:49.800> like<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.879> suggest<00:00:51.390> that

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
and things like that so I suggest that

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.819 
and things like that so I suggest that
you<00:00:51.629> would<00:00:51.750> use<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.590> system<00:00:53.460> such<00:00:53.670> as<00:00:53.699> riser<00:00:54.090> FS

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
you would use a system such as riser FS

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.830 
you would use a system such as riser FS
for<00:00:55.829> your<00:00:56.039> main<00:00:56.280> file<00:00:56.820> system<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.719> way

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
for your main file system and that way

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.930 
for your main file system and that way
your<00:00:58.109> your<00:00:58.379> file<00:00:58.649> system<00:00:59.070> can<00:00:59.219> access<00:00:59.550> files<00:00:59.789> a

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
your your file system can access files a

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.389 
your your file system can access files a
lot<00:01:00.120> faster<00:01:00.629> now<00:01:01.530> another<00:01:01.770> tip<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.190> use<00:01:02.370> a

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
lot faster now another tip is use a

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.870 
lot faster now another tip is use a
program<00:01:02.850> called<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.239> pre<00:01:03.480> link<00:01:04.129> if<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.339> type<00:01:05.610> sudo

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
program called a pre link if I type sudo

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.050 
program called a pre link if I type sudo
apt-get<00:01:06.840> install<00:01:07.080> pre<00:01:08.070> link<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.610> my

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
apt-get install pre link on my

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.020 
apt-get install pre link on my
installation<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.380> Linux<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:11.549> gonna<00:01:11.670> go<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
installation of Linux it's gonna go and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.880 
installation of Linux it's gonna go and
download<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.479> pre<00:01:12.840> link<00:01:13.110> program<00:01:13.380> and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
download the pre link program and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.100 
download the pre link program and
install<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.490> as<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.240> can<00:01:15.360> see<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.540> already<00:01:15.840> have

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
install it as you can see I already have

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.899 
install it as you can see I already have
it<00:01:16.200> installed<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.890> let's<00:01:17.280> go<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.670> configure

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
it installed so let's go and configure

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.969 
it installed so let's go and configure
pre<00:01:18.270> link<00:01:18.570> by<00:01:19.229> typing<00:01:19.650> sudo<00:01:19.920> G<00:01:20.670> edit<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
pre link by typing sudo G edit and the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.310 
pre link by typing sudo G edit and the
command<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:24.210> Etsy<00:01:24.960> default<00:01:25.830> pre<00:01:26.400> link<00:01:27.259> so<00:01:28.259> to

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
command is Etsy default pre link so to

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.980 
command is Etsy default pre link so to
open<00:01:28.470> up<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.799> pre<00:01:29.070> link<00:01:29.780> configuration<00:01:30.780> file

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
open up the pre link configuration file

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.679 
open up the pre link configuration file
let's<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:31.860> change<00:01:32.070> pre<00:01:32.490> linking<00:01:32.880> here<00:01:33.150> to

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
let's just change pre linking here to

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:41.210 
let's just change pre linking here to
say<00:01:34.130> yes<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.430> save<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:39.200> now<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:40.350> we<00:01:40.500> run<00:01:40.920> sudo

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
say yes and save it now if we run sudo

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.590 
say yes and save it now if we run sudo
pre<00:01:41.670> link<00:01:41.990> or<00:01:42.990> rather<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.320> pre<00:01:43.829> link<00:01:44.600> this

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
pre link or rather just pre link this

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.510 
pre link or rather just pre link this
program<00:01:46.079> will<00:01:46.259> run<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.829> will<00:01:46.979> go<00:01:47.490> through

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
program will run and it will go through

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.560 
program will run and it will go through
and<00:01:48.000> link<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.840> lot<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.200> your<00:01:49.380> shared<00:01:49.770> objects

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
and link a lot of your shared objects

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.240 
and link a lot of your shared objects
for<00:01:51.570> programs<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.409> use<00:01:52.439> it'll<00:01:53.009> go<00:01:53.159> ahead

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
for programs that you use it'll go ahead

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.800 
for programs that you use it'll go ahead
and<00:01:53.430> get<00:01:53.549> those<00:01:53.700> linked<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.720> the
