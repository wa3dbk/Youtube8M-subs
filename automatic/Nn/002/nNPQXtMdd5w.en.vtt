00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
fruity get fruits here I think it does

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.440 
fruity get fruits here I think it does
fruit<00:01:55.829> year<00:01:56.100> round<00:01:56.219> but<00:01:56.430> it's<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.700> long<00:01:56.880> time

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
fruit year round but it's a long time

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.109 
fruit year round but it's a long time
to<00:01:57.869> ripen<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.439> only<00:01:58.649> only<00:01:59.340> pick<00:01:59.700> them<00:01:59.909> when

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
to ripen so only only pick them when

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.270 
to ripen so only only pick them when
they're<00:02:00.270> actually<00:02:00.719> starting<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.590> push<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> part

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
they're actually starting to push a part

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.539
