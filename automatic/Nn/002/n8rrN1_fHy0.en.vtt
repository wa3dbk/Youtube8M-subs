00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.650 

articulation<00:01:18.680> wise<00:01:18.920> eyes<00:01:19.760> got<00:01:20.120> real<00:01:20.390> all<00:01:20.480> tech

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
articulation wise eyes got real all tech

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.390 
articulation wise eyes got real all tech
joints<00:01:20.990> on<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.140> ankles<00:01:21.500> so<00:01:22.010> you<00:01:22.100> can<00:01:22.190> bend

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
joints on the ankles so you can bend

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.820 
joints on the ankles so you can bend
those<00:01:22.550> up<00:01:22.910> and<00:01:23.060> down<00:01:23.210> as<00:01:23.930> well<00:01:24.170> you<00:01:24.350> can<00:01:24.530> tilt

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
those up and down as well you can tilt

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.180 
those up and down as well you can tilt
them<00:01:24.980> on<00:01:25.100> an<00:01:25.220> angle<00:01:25.520> like<00:01:25.670> so<00:01:26.710> I've<00:01:27.710> got<00:01:28.010> real

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
them on an angle like so I've got real

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.930 
them on an angle like so I've got real
tech<00:01:28.460> joints<00:01:28.790> on<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:28.970> knees<00:01:30.310> like<00:01:31.310> so<00:01:31.550> they'll

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
tech joints on the knees like so they'll

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.390 
tech joints on the knees like so they'll
actually<00:01:32.150> Bend<00:01:32.630> either<00:01:32.930> way<00:01:33.110> and<00:01:33.350> then<00:01:34.010> you

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
actually Bend either way and then you

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.680 
actually Bend either way and then you
could<00:01:34.550> even<00:01:34.700> bend<00:01:34.910> them<00:01:35.030> all<00:01:35.090> to<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.330> side<00:01:35.540> if

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
could even bend them all to the side if

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:42.000 
could even bend them all to the side if
you<00:01:35.750> want<00:01:35.900> to<00:01:35.990> manipulate<00:01:36.200> that<00:01:36.650> joint<00:01:40.540> I

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
you want to manipulate that joint I

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.980 
you want to manipulate that joint I
pointed<00:01:43.010> out<00:01:43.100> in<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:43.370> lot<00:01:43.520> of<00:01:43.550> my<00:01:43.960> reviews<00:01:44.960> for

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
pointed out in a lot of my reviews for

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.040 
pointed out in a lot of my reviews for
Revoltech<00:01:45.590> figures<00:01:46.660> Revoltech<00:01:47.660> figures<00:01:47.930> are

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
Revoltech figures Revoltech figures are

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.660 
Revoltech figures Revoltech figures are
very<00:01:48.230> plausible<00:01:48.710> but<00:01:48.950> like<00:01:49.100> I<00:01:49.250> said<00:01:49.310> with<00:01:49.580> the

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
very plausible but like I said with the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.240 
very plausible but like I said with the
joints<00:01:50.060> there<00:01:50.780> they<00:01:51.050> only<00:01:51.200> move<00:01:51.500> one<00:01:51.740> way<00:01:51.800> so

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
joints there they only move one way so

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.560 
joints there they only move one way so
you<00:01:52.340> know<00:01:52.520> you<00:01:52.820> want<00:01:52.970> to<00:01:53.000> bring<00:01:53.150> this<00:01:53.240> leg<00:01:53.450> up

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
you know you want to bring this leg up

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.030 
you know you want to bring this leg up
forward<00:01:53.900> that's<00:01:54.200> fine<00:01:54.470> but<00:01:54.650> if<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:54.830> want<00:01:54.980> to

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
forward that's fine but if you want to

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.770 
forward that's fine but if you want to
bring<00:01:55.160> it<00:01:55.250> out<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:55.370> the<00:01:55.580> side<00:01:55.850> you'd<00:01:56.480> have<00:01:56.630> to

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
bring it out to the side you'd have to

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.110 
bring it out to the side you'd have to
manipulate<00:01:57.080> that<00:01:57.530> joint<00:01:57.770> by<00:01:57.950> twisting<00:01:58.460> it<00:01:58.520> in

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
manipulate that joint by twisting it in

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.340 
manipulate that joint by twisting it in
order<00:01:59.330> to<00:01:59.420> get<00:01:59.540> the<00:01:59.690> leg<00:01:59.810> to<00:01:59.930> come<00:02:00.020> on<00:02:00.140> to<00:02:00.260> the

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
order to get the leg to come on to the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.660 
order to get the leg to come on to the
side<00:02:00.530> so<00:02:00.710> they<00:02:00.830> work<00:02:00.950> similar<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.340> a<00:02:01.490> ball

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
side so they work similar to a ball

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.860 
side so they work similar to a ball
joint<00:02:01.850> they're<00:02:02.060> just<00:02:02.240> a<00:02:02.300> little<00:02:02.480> bit<00:02:02.720> more

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
joint they're just a little bit more

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.510 
joint they're just a little bit more
effort<00:02:03.020> I<00:02:03.230> guess<00:02:03.410> but<00:02:03.830> anyways<00:02:04.130> got<00:02:04.340> another

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
effort I guess but anyways got another

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.420 
effort I guess but anyways got another
real<00:02:04.670> low<00:02:04.760> tech<00:02:04.970> joint<00:02:05.180> on<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.600> hips<00:02:06.220> it's<00:02:07.220> got

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
real low tech joint on the hips it's got

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.100 
real low tech joint on the hips it's got
a<00:02:07.460> I'm<00:02:07.850> not<00:02:07.880> sure<00:02:08.149> if<00:02:08.210> it's<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.360> real<00:02:08.540> tech<00:02:08.840> joint

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
a I'm not sure if it's a real tech joint

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.660 
a I'm not sure if it's a real tech joint
or<00:02:09.260> just<00:02:09.440> a<00:02:09.500> ball<00:02:09.710> joint<00:02:09.890> I<00:02:10.010> can't<00:02:10.190> really<00:02:10.520> see

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
or just a ball joint I can't really see

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.490 
or just a ball joint I can't really see
up<00:02:10.790> under<00:02:11.000> here<00:02:11.150> but<00:02:11.360> it's<00:02:11.930> more<00:02:12.110> like<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.350> ball

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
up under here but it's more like a ball

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.730 
up under here but it's more like a ball
joint<00:02:12.680> under<00:02:12.980> there<00:02:13.100> I<00:02:13.130> guess<00:02:14.230> eyes<00:02:15.230> got<00:02:15.710> a

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
joint under there I guess eyes got a

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.670 
joint under there I guess eyes got a
ball<00:02:15.950> joint<00:02:16.130> on<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.400> neck<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:17.410> then<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.470> ball

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
ball joint on the neck and then a ball

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.380 
ball joint on the neck and then a ball
joint<00:02:18.800> where<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.100> actual<00:02:19.460> head<00:02:19.640> connects<00:02:20.000> as

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
joint where the actual head connects as

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.479 
joint where the actual head connects as
well<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:20.870> again<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:21.650> can<00:02:21.770> tip<00:02:21.950> his<00:02:22.070> head<00:02:22.220> you

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
well and again you can tip his head you

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:23.920 
well and again you can tip his head you
know<00:02:22.610> forward<00:02:23.000> back<00:02:23.270> and<00:02:23.510> if<00:02:23.600> you<00:02:23.720> want<00:02:23.840> to

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
know forward back and if you want to

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.750 
know forward back and if you want to
manipulate<00:02:24.080> joint<00:02:25.040> you<00:02:25.130> can<00:02:25.250> go<00:02:25.400> from<00:02:25.520> side<00:02:25.730> to

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
manipulate joint you can go from side to

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.160 
manipulate joint you can go from side to
side<00:02:25.880> as<00:02:26.239> we<00:02:27.050> said<00:02:27.260> that<00:02:27.440> bowtie<00:02:27.800> is<00:02:27.860> movable

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
side as we said that bowtie is movable

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.250 
side as we said that bowtie is movable
more--well<00:02:30.170> tech<00:02:30.380> joints<00:02:30.680> on<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:30.800> shoulders

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
more--well tech joints on the shoulders

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.800 
more--well tech joints on the shoulders
that<00:02:33.260> control<00:02:33.739> as<00:02:33.920> well<00:02:34.420> he's<00:02:35.420> just<00:02:35.660> got<00:02:35.780> a

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
that control as well he's just got a

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.620 
that control as well he's just got a
hinge<00:02:36.140> on<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.560> elbow<00:02:37.270> which<00:02:38.270> I<00:02:38.390> thought<00:02:38.540> was

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
hinge on the elbow which I thought was

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.600 
hinge on the elbow which I thought was
kind<00:02:38.810> of<00:02:38.900> odd<00:02:39.020> but<00:02:39.709> it<00:02:40.160> works<00:02:40.340> just<00:02:40.489> fine

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
kind of odd but it works just fine

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.330 
kind of odd but it works just fine
anyways<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.680> then<00:02:43.000> just<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.180> hinge<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:45.340> swivel

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
anyways and then just a hinge and swivel

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.680 
anyways and then just a hinge and swivel
on<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.580> wrists

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
on the wrists

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.110 
on the wrists
so<00:02:49.260> quite<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.560> bit<00:02:49.770> of<00:02:49.890> pose<00:02:50.490> ability<00:02:50.940> on<00:02:51.030> this

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
so quite a bit of pose ability on this

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.300 
so quite a bit of pose ability on this
figure<00:02:51.360> actually<00:02:51.890> probably<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.100> most

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
figure actually probably the most

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.000 
figure actually probably the most
plausible<00:02:53.780> Jack<00:02:54.780> Skellington<00:02:55.050> figure<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:55.740> I

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
plausible Jack Skellington figure that I

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.250 
plausible Jack Skellington figure that I
have<00:02:56.250> anyways<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:57.690> other<00:02:57.810> two<00:02:57.990> being<00:02:58.170> the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
have anyways the other two being the

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.740 
have anyways the other two being the
NECA<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:59.220> know<00:02:59.310> players<00:02:59.670> version<00:03:00.210> but

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
NECA and you know players version but

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.510 
NECA and you know players version but
he's<00:03:01.140> definitely<00:03:01.320> taste<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.160> cake<00:03:02.340> for

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
he's definitely taste the cake for

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.060 
he's definitely taste the cake for
poseability<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:03.300> set<00:03:04.080> him<00:03:04.230> back<00:03:04.380> for<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.680> second

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
poseability I set him back for a second

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.900 
poseability I set him back for a second
we<00:03:05.490> can<00:03:05.610> look<00:03:05.940> at<00:03:06.030> his<00:03:06.120> actual<00:03:06.390> display<00:03:06.780> base

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
we can look at his actual display base

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.130 
we can look at his actual display base
so<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:09.120> really<00:03:09.360> like<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.630> paint<00:03:09.810> work<00:03:09.930> done

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
so I really like the paint work done

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.290 
so I really like the paint work done
it's<00:03:10.290> got<00:03:10.470> this<00:03:10.590> really<00:03:10.800> cool<00:03:11.070> kind<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.180> like<00:03:12.270> a

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
it's got this really cool kind of like a

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.690 
it's got this really cool kind of like a
purple<00:03:12.780> hue<00:03:12.990> running<00:03:13.350> up<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.560> bricks<00:03:13.800> and

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
purple hue running up the bricks and

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.450 
purple hue running up the bricks and
down<00:03:15.150> onto<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.570> Lord<00:03:16.080> piece<00:03:16.380> just<00:03:17.190> gives<00:03:17.340> a

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
down onto the Lord piece just gives a

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.030 
down onto the Lord piece just gives a
really<00:03:17.790> nice<00:03:17.910> effect<00:03:18.410> yeah<00:03:19.410> it's<00:03:19.650> got<00:03:19.800> like

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
really nice effect yeah it's got like

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.440 
really nice effect yeah it's got like
three<00:03:20.520> different<00:03:20.610> pumpkins<00:03:21.120> hanging<00:03:21.360> on

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
three different pumpkins hanging on

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.040 
three different pumpkins hanging on
there<00:03:21.630> this<00:03:22.110> one's<00:03:22.320> actually<00:03:22.500> removable<00:03:24.050> I'm

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
there this one's actually removable I'm

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.360 
there this one's actually removable I'm
not<00:03:25.200> sure<00:03:25.350> if<00:03:25.440> it's<00:03:25.530> supposed<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.860> be<00:03:26.040> but<00:03:26.250> it

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
not sure if it's supposed to be but it

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.250 
not sure if it's supposed to be but it
pulls<00:03:26.820> off<00:03:27.060> really<00:03:27.330> easily<00:03:27.510> anyways<00:03:27.960> I

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
pulls off really easily anyways I

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.680 
pulls off really easily anyways I
believe<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.160> saw<00:03:29.370> pictures<00:03:29.700> of<00:03:29.940> him<00:03:30.270> actually

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
believe I saw pictures of him actually

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.080 
believe I saw pictures of him actually
holding<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.200> one<00:03:31.290> pumpkin<00:03:31.710> so<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:32.130> guess<00:03:32.640> it

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
holding the one pumpkin so I guess it

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.640 
holding the one pumpkin so I guess it
probably<00:03:33.300> is<00:03:33.570> removable<00:03:33.900> it's<00:03:34.080> got<00:03:34.170> a<00:03:34.200> little

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
probably is removable it's got a little

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.750 
probably is removable it's got a little

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:54.120 

and<00:04:48.060> and<00:04:49.060> one<00:04:49.210> more<00:04:49.389> kind<00:04:49.570> of<00:04:49.720> an<00:04:50.110> evil<00:04:50.560> grin<00:04:53.130> so

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
and and one more kind of an evil grin so

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.860 
and and one more kind of an evil grin so
they<00:04:54.310> swap<00:04:54.550> in<00:04:54.729> and<00:04:54.820> out<00:04:54.910> really<00:04:55.180> easy<00:04:55.389> just

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
they swap in and out really easy just

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.129 
they swap in and out really easy just
pull<00:04:56.680> off<00:04:56.830> the<00:04:56.889> head

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.899 

replace<00:05:00.919> and<00:05:01.729> there<00:05:02.120> you<00:05:02.210> go<00:05:03.220> so<00:05:04.220> he<00:05:04.639> doesn't

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
replace and there you go so he doesn't

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:06.460 
replace and there you go so he doesn't
actually<00:05:05.030> include<00:05:05.360> a<00:05:05.539> reball<00:05:05.840> text<00:05:06.169> and<00:05:06.319> which

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
actually include a reball text and which

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.379 
actually include a reball text and which
I<00:05:06.560> thought<00:05:06.680> was<00:05:06.830> kind<00:05:07.009> of<00:05:07.129> odd<00:05:07.879> as<00:05:08.210> well

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
I thought was kind of odd as well

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.659 
I thought was kind of odd as well
because<00:05:08.689> there's<00:05:08.840> no<00:05:09.050> actual<00:05:09.830> footpegs<00:05:10.490> or

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
because there's no actual footpegs or

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:12.670 
because there's no actual footpegs or
anything<00:05:10.819> on<00:05:11.030> here<00:05:11.210> so<00:05:11.930> he<00:05:12.199> just<00:05:12.349> kind<00:05:12.530> of<00:05:12.590> got

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
anything on here so he just kind of got

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.909 
anything on here so he just kind of got
a<00:05:12.740> problem<00:05:13.219> against<00:05:13.580> the<00:05:13.729> branches<00:05:14.120> I<00:05:14.270> guess

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
a problem against the branches I guess

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.080 
a problem against the branches I guess
kind<00:05:15.919> of<00:05:15.949> get<00:05:16.069> him<00:05:16.159> standing<00:05:16.490> up<00:05:16.580> I<00:05:16.759> think<00:05:17.000> is

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
kind of get him standing up I think is

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.570 
kind of get him standing up I think is
more<00:05:17.240> that's<00:05:17.449> the<00:05:17.740> idea<00:05:18.740> they<00:05:18.889> were<00:05:18.949> going<00:05:19.219> for

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
more that's the idea they were going for

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.719 
more that's the idea they were going for
I<00:05:19.990> should<00:05:20.990> also<00:05:21.110> point<00:05:21.259> out<00:05:21.530> he<00:05:21.710> does<00:05:22.280> also
