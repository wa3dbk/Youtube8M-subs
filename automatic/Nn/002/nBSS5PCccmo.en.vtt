00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.300
 History should remind us why 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.210
 We are fighting 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:50.320
 Well, if the pact wants to eliminate this 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:53.200
 part of my story for me the law 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.170
 Better her than we ask Him to 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.890
 education when they see you for sure 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.890

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.970
 He opened his chest and turned the 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.110
 guts 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.330

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.069
 it's been an Allied fire accident or something 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.159
 A) Yes 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.950
 that there are sergeants looks like a patrol 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:11.730
 of the covenant elite units all 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.950
 dead precious 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.950
 a friend known 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.930
 well let's open this door stop following 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:35.010
 but it seems that the pact has strived 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.010
 by blocking it do it and son yes sir 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.930
 and 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.610
 to 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:09.790
 this gives me a bad spine 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.790
 boy to you everything gives you bad spine 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.700
 what happens, soldier, we have 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.350
 we do not see it 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.070
 given perceived change 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.920
 mendoza from where the second platoon and 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:36.890
 find out what the hell but do not answer me 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.890
 soldier but listen 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:44.749
 what is that where all the 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:44.749
 parts do not know there are look 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.960
 but not for them 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.949
 surrounded 

00:04:59.359 --> 00:05:05.599
 shoot since they are from the stones 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.599
 marines elections 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.250
 Hello 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:39.180
 Greetings, I am the monitor of the installation 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:41.800
 04 guilty spark 343 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.590
 they have released the flower 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:51.030
 my function is to prevent him from leaving here 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:51.030
 but I need your help, let's go here 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.490
 efe 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.990
 let's pick up the index before activating the 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.990
 installation 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.419
 the energy barrier that surrounds the 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:46.259
 index will be deactivated when we get 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:46.259
 to the floor below 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.460
 now you can take out the index 

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.410
 the protocol demands that I deal with the 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.780
 Index if you are vulnerable to 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.850
 infection the index should not fall 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:30.560
 hands of the flower before we see 

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.560
 the installation from the control room 

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.480
 and the city spread quickly
