00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.830 
effect is kind of lost when you twist
this<00:02:15.400> because<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.180> get<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.330> bit<00:02:16.510> more<00:02:16.660> of<00:02:16.720> an

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
this because you get a bit more of an

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.250 
this because you get a bit more of an
edge<00:02:17.020> there<00:02:17.319> but<00:02:18.190> I<00:02:18.550> am<00:02:19.060> really<00:02:19.569> loving<00:02:19.959> the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
edge there but I am really loving the

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.520 
edge there but I am really loving the
way<00:02:20.380> they<00:02:20.590> pulled<00:02:20.800> this<00:02:20.920> guy<00:02:21.130> off<00:02:22.349> he's<00:02:23.349> of

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
way they pulled this guy off he's of

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.290 
way they pulled this guy off he's of
course<00:02:23.560> got<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.130> double<00:02:24.489> jointed<00:02:24.760> elbows<00:02:24.880> the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
course got the double jointed elbows the

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.839 
course got the double jointed elbows the
triple-jointed<00:02:25.750> wrist<00:02:26.260> he's<00:02:26.470> got<00:02:26.680> in<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.670> way

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
triple-jointed wrist he's got in a way

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.520 
triple-jointed wrist he's got in a way
better<00:02:28.060> example<00:02:28.780> of<00:02:28.840> this<00:02:28.900> actually<00:02:29.319> this<00:02:29.409> has

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
better example of this actually this has

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.869 
better example of this actually this has
been<00:02:29.680> improved<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.159> think<00:02:30.370> since<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.730> last

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
been improved I think since the last

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.059 
been improved I think since the last
couple<00:02:31.180> I<00:02:31.239> messed<00:02:31.450> with<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:32.140> leg<00:02:32.620> joints

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
couple I messed with the leg joints

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.119 
couple I messed with the leg joints
where<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:33.670> can<00:02:33.790> actually<00:02:34.150> pull<00:02:34.510> the

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
where you can actually pull the

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.039 
where you can actually pull the
down<00:02:36.129> so<00:02:37.060> you<00:02:37.150> can<00:02:37.299> move<00:02:37.420> this<00:02:37.599> more<00:02:37.870> out<00:02:38.019> to

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
down so you can move this more out to

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.289 
down so you can move this more out to
the<00:02:38.290> side<00:02:38.500> or<00:02:38.799> up<00:02:39.010> or<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.609> like<00:02:39.790> it's<00:02:40.090> that's

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
the side or up or the like it's that's

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.920 
the side or up or the like it's that's
just<00:02:40.569> such<00:02:40.719> a<00:02:40.750> genius<00:02:41.109> joint<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:41.879> I'm<00:02:42.930> again

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
just such a genius joint and I'm again

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.470 
just such a genius joint and I'm again
just<00:02:44.290> astounded<00:02:45.099> by<00:02:45.280> how<00:02:45.489> high<00:02:45.939> the<00:02:46.000> level<00:02:46.239> of

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
just astounded by how high the level of

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.970 
just astounded by how high the level of
quality<00:02:46.870> is<00:02:46.959> on<00:02:47.109> the<00:02:47.200> paint<00:02:47.439> of<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.650> sculpt

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
quality is on the paint of the sculpt

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.119 
quality is on the paint of the sculpt
and<00:02:48.159> the<00:02:48.310> jointing<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:48.879> it<00:02:49.420> feels<00:02:49.870> durable<00:02:50.769> it

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
and the jointing and it feels durable it

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.690 
and the jointing and it feels durable it

fig arts another a Guiteau are that he's

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.080 
fig arts another a Guiteau are that he's
a<00:06:29.800> little<00:06:29.889> bit<00:06:30.040> more<00:06:30.250> expensive<00:06:30.580> since<00:06:30.970> his

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.330 
entire body is a unique sculpt and he
also<00:06:34.030> contains<00:06:34.510> no<00:06:35.110> metal<00:06:35.590> that<00:06:35.740> I'm<00:06:35.860> aware<00:06:36.130> of

this<00:06:36.580> makes<00:06:36.790> him<00:06:36.880> a<00:06:36.970> bit<00:06:37.120> lighter<00:06:37.389> than<00:06:37.660> most

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 
this makes him a bit lighter than most

this makes him a bit lighter than most
fig<00:06:38.110> arts<00:06:38.350> but<00:06:38.590> honestly<00:06:39.250> I<00:06:39.340> think<00:06:39.430> that<00:06:39.700> kind

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
fig arts but honestly I think that kind

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.640 
fig arts but honestly I think that kind
of<00:06:39.910> helps<00:06:40.060> that<00:06:40.600> and<00:06:40.780> I<00:06:40.810> don't<00:06:40.870> think<00:06:41.020> any<00:06:41.260> real

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:41.650 
of helps that and I don't think any real

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.230 
of helps that and I don't think any real
substantial<00:06:41.950> metal<00:06:42.550> would<00:06:42.730> have<00:06:42.820> suited<00:06:43.030> him

substantial metal would have suited him

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.060 
substantial metal would have suited him
that<00:06:43.419> well<00:06:43.600> outside<00:06:43.990> and<00:06:44.110> maybe<00:06:44.230> his<00:06:44.440> belt<00:06:44.770> and

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.070 
that well outside and maybe his belt and

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.909 
that well outside and maybe his belt and
his<00:06:45.220> bracelets<00:06:46.030> and<00:06:46.150> anklets<00:06:46.770> overall<00:06:47.770> though
