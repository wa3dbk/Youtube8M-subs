00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:06.950
 today a small unpacking including ten 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.120
 under a wireless charger so how 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.250
 it's really simply 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.250
 it's a charger that you plug into 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:17.779
 your cable from your phone so the 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:20.930
 galaxy ace 6 capture plus charger 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.850
 wall area because it's not 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.550
 provided you take your phone via 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.810
 the exercise you ask it is all 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.449
 just here but in charge 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.519
 here it is great not a big dog 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.030
 that he has every time it takes off the 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:37.640
 load good here is the white the black is 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.370
 party then unpacked on the press 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.220
 actually have not much on the 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.100
 right side to the left and absolutely beats 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.450
 nothing on the back so I try to 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.660
 make a nice focus I'm in 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:54.590
 filming with my ipad r I hope 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:01:00.530
 that it will be good here we go 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:04.159
 unpacked one finds directly in fact 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:08.120
 there is not much of small 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.520
 explanations just right there what 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.210
 find it right there we actually did not 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.900
 great thing to send you have kit from 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.580
 start a little thick and you have 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.080
 your station with a little movie 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.200
 plastic that explain you well 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.200
 how to put it 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.080
 tell me in the comments 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:35.140
 possibly which ones if 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.220
 it's a black or a white go 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:43.780
 a quick ride anyway it's 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:45.130
 quite simple the model so the microusb 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.840
 2.0 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.820
 the wiring obviously that is not 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.150
 provided what is this color 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:56.260
 of art is the same as no samsung is 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.150
 well like that the camera looks but 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.380
 not at all this one much darker 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.479
 it is not such a treaty is 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.070
 really nothing to do but it makes me 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.390
 still clearly that's how much 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.140
 obviously the parents so I have unfit 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:12.070
 to light up but that's it for this 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.140
 quick ride of these chargers without 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.770
 thread that really make pretty design pretty 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:22.530
 small a very small very small by 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.530
 compared to galaxy this problem
