00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 elio the gums justice i hope that 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.890
 to go all very well but in all 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.450
 case of the form we end up 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.030
 today for episode number 2 of 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.360
 Soda Cycling Intensive Man Of The 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.700
 match 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.740
 ramesh rodriguez guys and like you 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.690
 can always see it the same 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.779
 technical and as you can see 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.150
 also in the title some problems 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.890
 so so for the moment a wave 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.390
 like all the others here I have 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.640
 tried to use two particular players 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.140
 a cup and then I was pretty happy 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.029
 since he left I managed to nab 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.969
 for not too expensive sentinel so 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.989
 so I was pretty happy so 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.120
 now i will explain to you the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.469
 problem guys is that at the end of 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.570
 the video you're going to see he's going to me 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.050
 stay four players in madam api 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.329
 exchange 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.280
 and it's still the players who 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.350
 walk about the best with this 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.460
 technical problem is that these 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.449
 players they leave not that is to say 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.879
 that in five days I revived at least 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.649
 ten times each day 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.440
 impossible to send one of these 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.730
 four players it's just amazing 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.949
 and then I can tell you that when you 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.600
 take the trouble ten times a day 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.409
 to go raise and that has nothing that leaves 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.900
 it 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.060
 how to say that it breaks me 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.520
 lightly the balls I will say it and 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.750
 not this more seriously this is what is 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.670
 really the effect that it does that because 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.049
 that it's super annoying because I 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.409
 only turns on this technique 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.490
 in this episode and in the rhodes everything 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.900
 recent find them without forgiveness and 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.979
 and that's pretty annoying because 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.970
 here I am doing more the technique of 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.000
 changes of position because of 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.689
 monopolies and all that and so that's it 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.310
 pretty annoying 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:37.130
 so after I was offered on 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.960
 iron twitter actually the technique 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.610
 of the plane which actually consists of 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.229
 take a player and the town and 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.869
 kÃ©nitra 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.369
 I was told it was working with 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.799
 players who were dry at last I 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.710
 know that a subscriber explained to me that this is 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.810
 to say he took to a student who 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.580
 had his map his green card in the 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.409
 stern of the world I believe and he had it 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.179
 bought 70 miles credit a sum he 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.950
 resold 10 or 15 minutes credits more 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.270
 just by stuffing it with contract so 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.030
 it's still pretty incredible 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.470
 so I do not know if it works 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.049
 in the comments I can I can 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.600
 try on my account to the limit see 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.769
 what it may possibly give but 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.540
 that's very annoying because 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.780
 this is my channel turns on buying 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.550
 resale and it works it works 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.130
 not for me it's pretty annoying and 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.630
 and so here I also wanted to tell you 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.010
 than 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.260
 that I was going on vacation 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.700
 this week so here I make you the 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.960
 commented laughed at the short nose in is one is 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.460
 Friday so I'm going to try the 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.020
 go out either immediately Monday at the beginning 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.400
 week 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.020
 I think that's what I'm going to do 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.720
 so what would I have wanted 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.370
 during these during these few days 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.830
 these voices there you give me a maximum 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.150
 of ideas for the future because I am 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.240
 not you but me it is trying to 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.130
 gorging a little fifa right now I 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.550
 have to admit that I wanted to 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.380
 waiting for this mini break if we can 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.840
 to say like that I made myself a little 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.230
 team but then just too much 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.600
 this is amazing 1 5 2 1 2 so I 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.400
 can you already hear you that's ya 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.350
 enough to go crazy but hey gf 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.970
 listen guys have bought the mans on 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.520
 this game that it's good 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.920
 also to rage others because 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.830
 how good it is nice to score 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.510
 nice goals and all that but there you go 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.160
 well, we're not going to spread the word 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.840
 about here are some people who want 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.710
 score nice goals so not so 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.150
 here we fight the balls a little 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.220
 little as you can see 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.440
 here are the four players taking part not 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.690
 so here you propose me a maximum 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.730
 of ideas guys for the future 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.170
 and to you in the comments of 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.880
 and here are the ideas that you 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.140
 seem the most relevant and 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.480
 and that's the story we're doing something 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.760
 pretty cool on my return from vacation and 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.560
