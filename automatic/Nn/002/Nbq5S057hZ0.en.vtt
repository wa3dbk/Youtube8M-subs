a<00:03:47.220> little<00:03:47.610> offer<00:03:47.760> in<00:03:48.000> that<00:03:48.180> aspect<00:03:48.650> but<00:03:49.650> of

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
a little offer in that aspect but of

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.190 
a little offer in that aspect but of
course<00:03:49.920> this<00:03:50.580> won't<00:03:50.940> be<00:03:51.090> so<00:03:51.240> flawed<00:03:51.570> well

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
course this won't be so flawed well

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.110 
course this won't be so flawed well
actually<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:53.010> will<00:03:53.160> take<00:03:53.400> some<00:03:53.610> time<00:03:53.670> before

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
actually it will take some time before

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.210 
actually it will take some time before
there<00:03:54.570> will<00:03:54.630> be<00:03:54.810> an<00:03:54.960> obvious<00:03:55.260> change<00:03:55.920> in<00:03:56.100> the

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
there will be an obvious change in the

there will be an obvious change in the
center<00:03:56.580> but<00:03:56.790> White's<00:03:57.480> overwhelming<00:03:58.320> force

center but White's overwhelming force

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.350 
center but White's overwhelming force
there<00:03:59.040> won't<00:03:59.550> give<00:03:59.820> him<00:03:59.940> much<00:04:00.120> of<00:04:00.150> an

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
there won't give him much of an

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.110 
there won't give him much of an
advantage<00:04:01.100> but<00:04:02.100> with<00:04:02.370> that<00:04:02.400> I'll<00:04:02.760> have<00:04:02.970> to

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
advantage but with that I'll have to

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.610
