was<00:02:21.329> not<00:02:21.629> feeling<00:02:22.469> the<00:02:23.159> current<00:02:23.549> state<00:02:23.849> of

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
was not feeling the current state of

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.490 
was not feeling the current state of
things<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.480> something<00:02:24.750> had<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.959> change<00:02:24.989> and<00:02:25.439> I

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
things and something had to change and I

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.440 
things and something had to change and I
realize<00:02:25.799> because<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:27.090> know<00:02:27.180> there's<00:02:27.359> certain

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
realize because you know there's certain

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.089 
realize because you know there's certain
dynamics<00:02:27.989> that<00:02:28.019> it<00:02:28.170> can't<00:02:28.379> change<00:02:28.650> like<00:02:28.950> we're

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
dynamics that it can't change like we're

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.440 
dynamics that it can't change like we're
living<00:02:29.219> with<00:02:29.400> our<00:02:29.430> in-laws<00:02:29.670> at<00:02:29.969> the<00:02:30.060> moment

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
living with our in-laws at the moment

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.289 
living with our in-laws at the moment
and<00:02:30.569> I<00:02:31.230> can't<00:02:31.590> really<00:02:32.099> control<00:02:32.280> all<00:02:32.879> the<00:02:32.909> types

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
and I can't really control all the types

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:34.490 
and I can't really control all the types
of<00:02:33.420> food<00:02:33.599> in<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.810> house<00:02:33.959> because<00:02:34.139> there's<00:02:34.379> so

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
of food in the house because there's so

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.470 
of food in the house because there's so
many<00:02:34.620> people<00:02:35.010> in<00:02:35.129> the<00:02:35.219> house<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.639> like<00:02:35.819> can't

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
many people in the house and like can't

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.240 
many people in the house and like can't
control<00:02:36.750> all<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:37.139> so<00:02:37.620> it's<00:02:37.739> just<00:02:37.799> like<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:37.980> few

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
control all that so it's just like a few

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.009 
control all that so it's just like a few
factors<00:02:38.670> where<00:02:38.819> I<00:02:38.849> was<00:02:39.000> like<00:02:39.180> this<00:02:39.599> is<00:02:39.659> going

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
factors where I was like this is going

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.530 
factors where I was like this is going
to<00:02:40.139> be<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.290> little<00:02:40.500> bit<00:02:40.620> harder<00:02:41.189> than<00:02:41.909> it<00:02:41.939> was<00:02:42.299> to

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
to be a little bit harder than it was to

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.699 
to be a little bit harder than it was to
lose<00:02:42.719> the<00:02:42.870> baby<00:02:42.959> weight<00:02:43.109> with<00:02:43.349> my<00:02:43.469> daughter

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
lose the baby weight with my daughter

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.550 
lose the baby weight with my daughter
with<00:02:43.859> my<00:02:43.950> daughter<00:02:44.129> just<00:02:44.340> kind<00:02:44.579> of<00:02:44.639> fell<00:02:44.909> off

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
with my daughter just kind of fell off

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.349 
with my daughter just kind of fell off
life<00:02:46.560> was<00:02:46.769> pretty<00:02:46.919> normal<00:02:47.069> and<00:02:47.639> stable<00:02:47.819> so<00:02:48.299> I

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
life was pretty normal and stable so I

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.000 
life was pretty normal and stable so I
didn't<00:02:48.540> have<00:02:48.629> any<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:48.840> these<00:02:48.900> extra<00:02:49.470> issues

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
didn't have any of these extra issues

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.640 
didn't have any of these extra issues
