00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.530 
probably not so much these because it's
the<00:02:26.880> meat<00:02:27.150> pjs<00:02:27.900> but<00:02:28.740> definitely<00:02:29.310> like<00:02:29.700> these

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
the meat pjs but definitely like these

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.300 
the meat pjs but definitely like these
and<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.110> Christmas<00:02:31.530> dress<00:02:31.710> always<00:02:31.980> seemed<00:02:32.280> to

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
and the Christmas dress always seemed to

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.590 
and the Christmas dress always seemed to
sell<00:02:32.580> out<00:02:32.730> before<00:02:32.880> Christmas<00:02:33.620> so<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:35.600> would

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
sell out before Christmas so I would

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.300 
sell out before Christmas so I would
definitely<00:02:36.630> recommend<00:02:37.050> if<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.830> want<00:02:38.100> any
