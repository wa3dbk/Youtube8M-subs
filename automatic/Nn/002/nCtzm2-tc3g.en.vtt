00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
wallpaper now do keep in consideration
that<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.740> higher<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.520> go<00:01:38.549> up<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:39.150> list<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
that the higher you go up this list the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.450 
that the higher you go up this list the
more<00:01:40.409> it's<00:01:40.619> probably<00:01:40.950> going<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.159> drain<00:01:41.340> your

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
more it's probably going to drain your

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.020 
more it's probably going to drain your
battery<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.350> let's<00:01:43.350> let<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.590> back<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.890> 30<00:01:44.189> it's

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
battery so let's let you back to 30 it's

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.179 
battery so let's let you back to 30 it's
at<00:01:45.270> 45<00:01:45.810> by<00:01:45.990> default<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.560> we'll<00:01:46.710> see<00:01:46.829> what<00:01:46.920> 30

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
at 45 by default but we'll see what 30

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.609 
at 45 by default but we'll see what 30
looks<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:48.750> also<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:49.140> raining

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
looks like and you can also have raining

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.679 
looks like and you can also have raining
mode<00:01:49.799> now<00:01:50.430> training<00:01:50.850> mode<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.210> really<00:01:51.540> cool

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
mode now training mode is really cool

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.389 
mode now training mode is really cool
because<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.140> basically<00:01:52.229> will<00:01:52.680> give<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.009> aqua

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
because it basically will give the aqua

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.399 
because it basically will give the aqua
effect<00:01:53.670> as<00:01:53.820> if<00:01:53.850> there<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.750> rain<00:01:55.110> drops

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
effect as if there is rain drops

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.109 
effect as if there is rain drops
dripping<00:01:55.860> onto<00:01:56.009> your<00:01:56.280> wallpaper<00:01:56.670> which<00:01:56.969> is

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
dripping onto your wallpaper which is

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.030 
dripping onto your wallpaper which is
really<00:01:57.329> cool<00:01:57.540> looking<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.409> can<00:01:58.560> change<00:01:58.829> the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
really cool looking you can change the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.609 
really cool looking you can change the
frequency<00:01:59.549> from<00:01:59.790> low<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.390> normal<00:02:01.170> too<00:02:01.320> fast

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
frequency from low to normal too fast

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.080 
frequency from low to normal too fast
we'll<00:02:01.920> switch<00:02:02.070> at<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.219> fast<00:02:02.549> see<00:02:02.909> what<00:02:03.000> that

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
we'll switch at the fast see what that

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.420 
we'll switch at the fast see what that
looks<00:02:03.149> like<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:04.380> then<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:05.040> also<00:02:05.159> have<00:02:05.399> it

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
looks like and then you can also have it

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.910 
looks like and then you can also have it
so<00:02:05.610> let<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.880> rain<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.600> allows<00:02:06.930> your<00:02:07.290> touches

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
so let the rain this allows your touches

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.889 
so let the rain this allows your touches
basically<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.000> makes<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:09.390> anywhere<00:02:09.840> you

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
basically it makes it so anywhere you

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.180 
basically it makes it so anywhere you
touch<00:02:10.170> you're<00:02:10.410> not<00:02:10.530> going<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.739> have<00:02:10.860> that

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
touch you're not going to have that

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.980 
touch you're not going to have that
fact<00:02:11.370> it's<00:02:11.940> basically<00:02:12.360> just<00:02:12.480> going<00:02:12.810> off<00:02:12.930> of

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
fact it's basically just going off of

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.830 
fact it's basically just going off of
the<00:02:13.320> raindrops<00:02:14.100> so<00:02:14.790> will<00:02:14.910> also<00:02:15.090> enable<00:02:15.510> that

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
the raindrops so will also enable that

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.840 
the raindrops so will also enable that
and<00:02:16.050> then<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.740> do<00:02:16.860> have<00:02:16.890> splash<00:02:17.520> on<00:02:17.820> a

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
and then you do have splash on a

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.520 
and then you do have splash on a
respring<00:02:18.390> which<00:02:18.570> is<00:02:18.720> pretty<00:02:18.900> cool<00:02:19.140> looking<00:02:19.290> I

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
respring which is pretty cool looking I

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.070 
respring which is pretty cool looking I
can't<00:02:19.770> really<00:02:19.980> show<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.220> guys<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.460> on<00:02:20.790> video

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
can't really show you guys that on video

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.140 
can't really show you guys that on video

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
and then we have the reset lock timer

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.850 
and then we have the reset lock timer
there's<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.900> little<00:02:25.080> description<00:02:25.500> at<00:02:25.740> the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
there's a little description at the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.490 
there's a little description at the

bottom below reset lock timer if you

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.870 
bottom below reset lock timer if you
guys<00:02:28.620> want<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.920> know<00:02:29.010> exactly<00:02:29.130> what<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:29.640> is

but<00:02:30.420> that's<00:02:30.660> pretty<00:02:30.840> much<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.050> for<00:02:31.170> the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
but that's pretty much it for the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.740 
but that's pretty much it for the
settings<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.740> really<00:02:31.980> basic<00:02:32.250> tweak<00:02:32.790> but<00:02:33.630> it's

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
settings a really basic tweak but it's

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.270 
settings a really basic tweak but it's
really<00:02:34.020> awesome<00:02:34.290> looking<00:02:34.680> like<00:02:34.920> look<00:02:35.160> how

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
really awesome looking like look how

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.150 
really awesome looking like look how
insane<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:36.000> looks<00:02:36.320> that<00:02:37.320> is<00:02:37.590> just<00:02:37.890> simply

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
insane this looks that is just simply

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.380 
insane this looks that is just simply
cool<00:02:38.400> looking<00:02:38.700> let's<00:02:38.880> take<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.060> look<00:02:39.240> at<00:02:39.270> the

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
cool looking let's take a look at the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.870 
cool looking let's take a look at the
lock<00:02:39.570> screen<00:02:39.720> here<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.430> think<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.550> that<00:02:41.700> is

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
lock screen here I think that that is

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.150 
lock screen here I think that that is
pretty<00:02:42.360> damn<00:02:42.720> awesome<00:02:42.990> looking<00:02:43.590> it's

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
pretty damn awesome looking it's

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.920 
pretty damn awesome looking it's
literally<00:02:44.610> like<00:02:44.790> it's<00:02:45.060> just<00:02:45.270> raining<00:02:45.600> all

literally like it's just raining all
over<00:02:45.960> your<00:02:46.290> wallpaper<00:02:46.710> and<00:02:47.040> this<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.850> at<00:02:48.000> 30

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
over your wallpaper and this is at 30

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.360 
over your wallpaper and this is at 30
frames<00:02:48.420> per<00:02:48.630> second<00:02:49.140> keep<00:02:49.260> in<00:02:49.380> mind<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:49.830> we

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
frames per second keep in mind so we

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.070 
frames per second keep in mind so we
could<00:02:50.550> bump<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:50.970> back<00:02:51.150> up<00:02:51.330> there<00:02:51.510> like<00:02:51.660> 60

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
could bump that back up there like 60

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.540 
could bump that back up there like 60
frames<00:02:52.320> per<00:02:52.410> second<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.070> will<00:02:53.160> look<00:02:53.340> even

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
frames per second and it will look even

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.850 
frames per second and it will look even
more<00:02:53.850> incredible<00:02:54.260> but<00:02:55.260> that's<00:02:55.440> pretty<00:02:55.680> much
