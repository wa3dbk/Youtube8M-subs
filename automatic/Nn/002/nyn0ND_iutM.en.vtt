00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
 let's draw eyes now 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.700
 Create a new skills folder in which we will 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.700
 put all our our so-called 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:12.549
 open folder with recent new layer 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.609
 I take base potash 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.859
 and white colors to customer 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.859
 n region and such classes 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:26.349
 and now you will see why 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:27.970
 so here neatly not 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.309
 in a hurry will remain stamped more and more 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:33.309
 less even 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.470
 instead of basil yeast again you can 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.470
 use percentage any other 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.040
 favorite tool 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.740
 the result is less or less satisfied 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.980
 Now 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.620
 The judge news also May cocktail prevented to 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.340
 on the picture from the first layer 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.910
 here we have someone for half an hour 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.020
 now we take basel we take further soft 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.080
 and here is the whole color of life shook the shadows of copies 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.260
 media according to this contributes 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
 volume creation 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.450
 But this desire can be appreciated 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.410
 put but it is already 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.410
 depends as they say from work 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.860
 so crutch new layer 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.870
 here I already choose the main color 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.980
 class I want to lead with glasses 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.980
 Otto under painting letters class kareem 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.910
 now new layer 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.100
 and do and the news he defended under the black 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.410
 how painting over did not see the day only 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.710
 defined in participation 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.590
 take a tour 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.380
 we understand what to read fergie grief 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.060
 choosing the appropriate size 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.060
 and lightly smeared 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.500
 potaps 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.950
 new layer 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.100
 take the bright color of Moses right-handed 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.090
 and make such vandals big 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.400
 Brest 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.330
 I take ua orange not rain and take yellow 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.730
 blue what you like 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.779
 again depends on your work 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:16.869
 Little 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.839
 a little smear 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:21.839
 so now new layer 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:26.669
 the most important thing that will give us 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:29.089
 do children 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:31.149
 you can give them glare principle 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:33.679
 to put already and so she is no longer a mistake 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.489
 but that's not all I take was fired again 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.489
 hard and slightly smeared edges 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:45.079
 and that's what we got 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.589
 matovniki 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:49.589
 the lie of the day is that 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:53.339
 so magnified 

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:58.899
 So 

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:03.099
 caviar leader tit look many 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.079
 parties 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.079
 etc 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:10.309
 so I find a layer with shadows by the way each 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:12.589
 worth too can just be called u 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:15.809
 I don't have time to play with them 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:18.169
 I want a lot of losses because I donâ€™t 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:21.169
 like 

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:28.849
 and our eyes got sick
