00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.170
 with his final husband 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.770
 prof 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.770
 the future 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.890
 in recent years there are in 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:22.079
 germany will rise in standards 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.599
 insanely interesting winemakers the 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:27.419
 to tie back to craftsmanship 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.879
 The techniques often also ecological 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:37.170
 work 

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:39.449
 and so slowly the big yard again 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.400
 a celebrity of the wines around 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.340
 1900 century plus / minus ten 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.750
 Years and then come so small 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.050
 shops league guide you 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.410
 then come the craftsmanship 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.960
 work and have smaller productions 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.649
 So somewhere between 10 and 20 hectares 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:05.899
 work comes to the train that can 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:07.950
 qualities taste complexities 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.040
 work of which we have no 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.000
 Presentation make the German 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.310
 We care about that the most 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.280
 probably all the daddy there 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.920
 first but interested by Freescale 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.310
 the most interesting grape for 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.270
 Central European climate zones happen 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.270
 the most exciting thing 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:38.460
 contact no hurdle for domestic use 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:46.420
 Have you ever grown big 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:50.229
 Tried it said a bit 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.700
 The greetings of the Germans know more exactly 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:57.700
 do not recommend wine culture and then 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.810
 I would like something quite as usual 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.810
 great been experiencing 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:12.310
 the thing is clemens buses middle Mosel 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.069
 york that's for sure one of ours 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.349
 favorite island with that has one 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.019
 bit our riesling passion 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:23.560
 four years ago by climax bush 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:25.780
 certainly one of the pioneers for the 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.349
 resume artisanal tradition 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.450
 landsmen methods spontaneous fermentation 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:35.660
 in this case also ecological 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.020
 Certified to have crops storm 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.990
 that's easy 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.650
 plastic quality wonderfully insane 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:49.890
 stronger cuts creamier 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:54.230
 riesling beach chair with left 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.680
 rose plants are there 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:01.849
 called chimeric fruit flavors 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:04.340
 that's why this desire and juice 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.220
 or if the paragraph on the way to 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.450
 Rhine is one would say the most 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.830
 contain 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.239
 so-called fructose included 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.989
 primary ideas and those in the 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:17.180
 Appeal always with the fruits 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.110
 Be identified when we are at risk 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.210
 speak then you think more about it 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.970
 bright and green red-white 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.410
 rust 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.880
 we are all really playing too 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:34.030
 actually tastes apricots after 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:38.140
 itself tastes like depending on 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:43.420
 removal mature exotic 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:46.090
 Fruits like mango also have a number 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.480
 of aromas various of citrus fruits 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.800
 confess 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.800
 I am a lemon 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.070
 but next to that the whole dance 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:08.530
 vegetables so my want green stuff 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:11.030
 high sign second complex around then 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.550
 something with the chemical problem 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.680
 to do so during fermentation 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.810
 the conversion of a part of the fruit to 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:24.910
 let through in alcohol 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:27.970
 But products are created for this 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.289
 means more to get around fruit 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.920
 grades 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:35.530
 also morten the 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.580
 something to do with the soil texture 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.320
 but then have clear then then 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.870
 unfold and her choice not to demanding 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.439
 are hardly felt 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.639
 usually people 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:54.719
 that really is in the metaphor and now 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:58.689
 a supreme term mineral listing 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:05:00.689
 just tastes as being on the sound 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:03.969
 candidates remind the poor 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:06.020
 damp and rocks 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:08.110
 to ski 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.210
 Location 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.419
 and then you still make a difference 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.569
 Partially around and then raised the 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:20.030
 but also includes in the bottle 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:21.860
 the bottle in the middle said that 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.259
 is also important throughout the century 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.800
 not just about food too 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:29.020
 a special trip would have been in the 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.590
 run 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:35.500
 a few months and could be there too 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.259
 in a few years, then in the 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.539
 Develop a bottle that is one 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:43.750
 chemical interaction and natural 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:47.310
 of alcohol of fructose of 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:50.379
 trapped air oxygen if the 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.629
 Bottles closed with natural corks 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:55.360
 are also playing a certain amount 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:57.300
 permeability in the very discreet 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.599
 permeability of the token a role 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:03.789
 for the mature and that are now 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:06.340
 still others are why me so 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:12.340
 so to speak, three decisions one 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:15.460
 commonly does with one 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:21.690
 business partner raw material ghost train 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:26.639
 which recently opened to him where we are 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:31.270
 want to focus on three classic 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:33.789
 parade wines sort of campaign 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:37.210
 most famous sparkling wine drinks world man 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:38.110
 This is how noble sweet specialties want to turn 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.310
 there is something in particular 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:45.599
 Central European area of ​​course in 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:48.380
 germany interesting exciting 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:50.630
 qualities of 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:54.650
 read complaints trigger as a fan 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:55.940
 is Trockenbeerenauslese and third 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.890
 just the big plants of the 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:01.720
 people have spoken the dry 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.720
 developed top qualities
