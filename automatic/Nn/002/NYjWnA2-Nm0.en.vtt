00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 welcome to another video friends today jay 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.549
 pokemon lice and today they 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.870
 I bring another small video here to the channel 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.450
 of pokémon world information 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.370
 mysterious is that today makes 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.740
 and several hours since a small 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.690
 trailer with some new images by 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.460
 so to say and as you know that always 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.439
 I'm absolutely aware of everything 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.090
 what happens then well I decided to have them 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.160
 this video because I bring you a little 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.590
 news which I think a lot of 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.140
 people will be very excited to know 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.689
 about this game so good if not 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.850
 they showed as many images as such 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.829
 It was a trailer with several images of 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.809
 which we had previously seen in 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.300
 the first trailer shown already 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.280
 several days but with a different image 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.950
 new which is surprising enough 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.629
 first of all an image that can 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.270
 that surprises us so much but is a 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.340
 image as of a praza going to 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.289
 different points as if it were some 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.270
 mission something like that remember that 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.770
 when we are in one we go to some 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.870
 mission so we'll have to go to some 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.500
 dungeon and it seems that now they will do it with 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.420
 a better way because according to me 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.430
 I imagine I 'm not totally sure 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.870
 that the plast is the illusion like that 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.030
 Sun goes in zone arriving 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.490
 to the dungeon where we have to go 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.530
 to fulfill the mission then in another image 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.000
 that I am going to show you but also 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.770
 they know that bringing is down here in the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.660
 description if you want to check 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.100
 first hand in our image 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.010
 we can see that we are reaching the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.420
 city we are this picacho and print blog and 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.950
 we are coming to a city where 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.020
 is this military in this image 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.330
 I really only put it because there 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.740
 in the background you can see a very small 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.110
 I think and remember that it is very pokemon 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.360
 preferred now yes we go to the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.550
 truly rich information so 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.860
 say it of this video and in which I am 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.460
 sure that it will make illusion to almost all 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.620
 here, well, it looks like I'm almost 100% 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.470
 sure of that the test 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.880
 personality returns that is this test of 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.920
 personality for those who have played the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.810
 first games as good if not me 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.340
 wrong in the latest games for 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.020
 select your character all 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.390
 depending on a small roulette wheel which 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.580
 I rotated and you then select the 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.460
 pokemon and it was almost random as it rotated 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.320
 quite slow and it really was a bit 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.229
 boring to be honest because in the 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.180
 first games of this saga made you 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.500
 a series of questions and depending on 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.600
 the answers that you gave 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.310
 I could touch you a Pokémon completely 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.740
 different a pokémon totally 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.810
 random depending on the answers 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.660
 that you were giving for example if you 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.470
 you will win the lottery what would you do with it or 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.910
 spend it on you just give it to 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.160
 someone who needed that kind of 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.990
 questions were there and it depends on your 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.180
 answers as well was the pokemon that 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.310
 I played yesterday something quite father already 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.170
 that really if they gave you a pokémon 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.320
 because they were apart a description of 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.330
 the person that you were and really yes 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.930
 that was right to the description friend 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.610
 to be honest yes that was right so 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.239
 this is the news so to speak 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.970
 main because the test of this returns 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.950
 come back to find out what pokemon can 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.720
 be with this test so I think that to 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.000
 everyone will be excited because 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.860
 almost nobody liked the roulette we are going to 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.780
 the following images that is a 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.760
 small image of picacho and periplo therefore 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.739
 seeing the city that is not so 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.810
 relevant to be honest but it's new 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.430
 we had never seen the image 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.530
 next yes it is a little bit more 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.180
 interesting since we can see that 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.490
 while we are walking through the 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.700
 dungeons can appear completely 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.410
 random, then some small traps that 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.510
 they can vary us or they can 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.310
 teleport to a pokemon obviously 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.840
 not to the whole team to a part 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.250
 completely different and they are 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.310
 hidden so this can be 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.900
 Pretty troll but at the same time quite 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.480
 fun or stressful depending on 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.830
 how complicated is the emission already in 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.420
 the next image that I have to 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.110
 show that yes it is quite relevant 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.510
 then we can see an image as 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.830
 some pokemon and bone this image is going 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.000
 advancing why I tell them that they have 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.590
 what to see the video 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.330
 this image is advancing and is showing 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.920
 to several pokemon the safest thing is that 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.710
 be a pokemon which we have sighted 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.110
 and pokemon quite possibly to which 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.840
 we have recruited because then for those who 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.450
 do not know the 720 pokemon will appear 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.880
 inside this game so we can 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.130
 see them could appear and the safest 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.260
 is to resort to recruiting those who leave 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.210
 joining some kind of pokédex or something by 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.130
 the style where we know that it is already 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.440
 we have sighted or something like that 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.090
 we can also see images of all 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.560
 the legendary but really this already 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.050
 we saw it so it's not that relevant 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.920
 but we also see images for example 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.600
 of this art 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.640
 it's going to be very interesting in the 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.990
 archery mission we can also see 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.660
 an image of the three dogs 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.220
 legendary together as throwing themselves to the 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.440
 attack there will be a mission we will have to 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.900
 fight against them or they will be of our 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.790
 side I do not know and finally the last 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.010
 image is an image where we are 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.290
 pikachu print flow and some pokemon more 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.510
 behind us and you can see the 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.670
 shadow of a giant and it was tub that 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.470
 Most likely, it will be a pokemon with 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.420
 which we will have to fight but 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.340
 moment were all the images that 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.190
 were shown in this second trailer 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.550
 really test 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:04.340
 of this the test was really the only thing 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.690
 interesting about all this friends but 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.220
 good whatever it is all for the video of 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.750
 today that I hope you have 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.240
 They liked it a lot, they say that if they liked it 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.310
 thank you infinitely a little hand
