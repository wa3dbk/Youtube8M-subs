but if you remember there's something

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.509 
but if you remember there's something
slightly<00:02:36.540> different<00:02:37.019> here<00:02:37.069> about<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.400> way

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
slightly different here about the way

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.580 
slightly different here about the way
that<00:02:38.700> they<00:02:38.790> play<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.090> in<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.269> song<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.780> what

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
that they play it in the song and what

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.750 
that they play it in the song and what
they're<00:02:40.739> doing<00:02:40.769> is<00:02:41.100> they're<00:02:41.250> getting<00:02:41.459> to

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
they're doing is they're getting to

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.090 
they're doing is they're getting to
their<00:02:41.910> next<00:02:42.239> chord<00:02:42.569> one<00:02:43.109> beat<00:02:43.410> early<00:02:43.650> each

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
their next chord one beat early each

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:54.080 
their next chord one beat early each
time<00:02:44.430> so<00:02:44.760> check<00:02:44.790> this<00:02:45.030> out<00:02:52.609> the<00:02:53.609> last<00:02:53.819> one's

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
time so check this out the last one's

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.000 
time so check this out the last one's
normal<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:55.019> we<00:02:55.109> can<00:02:55.260> repeat<00:02:55.560> back<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.920> here

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
normal so we can repeat back to here

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.250 
normal so we can repeat back to here
as<00:02:57.250> well<00:02:57.489> so<00:02:58.299> really<00:02:58.569> if<00:02:58.659> you<00:02:58.720> think<00:02:58.750> about<00:02:58.989> it

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
as well so really if you think about it

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.920 
as well so really if you think about it
this<00:02:59.560> first<00:02:59.860> one<00:03:00.099> is<00:03:00.370> three<00:03:00.610> counts<00:03:01.000> then<00:03:01.780> we

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
this first one is three counts then we

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.440 
this first one is three counts then we
go<00:03:02.049> to<00:03:02.079> this<00:03:02.349> one<00:03:02.560> for<00:03:02.769> four<00:03:03.010> counts<00:03:03.280> this<00:03:04.180> one

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
go to this one for four counts this one

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.030 
go to this one for four counts this one
before<00:03:04.659> and<00:03:05.260> this<00:03:05.890> one<00:03:06.099> for<00:03:06.280> five<00:03:07.739> but<00:03:08.739> I<00:03:08.769> think

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
before and this one for five but I think

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.140 
before and this one for five but I think
counting<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.489> that<00:03:09.640> way<00:03:09.760> gets<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.030> little

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
counting it that way gets a little

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.729 
counting it that way gets a little
tricky<00:03:10.480> so<00:03:10.629> I<00:03:10.689> like<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:10.870> just<00:03:10.989> keep<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.470> steady

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
tricky so I like to just keep the steady

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.699 
tricky so I like to just keep the steady
four<00:03:12.069> counts<00:03:12.459> throughout<00:03:13.409> let's<00:03:14.409> do<00:03:14.500> it<00:03:14.590> one

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
four counts throughout let's do it one

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:15.839 
four counts throughout let's do it one
more<00:03:14.739> time<00:03:14.950> then<00:03:15.159> we'll<00:03:15.250> add<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.459> left<00:03:15.640> hand

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
more time then we'll add the left hand

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:32.849 
more time then we'll add the left hand
right<00:03:30.930> let's<00:03:31.930> get<00:03:32.049> the<00:03:32.140> left<00:03:32.319> hand<00:03:32.500> in<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.650> mix

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
right let's get the left hand in the mix

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.240 
right let's get the left hand in the mix
I<00:03:34.170> want<00:03:35.170> to<00:03:35.230> camp<00:03:35.500> out<00:03:35.650> right<00:03:35.889> around<00:03:35.980> this
