18-wheeler<00:01:55.530> type<00:01:55.950> design<00:01:56.369> but<00:01:56.609> obviously<00:01:56.969> it

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
18-wheeler type design but obviously it

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.469

it's kind of an odd design I think for a

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.730 
it's kind of an odd design I think for a
car<00:02:02.999> but<00:02:03.240> yeah<00:02:03.450> but<00:02:03.929> as<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.140> can<00:02:04.259> see<00:02:04.469> on<00:02:04.619> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
car but yeah but as you can see on the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.469 
car but yeah but as you can see on the
design<00:02:05.069> of<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.369> vehicle<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.789> actually

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
design of the vehicle that actually

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.300 
design of the vehicle that actually
would<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:07.109> make<00:02:07.500> me<00:02:07.709> want<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.009> believe<00:02:08.250> that

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
would it make me want to believe that

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.039 
would it make me want to believe that
they<00:02:08.489> would<00:02:08.640> have<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.819> lot<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.179> power<00:02:09.629> and

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
they would have a lot of power and

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:12.920 
they would have a lot of power and
they'd<00:02:10.379> be<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.560> real<00:02:10.979> big<00:02:11.549> car<00:02:11.940> something<00:02:12.780> like

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
they'd be a real big car something like

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.320 
they'd be a real big car something like
a<00:02:12.959> I<00:02:13.440> guess<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.129> don't<00:02:14.220> want<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.430> same<00:02:14.670> redneck

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
a I guess I don't want the same redneck

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330 
a I guess I don't want the same redneck
type<00:02:15.599> of<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:16.110> know<00:02:16.230> like<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.470> truck<00:02:16.920> kind<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.280> a

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
type of you know like a truck kind of a

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.190 
type of you know like a truck kind of a
thing<00:02:17.519> but<00:02:17.819> I<00:02:17.879> could<00:02:18.120> really<00:02:18.269> see<00:02:18.569> something

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
thing but I could really see something

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.259 
thing but I could really see something
like<00:02:19.410> that<00:02:19.560> like<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.340> sand<00:02:20.610> King<00:02:20.879> just<00:02:21.120> a

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
like that like the sand King just a

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:22.610 
like that like the sand King just a
little<00:02:21.540> bit<00:02:21.660> smaller<00:02:22.019> with<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.319> nice<00:02:22.590> little

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
little bit smaller with a nice little

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.390 
little bit smaller with a nice little
cool<00:02:23.239> design<00:02:24.239> but<00:02:24.680> overall<00:02:25.680> this<00:02:25.950> vehicle

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
cool design but overall this vehicle

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.520 
cool design but overall this vehicle
seems<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:27.000> be<00:02:27.239> what<00:02:27.510> would<00:02:27.720> be<00:02:27.840> included<00:02:28.200> in

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
seems to be what would be included in

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.460 
seems to be what would be included in
the<00:02:28.950> i<00:02:28.980> am<00:02:29.310> not<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.549> hipster<00:02:29.790> dlc<00:02:30.450> if<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:31.170> is

the<00:02:31.739> case<00:02:31.769> that<00:02:32.549> it<00:02:32.670> would<00:02:32.819> be<00:02:32.940> coming<00:02:33.180> to

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
the case that it would be coming to

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.240 
the case that it would be coming to

you guys think you guys like the way it
looks<00:02:57.389> so<00:02:57.720> far<00:02:57.989> obviously<00:02:58.950> I'm<00:02:59.069> assuming<00:02:59.489> they

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
looks so far obviously I'm assuming they

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.190 
looks so far obviously I'm assuming they
would<00:02:59.700> add<00:02:59.849> some<00:03:00.030> tweaks<00:03:00.329> to<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.540> make<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:01.019> real

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
would add some tweaks to it make it real

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.860 
would add some tweaks to it make it real
GTA<00:03:01.650> 5<00:03:01.950> esque<00:03:02.250> but<00:03:02.819> at<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.180> moment<00:03:03.359> this<00:03:03.690> is

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
GTA 5 esque but at the moment this is

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.780 
GTA 5 esque but at the moment this is
what<00:03:04.079> the<00:03:04.260> vehicle<00:03:04.620> could<00:03:04.769> look<00:03:04.980> like<00:03:05.010> since

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
what the vehicle could look like since

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.289 
what the vehicle could look like since
this<00:03:05.940> is<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.150> real<00:03:06.660> vehicle<00:03:07.230> in<00:03:07.620> real<00:03:07.829> life

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
this is a real vehicle in real life

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.690 
this is a real vehicle in real life
again<00:03:09.299> it<00:03:09.569> is<00:03:09.750> called<00:03:10.019> the<00:03:10.380> three<00:03:10.650> axial<00:03:11.370> dub

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
again it is called the three axial dub

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.150 
again it is called the three axial dub
stuff<00:03:12.019> now<00:03:13.019> this<00:03:13.200> particular<00:03:13.560> model<00:03:13.950> is

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
stuff now this particular model is

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.460 
stuff now this particular model is
actually<00:03:14.669> like<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:15.000> Mercedes<00:03:15.569> type<00:03:15.840> but<00:03:16.380> I

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
actually like the Mercedes type but I

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.920 
actually like the Mercedes type but I
have<00:03:16.680> seen<00:03:17.040> this<00:03:17.400> this<00:03:18.060> like<00:03:18.329> same<00:03:18.630> looking

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
have seen this this like same looking

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.830 
have seen this this like same looking
vehicle<00:03:19.139> in<00:03:19.530> GTA<00:03:19.950> but<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:21.030> obviously<00:03:21.299> doesn't

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
vehicle in GTA but it obviously doesn't

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.540 
vehicle in GTA but it obviously doesn't
have

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
have

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.640 
have
the<00:03:23.550> same<00:03:23.790> back<00:03:24.060> two<00:03:24.300> tires<00:03:24.570> that<00:03:25.020> this<00:03:25.410> one

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
the same back two tires that this one

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.560 
the same back two tires that this one
has<00:03:25.680> where<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.490> can<00:03:26.610> see<00:03:26.790> that<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:27.000> extra<00:03:27.420> two

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
has where you can see that the extra two

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.260 
has where you can see that the extra two
tires<00:03:27.810> but<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.380> saw<00:03:28.890> your<00:03:29.160> vehicle<00:03:29.610> in<00:03:29.700> GTA<00:03:30.060> that

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
tires but I saw your vehicle in GTA that

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.050 
tires but I saw your vehicle in GTA that
looks<00:03:30.480> somewhat<00:03:31.020> similar<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:32.010> believe<00:03:32.550> I

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
looks somewhat similar to it I believe I

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.310 
looks somewhat similar to it I believe I
don't<00:03:33.510> remember<00:03:33.600> exactly<00:03:33.810> what<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.260> was

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
don't remember exactly what it was

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.050 
don't remember exactly what it was
called<00:03:34.620> but<00:03:34.740> it<00:03:34.860> looks<00:03:35.040> just<00:03:35.130> like<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.580> without

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
called but it looks just like it without

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.570 
called but it looks just like it without
the<00:03:36.240> extra<00:03:36.510> two<00:03:36.660> tires<00:03:36.900> but<00:03:37.230> that's<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:38.160> certain

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
the extra two tires but that's a certain

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.920 
the extra two tires but that's a certain
