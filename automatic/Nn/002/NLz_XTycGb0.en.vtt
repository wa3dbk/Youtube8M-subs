00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
a live auction site

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.050 
a live auction site
unlike<00:00:14.670> eBay<00:00:15.240> where<00:00:15.719> an<00:00:16.170> item<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:17.400> have<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.970> on

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
unlike eBay where an item I have it on

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.060 
unlike eBay where an item I have it on
in<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.359> background<00:00:18.390> those<00:00:18.960> little<00:00:19.230> degree

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
in the background those little degree

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.210 
in the background those little degree
sounds<00:00:20.520> that's<00:00:20.789> from<00:00:21.119> top<00:00:21.300> header<00:00:22.070> there<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.189> a

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
sounds that's from top header there is a

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.429 
sounds that's from top header there is a
current<00:00:23.519> auction<00:00:23.939> going<00:00:24.210> on<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.260> think

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
current auction going on and I think

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.169 
current auction going on and I think
it's<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:27.710> supplies<00:00:28.710> auction<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.699> they<00:00:30.060> have

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
it's the supplies auction and they have

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.749 
it's the supplies auction and they have
various<00:00:30.539> options<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:31.230> go<00:00:31.410> on<00:00:31.759> throughout

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
various options that go on throughout

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.170 
various options that go on throughout
the<00:00:33.000> week<00:00:33.149> it's<00:00:33.510> not<00:00:33.719> on<00:00:33.899> 24/7<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.100> believe<00:00:35.850> it's

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
the week it's not on 24/7 I believe it's

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.260 
the week it's not on 24/7 I believe it's
also<00:00:36.420> Pacific<00:00:37.140> time<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:41.149> trying<00:00:42.149> to

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
also Pacific time so it is trying to

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.410 
also Pacific time so it is trying to
think<00:00:42.450> I'm<00:00:43.260> not<00:00:43.500> gonna<00:00:43.620> do<00:00:43.800> math<00:00:43.950> right<00:00:44.190> now

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
think I'm not gonna do math right now

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.880 
think I'm not gonna do math right now
anyway<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.620> did<00:00:47.329> check<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.480> out<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.989> while<00:00:49.530> ago

was<00:00:52.469> interested<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:52.980> until<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.370> saw<00:00:53.969> it

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
because I was kind of getting tired of

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.350 
because I was kind of getting tired of

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
going to check is to make sure that I

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.200 
going to check is to make sure that I

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
I didn't won the auction there were a

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.870 
I didn't won the auction there were a
couple<00:03:09.320> of<00:03:09.470> other<00:03:09.590> items<00:03:09.920> that<00:03:10.220> I<00:03:10.250> had<00:03:10.490> bid<00:03:10.700> on

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
couple of other items that I had bid on

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.120 
couple of other items that I had bid on
and<00:03:11.330> then<00:03:11.570> stopped<00:03:12.020> bidding<00:03:12.350> when<00:03:12.800> it<00:03:12.980> went

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
and then stopped bidding when it went

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.460 
and then stopped bidding when it went
above<00:03:13.460> a<00:03:13.820> price<00:03:14.750> where<00:03:14.990> I<00:03:15.020> was<00:03:15.200> comfortable

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
above a price where I was comfortable

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.080 
above a price where I was comfortable
for<00:03:16.010> example<00:03:16.460> I<00:03:16.760> think<00:03:17.480> yesterday<00:03:18.260> there<00:03:18.590> were

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
for example I think yesterday there were

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.490 
for example I think yesterday there were
some<00:03:21.070> Scrabble<00:03:22.070> pieces<00:03:22.400> that<00:03:23.300> were<00:03:23.540> in<00:03:23.930> dark

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
some Scrabble pieces that were in dark

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.630 
some Scrabble pieces that were in dark
blue<00:03:24.950> with<00:03:25.520> white<00:03:25.790> letters<00:03:26.180> and<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.920> opening

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
blue with white letters and the opening

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.980 
blue with white letters and the opening
bid<00:03:28.880> was<00:03:29.420> three<00:03:29.720> dollars<00:03:29.840> for<00:03:30.680> I<00:03:31.540> think<00:03:32.540> a

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
bid was three dollars for I think a

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.560 
bid was three dollars for I think a
hundred<00:03:33.730> which<00:03:34.730> seemed<00:03:35.000> like<00:03:35.030> a<00:03:35.240> very

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
hundred which seemed like a very

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.360 
hundred which seemed like a very
reasonable<00:03:35.900> really<00:03:36.680> inexpensive<00:03:37.220> and

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
reasonable really inexpensive and

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.160 
reasonable really inexpensive and
shipping<00:03:37.550> was<00:03:37.790> only<00:03:38.000> two<00:03:38.210> dollars<00:03:38.360> so<00:03:39.140> I

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
shipping was only two dollars so I

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.660 
shipping was only two dollars so I
thought<00:03:39.440> well<00:03:39.680> we'll<00:03:39.890> see<00:03:40.070> how<00:03:40.190> far<00:03:40.400> it<00:03:40.520> goes

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
thought well we'll see how far it goes

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.730 
thought well we'll see how far it goes
but<00:03:41.330> the<00:03:41.450> bidding<00:03:41.630> kept<00:03:41.900> going<00:03:42.140> up<00:03:42.320> and<00:03:42.500> up<00:03:42.560> and

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
but the bidding kept going up and up and

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.160 
but the bidding kept going up and up and
I<00:03:42.800> stopped<00:03:43.100> at<00:03:43.310> seven<00:03:43.850> so<00:03:44.480> you<00:03:44.840> have<00:03:45.020> the

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
I stopped at seven so you have the

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.580 
I stopped at seven so you have the
option<00:03:45.320> to<00:03:45.950> not<00:03:46.610> bid<00:03:46.970> anymore<00:03:47.240> if<00:03:47.690> it's<00:03:48.140> above

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
option to not bid anymore if it's above

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.260 
option to not bid anymore if it's above
where<00:03:48.950> you<00:03:49.100> think<00:03:49.400> it's<00:03:49.550> reasonable<00:03:50.060> for<00:03:50.180> that

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
where you think it's reasonable for that

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.920

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
there are a couple of mails when you log

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.899 
there are a couple of mails when you log
in<00:06:06.259> when<00:06:06.470> you<00:06:06.560> first<00:06:06.770> create<00:06:07.099> your<00:06:07.130> account<00:06:07.310> I

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:07.909 
in when you first create your account I

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.210 
in when you first create your account I
think<00:06:08.270> you<00:06:08.690> can<00:06:08.930> designate<00:06:09.139> male<00:06:09.710> or<00:06:09.889> female

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
think you can designate male or female

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.350 
think you can designate male or female
so<00:06:10.400> I<00:06:10.430> think<00:06:10.490> that's<00:06:10.789> where<00:06:11.030> your<00:06:11.210> little

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
so I think that's where your little

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.600 
so I think that's where your little
avatar<00:06:11.960> looks<00:06:12.229> so<00:06:12.680> if<00:06:12.830> you<00:06:12.949> decide<00:06:13.250> to<00:06:13.400> sell

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
avatar looks so if you decide to sell

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.700 
avatar looks so if you decide to sell
and<00:06:14.419> you<00:06:14.539> want<00:06:14.690> to<00:06:14.750> answer<00:06:14.900> questions<00:06:15.199> you'll

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
and you want to answer questions you'll

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.830 
and you want to answer questions you'll
appear<00:06:16.070> as<00:06:16.130> a<00:06:16.159> little<00:06:16.430> male<00:06:17.270> or<00:06:17.449> female

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 
appear as a little male or female

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.540 
appear as a little male or female
depending<00:06:18.229> on<00:06:18.320> what<00:06:18.409> you<00:06:18.530> choose<00:06:18.710> so<00:06:18.979> I'll

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
depending on what you choose so I'll

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.100 
depending on what you choose so I'll
include<00:06:19.880> a<00:06:19.909> link<00:06:20.000> in<00:06:20.210> the<00:06:20.300> description<00:06:20.389> it's

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
include a link in the description it's

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.100 
include a link in the description it's
not<00:06:21.949> on<00:06:22.190> 24/7<00:06:22.909> so<00:06:23.300> that's<00:06:23.479> another<00:06:23.690> thing<00:06:23.930> that

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
not on 24/7 so that's another thing that

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.010 
not on 24/7 so that's another thing that
I<00:06:24.169> think<00:06:24.229> and<00:06:24.620> maybe<00:06:24.979> it's<00:06:25.220> just<00:06:25.520> in<00:06:26.479> its<00:06:26.690> kind

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
I think and maybe it's just in its kind

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.290 
I think and maybe it's just in its kind
of<00:06:27.110> infancy<00:06:27.650> and<00:06:28.190> it<00:06:28.400> will<00:06:28.610> develop<00:06:28.849> into<00:06:29.090> a

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
of infancy and it will develop into a

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.409 
of infancy and it will develop into a
much<00:06:29.630> livelier<00:06:30.139> site<00:06:30.830> but<00:06:31.130> check<00:06:31.820> it<00:06:31.849> out<00:06:32.000> stop
