00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.059 
see that last loop that you did so now
this<00:02:47.940> is<00:02:48.120> actually<00:02:48.299> ready<00:02:48.840> for<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.709> work

panel so what you've actually done is

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.210 
panel so what you've actually done is
cast<00:02:55.560> on<00:02:57.019> all<00:02:58.019> at<00:02:58.410> one<00:02:58.620> time

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
cast on all at one time

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.910

with the crochet cast on you've you've

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.759 
with the crochet cast on you've you've
cast<00:03:02.190> on<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.940> knitted<00:03:03.599> over<00:03:03.870> practically<00:03:04.560> and

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
cast on and knitted over practically and

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.630 
cast on and knitted over practically and
if<00:03:05.670> you<00:03:05.940> had<00:03:06.150> done<00:03:06.180> an<00:03:06.750> e-wrap<00:03:07.620> cast<00:03:07.680> on<00:03:08.280> you

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
if you had done an e-wrap cast on you

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.610 
if you had done an e-wrap cast on you
would<00:03:08.790> have<00:03:08.910> ear<00:03:09.209> apt<00:03:09.450> all<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.810> way<00:03:09.930> down<00:03:10.140> here

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
would have ear apt all the way down here

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.610 
would have ear apt all the way down here
and<00:03:10.799> then<00:03:11.489> Y<00:03:11.519> on<00:03:11.730> all<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.329> way<00:03:12.450> back<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.470> that

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
and then Y on all the way back so that

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.050 
and then Y on all the way back so that
you<00:03:13.680> can<00:03:13.859> knit<00:03:14.040> over<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:14.579> say<00:03:14.700> you're<00:03:14.850> working

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
you can knit over and say you're working

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.809 
you can knit over and say you're working
strand<00:03:15.480> would<00:03:15.690> actually<00:03:16.109> be<00:03:16.260> over<00:03:16.560> here<00:03:16.980> so

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
strand would actually be over here so

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.150 
strand would actually be over here so
but<00:03:18.150> it's<00:03:18.299> because<00:03:18.930> we<00:03:19.139> did<00:03:19.350> it<00:03:19.470> all<00:03:19.650> in<00:03:19.859> one

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
but it's because we did it all in one

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.890 
but it's because we did it all in one
you<00:03:20.459> don't<00:03:20.579> have<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.940> knit<00:03:21.120> over<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.690> this<00:03:21.810> is

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
you don't have to knit over and this is

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.740 
you don't have to knit over and this is
completely<00:03:22.319> casted<00:03:22.829> on<00:03:22.980> but<00:03:23.880> you're<00:03:24.329> working

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
completely casted on but you're working

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.500 
completely casted on but you're working
strand<00:03:25.019> is<00:03:25.109> now<00:03:25.290> on<00:03:25.560> this<00:03:25.889> side<00:03:26.519> so<00:03:27.269> if<00:03:27.389> your

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
strand is now on this side so if your

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.539 
strand is now on this side so if your
directions<00:03:28.049> call<00:03:28.319> for<00:03:28.530> crochet<00:03:28.829> cast<00:03:29.099> on<00:03:29.310> know

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
directions call for crochet cast on know

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.759 
directions call for crochet cast on know
that<00:03:29.730> you'll<00:03:29.849> be<00:03:30.000> on<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.239> opposite<00:03:30.720> side<00:03:30.989> when

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
that you'll be on the opposite side when

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.470 
that you'll be on the opposite side when
you<00:03:31.889> finish<00:03:32.280> unless<00:03:32.549> you're<00:03:32.910> working<00:03:33.060> in<00:03:33.359> the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
you finish unless you're working in the

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.819 
you finish unless you're working in the
round<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:33.989> then<00:03:34.109> you'll<00:03:34.230> end<00:03:34.260> up<00:03:34.560> right<00:03:34.620> back

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
round and then you'll end up right back

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:35.930 
round and then you'll end up right back
where<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.190> started

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
where you started

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.909 
where you started
so<00:03:36.510> I<00:03:36.540> just<00:03:36.750> wanted<00:03:36.959> to<00:03:37.049> point<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.530> out<00:03:37.590> make

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
so I just wanted to point that out make

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.190 
so I just wanted to point that out make
that<00:03:38.099> clear<00:03:38.579> so<00:03:38.880> in<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.150> flat<00:03:39.419> panel<00:03:39.750> it's<00:03:40.079> gonna

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
that clear so in a flat panel it's gonna

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.960 
that clear so in a flat panel it's gonna
look<00:03:40.470> they<00:03:41.040> turn<00:03:41.220> this<00:03:41.340> around<00:03:41.489> it's<00:03:41.790> going<00:03:41.910> to

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
look they turn this around it's going to

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.789 
look they turn this around it's going to
look<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.090> little<00:03:42.209> different<00:03:42.450> so<00:03:42.900> normally<00:03:43.440> if

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
look a little different so normally if

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.979 
look a little different so normally if
you<00:03:44.010> start<00:03:44.310> on<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.549> left<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.150> you<00:03:45.569> work<00:03:45.780> your

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
you start on the left and you work your

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.990 
you start on the left and you work your
way<00:03:46.019> down<00:03:46.280> this<00:03:47.280> ends<00:03:47.700> up<00:03:47.849> here<00:03:48.569> so<00:03:49.099> you<00:03:50.099> may<00:03:50.370> be

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
required to build up this row and then

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.460 
required to build up this row and then
they<00:03:53.609> start<00:03:53.849> calling<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.359> Row<00:03:54.540> one<00:03:54.840> so<00:03:55.440> just

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
they start calling it Row one so just
