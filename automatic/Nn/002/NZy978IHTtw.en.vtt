but<00:00:01.260> today<00:00:01.500> I'm<00:00:01.709> doing<00:00:01.860> something<00:00:02.280> that's

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
but today I'm doing something that's

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.949 
but today I'm doing something that's
kind<00:00:02.850> of<00:00:02.939> practical<00:00:03.360> I'm<00:00:03.449> having<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.750> change

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
kind of practical I'm having to change

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:05.950 
kind of practical I'm having to change
out<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.259> fuel<00:00:04.470> pump<00:00:04.710> on<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:04.920> Monte<00:00:05.160> Carlo<00:00:05.430> SS

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:05.960 
out the fuel pump on the Monte Carlo SS

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.270 
out the fuel pump on the Monte Carlo SS
I've<00:00:06.960> got<00:00:07.109> it<00:00:07.230> leaning<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.529> one<00:00:07.560> side<00:00:07.710> as<00:00:08.069> much

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
I've got it leaning to one side as much

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.520 
I've got it leaning to one side as much
as<00:00:08.429> possible<00:00:08.970> so<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:09.840> hopefully<00:00:10.050> that<00:00:10.320> rod

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
as possible so that hopefully that rod

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.930 
as possible so that hopefully that rod
won't<00:00:10.860> slide<00:00:11.130> out<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.490> we'll<00:00:11.610> make<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.730> little

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
won't slide out and we'll make a little

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.330 
won't slide out and we'll make a little
easier<00:00:12.179> putting<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.480> in<00:00:12.599> there<00:00:13.219> but<00:00:14.219> there's

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
easier putting it in there but there's

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.740 
easier putting it in there but there's
something<00:00:14.549> else<00:00:14.639> about<00:00:14.820> these<00:00:15.059> Monte<00:00:15.360> Carlos

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
lot easier to work on that I want to

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.140 
lot easier to work on that I want to
show<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:22.980> many<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.730> may<00:00:23.850> already<00:00:24.000> know

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.179 
show you many of you may already know
this<00:00:24.539> but<00:00:26.510> I'll<00:00:27.510> show<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.840> anyway<00:00:28.050> it's<00:00:28.980> quite

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
this but I'll show it anyway it's quite

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.890 
this but I'll show it anyway it's quite
hard<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.519> work<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:29.910> these<00:00:30.029> cars<00:00:30.330> from<00:00:30.480> up<00:00:30.660> top

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
hard to work on these cars from up top

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.359 
hard to work on these cars from up top
with<00:00:31.410> all<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.650> junk<00:00:31.859> that's<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.250> way

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
with all the junk that's in the way

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.840 
with all the junk that's in the way
especially<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.630> original<00:00:34.020> car<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.700> guess<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
especially in original car I guess the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.540 
especially in original car I guess the
general<00:00:35.969> thought<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:37.040> an<00:00:38.040> easier<00:00:38.399> way<00:00:38.520> to

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
general thought of this an easier way to

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.310 
general thought of this an easier way to
access<00:00:39.000> things<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.510> from<00:00:39.719> inside<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.170> wheel

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
access things is from inside the wheel

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.020 
access things is from inside the wheel
well<00:00:40.530> here<00:00:42.410> the<00:00:43.410> spark<00:00:43.739> plugs<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.760> even<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
well here the spark plugs and even the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.029 
well here the spark plugs and even the
bolts<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.510> fuel<00:00:45.750> top<00:00:46.020> line<00:00:46.649> right<00:00:46.890> up

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
bolts on that fuel top line right up

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.000 
bolts on that fuel top line right up
with<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.280> hole<00:00:47.460> that's<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.910> wheel<00:00:48.059> well

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
with the hole that's in the wheel well

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.170 
with the hole that's in the wheel well
it's<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> lot<00:00:50.129> easier<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.610> work<00:00:50.730> on<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.030> from

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
it's a lot easier to work on it from

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.500 
it's a lot easier to work on it from
down<00:00:51.600> here<00:00:52.640> access<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.789> all<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> spark<00:00:54.270> plugs

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
down here access to all the spark plugs

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.229 
down here access to all the spark plugs
is<00:00:54.600> right<00:00:54.809> there<00:00:55.050> both<00:00:55.739> sides<00:00:56.120> it's<00:00:57.120> not

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
is right there both sides it's not

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.639 
is right there both sides it's not
easier<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.629> work<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.140> way<00:00:58.320> than<00:00:58.530> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
easier to work on it that way than to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.430 
easier to work on it that way than to
work<00:00:58.800> on<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.039> from<00:00:59.190> up<00:00:59.309> top<00:00:59.520> I<00:01:00.230> don't<00:01:01.230> have<00:01:01.379> to

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
work on it from up top I don't have to

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.540 
work on it from up top I don't have to
change<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.770> spark<00:01:02.010> plugs<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.309> was<00:01:02.430> just

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
change the spark plugs I was just

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.450 
change the spark plugs I was just
putting<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.850> on<00:01:02.879> there<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.120> show<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.480> you

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
putting it on there to show it to you

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.870 
putting it on there to show it to you
it's<00:01:05.460> tough<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.729> work<00:01:05.850> on<00:01:06.030> these<00:01:06.150> newer<00:01:06.420> cars

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
it's tough to work on these newer cars

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.460 
it's tough to work on these newer cars
to<00:01:08.880> me<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> newer<00:01:09.540> car<00:01:09.840> I'd<00:01:10.110> rather<00:01:10.290> be
