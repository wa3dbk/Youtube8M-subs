00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 with the frequent changes in this 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.020
 type of transportation the truck driver has 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.529
 to always be empowering if not for 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.529
 stay behind 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.960
 Someone still doubts that he was carrying 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.699
 dangerous products is an activity of 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.730
 nobody risk, right? 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.890
 just last year the company cetesb 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.740
 of the state of são paulo attended 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.140
 2202 road accidents involving 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.100
 trucks transporting products 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.480
 to speed up service 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.270
 concessionaires carry out 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.120
 simulated to train their teams in 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.710
 cases of accidents involving this type of 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.719
 carriage 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.539
 There's always something new like this. 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.300
 Equipped remote control helicopter 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.000
 with six propellers that captures the images and 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.100
 transmit in real time to the teams 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.109
 the current president of the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.960
 union of the transport companies of 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.570
 cargo from são paulo and region is witness 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.580
 ocular history up to the middle of the decade 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.909
 1980 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.070
 manuel de sousa was a truck driver 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.380
 worked in the pull of the chemical at a time 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.540
 in which little was said in regulation 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.670
 of this type of product 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.030
 I when I started making transport 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.909
 of hazardous products by looking at the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.920
 of my journey as a transporter 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.610
 had a product by the company 90 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.270
 tons 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.490
 I remember right from a product called 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.220
 china powder 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.920
 I remember the bombs coming in from the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.750
 warehouse and could not fai 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.119
 Libya chatting just finished 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.610
 talking and swallowing the helping hand 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.850
 trulli and that fell on torn clothes 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.689
 clothes means he then created 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.399
 an allergy to nuno helpers then a 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.159
 dangerous thing and give a 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.890
 Astronaut there because of the poor 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:03.200
 helper could do that 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.200
 protected loading and unloading 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.770
 over the years the rules for this 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.280
 type of transportation were becoming 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.530
 more rigid and also more bureaucratic 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.860
 to get an idea of ​​each state of the 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.860
 brazil requires different documentation 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.230
 are nine classes of products 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:29.580
 to number 1 are exclusive to 2 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.920
 gaza 3 is for flammable liquids 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.880
 four are solid subject to combustion 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:40.720
 spontaneous five are the six oxidants 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:44.110
 are for infectious toxicants 7 for 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.630
 the radioactive 8 for corrosive and 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.330
 nine are the products that despite the risk 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.450
 does not fit into any of the classes 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.670
 this carrier in abc 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.160
 São Paulo is one of the main 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.370
 that carry the chemical in the 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.190
 brazil your specialty is the products 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.840
 of class 8 the corrosive all this 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.060
 From here it goes inside the truck's cab 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.190
 All this goes from there to the 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.040
 I walk like a hoe in the cart 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.670
 né the fire extinguisher cones have their place 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.220
 and the driver has a bag right 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.000
 gpi that we call it stays inside 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.530
 of the truck in the case of the need of the 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.019
 emergency use that is not 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.030
 very accustomed to pull the chemical ino 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.769
 do not know but a truck that transports 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.360
 a product like that from here it has to 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.860
 have a specific place to stop 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.019
 inside the well can not, for example, 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.239
 stop on the side on the bulk carrier truck 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.610
 a truck hauling on a meat 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.220
 There's got to be a corner of him there. 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.600
 with 13 and avoid until even another 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.700
 truck that suddenly entered the yard 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.620
 of the post behind a valve and 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.870
 have a complete accident within one 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.790
 well as well, because it is beyond these 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.830
 foodstuffs and has cited the 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.870
 chemist himself between the product 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.239
 created me quite incompatible punishment 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.160
 I am not inside the corrosive for example 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.320
 that eight I have the soda that is base I 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.360
 I have acid and both are extremely 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.769
 incompatible then it is very difficult to 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.480
 important drivers and technicians 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.480
 enough to know where to stop 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.349
 even if you do not transport 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.320
 dangerous road products 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:20.769
 It's important to take the mopp course. 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:24.729
 an important aspect has 25 years in this 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:28.919
 law and I do not know why we'll see ooo 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:33.699
 driver does not seek to take a course 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:35.860
 of mop is your wallet to aaa 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:39.250
 duly authorized the carriage of 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.740
 products per shot one more time and only there 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.900
 It can happen even if he and let it 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.020
 work with the big motto in a little while 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.410
 contaminated with a load of pesticides that 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.880
 he can do it he will need the moc 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.610
 sometimes he is losing freight 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.860
 because he does not have a motorcycle before he starts 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.840
 a trip to us is summarized and 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.880
 what are the items you can not? 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.889
 can not forget to check before 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.780
 facing the early morning 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:07.570
 first thing that leads us to people 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.090
 Raises to check a tire 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.930
 I hit the tires before always is to follow 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.930
 trip 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.820
 water and look this is essential for you 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.360
 where you have to go inside the company 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:23.560
 or within the station anywhere if 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:27.020
 would have picked up tire 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:30.110
 comes oil and water 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.520
 the tire is an important safety item 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.229
 for any vehicle 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.849
 but when it comes to transporting 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.629
 dangerous products 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:40.879
 This class is extremely demanding. 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:44.300
 cart horse only roll with tires 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:47.180
 new to follow the wear and tear is 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:50.020
 installed on the last axis or the recorder 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.129
 of kilometers called a pedometer 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.030
 fire extinguisher while you have 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:55.729

 four nettheim pants with the house have a 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.229
 on the other side you have both in the drawer 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.800
 so we have to participate if 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:14.690
 not only the vehicle in safety can not 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:16.940
 forget the transport documentation of 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:20.180
 dangerous products is a matter of 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:22.520
 awareness and you're a foreigner is part 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.569
 fundamental to safety in this type of
