00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.550
 the dreamcast especially to be able to 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.440
 here you set the joystick is a 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.899
 little bit too the side the side 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.390
 graph then simply you 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.280
 go no option select claudine you 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.530
 press enter 6 on his record not on 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.460
 the menu can put this behind 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.980
 you arrive here simply 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.660
 go down you go from andorra not borbÃ© 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.100
 all the rest of the top me 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.390
 personally I did not touch anything because 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.140
 that it works very well games like 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.469
 that for now I'm going to take scope 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.910
 for flying back to you at 0 or 1 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.409
 what did I do what I did 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.110
 selected you come down on a caste 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.360
 you tap it underneath you 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.070
 down in scrolls and you're 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.790
 have logitech g15 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.390
 here you click and it's good your 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.530
 shifters 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.750
 these are without regulating way and the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.369
 ban me this disease this box is 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.640
 detected after just just go 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.790
 in maple not bad I do not know how 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.200
 is called configure cash branch 1 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.729
 you are in and here you 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.700
 your controller two cases what is displayed 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.049
 you click where I have the mouse up 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.400
 high enough and then here you do 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.770
 doubt settings simply you 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.070
 enter your keys one after the other 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.479
 other 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.740
 and here is your controller is set aside 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.420
 graphic design me i'm going to show you 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.060
 personally I did not touch anything I 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.710
 leave everything like that because it works 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.659
 very well 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.689
 but if it works I did not see 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.560
 the interest of touching something 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:05.009
 for now all the games I have 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.030
 put works here I show you a 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.320
 little bit everything that is checked and 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.259
 unchecked if you want 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.250
 really check that everything is the same 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.830
 but here I leave you on this 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.420
 e and probably has to next for 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.980
