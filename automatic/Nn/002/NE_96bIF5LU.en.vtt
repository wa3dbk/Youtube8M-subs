been<00:00:27.210> ball<00:00:27.599> tested<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.529> we<00:00:28.920> know<00:00:29.099> what<00:00:29.250> they

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
been ball tested so we know what they

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.190 
been ball tested so we know what they
can<00:00:29.580> do<00:00:33.500> back<00:00:34.500> there<00:00:35.180> now<00:00:36.180> one<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:36.960> hasn't

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
the top I have not bottle tested this

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.410 
the top I have not bottle tested this
yet<00:01:07.159> so<00:01:07.189> we're<00:01:07.670> gonna<00:01:07.820> have<00:01:07.939> to<00:01:08.030> see<00:01:08.180> what<00:01:08.299> this

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
yet so we're gonna have to see what this

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:17.940 
yet so we're gonna have to see what this
can<00:01:08.600> do<00:01:08.780> so<00:01:09.259> let's<00:01:09.470> check<00:01:09.680> that<00:01:09.860> out<00:01:10.009> right<00:01:10.159> now

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.760 

okay<00:01:18.750> we're<00:01:19.750> now<00:01:19.930> room<00:01:20.200> here<00:01:20.380> I'm<00:01:20.470> gonna<00:01:20.620> start

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
okay we're now room here I'm gonna start

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.680 
okay we're now room here I'm gonna start
smacking<00:01:21.190> machetes<00:01:21.610> in<00:01:21.700> a<00:01:21.790> second<00:01:22.210> but<00:01:23.110> I<00:01:24.690> have

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
smacking machetes in a second but I have

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.570 
smacking machetes in a second but I have
no<00:01:25.930> doubt<00:01:26.140> what<00:01:26.350> this<00:01:26.500> is<00:01:26.650> kind<00:01:26.920> of<00:01:27.010> do<00:01:27.190> so

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
no doubt what this is kind of do so

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.370 
no doubt what this is kind of do so
let's<00:01:27.940> just<00:01:28.180> go<00:01:28.330> ahead<00:01:28.360> and<00:01:28.630> get<00:01:28.720> it<00:01:28.870> over<00:01:28.960> with

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.219 

so<00:01:32.380> stupid<00:01:34.290> should<00:01:35.290> have<00:01:35.380> left<00:01:35.560> some<00:01:35.770> room

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
so stupid should have left some room

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:53.330 
so stupid should have left some room
clearance

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.450 

good<00:01:53.850> cut<00:01:54.470> you<00:01:55.470> can<00:01:55.560> get<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.770> bottle<00:01:56.130> didn't

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
good cut you can get the bottle didn't

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.610 
good cut you can get the bottle didn't
get<00:01:56.550> the<00:01:56.670> top<00:01:56.880> pop<00:01:57.180> but<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.570> wanted<00:01:57.870> try<00:01:58.470> that

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
get the top pop but I wanted try that

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.590 
get the top pop but I wanted try that
again

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
again

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.090 
again
all<00:02:00.600> right<00:02:00.750> let's<00:02:01.260> try<00:02:01.440> another<00:02:01.710> one<00:02:01.830> real

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
all right let's try another one real

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:13.710 
all right let's try another one real
quick<00:02:03.290> that'll<00:02:04.290> be<00:02:04.440> it<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.770> one

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.830 

this<00:02:14.720> one<00:02:15.020> out<00:02:15.680> of<00:02:15.740> all<00:02:16.010> of<00:02:16.070> them<00:02:16.430> has<00:02:17.330> probably

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
this one out of all of them has probably

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.770 
this one out of all of them has probably
got<00:02:18.170> its<00:02:18.440> got<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:19.250> much<00:02:19.460> thicker<00:02:19.850> blade<00:02:20.210> but

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
got its got the much thicker blade but

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.040 
got its got the much thicker blade but
it's<00:02:20.900> also<00:02:21.140> got<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.650> sharpest<00:02:22.130> edge<00:02:22.810> this<00:02:23.810> one

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
it's also got the sharpest edge this one

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.290 
it's also got the sharpest edge this one
I<00:02:24.200> don't<00:02:24.260> know<00:02:24.440> why<00:02:24.710> I<00:02:25.130> think<00:02:25.880> it's<00:02:26.060> just<00:02:26.120> the

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
I don't know why I think it's just the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.440 
I don't know why I think it's just the
edge<00:02:26.390> geometry<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:27.200> this<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:28.610> was<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.850> convex

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
edge geometry to this it was a convex

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.110 
edge geometry to this it was a convex
edge<00:02:29.920> that<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:30.950> put<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:32.110> shallower<00:02:33.190> V<00:02:34.190> edge<00:02:34.370> on<00:02:34.730> so

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
edge that I put a shallower V edge on so

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.820 
edge that I put a shallower V edge on so
it<00:02:35.960> definitely<00:02:36.530> gets<00:02:36.710> the<00:02:36.890> job<00:02:37.130> done<00:02:37.190> so<00:02:38.830> this

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
it definitely gets the job done so this

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.220 
it definitely gets the job done so this
one<00:02:40.100> is<00:02:40.520> not<00:02:40.790> as<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.480> said<00:02:41.540> in<00:02:41.900> my<00:02:42.020> previous

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
one is not as I said in my previous

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.430 
one is not as I said in my previous
review<00:02:42.950> it's<00:02:43.520> not<00:02:43.820> really<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.180> practical<00:02:44.959> you

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
review it's not really a practical you

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.410 
review it's not really a practical you
know<00:02:45.500> survival<00:02:46.190> machete<00:02:46.580> because<00:02:46.970> of<00:02:47.330> the

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
know survival machete because of the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.440 
know survival machete because of the
sharpened<00:02:47.840> edge<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.340> will<00:02:49.550> cut<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:50.420> chop

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
sharpened edge and it will cut and chop

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.540 
sharpened edge and it will cut and chop
like<00:02:50.930> nobody's<00:02:51.500> business<00:02:51.709> so<00:02:52.100> I'm<00:02:52.160> not<00:02:52.310> even

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
like nobody's business so I'm not even

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.860 
like nobody's business so I'm not even
to<00:02:52.640> bother<00:02:52.790> with<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:53.950> but<00:02:55.209> this<00:02:56.209> is<00:02:56.450> more<00:02:56.720> of

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
to bother with that but this is more of

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.440 
to bother with that but this is more of
a<00:02:56.989> collection<00:02:57.640> weapon<00:02:58.640> type<00:02:58.940> you<00:02:59.330> know
