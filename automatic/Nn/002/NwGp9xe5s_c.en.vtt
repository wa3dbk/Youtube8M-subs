all<00:03:31.239> been<00:03:31.630> guilty<00:03:31.989> of<00:03:32.020> doing<00:03:32.410> that<00:03:32.530> because<00:03:32.739> in

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
all been guilty of doing that because in

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.830 
all been guilty of doing that because in
the<00:03:33.130> end<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:33.640> argument<00:03:33.880> is<00:03:34.270> just<00:03:34.570> that<00:03:34.750> it

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
the end the argument is just that it

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.240 
the end the argument is just that it
doesn't<00:03:35.080> feel<00:03:35.290> right<00:03:35.560> with<00:03:35.800> you<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:36.100> so
