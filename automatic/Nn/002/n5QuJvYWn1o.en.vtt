00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.600 

the<00:01:44.260> pictures<00:01:44.650> I'm<00:01:44.920> not<00:01:45.100> going<00:01:45.280> to<00:01:45.340> change<00:01:45.520> my

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
the pictures I'm not going to change my

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.520 
the pictures I'm not going to change my
story<00:01:45.909> there<00:01:46.180> right<00:01:46.300> I<00:01:46.540> mean<00:01:46.930> I'm<00:01:47.020> sure<00:01:47.050> Paul

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
story there right I mean I'm sure Paul

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.149 
story there right I mean I'm sure Paul
maybe<00:01:48.070> he<00:01:48.460> swerved<00:01:49.120> away<00:01:49.620> from<00:01:50.620> Archer<00:01:50.979> from

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
maybe he swerved away from Archer from

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.770 
maybe he swerved away from Archer from
the<00:01:51.280> early<00:01:51.610> stuff<00:01:51.909> then<00:01:52.150> we<00:01:52.240> swerved<00:01:52.630> back

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
the early stuff then we swerved back

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.240 
the early stuff then we swerved back
didn't<00:01:53.080> realize<00:01:53.470> he<00:01:53.590> was<00:01:53.650> swerving<00:01:53.860> all<00:01:54.130> the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
didn't realize he was swerving all the

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.859 
didn't realize he was swerving all the
way<00:01:54.340> back<00:01:54.490> into<00:01:54.729> it<00:01:54.909> but<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.390> pictures<00:01:55.780> are

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
way back into it but the pictures are

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.590 
way back into it but the pictures are
pretty<00:01:56.020> damning<00:01:56.670> well<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:57.909> it<00:01:58.000> wasn't<00:01:58.330> subtle

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
pretty damning well and it wasn't subtle

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.749 
pretty damning well and it wasn't subtle
and<00:01:58.930> I<00:01:59.020> think<00:01:59.380> that<00:01:59.530> may<00:01:59.740> have<00:01:59.770> may<00:02:00.490> have<00:02:00.610> been

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
and I think that may have may have been

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.670 
and I think that may have may have been
the<00:02:00.790> biggest<00:02:01.240> faux<00:02:01.420> pas<00:02:01.660> years<00:02:01.990> is<00:02:02.380> if<00:02:02.560> you're

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
the biggest faux pas years is if you're

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.290 
the biggest faux pas years is if you're
going<00:02:02.830> to<00:02:02.890> do<00:02:03.040> something<00:02:03.070> like<00:02:03.520> that<00:02:03.580> don't

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
going to do something like that don't

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.850 
going to do something like that don't
make<00:02:04.390> it<00:02:04.540> quite<00:02:04.690> so<00:02:04.869> obvious<00:02:04.900> and<00:02:05.560> I<00:02:05.710> mean

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
make it quite so obvious and I mean

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.080 
make it quite so obvious and I mean
there<00:02:06.009> was<00:02:06.100> no<00:02:06.250> way<00:02:06.460> you<00:02:06.520> could<00:02:06.670> miss<00:02:07.060> that

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
there was no way you could miss that

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.169 
there was no way you could miss that
like<00:02:07.930> I<00:02:08.080> said<00:02:08.140> there<00:02:08.649> might<00:02:08.800> be<00:02:08.860> I<00:02:09.340> don't<00:02:10.030> want

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
like I said there might be I don't want

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.970 
like I said there might be I don't want
to<00:02:10.239> assign<00:02:10.479> intent<00:02:10.899> apology<00:02:11.470> was<00:02:11.590> pulling

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
to assign intent apology was pulling

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.040 
to assign intent apology was pulling
away<00:02:12.100> in<00:02:12.400> frustration<00:02:12.880> then<00:02:13.390> pulling<00:02:13.660> back<00:02:13.900> to

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
away in frustration then pulling back to

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.900 
away in frustration then pulling back to
get<00:02:14.170> in<00:02:14.230> line<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:14.530> misjudged<00:02:14.950> that<00:02:15.069> the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
get in line and misjudged that the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.240 
get in line and misjudged that the
effect<00:02:16.300> was<00:02:16.510> they<00:02:16.959> came<00:02:17.170> together<00:02:17.350> Paul

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
effect was they came together Paul

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.070 
effect was they came together Paul
initiated<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.180> valve<00:02:19.390> stem<00:02:19.510> got<00:02:19.780> knocked<00:02:19.959> up

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
initiated the valve stem got knocked up

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.170 
initiated the valve stem got knocked up
the<00:02:20.230> tire<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.709> archers<00:02:21.400> race<00:02:21.610> was<00:02:21.910> perhaps

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
the tire and archers race was perhaps

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.479 
the tire and archers race was perhaps
ruined<00:02:22.720> so<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:23.680> can<00:02:23.830> argue<00:02:24.040> that<00:02:24.070> there's<00:02:24.370> two

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
ruined so you can argue that there's two

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.040 
ruined so you can argue that there's two
sides<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.850> every<00:02:25.060> story<00:02:25.090> I'm<00:02:25.540> sure<00:02:25.720> we'll<00:02:25.870> hear
