00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.850
 frank or 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.840
 but 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.140
 we started to be big and small as 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.140
 everyone 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.859
 my name is jean paul reinier 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.509
 I'm the tortel restaurant manager and here 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.200
 we are in our new holy headquarters 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.190
 Monica 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.100
 we practically opened four years ago 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.190
 months we have our main in the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.040
 rock that already has 14 years the business already 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.210
 It takes 14 years and 12 others in the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.610
 city we have always been let's say in 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.340
 a very close alliance with loft or 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.280
 from the beginning 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.900
 we use and buy the equipment to 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.600
 them since we were very small with 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.120
 our first chubs and stoves 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.460
 they went with them logically after 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.470
 little by little as we grew up we went 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.350
 buying more sophisticated equipment like 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.860
 like the combis rational ovens and the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.890
 last we bought here for this to 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.260
 this headquarters and the truth has been a 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.110
 very good experience that has 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.170
 facilitated life both in the in the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.690
 assembly of the venues as in the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.479
 same business daily performance 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.370
 they also collaborate a lot in the 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.020
 stage of plans and of 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.630
 and let's say design them 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.370
 kitchens and the other points of the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.240
 local because the restaurants 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:48.200
 in large part of their of their locations 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.020
 has has equipment that we buy from 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.210
 Stick hands at the bar in kitchen at other 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.760
 cooling parts also from the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.530
 wines 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.960
 As I was saying now, it has been a 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.700
 very good partnership that will facilitate the 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.940
 life because they knowing the teams 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.030
 they know where where are you going let's say everything 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.220
 where the team fits behind reference and 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.680
 the truth has been an experience one 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.870
 very good partnership 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.870
 the combi oven helps a lot 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.120
 there are many things 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:40.230
 also to the juices 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.230
 and the protein 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.970
 take rhythm and salt extraction 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:54.250
 compare the bell is great 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.250
 this afternoon 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.900
 she feels very happy we have improved 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.900
 the times 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.390
 between the dishes 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.880
 the truth that the garbage oven 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.980
 and the stove that we have is very good 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.950
 because it is very easy to 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.470
 it is very easy to disarm 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.890
 the water bath is also very good 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:27.640
 Electric washing vanities 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:31.590
 because waiters are only food 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.590
 the plate is cleaned a little 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.490
 save work be a job 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.890
 Water 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.710
 where are we after, very good for 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.350
 start well 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:49.290
 people are looking for a little that one 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.050
 deliver a really cozy site 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.790
 with a modern architecture that looks 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.340
 very clean and that is what we have tried 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.430
 of doing in all the seats logically 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.710
 is that we did it from scratch and how 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.840
 I said germinate now we have the kitchen 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.490
 it is ideal then in this moment of suddenly 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.520
 is the one I like because that is a 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.160
 very open place very clean with lots 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.650
 light and the terrace is very pretty with its 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.900
 green wall 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.310
 and what they said now about all that part 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.190
 of innovative equipment also here 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.380
 we have an ice machine that 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.900
 we buy dove not that is fabulous 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.759
 then in another of the points in the rock 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.070
 we also have one but but there are two 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.050
 points where we do not even have a dishwasher 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.040
 no ice machine and it really does not feel 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:36.370
 the difference is to be buying then 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.310
 those supplies wash it by hand is much more 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:42.370
 costly requires a more personal 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.750
 and well I think that if people when 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.000
 comes to the restaurants looking a bit 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.640
 that not all of that set not only the 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.530
 rich food without kind attention 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.820
 the site is nice that there is good 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.610
 music 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.860
 Suddenly feel that really what 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.650
 they are offering is a 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.690
 experience not only gastronomic but 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.540
 as a total a moment where truth to 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:09.510
 enjoy and abuse your family with your 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.510
 friends or are in a work moment
