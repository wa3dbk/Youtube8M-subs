so today we're going to build our own

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:06.090 
so today we're going to build our own
smoker<00:00:03.699> and<00:00:04.180> this<00:00:04.990> is<00:00:05.230> what<00:00:05.650> we're<00:00:05.800> going<00:00:05.950> to

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.100 
smoker and this is what we're going to

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.259

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.349 
the unit and everything on the inside is
clad<00:00:24.490> with<00:00:25.119> fireproof<00:00:25.720> board<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:28.000> can<00:00:28.179> see

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
clad with fireproof board you can see

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:29.820 
clad with fireproof board you can see
we've<00:00:28.570> put<00:00:28.720> a<00:00:28.750> couple<00:00:29.050> of<00:00:29.109> shells<00:00:29.380> in<00:00:29.650> there

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
we've put a couple of shells in there

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.919 
we've put a couple of shells in there
we've<00:00:30.130> got<00:00:30.339> a<00:00:30.369> smoke<00:00:31.060> spreader<00:00:31.480> there<00:00:31.720> to

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:31.929 
we've got a smoke spreader there to

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:35.010 
we've got a smoke spreader there to
ensure<00:00:32.079> that<00:00:32.439> we've<00:00:32.619> got<00:00:32.879> even<00:00:33.879> movement<00:00:34.840> of

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
ensure that we've got even movement of

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.380 
ensure that we've got even movement of
the<00:00:35.050> smoke<00:00:35.410> throughout<00:00:35.969> we've<00:00:36.969> got<00:00:37.210> our

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
the smoke throughout we've got our

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.049 
the smoke throughout we've got our
thermometer<00:00:38.050> gauge<00:00:38.230> which<00:00:38.649> is<00:00:39.059> positioned

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
thermometer gauge which is positioned

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.279 
thermometer gauge which is positioned
just<00:00:40.329> above<00:00:41.199> food<00:00:41.500> height<00:00:42.809> for<00:00:43.809> the<00:00:43.870> chimney

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:44.289 
just above food height for the chimney

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:46.889 
just above food height for the chimney
it's<00:00:44.859> an<00:00:45.070> open<00:00:45.399> hole<00:00:45.579> but<00:00:46.300> then<00:00:46.539> we<00:00:46.690> have<00:00:46.870> a

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
it's an open hole but then we have a

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.260 
it's an open hole but then we have a
slider<00:00:47.350> which<00:00:47.680> goes<00:00:47.949> over<00:00:48.309> the<00:00:48.430> top<00:00:48.460> so<00:00:49.239> that

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
slider which goes over the top so that

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.720 
slider which goes over the top so that
we<00:00:49.660> can<00:00:49.840> control<00:00:50.320> the<00:00:50.649> vent<00:00:51.190> that<00:00:51.550> we've

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
we can control the vent that we've

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.490 
we can control the vent that we've
gotten<00:00:52.090> there<00:00:52.300> for<00:00:52.510> control<00:00:52.930> the<00:00:53.079> heat<00:00:53.199> in<00:00:53.410> the

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
gotten there for control the heat in the

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.560 
gotten there for control the heat in the
unit<00:00:53.829> down<00:00:54.789> below<00:00:55.149> we've<00:00:55.989> got<00:00:56.199> a<00:00:56.230> fire<00:00:56.469> box

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
unit down below we've got a fire box

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.740 
unit down below we've got a fire box
again<00:00:58.620> fully<00:00:59.620> clad<00:00:59.949> with<00:01:00.640> fireproof<00:01:01.420> board

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
again fully clad with fireproof board

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.920 
again fully clad with fireproof board
you<00:01:02.620> can<00:01:02.829> see<00:01:03.070> we've<00:01:03.280> also<00:01:03.489> got<00:01:03.940> we're<00:01:04.720> using

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
you can see we've also got we're using

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.740 
you can see we've also got we're using
what's<00:01:05.320> called<00:01:05.409> velcro<00:01:06.009> loop<00:01:06.250> to<00:01:06.970> provide<00:01:07.600> the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
what's called velcro loop to provide the

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.130 
what's called velcro loop to provide the
smoke<00:01:08.049> seal<00:01:08.350> for<00:01:08.619> the<00:01:08.650> door<00:01:08.920> and<00:01:09.869> we're<00:01:10.869> using

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
smoke seal for the door and we're using

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.260 
smoke seal for the door and we're using
a<00:01:11.380> gas<00:01:11.619> fired<00:01:12.009> burner<00:01:12.369> in<00:01:12.700> this<00:01:13.060> particular

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
a gas fired burner in this particular

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.710 
a gas fired burner in this particular
instance<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:15.759> gas<00:01:15.939> fire<00:01:16.270> will<00:01:16.540> have<00:01:16.689> a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
instance so the gas fire will have a

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.679 
instance so the gas fire will have a
frying<00:01:17.079> pan<00:01:17.170> on<00:01:17.470> top<00:01:17.650> of<00:01:17.860> it<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:19.030> that<00:01:19.270> frying

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
frying pan on top of it in that frying

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.560 
frying pan on top of it in that frying
pan<00:01:19.990> we<00:01:20.560> will<00:01:20.770> have<00:01:20.979> our<00:01:21.009> wood<00:01:21.520> chips<00:01:21.850> and<00:01:22.360> that

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
pan we will have our wood chips and that

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.950 
pan we will have our wood chips and that
will<00:01:22.780> create<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.710> heat<00:01:23.920> and<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:24.729> smoke<00:01:24.960> you

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
will create the heat and the smoke you

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.969 
will create the heat and the smoke you
can<00:01:26.140> see<00:01:26.380> how<00:01:27.119> we've<00:01:28.119> designed<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:29.409> door<00:01:29.680> so

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
can see how we've designed the door so

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.179 
can see how we've designed the door so
it<00:01:30.130> nicely<00:01:30.549> fits<00:01:31.390> over<00:01:31.659> the<00:01:32.110> burner<00:01:33.240> neck<00:01:34.240> and

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
it nicely fits over the burner neck and

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.179 
it nicely fits over the burner neck and
still<00:01:36.189> provides<00:01:36.759> a<00:01:37.170> satisfactory<00:01:38.170> air<00:01:38.619> intake

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
still provides a satisfactory air intake

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.969 
still provides a satisfactory air intake
for<00:01:39.909> the<00:01:39.939> burner<00:01:40.210> to<00:01:40.509> operate<00:01:40.960> without<00:01:41.500> that

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
for the burner to operate without that

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.580 
for the burner to operate without that
that<00:01:42.369> aperture<00:01:42.700> being<00:01:43.090> so<00:01:43.360> big<00:01:43.659> that<00:01:43.869> we<00:01:44.409> get<00:01:44.560> a

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
that aperture being so big that we get a

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.139 
that aperture being so big that we get a
gust<00:01:44.770> of<00:01:44.950> wind<00:01:45.009> and<00:01:45.340> will<00:01:45.520> blow<00:01:45.759> the<00:01:45.939> burner

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
gust of wind and will blow the burner

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.740 
gust of wind and will blow the burner
out<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.920> that's<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.189> basic<00:01:48.640> unit<00:01:48.670> it's<00:01:49.509> on

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
out so that's the basic unit it's on

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.330 
out so that's the basic unit it's on
casters<00:01:49.990> for<00:01:50.320> easy<00:01:50.850> maneuverability<00:01:51.850> and

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
casters for easy maneuverability and

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.440 
casters for easy maneuverability and
let's<00:01:54.340> see<00:01:54.610> if<00:01:54.850> we<00:01:55.180> can<00:01:55.479> build<00:01:56.079> one<00:01:57.270> will<00:01:58.270> go

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
let's see if we can build one will go

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.420 
let's see if we can build one will go
through<00:01:58.689> the<00:01:58.840> construction<00:01:59.140> panel<00:01:59.950> by<00:02:00.159> panel
