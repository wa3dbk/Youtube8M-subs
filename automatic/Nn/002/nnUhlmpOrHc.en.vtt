00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.910 
cup so I never come out with a high
stamina<00:03:18.580> bar<00:03:18.970> which<00:03:19.600> is<00:03:19.630> difficult<00:03:20.530> because

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
stamina bar which is difficult because

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.770 
stamina bar which is difficult because
towards<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.459> end<00:03:21.580> of<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.730> game<00:03:21.760> my<00:03:22.299> guys<00:03:22.510> not

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
towards the end of the game my guys not

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.289 
towards the end of the game my guys not
as<00:03:23.019> quick<00:03:23.860> as<00:03:24.160> he<00:03:24.430> is<00:03:24.549> when<00:03:24.730> he<00:03:24.820> starts<00:03:25.150> the

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
as quick as he is when he starts the

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.270 
as quick as he is when he starts the
game<00:03:25.330> so<00:03:26.080> it's<00:03:26.230> difficult<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.890> get<00:03:27.010> goals

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
game so it's difficult to get goals

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.800 
game so it's difficult to get goals
