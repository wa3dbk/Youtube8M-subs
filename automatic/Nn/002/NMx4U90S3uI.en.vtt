00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello everyone this is one of the trio of 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.839
 creepy pastas of this day I hope you 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.960
 like it and do not forget to see the other two 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.030
 captured the desert keeper all 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.969
 started with my foolishness I wanted to come 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.340
 just having a little fun maybe it's 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.230
 good to tell you my story was a 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.119
 any day 'had left 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.279
 coaches school vacation 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.410
 pokémon our parents were great 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.779
 friends and the three of us decided 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.760
 venture into the desert we had 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.859
 talked about it for the whole month 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.960
 we would say that we would go to sleep at home 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.640
 a friend that he had invited us to 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.860
 That day our parents had 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.050
 stayed to sleep in my house because it was already 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.030
 late and they were also drunk with 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.640
 the liquor they got from our card 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.010
 so the time came we left with course 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.410
 to the desert of the routes and then yes 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.539
 I live in today's region at the beginning 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.910
 my friends were endowed what motivated 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.219
 that they were for this but as we 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.500
 We approached the desert began to 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.420
 get nervous when facing the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.550
 sand we thought we saw a couple of figures 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.979
 really macabre that lurked in the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.840
 shadows nobody gave him an immense fear 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.820
 to the point of not wanting to get close 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.259
 to the desert one more step was 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.960
 then when to the distance 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.090
 we heard a strange sound after 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.670
 at last to see the calm we begin to 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.920
 get into the desert a big mistake 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.259
 then it was heard again that 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.209
 sinister sound and she broke into tears 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.340
 begging to return that we should only 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:28.439
 apologize or say that your parents 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.569
 They said they could not at the last minute but 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.310
 I told her that if I wanted I could go to her 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:35.009
 alone that I would not move more than 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.869
 in the desert then I started 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.420
 look for wood when there was hardly 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.310
 gathered a little bit I found a little cat 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.560
 It has dried up so I decided to burn it 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.869
 also when it started to burn I sat down 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.209
 and I told them I will tell a story but not 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.789
 flee if they are afraid they sat down and it was 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:53.069
 when I started it says it does 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.289
 already a long time here in the region of 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:57.539
 young man used to live a pokémon trainer 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.969
 something peculiar he was one of the best 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:03.030
 coaches had a large and varied 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.280
 pokemon team among so many a poster 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.170
 and the region was ravaged by the great 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.750
 battle between the pokemon of the earth 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.090
 crude nor the pokemon of the sea I fall 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.250
 the battle was powerful there was no way 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.590
 of having them this coach had not 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.569
 I went to the support because he found out that 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.670
 his family was at risk in a 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.739
 powerful attack of grow done the soil 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.140
 He suffered an earthquake because of his anger 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.150
 then this coach started to 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.640
 look desperately for his family 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.440
 when suddenly a huge rock was 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.660
 falling from the heights of that 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.370
 elevation I point to an elevation of 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.280
 ground that arose to entries of the 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.350
 desert was then when his capture 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.070
 feeling that his coach was in 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.840
 danger 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.519
 He came out of his little ball and pounced 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.739
 between his coach and the big rock 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.260
 when at last he was able to stop that great 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.970
 rock he could no longer bear the weight of the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.140
 thorns on his back had been 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.450
 buried in his skin 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.030
 It was then that they resisted 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.310
 more capture I was almost unconscious 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.830
 when the rock beat the little force that 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.200
 still had he fell on his coach in 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.360
 an effort to survive him without giving 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.550
 account had absorbed the vital energy 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.530
 of his coach with his thorns 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.390
 then it was when he finally could 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.790
 get rid of that great one 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.640
 imposing rock observed the body of his 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.980
 coach was dry then the father 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.020
 of his coach had gone out to observe 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.330
 what had happened when it was found 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.160
 with that monstrous scene his dead son 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.470
 in the arms of the pokemon that he 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.260
 had given away then he took one of his 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.600
 few balls and told him coldly we've 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.640
 confident we always thought it was the 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.620
 better pokemon than you could be the 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.800
 definitive companion of our son 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.930
 but I was wrong you are a monster 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.690
 then he pulled his cameroon was awesome 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.670
 a nightmare made true that pokemon 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.950
 I had been taught not to attack 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.080
 respect now is my opponent me at 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.970
 I refused to fight but it was 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.340
 then when he started running 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.170
 towards me I avoided it and left the corpse 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.390
 of my old coach on the floor 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.400
 then I received a strong flare in 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.040
 my face and I was burning the 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.260
 pain was unbearable then I took it 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.330
 between my arms absorbing little by little 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.850
 all your vital energy until you leave 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.800
 nothing more than another dry corpse was 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.510
 is when his mother observed me with a 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.000
 expression of terror that there was 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.250
 observed never before then he 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.320
 he shouted he flees and never come back is damn 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.960
 pokemon immediately he started to 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.150
 cry and left for the desert was 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.910
 when he heard a sinister voice tell 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.790
 Kill them you can not not listen 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.440
 understand you kill them I doubtful and drying 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.840
 I did not know what to do 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.090
 when then I observed the distance 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.130
 something that puzzled me were torches 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.680
 the humans were coming for me when 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.450
 then I did not know what to do I found 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.180
 with a small card he told me 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.190
 neglect we will help you invoke 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.590
 a powerful sandstorm and you 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:56.010
 I answered you know that only you can not truth 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.050
 He told me I know but I'm not alone 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.000
 soon hundreds of meat so some cap 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.710
 turns rose from the sand and 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.840
 they left for humans 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.670
 the battle was brutal the blood gushed 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.100
 their bodies of their faces 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.800
 were in pain they were fighting for 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.630
 I was when then everything fell 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.550
 Leader to the village gym the vacada 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.560
 he had come to the call of battle 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.750
 It was when I lost hope 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.940
 his fire type pokemon incinerated 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.190
 those who protected me saw them burn 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.139
 I saw them fall before my eyes 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.870
 witness this I could not react 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:28.770
 as it should be so in a frenzy I went 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.139
 to combat 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.169
 everything was ashes she had a touch to 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:36.590
 One is luma and a gamer and I knew that no 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:39.210
 I could so I took her in my arms 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.550
 absorbing its energy when I let it go 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.800
 it was just a bunch of bones what 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.960
 others had joined the desert when 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.810
 again I heard that voice say 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.520
 well done you are the one of the prophecy you 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.010
 you are to whom this desert has been 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.990
 waiting I did not know what to tell him 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.510
 strange the clearest thing was that it was a 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.820
 Elder did not know how he could be 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.970
 speaking then I asked who are you 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:06.030
 you but he did not answer me I told him 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.310
 you want then he answered you 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.919
 you need here you are the guardian of the 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:13.350
 legend you're cartoon the guardian of 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:15.389
 desert he went on you must 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.340
 protect this place from everyone who 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:19.110
 dare to profane what of all that 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.450
 that it occurs to him to harm any being 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.780
 I live from this place that cartridge did not accept 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.210
 It was 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.340
 then the ashes were being 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.889
 dragged towards him and started a 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.080
 strange ritual the ashes covered my 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:33.600
 body in a strange way was 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.060
 adopting a rather demonic figure 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.860
 my spines were coated on the tip 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.600
 with the blood of humans my 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.940
 entrails will now be ashes 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.889
 That's when that old man said 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.230
 it's time for you to take your place as 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:48.570
 protector of the desert and then that 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.889
 old man became ashes and he 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.139
 joined the desert 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:54.570
 I knew what to do when I was going to leave a 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:56.490
 little more of the desert alone until you can 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:58.710
 see what he had done a note that that 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.169
 cane to whom he offered his help was 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.630
 still ashes could be noticed 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:05.760
 few traits of him then hate me 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.860
 consumed and now every time someone 

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.750
 approached the desert or dared to 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.510
 bring something related to fire 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.580
 happen, look and it would take the same destiny 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:17.550
 that those humans and would join the 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.770
 desert then my friends were more 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:22.020
 that terrified nobody insisted on 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:24.180
 put out the campfire and damián only 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.880
 I wanted to go home I had to make them 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.630
 case was then when a 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.790
 great and imposes 

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.880
 of sandstorm was dragging 

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:34.440
 it made us deep in the desert 

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:37.140
 strange since it should commonly 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.660
 hurt us then they tried to flee but 

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.580
 a large rock blocked the exit 

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:43.650
 we were trapped then he took 

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:46.200
 nayeli crawls towards the parts more 

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:48.210
 dark of the desert I could hear their 

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.040
 cries of terror asking for mercy and 

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:52.440
 help but not all much and it 

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.590
 vanished with a heartbreaking scream was 

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:57.210
 when between shadows damián disappeared 

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:59.400
 now I was left only when 

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:01.950
 accident I fell and then he took me to 

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.780
 I was also that cartoon and in that 

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:06.060
 point knew that everything was already lost 

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:08.280
 It was then that he took us between his 

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.960
 arms and joined us to the good desert 

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.690
