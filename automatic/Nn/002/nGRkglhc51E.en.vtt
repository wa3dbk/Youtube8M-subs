00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.900
 or 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.890
 my novel hello hello so tell 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.480
 we a little bit already what is it that you 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.279
 taken to become a pilot had risen a 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.720
 morning cia lisa and I want to do that it's 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.300
 a child's dream how did it go 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.279
 it's almost that's good already my 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.619
 father was doing level races I'll go 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.629
 more amateurs but it was rallies 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.500
 so it had nothing to do with the 24 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:35.940
 mans hours we race 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.340
 endurance but I always bathed there 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.680
 in and then at the age of 12 I 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.879
 started with karting is 15 years old 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.440
 I started I did not have the license 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.820
 car and yet I started with the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.070
 single seat because on the circuits you 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.239
 can start at the age of 15 I 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.770
 gained a selection called the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.629
 flying elf and then it goes from there 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.100
 until 2002 I did the car 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.079
 I did tests in formula 1 at the 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.579
 end at renault and I forked on 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.770
 full-time endurance from 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.090
 2003 so that's a little over 15 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.710
 years now that you do that what is it 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.369
 who always motivates you what is 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.450
 push to continue every day I 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.700
 think it's good already we have the advantage 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.259
 it's a passion so it's safe to say 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.220
 all day we could say we have 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:11.759
 always an idea in mind is to 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.440
 drive 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.310
 it has nothing to do with football on 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.110
 could say because we do not train 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.670
 not often in quotation marks except we 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.860
 is still there in tried to do 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.149
 the maximum and I think that passion 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.649
 pushes us to always go beyond 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.289
 tried to always do better 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.490
 I come the moment in the idea it's 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.959
 always trying to win or that 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.130
 is the category in general it's done 

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:30.090
 yet thirteen participations and 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.780
 yet when I come here as a 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.459
 like a kid 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.979
 and we are on this circuit 

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:37.259
 mythical mans miss the 24 hours 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.209
 how do you feel about this 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.530
 race and how do you apprehend it 

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:41.910
 mans is a particular race 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.200
 but already for a French like this 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.619
 child you have a pressure anyway 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.539
 huge 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.220
 there are over two thousand spectators there 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.300
 not only defending it's safe but as much 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.920
 tell you that you are with a 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.310
 construct a constructor like here 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.539
 porsche 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.709
 there are many people who you 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.759
 so look at that you still have 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:56.009
 an apprehension 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.479
 so for me I'm doing 24 hours 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.429
 all year it starts in January at 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.770
 daytona it goes after 24 hours spa 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.030
 24 hours do not win in Germany 24 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.410
 mans hours so that's my job 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.459
 as if you every day when you 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.679
 go work from me it's the same 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.179
 but you have a little pressure 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.619
 more that is the pressure of the result that 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.920
 it is obvious that it is certain that the lack of 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.980
 win in 2010 it's my opinion mama this 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.270
 who scored me the most but still I 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.590
 had to win a race like the 12 hours 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.700
 sebring for example in the united states 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.230
 which is a classic endurance 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.700
 a bit like the masters if they wanted 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.210
 what are some of the most 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.130
 big races 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.450
 this one was in 2008 it was a very 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.890
 very good memory and then after 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.960
 sales 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.310
 of nÃ¼rburgring in germany which is 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.630
 yet who are yet reserved 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.680
 only to the Germans where there had never been 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.200
 in France and who had imposed 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.490
 won it's four times now so what 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.130
 are classics for us but 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.319
 every win gier has his little trick in 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.360
 more to the something you have left 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.980
 so race driver is a sport 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.180
 individual but that comes from a sport 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.430
 collective because everyone has 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.840
 invested around that I know for you the 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.970
 work of equipped in the heart of ta 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.530
 mindset your state of mind it's 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.090
 obligatory you already know good sharing 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.350
 here the car with three pilots one is 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.030
 of 1 closed three pilots in everything with 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.440
 two teammates and myself so already 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.030
 you must be good 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.070
 you have to make compromises that this 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.510
 either on the driving position that this 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.730
 either on the settings that it is on 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.650
 for example you will prefer 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.880
 drive there are some at night 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.280
 others on other days 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.900
 so all that needs to be very open 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.530
 because if you are not that it does not 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.900
 can not walk 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.360
 and then after behind there you had 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.220
 81 100 people who are there his share of 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.360
 engineers his mechanics share his share 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.160
 people who will take care that 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.140
 Zion engines that deals only with tires 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.970
 and all these guys there if you can not get 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.500
 not to put them with you in the same 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.640
 boat but sooner or later you have to 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.930
 end of 22 hours when you have 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.280
 really fed up with hearing noise and 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.900
 cars because it's still 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.060
 long well these guys here they go 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.320
 crack so no you really have to 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.239
 to get solder everyone is 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.799
 very important to just try to 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.299
 to make the best race possible a 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.709
 little indiscretion the life of a pilot 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.329
 what is a lot of rest 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.340
 a lot of sport how does it work 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.799
 how would not it be no it's a lot of 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.329
 people's journeys today it's 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.489
 become so professional that has 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.630
 enormously deaths in fact you come here 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.829
 to the 24 hours of mans in moody's is 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.390
 a good one it lasts 24 hours but what it 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.320
 must know is that before you have 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.269
 done three or four times 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.769
 these 24 hours being prepared on a 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.239
 circuit abroad or 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.340
 times to paul ricard in France or otherwise 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.420
 abu dhabi and so it is you prepare 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.950
 already too much four times these 24 hours 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.989
 before you do simulations this 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.590
 which we call more private trials of 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.600
 tires etc 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.120
 so that's more I could say in 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.130
 the year 160 days of flying and the 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.840
 rest of the year when you are at home 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.210
 you or otherwise you are traveling between two 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.800
 circuits so it's been 12 years since you were 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.419
 professional what can we do 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.500
 wish for the continuation that it continues 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.800
 that it goes further from others 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.960
 ambitions finally for me that it continues 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.669
 certainly a good level because I think the 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.229
 day you feel that it's in the process of 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.590
 no longer at the level it is better 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.720
 Stop 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.919
 I'm just in the middle of my 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.129
 career one could say in endurance 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.770
 or be able to ride at 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:45.360
 a very good level as 45 years the good 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.009
 it's all professionalized when I 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.249
 have already told you so necessarily we are 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:51.179
 we are very controlled so yes I hope 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:52.709
 that it will continue a few more 

00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:54.449
 years necessarily to win the mans with 

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:55.769
 porsche on my goal is to win 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.969
 a race called the 24 hours 

00:04:55.769 --> 00:04:58.830
 of daytona that never actually won 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:00.839
 no one ever has the world to win 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.729
 all the 24 hour races and I 

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:03.689
 am the only one i think yes miss the 24 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.459
 hours of daytona so I hope someday 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:07.289
 the rows lined up and like that I say and 

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:07.679
 the loop is complete I can take my 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.589
 retirement 

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:12.330
 so here is now between thank you for 

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:15.080
 this new interview and then in 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.080
 a chance for the future 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.390
 or
