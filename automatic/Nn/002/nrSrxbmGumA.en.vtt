00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 klaus allofs the last season was one 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.130
 very difficult one can say that too 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.540
 the joy of playing by claudio pizarro 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.410
 so a bit out of that 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.179
 has pulled down sump all 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.089
 Players are involved in it, of course 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.740
 as well as claudia last year too 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.029
 others hum our bad 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.770
 Season should be involved now 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.930
 of course also on the good start 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.859
 Last year, Claudio was involved 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.170
 often injured 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.029
 had five or six muscle injuries 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.289
 and he missed us a lot and that was 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.750
 Of course with a reason for that 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.070
 did not go that way and now he is 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.420
 although he is back with one 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.130
 injury started in the season 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.590
 he does not have the season preparation 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.570
 can fully participate is now in 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.730
 a very good constitution and that 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.040
 Of course, ours immediately improves 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.660
 The atmosphere is also in the game 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.640
 team responsible I mean it means 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.000
 always the slit ear and the radiates 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.440
 always a lot of happiness 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.020
 Of course, it's only one 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.550
 leader and look to him 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.020
 of course especially the young ones 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.449
 players look up to him and and 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.430
 are also based on him and he is 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.049
 just a happy person the one 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.970
 just for the mood within the 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.430
 Group with responsible without there 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.659
 Now I'll tell the clown 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:16.290
 his but his form or or 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.790
 or even believe his makeup 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.409
 I play a big role because 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.280
 There are many players on him 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.560
 orientate 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.270
 He has been playing in the past eight 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.369
 five goals scored last season 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.229
 that was eminently important in the end 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.659
 for Werder bremen you can say that he 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.650
 his own crisis as well as that of 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.540
 werner mastered his crisis 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.310
 was basically a crisis of 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.600
 injuries that he that he as just 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.670
 never his 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.130
 a complete performance has to retrieve 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.020
 He too must be one hundred percent fit 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.610
 to be so good at playing it in the 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.280
 moment makes and that is first 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.450
 endured that would be important to the 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.220
 meantime has again peru 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.330
 played that 's just one for him 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.950
 an important thing is one 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.810
 heart affair and all that 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.090
 Together it makes him easy 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.399
 I feel well and that feels good 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.860
 can help and he is just a good one 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.500
 player and me summer when he is fit 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.209
 then he will always shoot his gates 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.489
 past season as it then 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.140
 They also have extreme defeat 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.069
 Penitrants ask for the trainer 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.300
 heard how to deal with it 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.769
 for us, of course, so busy 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.840
 that is clear that one always that we 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.769
 have to analyze what is s why 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.459
 we do not win anymore or why 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.430
 work things in the 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.830
 Past has worked very well 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.690
 do not have more and there you can too 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.569
 Do not stop at the coach then 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.720
 but there we are very much 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.060
 who often have very long 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.019
 so that's just trying that too 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.840
 to get to the bottom of things 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.450
 but also in the phase than then 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.980
 has been demanded who must act 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.450
 and now you have to be like many 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.640
 other pressures on the times now 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.650
 We changed trainer always and 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.120
 if I say this, that applies to the 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.870
 entire management and also for 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.730
 the supervisory board 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.380
 we were always convinced that 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.329
 Thomas creates the right man and is 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.920
 that he is the best coach for us 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.320
 and that we if you're in the west needs 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.750
 you do not look for the second best one has 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.650
 then generally in such a situation 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.720
 existential fears or know one due 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.680
 the experience of the past 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.079
 this will turn on sometime 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.840
 again for the good 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:24.320
 yes you never know that 's it too 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.579
 enough possibilities of comparison or 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.200
 or experiences you in the 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.209
 Past has collected with others 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.989
 clubs they never expected 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.200
 had 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.640
 to get into trouble so that one 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.160
 not on the safe side we were 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.560
 Of course, extremely confident than we 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.440
 We have a good team 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.560
 were also sure to know what it was 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.580
 has lain 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.260
 we have a lot of injured players 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.819
 had and that has a role 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.410
 played by therefore we were very 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:53.489
 Confident but existential fear is 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.349
 maybe a bit far-fetched 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.349
 but of course you do it already 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.910
 arge thoughts because to the sun of course 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.200
 comes from a very different level when 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.599
 you previously played champions league 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.980
 always actually around the front 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.870
 has played in the league and 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.190
 when you're in the bottom and yourself 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.140
 at least sometimes thought about the 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.540
 second league then have to do then 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.550
 not so pleasant a thought 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.739
 which one has and I know that 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.940
 of course also in the environment and and that 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.200
 are the games but thats also the ones 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.600
 Employees in a club 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.620
 that, of course, will worry too 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.450
 not exactly low 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.310
 that is all the more surprising for many 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.540
 the lever now moved so abruptly 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.130
 been's not so abruptly 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.630
 it would not have been the final phase of the 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.820
 championship we have many things 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.050
 already done better and I believe that 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.550
 the lever in the reason already in the 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.380
 Training camp in winter training camp 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.060
 the last season has been turned over 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.889
 but that's not all 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.960
 immediately acts now it is again 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.340
 naturally reinforced by a 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.840
 some restructuring in the 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.100
 team we have with the 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.350
 we have good obligations 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.300
 that fits well together and that 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.979
 has now accelerated again but 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.660
 I believe that we are already one 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.130
 good half year on the right track 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.050
 have given 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.080
 what is the goal in this season the 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.700
 championship win every game that 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.120
 is our goal but that one after the other and 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.100
 so what 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.310
 What we can achieve then we have to 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.169
 we see we know that we are not on any 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.580
 may deliver less than us 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.510
 have done that now to succeed 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.010
 to be 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.229
 which has been playing in with 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.210
 exception from the leverkusen game has that 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:26.100
 works well and there we want 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.780
 carry on and I believe that we 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.550
 that we have a team with 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.590
 great potential that is one 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.419
 interesting mix of experienced 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.979
 but also many boys 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.510
 players who have come too and 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.039
 Of course we want to continue that 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.180
 develop and you have to see what you do 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.919
 what you have achieved depends on it 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.000
 a little bit so off the competition though 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:43.740
 It also depends on us if we have this 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.230
 This is what makes us special in particular 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.200
 totally gone last year 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.730
 that we restore them and then 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.230
 then I am quite confident that 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.560
 We at least in the upper third 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.560
 are
