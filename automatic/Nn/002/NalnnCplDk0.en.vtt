00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:20.770 

get<00:02:12.190> off<00:02:12.480> until<00:02:13.480> it

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:41.820 

doesn't<00:02:21.620> come<00:02:21.770> out

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.100 

just<00:02:42.520> let<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:42.880> know<00:02:43.030> at<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.420> back<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:47.080> is

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
just let you know at the back it is

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:54.949 
just let you know at the back it is
connected

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:02.030 

but<00:02:55.469> is<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.769> VGA<00:02:59.959> just<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.140> show<00:03:01.349> that<00:03:01.379> it's

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
but is the VGA just to show that it's

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.009 
but is the VGA just to show that it's
not<00:03:02.280> because<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:03.060> don't<00:03:03.209> know<00:03:03.420> how<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.599> connect

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
not because I don't know how to connect

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.559 
not because I don't know how to connect
my<00:03:04.230> monitor

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
my monitor

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:13.660 
my monitor
definitely

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.660 

take<00:03:14.270> off

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
take off

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.390

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
then that one again nothing for that to

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.080 
then that one again nothing for that to
come<00:03:21.580> out<00:03:21.820> and

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:40.470 

then<00:03:26.750> I<00:03:26.870> click<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.170> source

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480
