just banging a few holes along the
bottom<00:00:47.520> rung<00:00:54.199> okay<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.410> then<00:00:56.160> across<00:00:56.690> just<00:00:57.690> a

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
bottom rung okay and then across just a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.029

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
couple down in the bottom you get the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.460 
couple down in the bottom you get the
idea<00:01:02.430> what<00:01:03.120> I'm<00:01:03.239> doing<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.600> I'm<00:01:03.750> creating<00:01:03.989> a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
idea what I'm doing is I'm creating a

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.640 
idea what I'm doing is I'm creating a
shower<00:01:05.369> head<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.659> would<00:01:09.840> probably<00:01:10.140> want

shower head and I would probably want

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.190 
shower head and I would probably want
this<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.010> be<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.210> larger<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.810> could<00:01:13.049> take

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
this to be a larger can so I could take

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.130 
this to be a larger can so I could take
a<00:01:13.229> little<00:01:13.439> bit<00:01:13.650> longer<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.400> shower<00:01:15.110> with<00:01:16.110> a

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
wire or a rope I could hang this from a

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.260 
wire or a rope I could hang this from a
tree<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.990> pour<00:01:19.500> some<00:01:19.740> nice<00:01:19.920> warm<00:01:20.430> water<00:01:20.670> into
