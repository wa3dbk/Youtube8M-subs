00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.320 
flavor the inside looks beautiful it's
like<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:21.080> Marbley<00:02:21.740> of<00:02:21.890> some<00:02:22.130> sort<00:02:22.490> now<00:02:23.000> that<00:02:23.180> I'm

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
like a Marbley of some sort now that I'm

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.460 
like a Marbley of some sort now that I'm
starting<00:02:23.630> to<00:02:23.660> think<00:02:23.750> about<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:24.170> I'm<00:02:24.260> starting

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
starting to think about it I'm starting

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.780 
starting to think about it I'm starting
to<00:02:24.590> think<00:02:24.770> this<00:02:24.920> is<00:02:25.070> some<00:02:25.220> sort<00:02:25.460> of<00:02:25.520> coffee

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
to think this is some sort of coffee

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.050 
to think this is some sort of coffee
cake<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.950> don't<00:02:27.950> know<00:02:28.160> what<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.490> flavor<00:02:28.820> is

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
cake I don't know what that flavor is

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.699 
cake I don't know what that flavor is
but<00:02:29.270> it's<00:02:29.390> good<00:02:29.660> that<00:02:30.580> is<00:02:31.580> pretty<00:02:32.000> good

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
but it's good that is pretty good

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.050 
but it's good that is pretty good
guessing<00:02:33.709> by<00:02:34.130> looking<00:02:34.730> at<00:02:34.910> this<00:02:35.530> candy<00:02:36.530> on<00:02:36.920> top

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
guessing by looking at this candy on top

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.230 
guessing by looking at this candy on top
I'm<00:02:38.060> thinking<00:02:38.630> this<00:02:38.810> is<00:02:39.050> lemon<00:02:39.800> has<00:02:40.610> speckles

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.330 
I'm thinking this is lemon has speckles
of<00:02:41.450> lemon<00:02:41.959> zest<00:02:42.200> in<00:02:42.380> here<00:02:42.440> which<00:02:42.740> looks<00:02:42.920> so

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
of lemon zest in here which looks so

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.260 
of lemon zest in here which looks so
pretty<00:02:43.910> like<00:02:44.209> confetti<00:02:45.610> if<00:02:46.610> this<00:02:46.880> is<00:02:47.120> not

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
pretty like confetti if this is not

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.750 
pretty like confetti if this is not
