00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
clips though but anyway that's what you

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.270 
clips though but anyway that's what you
do<00:00:35.340> pretty<00:00:35.670> much<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.469> I've<00:00:37.469> you've<00:00:37.770> done<00:00:38.010> that

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
be supposed to be getting like pretty

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.560 
be supposed to be getting like pretty
decent<00:00:43.410> drops<00:00:43.680> but<00:00:44.040> if<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.030> seek<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.420> this

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
decent drops but if you seek on this

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.360 
decent drops but if you seek on this
