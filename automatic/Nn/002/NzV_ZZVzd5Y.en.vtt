00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
characters on screen I think in this

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.679 
characters on screen I think in this
demo<00:01:21.869> there's<00:01:22.140> about<00:01:22.320> 1200<00:01:22.979> zombies<00:01:23.479> on<00:01:24.479> the

strip that you see but that's where

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.020 
strip that you see but that's where
we're<00:01:26.460> not<00:01:26.490> limited<00:01:26.970> by<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.270> by<00:01:27.420> any<00:01:27.570> means

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
we're not limited by that by any means

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.450 
we're not limited by that by any means
now<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.390> time<00:01:31.170> limit<00:01:31.500> was<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.650> big<00:01:31.890> factor<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
now a time limit was a big factor in the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.370 
now a time limit was a big factor in the
original<00:01:32.640> game<00:01:32.909> are<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:33.750> getting<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.140> back

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
original game are we getting that back

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.440 
original game are we getting that back
in<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.680> game<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.250> what's<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.820> context<00:01:36.299> this

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
in this game and what's the context this

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.289 
in this game and what's the context this
time<00:01:36.829> yeah<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.979> time<00:01:38.430> limit<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.850> back<00:01:39.060> i<00:01:39.240> think

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
time yeah the time limit is back i think

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.940 
time yeah the time limit is back i think
that's<00:01:39.570> integral<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.710> Dead

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
that's integral to the to the Dead

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.389 
that's integral to the to the Dead
Rising<00:01:41.210> universe<00:01:42.530> time<00:01:43.530> progresses<00:01:44.009> the
