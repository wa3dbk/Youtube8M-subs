and<00:00:00.510> today<00:00:00.780> we're<00:00:00.930> going<00:00:01.020> to<00:00:01.110> be<00:00:01.170> dissecting

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
and today we're going to be dissecting

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.590 
and today we're going to be dissecting
sharks<00:00:02.750> and<00:00:03.920> this<00:00:04.920> is<00:00:05.160> my<00:00:05.339> interpretation<00:00:05.819> of

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
sharks and this is my interpretation of

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.430 
sharks and this is my interpretation of
the<00:00:06.720> term<00:00:06.899> okay<00:00:07.680> this<00:00:08.400> is<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.820> by<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.450> way<00:00:09.599> the

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
the term okay this is the by the way the

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.320 
the term okay this is the by the way the
pectoral<00:00:10.980> fins<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.460> pelvic<00:00:11.790> fins<00:00:11.969> are<00:00:12.179> down

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
pectoral fins the pelvic fins are down

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.509 
pectoral fins the pelvic fins are down
here<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.559> body<00:00:13.769> this<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.309> where<00:00:14.490> all

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
here this is the body this is where all

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.060 
here this is the body this is where all
the<00:00:14.759> fun<00:00:14.910> stuff<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.420> okay<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:16.650> order<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.949> get

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
the fun stuff is okay in order to get

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.680 
the fun stuff is okay in order to get
into<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.460> you're<00:00:17.970> gonna<00:00:18.060> make<00:00:18.270> an<00:00:18.390> incision

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
into that you're gonna make an incision

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.429 
into that you're gonna make an incision
down<00:00:18.869> here<00:00:19.380> cut<00:00:19.650> up<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.160> just<00:00:20.609> above<00:00:21.000> where<00:00:21.060> the

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
down here cut up to just above where the

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.900 
down here cut up to just above where the
pectoral<00:00:22.439> fins<00:00:22.680> are<00:00:22.920> cut<00:00:23.400> across<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:23.850> way

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
pectoral fins are cut across this way

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.609 
pectoral fins are cut across this way
cut<00:00:24.330> across<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.720> way<00:00:24.779> cut<00:00:25.140> across<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:25.560> way

cut<00:00:25.949> across<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.340> way<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:27.210> will<00:00:27.330> open<00:00:27.480> up

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
cut across this way and it will open up

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:46.130 
cut across this way and it will open up
like<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.960> book<00:00:43.700> I've<00:00:44.700> dissected<00:00:44.940> probably<00:00:45.690> oh

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
like a book I've dissected probably oh

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.900 
like a book I've dissected probably oh
five<00:00:46.710> hundred<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> thousand<00:00:47.520> sharks<00:00:47.700> over

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
five hundred to a thousand sharks over

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:59.360 
five hundred to a thousand sharks over
the<00:00:48.059> years<00:00:56.930> well<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.770> mean<00:00:58.890> either<00:00:59.010> this

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
the years well and I mean either this

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.740 
the years well and I mean either this
this<00:00:59.609> blade<00:00:59.879> has<00:01:00.059> gone<00:01:00.239> through<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.510> lot<00:01:00.539> of

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
this blade has gone through a lot of

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.970 
this blade has gone through a lot of
shark<00:01:00.930> skin<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.379> same<00:01:01.530> one<00:01:01.680> I'm<00:01:01.770> using

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
shark skin it's the same one I'm using

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.380 
shark skin it's the same one I'm using
since<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.309> beginning<00:01:02.640> but<00:01:02.820> if<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.180> blade

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
since the beginning but if the blade

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.200 
since the beginning but if the blade
does<00:01:03.600> get<00:01:03.780> duller<00:01:03.989> over<00:01:04.409> over<00:01:04.860> time<00:01:05.070> soon<00:01:05.430> but

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
does get duller over over time soon but

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.850 
does get duller over over time soon but
when<00:01:07.049> you're<00:01:07.170> cutting<00:01:07.470> through<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> bigger

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
when you're cutting through the bigger

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:17.899 
when you're cutting through the bigger
ones<00:01:08.100> got<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> lot<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.000> cartilage<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:16.400> it<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.610> not

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
ones got a lot of cartilage to it is not

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.810 
ones got a lot of cartilage to it is not
just<00:01:18.330> for<00:01:18.659> processing<00:01:19.560> stuff<00:01:19.770> internally<00:01:20.189> but

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
just for processing stuff internally but

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.270 
just for processing stuff internally but
also<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.390> exploitation<00:01:21.990> device<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:23.040> liver

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
also it is exploitation device the liver

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.560 
also it is exploitation device the liver
is<00:01:23.430> still<00:01:23.520> with<00:01:23.729> those<00:01:23.850> oils<00:01:24.240> which<00:01:24.390> what

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
is still with those oils which what

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.539 
is still with those oils which what
keeps<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.960> shark<00:01:25.170> from<00:01:25.290> just<00:01:25.530> sinking<00:01:25.860> think

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
keeps the shark from just sinking think

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.890 
keeps the shark from just sinking think
about<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:26.970> does<00:01:27.119> not<00:01:27.150> have<00:01:27.299> an<00:01:27.540> air<00:01:27.659> bladder

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
about it it does not have an air bladder

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.380 
about it it does not have an air bladder
like<00:01:28.380> most<00:01:28.770> fish<00:01:29.009> dude<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.970> has<00:01:30.150> these<00:01:30.329> huge

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
like most fish dude so it has these huge

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.840 
like most fish dude so it has these huge
livers<00:01:31.020> now<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.640> case<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.960> guy<00:01:34.850> their

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
livers now in the case of this guy their

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.140 
livers now in the case of this guy their
livers<00:01:36.210> are<00:01:36.600> at<00:01:36.990> least<00:01:37.470> 20%<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.520> their

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
livers are at least 20% of their

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.140 
livers are at least 20% of their
internal<00:01:39.750> anatomy<00:01:40.350> if<00:01:40.680> not<00:01:40.920> more<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.759> cells

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
internal anatomy if not more the cells

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.790 
internal anatomy if not more the cells
on<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.600> outside<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:43.259> your<00:01:43.290> sharks

interesting and it is the digestive
system<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.430> system<00:02:25.850> starts<00:02:26.180> up<00:02:26.300> at<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.630> mouth

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
system the system starts up at the mouth

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.110 
system the system starts up at the mouth
up<00:02:27.560> behind<00:02:28.190> where<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.550> heart<00:02:28.730> is<00:02:28.850> there's

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
up behind where the heart is there's

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.430 
up behind where the heart is there's
gonna<00:02:29.210> be<00:02:29.360> an<00:02:29.450> esophagus<00:02:29.930> which<00:02:30.110> will<00:02:30.290> lead

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
gonna be an esophagus which will lead

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.320 
gonna be an esophagus which will lead
into<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.830> stomach<00:02:31.190> that's<00:02:31.670> what<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.120> first

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.070 
there isn't it is not fat what you will
see<00:02:39.710> is<00:02:39.950> rugae<00:02:40.430> which<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.240> rugae<00:02:41.630> are<00:02:41.870> the

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
see is rugae which the rugae are the

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.890 
see is rugae which the rugae are the
ridges<00:02:42.530> inside<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.550> stomach<00:02:43.910> if<00:02:44.600> your

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
ridges inside the stomach if your

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.040 
ridges inside the stomach if your
stomach<00:02:45.260> is<00:02:45.440> full<00:02:45.860> no<00:02:46.760> rugae<00:02:47.150> because<00:02:47.720> it's

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
stomach is full no rugae because it's

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.420 
stomach is full no rugae because it's
been<00:02:48.230> expanded<00:02:48.770> in<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:48.890> rugae<00:02:49.190> has<00:02:49.310> been

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
been expanded in the rugae has been

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.160 
been expanded in the rugae has been
flattened<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.300> rugae<00:02:50.630> are<00:02:50.720> designed<00:02:51.050> to

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
flattened the rugae are designed to

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.650 
flattened the rugae are designed to
increase<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:52.100> areas<00:02:52.520> for<00:02:52.730> digestion<00:02:53.209> okay<00:02:54.610> so

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
increase the areas for digestion okay so

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.699 
increase the areas for digestion okay so
when<00:02:56.660> you<00:02:56.750> come<00:02:56.930> up<00:02:56.959> with<00:02:57.080> your<00:02:57.290> stomach<00:02:57.590> you

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
when you come up with your stomach you

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.620 
when you come up with your stomach you
might<00:02:57.860> see<00:02:58.010> some<00:02:58.190> interesting<00:02:58.370> stuff<00:02:58.820> the

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
might see some interesting stuff the

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.540 
might see some interesting stuff the
next<00:02:59.989> thing<00:03:00.170> is<00:03:00.350> it<00:03:00.530> goes<00:03:00.680> down<00:03:00.920> into<00:03:01.190> the

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
next thing is it goes down into the

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.910 
next thing is it goes down into the
small<00:03:01.850> intestine<00:03:02.390> our<00:03:02.750> small<00:03:03.050> intestine<00:03:03.560> 20

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
small intestine our small intestine 20

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.640 
small intestine our small intestine 20
plus<00:03:04.130> feet<00:03:04.370> it's<00:03:04.850> small<00:03:05.150> intestine<00:03:05.660> not<00:03:06.500> even

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
plus feet it's small intestine not even

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.850 
plus feet it's small intestine not even
a<00:03:06.680> foot<00:03:06.890> okay<00:03:07.959> it<00:03:08.959> then<00:03:09.200> moves<00:03:09.440> into<00:03:09.739> the

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
a foot okay it then moves into the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.830 
a foot okay it then moves into the
spiral<00:03:10.130> valve<00:03:10.459> an<00:03:10.670> intense<00:03:11.090> spiral<00:03:11.630> valve

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
spiral valve an intense spiral valve

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.990 
spiral valve an intense spiral valve
intestine<00:03:12.530> which<00:03:13.190> you<00:03:13.459> think<00:03:13.670> that's<00:03:13.910> the

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
intestine which you think that's the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.120 
intestine which you think that's the
large<00:03:14.150> intestine<00:03:14.690> but<00:03:14.780> actually<00:03:15.260> that<00:03:15.830> is<00:03:16.010> the

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
large intestine but actually that is the

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.440 
large intestine but actually that is the
area<00:03:16.459> where<00:03:16.580> most<00:03:16.760> of<00:03:16.970> your<00:03:17.090> absorption

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
area where most of your absorption

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.420 
area where most of your absorption
occurs<00:03:17.660> if<00:03:18.470> you<00:03:18.650> think<00:03:18.860> of<00:03:18.950> a<00:03:19.010> spiral

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
occurs if you think of a spiral

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.820 
occurs if you think of a spiral
staircase<00:03:19.700> a<00:03:20.120> really<00:03:20.780> big<00:03:20.989> spiral<00:03:21.260> staircase

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
staircase a really big spiral staircase

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.920 
staircase a really big spiral staircase
that's<00:03:22.400> basically<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.150> way<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.450> food<00:03:23.630> moves

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
that's basically the way the food moves

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.979 
that's basically the way the food moves
through<00:03:24.260> its<00:03:24.560> spiral<00:03:25.160> valve<00:03:25.340> intestine<00:03:25.989> again

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
through its spiral valve intestine again

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:33.119 
through its spiral valve intestine again
increased<00:03:27.470> surface<00:03:27.680> area

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
eggs which is possible that we're gonna

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.509 
eggs which is possible that we're gonna
find<00:04:10.700> lots<00:04:11.209> of<00:04:11.329> little<00:04:11.540> embryos<00:04:12.099> or<00:04:13.099> we<00:04:13.340> might

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
find lots of little embryos or we might

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.210 
find lots of little embryos or we might
find<00:04:13.790> more<00:04:14.000> but<00:04:14.959> this<00:04:15.230> morning<00:04:15.590> we<00:04:15.859> actually

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
find more but this morning we actually

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.860 
find more but this morning we actually
had<00:04:16.370> sharks<00:04:16.759> which<00:04:17.090> actually<00:04:17.539> had<00:04:17.690> some

had sharks which actually had some

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.259 
had sharks which actually had some
development<00:04:18.320> on<00:04:18.410> them<00:04:18.789> okay<00:04:19.789> so<00:04:19.849> you<00:04:20.060> never

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
development on them okay so you never

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.140
