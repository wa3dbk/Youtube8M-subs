here we are back again I want to answer
a<00:00:08.020> couple<00:00:08.260> of<00:00:08.440> questions<00:00:08.500> that<00:00:09.010> were<00:00:09.580> brought

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:09.850 
a couple of questions that were brought

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.660 
a couple of questions that were brought
up<00:00:10.500> again<00:00:11.500> this<00:00:11.620> is<00:00:11.770> the<00:00:11.860> footswitch<00:00:12.309> that<00:00:12.639> I

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
up again this is the footswitch that I

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.600 
up again this is the footswitch that I
used<00:00:13.629> and<00:00:13.959> here<00:00:14.559> is<00:00:14.680> the<00:00:14.889> switch<00:00:15.309> that's

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
used and here is the switch that's

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.620 
used and here is the switch that's
toggle<00:00:16.450> switch<00:00:16.690> that<00:00:17.560> switches<00:00:18.070> between<00:00:18.630> full

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
toggle switch that switches between full

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.580 
toggle switch that switches between full
speed<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:21.279> variable<00:00:22.090> speed<00:00:22.140> if<00:00:23.140> it's<00:00:23.320> in<00:00:23.500> the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
speed and variable speed if it's in the

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.099

pole<00:00:23.769> speed<00:00:24.070> mode<00:00:24.340> as<00:00:24.519> soon<00:00:24.730> as<00:00:24.849> I<00:00:24.910> touch<00:00:25.150> it<00:00:25.359> it

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:26.109 
pole speed mode as soon as I touch it it

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.470 
pole speed mode as soon as I touch it it
goes<00:00:26.289> off<00:00:26.560> in<00:00:26.769> full<00:00:27.009> speed<00:00:27.369> and<00:00:27.970> when<00:00:28.150> you<00:00:28.269> push

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
goes off in full speed and when you push

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.710 
goes off in full speed and when you push
it<00:00:28.630> back<00:00:28.660> down<00:00:28.869> now<00:00:29.859> it's<00:00:30.099> adjustable<00:00:33.720> the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
it back down now it's adjustable the

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.950 
it back down now it's adjustable the
other<00:00:34.840> thing<00:00:35.140> was<00:00:35.350> it<00:00:35.950> was<00:00:36.070> asked<00:00:36.550> if<00:00:36.640> this<00:00:36.820> was

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
other thing was it was asked if this was

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.160 
other thing was it was asked if this was
had<00:00:37.960> both<00:00:38.230> shaft<00:00:38.559> driven<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:40.239> it<00:00:40.629> is<00:00:40.870> both

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
had both shaft driven and it is both

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.350 
had both shaft driven and it is both
chef-driven

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.970 

both<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.570> top<00:00:47.810> and<00:00:48.020> the<00:00:48.080> bottom<00:00:48.200> shift<00:00:48.650> are

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
both the top and the bottom shift are

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.670 
both the top and the bottom shift are
driven<00:00:49.400> so<00:00:49.970> I'll<00:00:50.510> show<00:00:50.810> you<00:00:50.840> some<00:00:50.960> bead

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
driven so I'll show you some bead

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.390 
driven so I'll show you some bead
rolling<00:00:52.130> now<00:00:52.840> here's<00:00:53.840> a<00:00:53.989> narrow<00:00:54.710> die<00:00:55.100> that

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
rolling now here's a narrow die that

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:11.100 
rolling now here's a narrow die that
I've<00:00:55.520> made<00:00:56.230> do<00:00:57.230> some<00:00:57.500> narrow<00:00:58.130> beading

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:26.819 

adjusted<00:01:12.110> deeper

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.350 

and<00:01:27.829> if<00:01:28.250> you<00:01:28.369> want<00:01:28.549> to<00:01:28.610> go<00:01:28.700> deeper<00:01:29.090> than<00:01:29.149> that

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
and if you want to go deeper than that

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:44.679 
and if you want to go deeper than that
you<00:01:29.539> can<00:01:29.689> just<00:01:29.930> it<00:01:30.110> down<00:01:30.289> some<00:01:30.530> more

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.940 

see<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.840> raises<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.859> up<00:01:46.979> quite<00:01:47.219> a<00:01:47.280> bit<00:01:48.950> you

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
see it raises it up quite a bit you

00:01:49.950 --> 00:02:12.880 
see it raises it up quite a bit you
still<00:01:50.280> go<00:01:50.429> down<00:01:50.460> more<00:01:51.149> if<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.420> want

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.800 

there's<00:02:13.890> another<00:02:14.160> bead<00:02:14.850> I<00:02:15.060> that<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.360> made<00:02:15.600> is

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
there's another bead I that I made is

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.140 
there's another bead I that I made is
kind<00:02:16.020> of<00:02:16.110> deep<00:02:16.320> you<00:02:16.950> can<00:02:17.160> adjust<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.640> depth<00:02:17.910> on

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
kind of deep you can adjust the depth on

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.800 
kind of deep you can adjust the depth on
it<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:19.070> make<00:02:20.070> it<00:02:20.100> as<00:02:20.310> deep<00:02:20.490> as<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.790> want<00:02:20.820> as

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
it and make it as deep as you want as

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:31.910 
it and make it as deep as you want as
you're<00:02:22.080> going<00:02:25.580> shallow<00:02:28.250> groove<00:02:30.650> just<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.860> a

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
you're going shallow groove just it a

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.540 
you're going shallow groove just it a
little<00:02:32.040> bit

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:52.750 

and<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.090> deeper<00:02:40.010> or<00:02:41.010> adjust<00:02:41.550> it<00:02:41.670> down<00:02:41.910> some<00:02:42.180> more

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.020 

even<00:02:53.760> deeper<00:02:54.740> the<00:02:55.740> deeper<00:02:56.100> goes<00:02:56.340> costs<00:02:56.940> that's

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
even deeper the deeper goes costs that's

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.920 
even deeper the deeper goes costs that's
going<00:02:57.210> to<00:02:57.270> make<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.570> panel<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:57.960> lot<00:02:58.140> more<00:02:58.320> rigid

here's<00:03:03.930> another<00:03:04.230> real<00:03:04.530> thin<00:03:04.830> dye<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.340> made

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
here's another real thin dye that I made

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.630 
here's another real thin dye that I made
with<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.920> ultra<00:03:07.920> high<00:03:08.040> molecular<00:03:08.070> weight

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
with the ultra high molecular weight

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.750 
with the ultra high molecular weight
plastic<00:03:09.060> diet<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.680> tipping<00:03:11.100> beginning<00:03:11.640> you

plastic diet the tipping beginning you

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.150 
plastic diet the tipping beginning you
use<00:03:11.940> this<00:03:12.210> one<00:03:12.480> or<00:03:12.630> that<00:03:12.660> deep<00:03:13.410> V<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.830> I<00:03:13.860> used

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
use this one or that deep V that I used

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.370 
use this one or that deep V that I used
a<00:03:14.280> minute<00:03:14.550> ago<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:17.480> just<00:03:18.480> put<00:03:18.960> it<00:03:19.050> in<00:03:19.140> there

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
a minute ago you just put it in there

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:26.540 
a minute ago you just put it in there
and<00:03:19.470> push<00:03:19.680> up<00:03:19.890> on<00:03:20.100> it<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.520> then<00:03:20.790> follow

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.820 

begins<00:03:27.550> with<00:03:27.670> them<00:03:28.030> bend<00:03:28.810> it<00:03:28.990> you<00:03:29.200> just

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
begins with them bend it you just

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:40.210 
begins with them bend it you just
continued

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.270 

you<00:03:40.730> start<00:03:41.120> to<00:03:41.270> bend<00:03:41.450> the<00:03:41.570> metal<00:03:41.630> a<00:03:42.280> little

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
you start to bend the metal a little

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:52.000 
you start to bend the metal a little
more

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:04:07.120 

almost<00:03:52.640> a<00:03:52.760> 90-degree<00:03:53.360> there

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.160 

as<00:04:08.130> you<00:04:08.340> can<00:04:08.460> see<00:04:08.640> you<00:04:08.820> can<00:04:08.970> use<00:04:09.150> this<00:04:09.420> dye<00:04:09.690> also

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
as you can see you can use this dye also

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.870 
as you can see you can use this dye also
in<00:04:10.320> conjunction<00:04:10.740> with<00:04:10.920> this<00:04:11.190> to<00:04:11.370> do<00:04:11.490> the<00:04:11.640> same

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
in conjunction with this to do the same

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:20.539 
in conjunction with this to do the same
thing<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:19.380> that<00:04:19.410> change<00:04:19.860> the<00:04:20.070> bottom<00:04:20.280> and

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
thing and that change the bottom and

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.280 
thing and that change the bottom and
show<00:04:20.730> you<00:04:20.790> that<00:04:21.120> you<00:04:21.299> can<00:04:21.420> actually<00:04:21.600> make<00:04:22.049> this

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
show you that you can actually make this

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.620 
show you that you can actually make this
tip<00:04:22.560> for<00:04:22.800> up<00:04:22.980> further<00:04:25.910> as<00:04:26.910> you<00:04:27.150> can<00:04:27.270> see<00:04:27.420> I<00:04:27.450> have

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
tip for up further as you can see I have

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.030 
tip for up further as you can see I have
the<00:04:27.780> other<00:04:27.810> dye<00:04:28.170> on<00:04:28.470> that<00:04:28.710> now<00:04:30.500> and<00:04:31.500> this<00:04:31.860> will

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
the other dye on that now and this will

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:39.909 
the other dye on that now and this will
allow<00:04:32.160> me<00:04:32.310> to<00:04:32.610> go<00:04:33.150> up<00:04:33.240> even<00:04:33.900> further

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:55.140 

with<00:04:40.219> the<00:04:40.400> amount<00:04:40.669> of<00:04:40.759> end

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.240 

actually<00:04:56.150> I<00:04:56.210> used<00:04:56.480> a<00:04:56.660> flat<00:04:57.380> one<00:04:57.620> in<00:04:57.770> here<00:04:58.010> would

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
actually I used a flat one in here would

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.100 
actually I used a flat one in here would
drive<00:04:58.490> it<00:04:58.670> further<00:04:58.940> into<00:04:59.210> the<00:04:59.390> groove<00:04:59.660> or<00:04:59.930> you

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
drive it further into the groove or you

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.930 
drive it further into the groove or you
can<00:05:00.260> make<00:05:00.470> a<00:05:00.500> narrow<00:05:00.860> groove<00:05:01.280> and<00:05:01.520> do<00:05:01.610> it<00:05:01.730> with

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
can make a narrow groove and do it with

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.150 
can make a narrow groove and do it with
that<00:05:02.150> but<00:05:02.780> you<00:05:02.810> can<00:05:03.170> get<00:05:03.290> it<00:05:03.440> so<00:05:03.590> to<00:05:03.650> fold<00:05:03.950> all

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
that but you can get it so to fold all

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.650 
that but you can get it so to fold all
the<00:05:04.190> way<00:05:04.430> over<00:05:04.760> and<00:05:04.790> you<00:05:05.000> could<00:05:05.150> put<00:05:05.330> a<00:05:05.360> wire<00:05:05.630> in

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
the way over and you could put a wire in

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.130 
the way over and you could put a wire in
there<00:05:06.080> if<00:05:06.200> you<00:05:06.290> wanted<00:05:06.590> to<00:05:07.960> here's<00:05:08.960> another

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
there if you wanted to here's another

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.410 
there if you wanted to here's another
this<00:05:09.830> is<00:05:10.010> one<00:05:10.190> of<00:05:10.220> the<00:05:10.400> dyes<00:05:10.580> I<00:05:10.820> used<00:05:11.210> before

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
this is one of the dyes I used before

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.110 
this is one of the dyes I used before
and<00:05:11.960> this<00:05:12.230> is<00:05:12.410> the<00:05:12.620> got<00:05:13.250> a<00:05:13.280> real<00:05:13.490> thin<00:05:13.790> groove

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
and this is the got a real thin groove

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.350 
and this is the got a real thin groove
in<00:05:14.360> that<00:05:14.540> and<00:05:15.970> this<00:05:16.970> one<00:05:17.210> will<00:05:17.330> allow<00:05:17.360> it<00:05:17.810> to

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
in that and this one will allow it to

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:58.500 
in that and this one will allow it to
fold<00:05:20.360> that<00:05:20.510> up<00:05:20.780> quite<00:05:21.050> a<00:05:21.110> bit

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.020 

you<00:05:59.320> see<00:05:59.590> you<00:05:59.770> can<00:05:59.980> bring<00:06:00.220> that<00:06:00.280> around<00:06:00.550> you

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
you see you can bring that around you

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.810 
you see you can bring that around you
could<00:06:01.210> take<00:06:01.390> two<00:06:01.930> flat<00:06:02.230> dyes<00:06:02.530> and<00:06:02.950> roll<00:06:03.640> this

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
could take two flat dyes and roll this

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.020 
could take two flat dyes and roll this
back<00:06:04.090> down<00:06:04.360> crush<00:06:04.810> it<00:06:05.020> and<00:06:05.140> make<00:06:05.830> this<00:06:06.010> a<00:06:06.070> rigid

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
back down crush it and make this a rigid

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.210 
back down crush it and make this a rigid
seam<00:06:07.360> or<00:06:07.660> ahem<00:06:08.020> align<00:06:08.380> round<00:06:08.830> they're<00:06:09.040> like

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
seam or ahem align round they're like

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.280 
seam or ahem align round they're like
they<00:06:09.370> call<00:06:09.610> it<00:06:12.300> the<00:06:13.300> work<00:06:13.510> table<00:06:13.780> I<00:06:14.020> talked

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.290 
they call it the work table I talked

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.230 
they call it the work table I talked
about<00:06:14.560> on<00:06:14.830> the<00:06:15.010> other<00:06:15.160> video<00:06:15.490> and<00:06:15.910> these<00:06:16.060> are

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
about on the other video and these are

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.860 
about on the other video and these are
the<00:06:16.330> embossing<00:06:16.960> dies<00:06:18.390> so<00:06:19.390> I'll<00:06:19.480> show<00:06:19.660> you<00:06:19.690> how

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
the embossing dies so I'll show you how

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.760 
the embossing dies so I'll show you how
they<00:06:20.140> work<00:06:20.170> basically<00:06:22.500> using<00:06:23.500> a<00:06:23.560> piece<00:06:23.740> of

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
they work basically using a piece of

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.680 
they work basically using a piece of
woman<00:06:24.070> because<00:06:24.550> it<00:06:24.700> really<00:06:24.910> shows<00:06:25.180> up<00:06:25.420> great

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
woman because it really shows up great

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.600 
woman because it really shows up great
on<00:06:25.900> women<00:06:26.080> I'm<00:06:26.320> Adela<00:06:26.590> so<00:06:26.830> it<00:06:26.890> doesn't<00:06:27.340> steal

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
on women I'm Adela so it doesn't steal

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.340 
on women I'm Adela so it doesn't steal
but<00:06:27.880> this<00:06:28.750> is<00:06:28.960> going<00:06:29.230> to<00:06:29.320> really<00:06:29.890> look<00:06:30.130> nice

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350 
but this is going to really look nice

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:42.810 
but this is going to really look nice
basically

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:42.820 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.440 

now<00:06:44.590> when<00:06:45.590> I<00:06:45.620> did<00:06:45.740> this<00:06:46.100> it<00:06:46.160> raised<00:06:46.610> it<00:06:46.880> up<00:06:47.000> so

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:47.450 
now when I did this it raised it up so

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.260 
now when I did this it raised it up so
this<00:06:47.630> is<00:06:47.690> the<00:06:47.870> higher<00:06:48.110> side<00:06:49.000> so<00:06:50.000> what<00:06:50.210> I'm

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270 
this is the higher side so what I'm

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.710 
this is the higher side so what I'm
going<00:06:50.450> to<00:06:50.480> do<00:06:50.600> is<00:06:50.750> turn<00:06:50.930> it<00:06:51.140> around<00:06:52.300> because<00:06:53.300> we

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 
going to do is turn it around because we

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.990 
going to do is turn it around because we
want<00:06:53.930> this<00:06:54.110> area<00:06:54.170> raised<00:06:54.890> and<00:06:55.340> up<00:06:55.460> step<00:06:55.760> both

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 
want this area raised and up step both

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.140 
want this area raised and up step both
to<00:06:56.210> the<00:06:56.330> side<00:06:56.600> of<00:06:56.750> the<00:06:57.100> knot<00:06:58.100> as<00:06:58.310> race<00:06:58.550> you<00:06:58.880> turn

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150 
to the side of the knot as race you turn

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:12.540 
to the side of the knot as race you turn
it<00:06:59.330> around<00:06:59.420> to<00:06:59.810> start<00:07:00.140> again

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:12.550 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.460 

as<00:07:13.550> you<00:07:13.819> can<00:07:13.879> see<00:07:14.090> this<00:07:14.300> is<00:07:14.509> the<00:07:14.660> raised<00:07:14.870> area

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.470 
as you can see this is the raised area

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.950 
as you can see this is the raised area
with<00:07:15.680> each<00:07:16.430> place<00:07:16.759> where<00:07:17.000> I<00:07:17.060> ran<00:07:17.330> a<00:07:17.360> bead<00:07:17.690> is

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:17.960 
with each place where I ran a bead is

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.969 
with each place where I ran a bead is
recessed<00:07:18.830> down<00:07:19.159> there<00:07:20.470> basically<00:07:21.470> you<00:07:21.680> can<00:07:21.860> do

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:21.979 
recessed down there basically you can do

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:26.200 
recessed down there basically you can do
anything<00:07:22.400> you<00:07:22.520> want<00:07:22.759> as<00:07:22.940> far<00:07:23.150> as<00:07:23.210> some<00:07:25.210> turning

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:26.210 
anything you want as far as some turning

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:36.099 
anything you want as far as some turning
this<00:07:26.330> around

00:07:36.099 --> 00:07:36.109 

00:07:36.109 --> 00:07:39.619 

see<00:07:37.109> if<00:07:37.199> you<00:07:37.319> continue<00:07:37.829> to<00:07:37.979> go<00:07:38.359> whichever<00:07:39.359> side

00:07:39.619 --> 00:07:39.629 
see if you continue to go whichever side

00:07:39.629 --> 00:07:42.439 
see if you continue to go whichever side
you<00:07:39.839> do<00:07:40.489> remember<00:07:41.489> so<00:07:41.849> you<00:07:41.909> have<00:07:42.119> the<00:07:42.239> raised

00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:42.449 
you do remember so you have the raised

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:44.599 
you do remember so you have the raised
area<00:07:42.869> in<00:07:42.959> the<00:07:43.049> center<00:07:43.409> that<00:07:43.979> makes<00:07:44.369> it<00:07:44.489> more

00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:44.609 
area in the center that makes it more

00:07:44.609 --> 00:07:48.169 
area in the center that makes it more
pronounced<00:07:45.949> so<00:07:46.949> this<00:07:47.159> one<00:07:47.369> now<00:07:47.549> is<00:07:47.759> this<00:07:47.969> is

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:48.179 
pronounced so this one now is this is

00:07:48.179 --> 00:07:52.969 
pronounced so this one now is this is
lower<00:07:48.479> than<00:07:48.869> s<00:07:49.019> here<00:07:49.349> this<00:07:49.559> is<00:07:49.769> higher<00:07:51.979> just

00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:52.979 
lower than s here this is higher just

00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:56.059 
lower than s here this is higher just
depends<00:07:53.249> on<00:07:53.399> which<00:07:53.609> side<00:07:53.849> of<00:07:53.879> the<00:07:54.619> dies<00:07:55.619> and

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:56.069 
depends on which side of the dies and

00:07:56.069 --> 00:07:57.649 
depends on which side of the dies and
with<00:07:56.459> this<00:07:56.639> one<00:07:56.879> you<00:07:57.029> can<00:07:57.179> actually<00:07:57.209> adjust

00:07:57.649 --> 00:07:57.659 
with this one you can actually adjust

00:07:57.659 --> 00:08:00.589 
with this one you can actually adjust
the<00:07:58.079> dice<00:07:58.579> one<00:07:59.579> side<00:07:59.879> or<00:08:00.029> the<00:08:00.059> other<00:08:00.149> rather

00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:00.599 
the dice one side or the other rather

00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:03.789 
the dice one side or the other rather
than<00:08:00.779> go<00:08:01.079> in<00:08:01.169> the<00:08:01.259> opposite<00:08:01.709> direction<00:08:01.889> that

00:08:03.789 --> 00:08:03.799 
than go in the opposite direction that

00:08:03.799 --> 00:08:07.609 
than go in the opposite direction that
