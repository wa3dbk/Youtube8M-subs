other stuff but still yeah that took a

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.620 
other stuff but still yeah that took a
long<00:01:37.470> time<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:38.340> then<00:01:38.520> when<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.729> finally<00:01:39.090> got<00:01:39.570> my

long time but then when I finally got my

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.010 
long time but then when I finally got my
pc<00:01:40.259> after<00:01:40.560> running<00:01:41.150> it's<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.270> custom<00:01:42.720> built<00:01:42.930> pc

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
pc after running it's a custom built pc

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.319 
pc after running it's a custom built pc
i<00:01:43.409> didn't<00:01:43.770> build<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.009> myself<00:01:44.189> but<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.180> still

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
i didn't build it myself but it's still

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.330 
i didn't build it myself but it's still
custom<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.049> it's<00:01:46.530> supposed<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.920> be<00:01:47.040> really

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
custom and it's supposed to be really

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.660 
custom and it's supposed to be really
good<00:01:47.790> essentially<00:01:48.479> it's<00:01:49.430> double<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
good essentially it's double the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.480 
good essentially it's double the
performance<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.600> my<00:01:51.869> previous<00:01:52.860> computer

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
performance of my previous computer

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.270 
performance of my previous computer
which<00:01:53.640> i'm<00:01:53.820> using<00:01:54.119> right<00:01:54.149> now<00:01:54.329> sadly<00:01:55.070> but<00:01:56.070> yeah

the severely disappointed actually

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.210 
the severely disappointed actually
because<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.420> really<00:02:10.229> wanted<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.619> get<00:02:10.739> like<00:02:10.950> you

know the
we<00:02:12.349> hundred<00:02:12.829> frames<00:02:13.040> per<00:02:13.340> second<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:13.879> then

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
we hundred frames per second and then

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.300 
we hundred frames per second and then
record<00:02:14.299> with<00:02:14.569> like<00:02:14.780> 100<00:02:15.170> frames<00:02:15.739> per<00:02:15.920> second

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
record with like 100 frames per second

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.250 
record with like 100 frames per second
case<00:02:16.819> that<00:02:17.150> makes<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.629> gameplay<00:02:17.959> really

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260

smooth<00:02:18.500> that<00:02:18.739> I<00:02:18.769> can<00:02:18.920> record<00:02:19.219> very<00:02:20.000> smoothly

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
smooth that I can record very smoothly

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.539 
smooth that I can record very smoothly
and<00:02:20.750> hopefully<00:02:21.140> get<00:02:21.379> really<00:02:21.920> good<00:02:22.010> videos<00:02:22.340> for

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
all with a brand new really good DC so

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.220

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
um yeah what's very confused and I still

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.199 
um yeah what's very confused and I still
haven't<00:02:45.470> sold<00:02:45.769> that<00:02:46.010> issue<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:46.549> for<00:02:46.760> now<00:02:46.970> I'm

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
haven't sold that issue so for now I'm

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.379 
haven't sold that issue so for now I'm
going<00:02:47.239> back<00:02:47.480> to<00:02:47.689> my<00:02:47.989> previous<00:02:48.170> computer<00:02:48.859> and

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
going back to my previous computer and

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.569 
going back to my previous computer and
I'm<00:02:50.389> not<00:02:50.930> even<00:02:50.959> sure<00:02:51.260> what<00:02:51.829> to<00:02:51.980> do<00:02:52.069> with<00:02:52.250> my<00:02:52.370> new

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
I'm not even sure what to do with my new

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.699 
I'm not even sure what to do with my new
one<00:02:52.819> I<00:02:53.060> probably<00:02:53.569> have<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:53.959> get<00:02:54.169> it<00:02:54.290> fixed

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
one I probably have to get it fixed

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.789 
one I probably have to get it fixed
somehow<00:02:55.120> but<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:56.569> will<00:02:56.930> probably<00:02:57.230> be<00:02:57.769> a

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
somehow but that will probably be a

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:59.949 
somehow but that will probably be a
really<00:02:57.919> long<00:02:58.400> process<00:02:59.180> so<00:02:59.389> for<00:02:59.599> now<00:02:59.750> I'm<00:02:59.930> going

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
really long process so for now I'm going

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.240 
really long process so for now I'm going
back<00:03:00.169> to<00:03:00.290> my<00:03:00.470> normal<00:03:00.620> one<00:03:01.040> that<00:03:01.189> I<00:03:01.220> can

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
back to my normal one that I can

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.399 
back to my normal one that I can
actually<00:03:01.489> run<00:03:02.060> minecraft<00:03:02.810> with<00:03:03.079> because

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.860 
let's be honest here with that new one I
could<00:03:06.530> barely<00:03:06.769> run<00:03:07.310> minecraft<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.329> minecraft

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
could barely run minecraft and minecraft

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.050 
could barely run minecraft and minecraft
is<00:03:09.139> a<00:03:09.169> pretty<00:03:09.560> easy<00:03:09.829> game<00:03:10.159> to<00:03:10.189> run<00:03:10.519> after<00:03:10.970> all

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
is a pretty easy game to run after all

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.720 
is a pretty easy game to run after all
compared<00:03:11.569> to<00:03:11.750> some<00:03:12.260> other<00:03:12.349> triple-a<00:03:12.980> games<00:03:13.310> so

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
compared to some other triple-a games so

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.589 
compared to some other triple-a games so
yeah<00:03:14.620> I'm<00:03:15.620> not<00:03:15.950> gonna<00:03:16.129> ramble<00:03:16.400> on<00:03:16.609> here<00:03:17.030> but<00:03:17.269> to

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599

worry<00:05:39.620> about<00:05:39.710> that<00:05:40.100> but<00:05:41.030> anyway<00:05:41.660> that's<00:05:42.170> it<00:05:42.590> I

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
worry about that but anyway that's it I

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.920 
worry about that but anyway that's it I
want<00:05:43.100> to<00:05:43.160> try<00:05:43.460> to<00:05:43.490> get<00:05:43.970> into<00:05:44.270> more<00:05:44.450> building
