they're definitely used but they're not
used<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.189> long<00:01:41.720> again<00:01:42.720> it's<00:01:42.930> just<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.229> it's

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
used that long again it's just the it's

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.050 
used that long again it's just the it's
just<00:01:43.619> kind<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> nature<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.700> beats<00:01:44.880> where

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
just kind of the nature the beats where

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.330 
just kind of the nature the beats where
these<00:01:45.210> things<00:01:45.390> go<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:45.899> lower<00:01:46.530> control<00:01:46.920> arms

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
these things go so lower control arms

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.179 
these things go so lower control arms
they<00:01:48.210> are<00:01:48.240> pretty<00:01:48.720> much<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.439> same<00:01:49.680> size<00:01:50.040> of

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
they are pretty much the same size of

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.010 
they are pretty much the same size of
your<00:01:50.340> stock<00:01:50.610> ones<00:01:50.909> they<00:01:51.119> might<00:01:51.299> be<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> tad<00:01:51.810> bit

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
your stock ones they might be a tad bit

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.450 
your stock ones they might be a tad bit
longer<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.380> measured<00:01:52.770> them<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.070> they're<00:01:53.189> maybe

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
longer I measured them and they're maybe

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.330 
longer I measured them and they're maybe
a<00:01:53.640> half-inch<00:01:54.090> longer<00:01:54.570> but<00:01:55.470> pretty<00:01:55.920> much<00:01:56.159> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
a half-inch longer but pretty much the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.520 
a half-inch longer but pretty much the
reason<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.880> these<00:01:57.030> are<00:01:57.090> nice<00:01:57.390> besides<00:01:58.320> are<00:01:58.500> a

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
reason that these are nice besides are a

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.319 
reason that these are nice besides are a
heck<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.070> lot<00:01:59.219> stronger<00:01:59.549> those<00:01:59.909> control

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
heck of a lot stronger those control

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.719 
heck of a lot stronger those control
arms<00:02:00.479> if<00:02:00.600> you've<00:02:00.750> had<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.140> issue<00:02:01.320> before<00:02:01.729> and

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
arms if you've had this issue before and

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.670 
arms if you've had this issue before and
bending<00:02:03.329> them<00:02:03.509> they're<00:02:03.719> very<00:02:03.990> easy<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.409> bend

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
bending them they're very easy to bend

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.020 
bending them they're very easy to bend
the<00:02:04.860> other<00:02:04.979> ones<00:02:05.250> these<00:02:05.490> things<00:02:05.729> are<00:02:05.850> very

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
the other ones these things are very

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.990 
the other ones these things are very
stout<00:02:06.360> they<00:02:06.630> are<00:02:06.780> made<00:02:06.990> by<00:02:07.170> skyjacker

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
stout they are made by skyjacker

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.279 
stout they are made by skyjacker
but<00:02:09.000> not<00:02:09.119> only<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.660> bushings<00:02:10.140> these

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
but not only that the bushings these

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.150 
but not only that the bushings these
polyurethane<00:02:11.009> bushings<00:02:11.430> are

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
polyurethane bushings are

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.710 
polyurethane bushings are
better<00:02:12.340> than<00:02:12.550> that<00:02:12.640> rubber<00:02:12.880> crap<00:02:13.210> they<00:02:13.420> put<00:02:13.630> in

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
better than that rubber crap they put in

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.580 
better than that rubber crap they put in
them<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:15.240> for<00:02:16.240> ride<00:02:16.390> comfort<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.110> just<00:02:17.320> for

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
them and for ride comfort and just for

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.010 
them and for ride comfort and just for
flex<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.490> a<00:02:18.550> lot<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:18.820> other<00:02:18.940> things<00:02:19.240> so<00:02:19.510> plus

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
flex and a lot of other things so plus

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.600 
flex and a lot of other things so plus
the<00:02:20.230> fact<00:02:20.650> that<00:02:20.740> you<00:02:20.890> can<00:02:21.070> grease<00:02:21.340> these

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
the fact that you can grease these

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.350 
the fact that you can grease these
things<00:02:22.110> at<00:02:23.110> all<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.470> bushing<00:02:23.860> points<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.550> huge

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
things at all the bushing points is huge

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.120 
things at all the bushing points is huge
because<00:02:25.720> that's<00:02:26.020> usually<00:02:26.530> what<00:02:26.710> makes<00:02:26.860> the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
because that's usually what makes the

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.670 
because that's usually what makes the
older<00:02:27.490> bushings<00:02:27.820> go<00:02:28.030> back<00:02:28.210> okay<00:02:29.080> so<00:02:29.470> these<00:02:29.620> are

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
older bushings go back okay so these are

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.460 
older bushings go back okay so these are
pretty<00:02:30.220> simple<00:02:30.400> bushings<00:02:30.970> they<00:02:31.900> just<00:02:32.140> kind<00:02:32.350> of

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
pretty simple bushings they just kind of

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.440 
pretty simple bushings they just kind of
push<00:02:33.100> in<00:02:33.280> place<00:02:33.520> you<00:02:33.730> don't<00:02:33.910> have<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.180> press

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
push in place you don't have to press

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.000 
push in place you don't have to press
them<00:02:34.630> or<00:02:34.780> anything<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:36.900> then<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:38.110> I'll<00:02:38.800> show

my<00:02:45.910> Kart<00:02:46.240> this<00:02:46.510> little<00:02:46.780> metal<00:02:46.930> parts<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.320> little

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
my Kart this little metal parts a little

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.350 
my Kart this little metal parts a little
clumsy<00:02:47.680> but<00:02:47.890> these<00:02:48.610> things<00:02:48.820> should<00:02:49.030> go<00:02:49.180> right

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
clumsy but these things should go right

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.000 
clumsy but these things should go right
into<00:02:49.540> place<00:02:49.840> just<00:02:49.870> like<00:02:50.260> they<00:02:50.470> are<00:02:50.620> for<00:02:50.920> it

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
into place just like they are for it

00:02:51.010 --> 00:03:00.750 
into place just like they are for it
easily<00:02:57.900> okay<00:02:58.900> all<00:02:59.740> right<00:02:59.920> so<00:03:00.070> that<00:03:00.220> sides<00:03:00.520> all

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
easily okay all right so that sides all

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.910 
easily okay all right so that sides all
there<00:03:01.090> so<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:01.960> told<00:03:02.110> you<00:03:02.230> those<00:03:02.380> easy<00:03:02.590> and

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
there so you told you those easy and

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:22.140 
there so you told you those easy and
then<00:03:03.100> I'll<00:03:03.400> flip<00:03:03.640> them<00:03:03.850> over<00:03:03.910> here<00:03:19.920> okay<00:03:21.150> now

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
then I'll flip them over here okay now

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.020 
then I'll flip them over here okay now
they're<00:03:22.360> all<00:03:22.480> flush<00:03:22.780> okay<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:24.459> see<00:03:24.700> them<00:03:24.850> down

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
they're all flush okay and see them down

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.990 
they're all flush okay and see them down
the<00:03:25.240> line<00:03:26.100> again<00:03:27.100> there's<00:03:27.340> no<00:03:27.490> bends<00:03:27.730> or

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
the line again there's no bends or

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.910 
the line again there's no bends or
anything<00:03:28.150> in<00:03:28.420> these<00:03:28.570> guys<00:03:31.530> they're<00:03:32.530> supposed

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
anything in these guys they're supposed

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.310 
anything in these guys they're supposed
to<00:03:33.010> they<00:03:33.250> obviously<00:03:33.880> will<00:03:34.630> hold<00:03:34.840> tight<00:03:35.050> once

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
to they obviously will hold tight once

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.350 
to they obviously will hold tight once
you<00:03:35.440> get<00:03:35.620> that<00:03:35.830> metal<00:03:36.370> sleeve<00:03:36.670> and<00:03:36.820> your<00:03:37.090> bolts

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
you get that metal sleeve and your bolts

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.830 
you get that metal sleeve and your bolts
in<00:03:37.480> them<00:03:37.830> but<00:03:38.830> for<00:03:39.010> our<00:03:39.130> sake<00:03:39.400> just<00:03:40.120> this

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
in them but for our sake just this

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.130 
in them but for our sake just this
little<00:03:41.260> demonstration<00:03:41.440> here<00:03:42.370> which<00:03:42.580> is<00:03:43.140> not

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
little demonstration here which is not

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.960 
little demonstration here which is not
just<00:03:44.350> so<00:03:44.470> much<00:03:44.620> our<00:03:44.800> demonstration<00:03:45.459> is<00:03:45.610> also

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
just so much our demonstration is also

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.660 
just so much our demonstration is also
the<00:03:46.209> condition<00:03:47.010> because<00:03:48.010> I<00:03:48.100> like<00:03:48.340> when<00:03:48.580> you

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
the condition because I like when you

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.810 
the condition because I like when you
sell<00:03:48.880> you<00:03:49.120> stuff<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:49.690> this<00:03:49.780> is<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:49.959> fairly

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
sell you stuff and this is a fairly

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.090 
sell you stuff and this is a fairly
inexpensive<00:03:51.820> but<00:03:52.720> not<00:03:52.959> super<00:03:53.470> cheap<00:03:53.709> part

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
inexpensive but not super cheap part

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.760 
inexpensive but not super cheap part
especially<00:03:54.820> new<00:03:55.720> I<00:03:55.750> think<00:03:55.959> they<00:03:56.290> run<00:03:56.410> a<00:03:56.470> couple

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
especially new I think they run a couple

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.070 
especially new I think they run a couple
hundred<00:03:56.890> bucks<00:03:57.390> buying<00:03:58.390> stuff<00:03:58.750> like<00:03:58.930> this

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
hundred bucks buying stuff like this

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.840 
hundred bucks buying stuff like this
years<00:03:59.440> especially<00:04:00.040> when<00:04:00.190> it's<00:04:00.340> kind<00:04:00.550> of<00:04:00.610> a<00:04:00.670> non

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
years especially when it's kind of a non

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.090 
years especially when it's kind of a non
wearable<00:04:01.360> part<00:04:01.630> long<00:04:02.260> as<00:04:02.380> these<00:04:02.500> bushings<00:04:02.980> are

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
wearable part long as these bushings are

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.380 
wearable part long as these bushings are
still<00:04:03.280> in<00:04:03.370> good<00:04:03.520> shape<00:04:03.730> and<00:04:03.910> these<00:04:04.000> bushings

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
still in good shape and these bushings

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.720 
still in good shape and these bushings
are<00:04:04.570> still<00:04:04.810> very<00:04:05.709> good<00:04:06.010> shape<00:04:06.220> that's<00:04:06.550> how<00:04:06.700> I

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
are still very good shape that's how I

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.010 
are still very good shape that's how I
can<00:04:06.940> tell<00:04:07.060> this<00:04:07.209> ik<00:04:07.330> it<00:04:07.480> wasn't<00:04:07.720> very<00:04:07.840> old

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
can tell this ik it wasn't very old

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.470 
can tell this ik it wasn't very old
because<00:04:09.010> bushings<00:04:09.489> have<00:04:09.640> a<00:04:09.670> tendency<00:04:10.150> to<00:04:10.270> dry

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
because bushings have a tendency to dry

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.420 
because bushings have a tendency to dry
out<00:04:11.070> fairly<00:04:12.070> easily<00:04:12.300> so<00:04:13.300> these<00:04:13.510> ones<00:04:13.750> are<00:04:13.930> all

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
out fairly easily so these ones are all

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.010 
out fairly easily so these ones are all
pretty<00:04:15.430> flexible<00:04:15.730> just<00:04:16.299> like<00:04:16.450> they<00:04:16.600> should<00:04:16.840> be

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.020 
pretty flexible just like they should be

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.890 
pretty flexible just like they should be
so<00:04:17.700> alright<00:04:18.700> so<00:04:18.910> there<00:04:19.090> we<00:04:19.209> go<00:04:19.239> so<00:04:19.630> they're<00:04:19.780> all

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
so alright so there we go so they're all

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.050 
so alright so there we go so they're all
back<00:04:20.080> in<00:04:20.320> now

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
back in now

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.620 
back in now
and<00:04:22.070> then<00:04:23.070> basically<00:04:23.850> that's<00:04:24.090> what<00:04:24.240> you<00:04:24.420> have

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
and then basically that's what you have

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.110 
and then basically that's what you have
and<00:04:24.960> then<00:04:25.050> your<00:04:25.170> metal<00:04:25.440> sleeve<00:04:25.680> here<00:04:26.120> super

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
and then your metal sleeve here super

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.380 
and then your metal sleeve here super
see<00:04:27.300> just<00:04:27.720> slides<00:04:28.680> right<00:04:28.800> down<00:04:29.130> in<00:04:29.550> there<00:04:29.880> and

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
see just slides right down in there and

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.000 
see just slides right down in there and
you<00:04:30.510> can<00:04:30.660> reuse<00:04:30.810> your<00:04:31.110> stock<00:04:31.170> bolts<00:04:31.710> which<00:04:31.860> is

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
you can reuse your stock bolts which is

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.790 
you can reuse your stock bolts which is
what<00:04:32.160> I<00:04:32.190> would<00:04:32.370> recommend<00:04:32.810> and<00:04:33.810> then<00:04:34.440> you<00:04:34.620> just

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
what I would recommend and then you just

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.050 
what I would recommend and then you just
put<00:04:35.010> these<00:04:35.130> on<00:04:35.280> these<00:04:35.460> are<00:04:35.520> all<00:04:35.640> the<00:04:35.730> same

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
put these on these are all the same

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.630 
put these on these are all the same
which<00:04:36.870> is<00:04:36.900> exactly<00:04:37.470> it<00:04:37.650> like<00:04:37.830> on<00:04:38.010> your<00:04:38.130> TJ<00:04:38.490> if

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
which is exactly it like on your TJ if

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.890 
which is exactly it like on your TJ if
you<00:04:38.730> don't<00:04:38.910> know<00:04:39.000> this<00:04:39.150> already<00:04:39.270> all<00:04:39.720> your

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
you don't know this already all your

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.870 
you don't know this already all your
lower<00:04:40.080> control<00:04:40.440> arms<00:04:40.770> on<00:04:40.890> a<00:04:40.920> TJ<00:04:41.280> are<00:04:41.400> identical

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
lower control arms on a TJ are identical

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.900 
lower control arms on a TJ are identical
unless<00:04:42.090> you've<00:04:42.270> changed<00:04:42.300> him<00:04:42.720> obviously<00:04:43.910> if

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
unless you've changed him obviously if

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.580 
unless you've changed him obviously if
you<00:04:45.000> got<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.180> lift<00:04:45.420> this<00:04:45.600> was<00:04:45.870> a<00:04:45.900> Jeep<00:04:46.260> that<00:04:46.290> was

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
you got a lift this was a Jeep that was

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.460 
you got a lift this was a Jeep that was
lifted<00:04:46.800> so<00:04:47.570> usually<00:04:48.570> they<00:04:48.690> recommend

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
lifted so usually they recommend

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.470 
lifted so usually they recommend
adjustable<00:04:50.220> lower<00:04:50.370> conforms<00:04:50.970> if<00:04:51.150> it's<00:04:51.330> up

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
adjustable lower conforms if it's up

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.710 
adjustable lower conforms if it's up
higher<00:04:51.930> than<00:04:52.200> two<00:04:52.830> and<00:04:52.950> a<00:04:53.010> half<00:04:53.130> inches<00:04:53.600> but<00:04:54.600> if

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
higher than two and a half inches but if

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.320 
higher than two and a half inches but if
you're<00:04:54.870> just<00:04:55.200> two<00:04:55.350> inches<00:04:55.820> up<00:04:56.820> you<00:04:57.060> don't<00:04:57.150> need

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
you're just two inches up you don't need

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.050 
you're just two inches up you don't need
to<00:04:57.450> do<00:04:57.570> that<00:04:57.830> it's<00:04:58.830> just<00:04:59.130> a<00:04:59.280> the<00:04:59.700> reason<00:05:00.000> you

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
to do that it's just a the reason you

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.730 
to do that it's just a the reason you
want<00:05:00.240> to<00:05:00.300> just<00:05:00.480> will<00:05:00.690> control<00:05:01.020> arms<00:05:01.350> on<00:05:01.500> a<00:05:01.530> lift

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
want to just will control arms on a lift

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.650 
want to just will control arms on a lift
especially<00:05:02.370> a<00:05:02.400> big<00:05:02.640> lift<00:05:02.880> like<00:05:02.940> a<00:05:03.060> four<00:05:03.330> inches

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
especially a big lift like a four inches

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.660 
especially a big lift like a four inches
so<00:05:04.230> you<00:05:04.320> can<00:05:04.470> adjust<00:05:04.770> your<00:05:04.860> caster<00:05:05.370> because<00:05:05.550> it

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
so you can adjust your caster because it

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.990 
so you can adjust your caster because it
basically<00:05:06.140> affects<00:05:07.140> the<00:05:07.290> angle<00:05:07.620> of<00:05:07.860> your<00:05:08.100> axle

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
basically affects the angle of your axle

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.910 
basically affects the angle of your axle
under<00:05:09.240> there<00:05:09.390> so<00:05:09.630> it's<00:05:10.110> definitely<00:05:10.440> important

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
under there so it's definitely important

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.820 
under there so it's definitely important
they're<00:05:11.340> good<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:11.580> have<00:05:11.730> anyway<00:05:12.150> but<00:05:12.830> but

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
they're good to have anyway but but

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.000 
they're good to have anyway but but
they're<00:05:14.100> very<00:05:14.250> expensive<00:05:14.640> usually<00:05:14.970> and<00:05:16.010> these

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
they're very expensive usually and these

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.760 
they're very expensive usually and these
are<00:05:17.160> much<00:05:17.340> better<00:05:17.520> than<00:05:17.670> stock<00:05:18.030> so<00:05:18.740> anyway<00:05:19.740> I

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
are much better than stock so anyway I

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.490 
are much better than stock so anyway I
think<00:05:20.010> that<00:05:20.160> does<00:05:20.310> it<00:05:20.340> for<00:05:20.460> me<00:05:20.760> 7<00:05:21.060> 12<00:05:21.300> 9<00:05:21.510> 8<00:05:21.630> 7<00:05:21.900> 8<00:05:22.140> 7
