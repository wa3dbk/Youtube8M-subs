but it's still working it's uh it's

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.840 
but it's still working it's uh it's
telling<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.739> truth<00:02:40.950> when<00:02:41.130> it<00:02:41.280> says<00:02:41.459> I<00:02:41.489> sell

around<00:02:42.090> five<00:02:42.360> thirty<00:02:42.390> three<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:45.060> ram<00:02:45.239> has

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
around five thirty three and the ram has

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.160 
around five thirty three and the ram has
been<00:02:45.930> upgraded<00:02:46.230> in<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.840> think<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:48.959> came

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
been upgraded in it I think it came

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
been upgraded in it I think it came
stock<00:02:49.620> with<00:02:49.850> 64<00:02:51.380> how<00:02:52.380> much<00:02:52.530> rain<00:02:52.769> we<00:02:52.799> got<00:02:53.040> in

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
stock with 64 how much rain we got in

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.120 
stock with 64 how much rain we got in
this<00:02:53.340> sucker<00:02:53.640> we<00:02:53.970> got<00:02:54.319> 319<00:02:57.709> megabytes<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:58.860> RAM

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
this sucker we got 319 megabytes of RAM

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.229 
this sucker we got 319 megabytes of RAM
so<00:02:59.489> it's<00:02:59.670> it's<00:03:00.450> had<00:03:00.690> 256<00:03:01.470> added<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.640> stock

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
so it's it's had 256 added to the stock

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.220 
so it's it's had 256 added to the stock
64<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.380> it's<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.940> reasonably<00:03:05.940> zippy<00:03:06.480> unit<00:03:06.959> for

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
64 and it's a reasonably zippy unit for

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.259 
64 and it's a reasonably zippy unit for
its<00:03:07.380> age<00:03:09.230> what's<00:03:10.230> going<00:03:11.069> on<00:03:11.220> with<00:03:11.459> it<00:03:11.670> well<00:03:12.239> I

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
its age what's going on with it well I

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.110 
its age what's going on with it well I
think<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.870> power<00:03:13.170> supply<00:03:13.880> specifically<00:03:14.880> the

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
think the power supply specifically the

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.710 
think the power supply specifically the
12<00:03:15.420> volt<00:03:15.480> rail<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.230> getting<00:03:16.680> kind<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.100> weak<00:03:17.370> i

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
12 volt rail is getting kind of weak i

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.780 
12 volt rail is getting kind of weak i
could<00:03:18.720> probably<00:03:19.019> replace<00:03:19.590> find<00:03:20.430> another

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
could probably replace find another

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.560 
could probably replace find another
paris<00:03:21.239> fly<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.870> press<00:03:22.170> it<00:03:22.200> into<00:03:22.500> service

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
paris fly and press it into service

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.140 
paris fly and press it into service
however<00:03:24.570> let's<00:03:25.609> hear<00:03:26.609> what's<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.880> power

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
however let's hear what's the power

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.890 
however let's hear what's the power
consumption<00:03:27.600> on<00:03:27.900> that<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.380> says<00:03:28.650> two<00:03:29.010> amps

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
consumption on that it says two amps

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.190 
consumption on that it says two amps
where<00:03:30.900> as<00:03:32.180> well<00:03:33.180> that's<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.570> 1<00:03:33.780> amp<00:03:33.989> power

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
where as well that's a 1 amp power

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.990 
where as well that's a 1 amp power
supply<00:03:34.680> though<00:03:34.920> i<00:03:34.980> know<00:03:35.130> this<00:03:35.430> saying<00:03:35.730> can't

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
supply though i know this saying can't

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.710 
supply though i know this saying can't
draw<00:03:36.269> that<00:03:36.480> much<00:03:37.700> but<00:03:38.700> anyway<00:03:39.150> this<00:03:39.390> thing<00:03:39.630> is

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
draw that much but anyway this thing is

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.259 
draw that much but anyway this thing is
probably<00:03:39.989> going<00:03:40.500> to<00:03:40.590> use<00:03:41.100> a<00:03:41.130> whole<00:03:41.549> lot<00:03:41.850> less

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
probably going to use a whole lot less

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.310 
probably going to use a whole lot less
electricity<00:03:43.519> to<00:03:44.519> use<00:03:44.850> for<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.630> purpose<00:03:46.079> and

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
electricity to use for the purpose and

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.110 
electricity to use for the purpose and
the<00:03:46.700> nice<00:03:47.700> thing<00:03:47.730> about<00:03:48.120> it<00:03:48.570> is<00:03:48.930> in<00:03:49.230> theory

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
the nice thing about it is in theory

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.310 
the nice thing about it is in theory
whenever<00:03:51.120> we<00:03:51.239> want<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.540> change<00:03:51.690> our<00:03:51.870> playlists

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
whenever we want to change our playlists

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.849 
whenever we want to change our playlists
we<00:03:52.560> just<00:03:52.799> changed<00:03:53.130> USB<00:03:53.640> sticks<00:03:54.410> so<00:03:55.410> this<00:03:55.709> is

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
we just changed USB sticks so this is

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.970 
we just changed USB sticks so this is
probably<00:03:56.069> going<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.370> be<00:03:56.430> our<00:03:56.760> music<00:03:57.980> source

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
probably going to be our music source

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.620 
probably going to be our music source
for<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.280> while<00:04:01.160> okay<00:04:02.160> so<00:04:02.670> that's<00:04:02.940> this<00:04:03.239> video

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
for a while okay so that's this video

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.599 
for a while okay so that's this video
and<00:04:04.019> what<00:04:04.140> i'm<00:04:04.260> doing<00:04:04.530> right<00:04:04.680> now<00:04:04.920> is<00:04:05.310> a<00:04:07.549> no<00:04:08.549> no

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
and what i'm doing right now is a no no

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.940 
and what i'm doing right now is a no no
I<00:04:08.730> got<00:04:08.970> it<00:04:09.000> going<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.510> way<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:09.840> got<00:04:10.230> it<00:04:10.410> going

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
I got it going the way I got it going

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.030 
I got it going the way I got it going
I've<00:04:11.819> had<00:04:12.090> to<00:04:12.239> do<00:04:12.389> this<00:04:12.600> twice<00:04:12.989> I've<00:04:13.410> unplugged

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
I've had to do this twice I've unplugged

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.779 
I've had to do this twice I've unplugged
the<00:04:14.340> hard<00:04:14.670> drive<00:04:14.940> data<00:04:15.299> cable<00:04:15.989> why<00:04:16.889> helps<00:04:17.609> I

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
the hard drive data cable why helps I

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:21.800 
the hard drive data cable why helps I
don't<00:04:18.180> know<00:04:18.590> and<00:04:19.940> after<00:04:20.940> a<00:04:20.970> couple<00:04:21.150> tries<00:04:21.510> to

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
don't know and after a couple tries to

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.850 
don't know and after a couple tries to
work<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:22.500> this<00:04:22.800> last<00:04:23.159> time

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
work and this last time

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.429 
work and this last time
I<00:04:23.889> actually<00:04:24.400> hot<00:04:24.969> plug<00:04:25.300> the<00:04:25.449> cable<00:04:25.930> while<00:04:26.169> it

00:04:26.429 --> 00:04:26.439 
I actually hot plug the cable while it

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:29.760 
I actually hot plug the cable while it
was<00:04:26.879> booting<00:04:27.879> and<00:04:28.120> did<00:04:28.330> so<00:04:28.599> just<00:04:29.229> fast<00:04:29.560> enough

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
was booting and did so just fast enough

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.089 
was booting and did so just fast enough
to<00:04:30.189> where<00:04:30.219> it<00:04:30.550> would<00:04:30.789> actually<00:04:31.710> still<00:04:32.710> detect

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099 
to where it would actually still detect

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:36.570 
to where it would actually still detect
the<00:04:33.219> hard<00:04:33.370> drive<00:04:33.729> yes<00:04:34.240> that<00:04:34.599> is<00:04:34.750> risky<00:04:35.289> but<00:04:36.250> the

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
the hard drive yes that is risky but the

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.369 
the hard drive yes that is risky but the
thing<00:04:36.819> is<00:04:36.849> this<00:04:37.180> thing<00:04:37.419> is<00:04:37.569> so<00:04:37.810> old<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.710> so<00:04:40.379> as

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:41.379 
thing is this thing is so old and so as

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:43.619 
thing is this thing is so old and so as
of<00:04:41.409> right<00:04:41.620> now<00:04:41.800> kind<00:04:42.340> of<00:04:42.400> honest<00:04:42.729> last<00:04:42.939> leg<00:04:43.300> I

00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:43.629 
of right now kind of honest last leg I

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:46.830 
of right now kind of honest last leg I
wasn't<00:04:43.960> too<00:04:44.229> worried<00:04:44.650> about<00:04:44.740> it<00:04:45.569> yeah<00:04:46.569> I<00:04:46.599> know

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
wasn't too worried about it yeah I know

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.869 
wasn't too worried about it yeah I know
it<00:04:47.409> was<00:04:47.590> probably<00:04:48.039> not<00:04:48.159> the<00:04:48.219> smartest<00:04:48.430> thing

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:48.879 
it was probably not the smartest thing

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:50.850 
it was probably not the smartest thing
to<00:04:48.909> do<00:04:49.150> but<00:04:49.360> sometimes<00:04:49.629> you<00:04:50.139> just<00:04:50.289> get<00:04:50.500> into

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
to do but sometimes you just get into

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.240 
to do but sometimes you just get into

pronounce<00:04:57.490> that<00:04:58.949> power<00:04:59.949> supply<00:05:00.520> is<00:05:00.969> just<00:05:01.509> I

pronounce that power supply is just I
think<00:05:04.029> it's<00:05:04.150> just<00:05:04.240> getting<00:05:05.050> old<00:05:05.379> I<00:05:05.740> think

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
think it's just getting old I think

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.469 
think it's just getting old I think
that's<00:05:06.639> what<00:05:06.849> it<00:05:06.969> is<00:05:07.139> and<00:05:08.939> so<00:05:09.939> I'm<00:05:10.270> not<00:05:10.419> sure

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
that's what it is and so I'm not sure

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.360 
that's what it is and so I'm not sure
what<00:05:10.629> I'm<00:05:10.990> going<00:05:11.110> to<00:05:11.169> do<00:05:11.409> yet<00:05:11.620> this<00:05:11.889> thing<00:05:12.159> is

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
what I'm going to do yet this thing is

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.619 
what I'm going to do yet this thing is
probably<00:05:12.699> going<00:05:12.969> to<00:05:13.060> be<00:05:13.120> more<00:05:13.360> or<00:05:13.509> less

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:13.629 
probably going to be more or less
