00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.410
 Hello good Morning 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.250
 let's see one more time 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:12.370
 let's perform certain techniques of 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:16.059
 use of short corners 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:19.240
 short of the book of kaplan this occasion 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:22.150
 will learn how to maintain control of 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.539
 several cards seen through the corner 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:28.179
 short so first bought 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.270
 hands and legs from the heat and they start 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.689
 to sweat 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:37.100
 really 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:40.940
 place the letter of short corners in the 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.860
 bottom of the deck and you'll use 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.090
 the method that I explain in the video 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.370
 previous 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.630
 of view of letter by the viewer 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:56.809
 you attract a rifle or and a break control 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.809
 so proceed to place the deck 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.240
 upright rifle to the cards 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.129
 it's so hot, say high the 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.860
 viewer observes the card in this case 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:12.020
 7 of diamonds you produce the separation 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:14.240
 with the middle finger in the middle of the 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.980
 shuffles on the outside as 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.950
 I explained on the previous occasion with your 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.660
 thumb finger press up to 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.290
 create the separation at the bottom 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:27.170
 and place the little finger in this position 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.110
 in this way we maintain control 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.450
 about the letter chosen by the viewer 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.259
 now you are going to proceed to make a 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.440
 mix by drag for this you must with 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.390
 the right hand come to look for the 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.550
 lower package 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.229
 since we have the break we do the 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:51.020
 separation with the thumb introduced in 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:54.860
 the same place and the index finger with the 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.540
 nail located in the center all this 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.700
 it seems very orthodox evidently they are 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.110
 movements that you should practice 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.150
 agreement if you have 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.039
 index finger to remove the letters 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.890
 superiors by letting them fall into your hand 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.830
 left and proceeding to the mixing by 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:18.080
 dragging until you reach the 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:21.480
 last so that in this way the letter 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:25.080
 chosen by the viewer is in the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.590
 bottom and corner chart 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.450
 short stay at the top 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.010
 first phase they have made the mixture 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.220
 you make a mix again 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.310
 drag on this occasion holding the 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.740
 first and last with thumb and 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.130
 middle finger 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.710
 strips of the whole deck - these two 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.800
 placing the chosen card in the last 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:53.640
 position and just above it our 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.430
 letter of short corners you paste all the 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:01.280
 letters you drag all the letters over 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:04.670
 of these staying in this position 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.110
 proceed with a second viewer because 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.160
 you are going to make the same movements 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:13.500
 as many times as letters should you give to 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.920
 choose so for the second 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.690
 the same operation raise the deck have 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.570
 note that in a game of this type 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.360
 It can be said that the second spectator 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.390
 must know the letter of the first 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:30.330
 you make the rifle or samples in this 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.959
 case through camera I do not see the jack 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.900
 of hearts you keep separating 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.430
 making the break the same situation 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:43.650
 thumb to the bottom of the nail 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:46.650
 it stops for mixtures by dragging peeling a 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.810
 to join the letters so that they remain in 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.920
 the top in this case 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.790
 inverted 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.340
 the short letter chosen by the first 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.730
 viewer and the one chosen by the second 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.750
 now we have it below proceeds is the same 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.700
 you give first and second but not the 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.990
 you hit the next one too 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.800
 you bring it 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.960
 and you finish the mix now you have 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.720
 in the same order as before but added 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.299
 a letter plus a short letter when the 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.840
 first writer letter of the second let's 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:26.510
 a by the third and successive according to 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.360
 number of letters that you should give to 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.660
 choose a rifle or let's look for the 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:36.110
 black a black one of those that saves me the 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:40.420
 plane the ace of spades according is done 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.420
 the control you make the break 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.830
 shows the deck at some point 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.500
 all in a succession without stopping you 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.210
 and in a perfect sequence of agreement 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.910
 I do it very slowly so there's no 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.390
 no inconvenience 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:59.690
 you get all the cards up when 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.460
 you get to the end of one to one 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.530
 all with an adequate speed 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.350
 so you do not notice that you're 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.840
 placing one by one of course all 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.580
 this very slowly to learn it and 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.980
 then you will give the frequency 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.130
 it requires us to stay the same as before 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:19.160
 of the last viewer in the part 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:22.850
 lower and the other two up is now 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:26.900
 the same as the first and last one and 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:29.000
 two and then continue with the sequence 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.520
 that will repeat as I say so many times 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.940
 as it is necessary 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:37.009
 I will choose a letter a spectator 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.610
 you will always have now if you will perform 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:39.610
 a cut 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:47.420
 would you have from the short letter that 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.430
 is this the letter chosen by the first 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.590
 viewer the chosen one for that 1 and the 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.170
 chosen by the third and so formula 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.930
 diego successively without needing more 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:59.780
 spectators movements that you must 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:02.960
 practice very calmly with 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.569
 a lot of patience with a lot of determination so that 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.759
 out 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:12.569
 with the necessary fluidity thank you very much 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:12.569
 and until the next video
