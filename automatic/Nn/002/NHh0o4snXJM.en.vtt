00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
jumping off high places are even after a

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.920 
jumping off high places are even after a
flip<00:00:31.740> after<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.520> front<00:00:32.969> flip<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.360> can<00:00:33.570> do<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
shoulder pretty much it's kind of like a

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.709 
shoulder pretty much it's kind of like a
little<00:00:50.460> tight<00:00:50.670> area<00:00:51.180> but<00:00:53.210> probably<00:00:54.210> over<00:00:54.600> your

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.100 
you're going down like that and you're
kind<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.860> pushing<00:01:05.250> yourself<00:01:05.720> outwards<00:01:06.720> so

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
kind of pushing yourself outwards so

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.010 
kind of pushing yourself outwards so
you're<00:01:07.530> going<00:01:07.650> down<00:01:08.010> out<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.600> then<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.840> roll

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
jumping off a high place you want to

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.320 
jumping off a high place you want to
just<00:01:28.290> get<00:01:29.290> your<00:01:29.560> legs<00:01:29.740> just<00:01:31.049> completely

unlock them so once you hit the ground

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.410 
unlock them so once you hit the ground
you<00:01:36.700> just<00:01:36.880> kind<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:37.899> fall<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:40.000> is<00:01:40.210> that's

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
you just kind of fall this is that's

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.270 
you just kind of fall this is that's
what<00:01:40.540> you're<00:01:40.690> pretty<00:01:40.840> much<00:01:40.960> even<00:01:41.170> for<00:01:41.350> you're

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
what you're pretty much even for you're

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.910 
what you're pretty much even for you're
going<00:01:42.610> to<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:42.850> ground<00:01:43.060> you<00:01:43.990> find<00:01:44.560> pretty<00:01:44.770> much

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
going to the ground you find pretty much

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.590 
going to the ground you find pretty much
unblock<00:01:45.369> your<00:01:45.580> legs<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.899> you<00:01:47.110> just<00:01:47.320> fall<00:01:48.600> but

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
unblock your legs and you just fall but

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.270 
unblock your legs and you just fall but
at<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:49.810> same<00:01:50.020> time<00:01:50.259> you're<00:01:50.470> pushing<00:01:50.830> forward

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
at the same time you're pushing forward

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.150 
at the same time you're pushing forward
so<00:01:51.460> your<00:01:51.580> unlocking<00:01:52.179> your<00:01:52.210> legs<00:01:52.570> and<00:01:53.160> you're

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
so your unlocking your legs and you're

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.279 
so your unlocking your legs and you're
just<00:01:55.590> rolling<00:01:56.590> forward<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.750> stacks<00:01:59.050> are

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
just rolling forward the stacks are

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.730 
just rolling forward the stacks are
scientifically<00:01:59.979> proven<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:01.259> reduce<00:02:02.259> the

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
scientifically proven to reduce the

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.090 
scientifically proven to reduce the
weight<00:02:02.979> that's<00:02:03.310> coming<00:02:03.819> down<00:02:04.030> on<00:02:04.060> you<00:02:05.100> when

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
weight that's coming down on you when

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.639 
weight that's coming down on you when
you're<00:02:06.220> jumping<00:02:06.610> off<00:02:06.729> a<00:02:06.759> high<00:02:06.970> place<00:02:07.649> it

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
you're jumping off a high place it

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.130 
you're jumping off a high place it
actually<00:02:08.860> reduces<00:02:09.489> the<00:02:10.000> impact<00:02:10.179> on<00:02:10.810> your

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
actually reduces the impact on your

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.130 
actually reduces the impact on your
ankles<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:11.830> your<00:02:11.920> legs<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:14.470> I'm<00:02:14.860> going<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:16.140> try

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
ankles and your legs so I'm going to try

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.780 
ankles and your legs so I'm going to try
and<00:02:19.140> demonstrate<00:02:20.140> one<00:02:20.800> as<00:02:21.069> if<00:02:21.310> I<00:02:21.430> was<00:02:21.610> trying

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
and demonstrate one as if I was trying

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.239 
and demonstrate one as if I was trying
to<00:02:21.940> jump<00:02:22.030> off<00:02:22.390> something

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:27.249 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.190 

that's<00:02:28.249> mainly<00:02:28.489> what<00:02:28.700> I<00:02:28.819> would<00:02:28.969> do<00:02:29.090> of<00:02:29.870> course

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
that's mainly what I would do of course

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.699 
that's mainly what I would do of course
it<00:02:30.829> looks<00:02:30.920> like<00:02:31.219> i'm<00:02:31.370> still<00:02:32.439> kind<00:02:33.439> of<00:02:33.499> rolling

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
it looks like i'm still kind of rolling

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.270 
it looks like i'm still kind of rolling
