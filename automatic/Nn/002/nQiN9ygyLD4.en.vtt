here's the video review for transformers
power<00:00:03.540> core<00:00:03.870> combiners<00:00:04.500> Leadfoot<00:00:05.160> with

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
power core combiners Leadfoot with

power core combiners Leadfoot with
throttler<00:00:07.519> as<00:00:08.519> I've<00:00:08.760> said<00:00:08.910> before<00:00:08.970> throttler

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
throttler as I've said before throttler

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.360 
throttler as I've said before throttler
I<00:00:09.750> think<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.080> my<00:00:10.200> favorite<00:00:10.230> Minicon<00:00:10.980> out<00:00:11.250> of

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
I think is my favorite Minicon out of

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.129 
I think is my favorite Minicon out of
all<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.700> Power<00:00:11.910> Core<00:00:12.179> combiners<00:00:12.660> mini<00:00:12.870> cons

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
all the Power Core combiners mini cons

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.609 
all the Power Core combiners mini cons
and<00:00:14.130> Leadfoot<00:00:14.610> now<00:00:15.420> he's<00:00:15.570> well<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.750> really<00:00:16.500> was

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
and Leadfoot now he's well I really was

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.680 
and Leadfoot now he's well I really was
looking<00:00:16.859> forward<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.130> him<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.430> like<00:00:17.970> LED<00:00:18.150> foot<00:00:18.390> I

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
looking forward to him I like LED foot I

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.840 
looking forward to him I like LED foot I
was<00:00:19.170> he<00:00:19.410> was<00:00:19.529> my<00:00:19.680> favorite<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.160> wave<00:00:20.310> 2<00:00:20.550> when<00:00:20.730> we

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
was he was my favorite of wave 2 when we

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.400 
was he was my favorite of wave 2 when we
saw<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.029> pictures<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.630> he's<00:00:22.050> still<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.230> pretty

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
saw the pictures and he's still a pretty

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.960 
saw the pictures and he's still a pretty
good<00:00:22.470> figure<00:00:22.830> but<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.010> do<00:00:23.100> think<00:00:23.340> sledge<00:00:23.670> beats

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
good figure but I do think sledge beats

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.009 
good figure but I do think sledge beats
him<00:00:24.090> out<00:00:24.210> just<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.539> little<00:00:24.570> bit

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
him out just a little bit

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.380 
him out just a little bit
you<00:00:25.859> see<00:00:26.039> throttles<00:00:26.430> attached<00:00:26.789> here<00:00:27.150> as<00:00:27.269> an

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
you see throttles attached here as an

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.450 
you see throttles attached here as an
engineering<00:00:27.810> kind<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.109> see<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.289> exhaust<00:00:28.740> as

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
engineering kind of see the exhaust as

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.290 
engineering kind of see the exhaust as
an<00:00:29.910> engine<00:00:30.179> gun<00:00:31.160> you're<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:32.279> throttler<00:00:32.730> we're

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
an engine gun you're on throttler we're

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.139 
an engine gun you're on throttler we're
here<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.540> pin<00:00:33.719> point<00:00:34.280> lead<00:00:35.280> foot<00:00:35.579> there<00:00:35.910> we<00:00:36.030> go

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
here on pin point lead foot there we go

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.580 
here on pin point lead foot there we go
left<00:00:36.300> foot<00:00:36.450> with<00:00:36.570> pinpoint<00:00:36.809> if<00:00:37.200> there<00:00:37.320> we<00:00:37.410> go

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
left foot with pinpoint if there we go

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.760 
left foot with pinpoint if there we go
pinpoint<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.309> his<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.879> guy's<00:00:39.090> name<00:00:39.770> just

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
pinpoint is his this guy's name just

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.170 
pinpoint is his this guy's name just
tired<00:00:41.040> I'll<00:00:41.399> get<00:00:41.700> everything<00:00:41.910> correct

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
tired I'll get everything correct

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.970 
tired I'll get everything correct
eventually<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:43.020> can<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.379> pop<00:00:43.500> him<00:00:43.649> off<00:00:43.770> and

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
eventually we can just pop him off and

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.979 
eventually we can just pop him off and
fold<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.309> down<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.730> there's<00:00:44.910> lead<00:00:45.600> foot<00:00:45.840> in

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
fold that down and there's lead foot in

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.600 
fold that down and there's lead foot in
his<00:00:46.110> racecar<00:00:46.350> mode<00:00:47.329> and<00:00:48.329> then<00:00:48.530> pinpoint<00:00:49.610> you

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
his racecar mode and then pinpoint you

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.790 
his racecar mode and then pinpoint you
bring<00:00:50.820> his<00:00:50.910> legs<00:00:51.149> down<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.539> around<00:00:54.680> bring<00:00:55.680> his

arms<00:00:56.070> around<00:00:56.449> and<00:00:57.449> fold<00:00:57.750> his<00:00:57.930> guns<00:00:58.199> down<00:00:58.469> and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
arms around and fold his guns down and

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.340 
arms around and fold his guns down and
there's<00:00:58.800> pinpoint<00:00:59.370> in<00:01:00.120> his<00:01:00.570> robot<00:01:00.989> mode<00:01:01.020> and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
there's pinpoint in his robot mode and

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.689 
there's pinpoint in his robot mode and
there's<00:01:01.469> something<00:01:01.590> vaguely<00:01:01.920> truant<00:01:02.520> asked

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
there's something vaguely truant asked

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.310

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.539 
nice humanoid esque Minicon I like I
said<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.900> like<00:01:16.409> his<00:01:16.590> design<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.070> best<00:01:17.280> he<00:01:17.400> just

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549

said I like his design the best he just
looks<00:01:17.729> really<00:01:17.909> cool<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> robot<00:01:18.479> mode<00:01:19.159> but

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
looks really cool in a robot mode but

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.880 
looks really cool in a robot mode but
we'll<00:01:20.250> set<00:01:20.400> him<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> side<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:22.740> then

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
we'll set him to the side and then

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.910 
we'll set him to the side and then
here's<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.220> lead<00:01:23.490> foot<00:01:23.960> yeah<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.229> transform<00:01:25.740> him

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
here's a lead foot yeah I transform him

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.609 
here's a lead foot yeah I transform him
I<00:01:26.009> want<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.220> go<00:01:26.310> ahead<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.549> fold<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> wheels

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
I want to go ahead and fold the wheels

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.140 
I want to go ahead and fold the wheels
down<00:01:28.619> just<00:01:28.920> like<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.280> almost<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.759> hover<00:01:29.909> car

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
down just like that almost a hover car

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.760 
down just like that almost a hover car
mode<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.780> back<00:01:30.960> wheels<00:01:31.170> don't<00:01:31.409> fold<00:01:31.590> down

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
mode but the back wheels don't fold down

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.440 
mode but the back wheels don't fold down
so<00:01:32.040> no<00:01:32.520> go<00:01:32.900> and<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.140> we<00:01:34.259> come<00:01:34.680> back<00:01:34.710> here<00:01:35.100> and

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
so no go and then we come back here and

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.179 
so no go and then we come back here and
detach<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:38.009> hands<00:01:38.549> they<00:01:38.670> snap<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.950> legs

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
detach the hands they snap on the legs

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.450 
detach the hands they snap on the legs
there<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:42.119> do<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.479> same<00:01:42.600> over<00:01:42.810> on<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:42.990> side

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
there and do the same over on this side

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.240 
there and do the same over on this side
and<00:01:44.460> then<00:01:44.850> we<00:01:44.909> bring<00:01:45.180> them<00:01:45.890> bring<00:01:46.890> them<00:01:47.040> out<00:01:47.130> to

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
and then we bring them bring them out to

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.609 
and then we bring them bring them out to
the<00:01:47.340> sides<00:01:47.579> here<00:01:47.850> for<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.030> time<00:01:48.240> being<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:49.470> go

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
the sides here for the time being and go

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.109 
the sides here for the time being and go
ahead<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:49.890> take<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.159> whole<00:01:50.369> piece<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.939> fold

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
ahead and take this whole piece and fold

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.380 
ahead and take this whole piece and fold
it<00:01:51.329> back<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.540> around<00:01:52.369> and<00:01:53.369> then<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:53.729> extend

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
it back and around and then just extend

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.980

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
the legs just by folding them up like

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.569 
the legs just by folding them up like
that<00:01:58.430> flip<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.579> power<00:01:59.790> core<00:02:00.000> combine<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.420> back

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
that flip the power core combine it back

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.840 
that flip the power core combine it back
and<00:02:02.579> then<00:02:02.790> sing<00:02:03.180> over<00:02:03.390> here<00:02:03.659> just<00:02:03.869> flip<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.259> up

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
and then sing over here just flip it up

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.730 
and then sing over here just flip it up
all<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.000> way<00:02:06.119> until<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.390> snaps<00:02:06.719> pull<00:02:07.590> that

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
all the way until it snaps pull that

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.160 
all the way until it snaps pull that
back<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.129> serve<00:02:08.340> as<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.520> heel<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:09.599> can<00:02:09.810> fold<00:02:10.050> it

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
back to serve as a heel you can fold it

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.600 
back to serve as a heel you can fold it
all<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.379> way<00:02:10.470> up<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.679> only<00:02:11.099> actually<00:02:11.459> no<00:02:11.550> you

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
all the way up and only actually no you

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.559 
all the way up and only actually no you
can't<00:02:12.120> fold<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.480> up<00:02:12.690> like<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:13.140> if<00:02:13.379> you

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
can't fold it up like that if you

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.750 
can't fold it up like that if you
but<00:02:13.989> why<00:02:14.920> it's<00:02:15.040> easier<00:02:15.310> just<00:02:15.340> use<00:02:15.549> them<00:02:15.670> as

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
but why it's easier just use them as

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.349 
but why it's easier just use them as
heels<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:17.260> then<00:02:17.469> bring<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:18.209> shoulders<00:02:19.209> all

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.349 
heels and then bring the shoulders all
the<00:02:19.389> way<00:02:19.510> up<00:02:19.719> just<00:02:20.310> like<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.609> fold<00:02:22.030> them<00:02:22.150> down

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:22.359 
the way up just like that fold them down

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:24.839 
the way up just like that fold them down
and<00:02:22.689> then<00:02:23.049> you<00:02:23.109> want<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.319> rotate<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:24.459> exhaust

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.349 
and then you want to rotate the exhaust

but that's just a support for for

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:44.530 
but that's just a support for for
playing<00:04:33.800> them<00:04:34.010> in<00:04:34.480> folders<00:04:35.480> arm<00:04:35.750> up<00:04:35.870> here<00:04:43.540> we

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
playing them in folders arm up here we

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.910 
playing them in folders arm up here we
do<00:04:44.690> that<00:04:44.840> you<00:04:44.960> want<00:04:45.110> to<00:04:45.170> rotate<00:04:45.350> his<00:04:45.590> legs<00:04:45.890> up

do that you want to rotate his legs up

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.940 
do that you want to rotate his legs up
that's<00:04:48.920> not<00:04:49.100> right<00:04:50.290> there<00:04:51.290> we<00:04:51.380> go<00:04:51.530> bring<00:04:51.830> his

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
that's not right there we go bring his

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.440 
that's not right there we go bring his
legs<00:04:52.100> up<00:04:52.340> and<00:04:52.520> rotate<00:04:52.850> him<00:04:53.000> down<00:04:53.150> like<00:04:53.300> that

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
legs up and rotate him down like that

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.690 
legs up and rotate him down like that
there<00:04:53.750> we<00:04:53.840> go

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
there we go

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:01.290 
there we go
leg<00:04:55.700> up<00:04:56.950> and<00:04:57.950> then<00:04:58.130> rotate<00:04:58.610> it<00:04:58.850> down<00:04:59.150> like<00:04:59.360> that

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
leg up and then rotate it down like that

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.340 
leg up and then rotate it down like that
and<00:05:02.300> that<00:05:02.480> lets<00:05:02.720> you<00:05:02.840> pull<00:05:03.020> down<00:05:03.200> the

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
and that lets you pull down the

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.770 
and that lets you pull down the
connector<00:05:03.920> pegs<00:05:06.190> clip<00:05:07.190> it<00:05:07.310> down<00:05:07.660> and<00:05:08.660> then

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
connector pegs clip it down and then

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.970 
connector pegs clip it down and then
bring<00:05:08.990> the<00:05:09.080> arms<00:05:09.110> down<00:05:11.530> and<00:05:12.530> they<00:05:12.650> plug<00:05:12.860> in

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
bring the arms down and they plug in

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.310 
bring the arms down and they plug in
like<00:05:13.130> that<00:05:13.400> there<00:05:13.790> we<00:05:13.940> go<00:05:14.090> and<00:05:14.510> then<00:05:14.660> out<00:05:15.110> and

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
like that there we go and then out and

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.250 
like that there we go and then out and
bend<00:05:15.530> them<00:05:15.650> in<00:05:15.880> just<00:05:16.880> like<00:05:16.970> that<00:05:20.200> right<00:05:21.200> in

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
bend them in just like that right in

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:27.430 
bend them in just like that right in
there<00:05:21.530> there<00:05:22.490> you<00:05:22.610> go<00:05:22.730> and<00:05:23.770> rotate<00:05:24.770> it<00:05:26.440> again

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
there there you go and rotate it again

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.650 
there there you go and rotate it again
bring<00:05:27.800> it<00:05:27.830> out<00:05:28.040> until<00:05:28.430> that<00:05:28.610> fits<00:05:29.210> right<00:05:29.390> over

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
bring it out until that fits right over

bring it out until that fits right over
that<00:05:29.690> like<00:05:30.500> that<00:05:31.300> fold<00:05:32.300> down<00:05:32.360> these

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
that like that fold down these

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.410 
that like that fold down these
connectors<00:05:34.690> and<00:05:35.690> there<00:05:35.990> is<00:05:36.290> lead<00:05:36.860> foot<00:05:37.130> in

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.420

unfortunately this way his race car

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.880 
unfortunately this way his race car
opens<00:06:54.750> up<00:06:54.900> a<00:06:54.960> little<00:06:55.110> bit<00:06:55.260> to<00:06:55.350> let<00:06:55.440> his<00:06:55.560> robot

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:55.890 
opens up a little bit to let his robot

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.150 
opens up a little bit to let his robot
mode<00:06:55.920> head<00:06:56.220> in<00:06:56.370> this<00:06:56.520> is<00:06:56.670> a<00:06:56.700> little<00:06:56.940> loose<00:06:58.160> but

mode head in this is a little loose but
just<00:07:00.030> so<00:07:00.120> you<00:07:00.180> get<00:07:00.330> an<00:07:00.390> idea<00:07:00.660> and<00:07:00.990> we'll<00:07:01.170> plug

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 
just so you get an idea and we'll plug

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.230 
just so you get an idea and we'll plug
in<00:07:01.440> the<00:07:03.380> rally<00:07:04.380> drone<00:07:04.740> and<00:07:05.370> then<00:07:05.610> the<00:07:05.790> truck

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:46.590 
and like and like I said the wave the

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.250 
and like and like I said the wave the
wave<00:07:46.710> 2<00:07:47.040> 2<00:07:47.310> packs<00:07:47.610> are<00:07:47.970> much<00:07:48.750> better<00:07:48.960> than<00:07:49.169> the

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:49.260 
wave 2 2 packs are much better than the

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.220 
wave 2 2 packs are much better than the
wave<00:07:49.410> 1<00:07:49.680> ones<00:07:49.890> overall<00:07:50.340> the<00:07:51.240> wave<00:07:51.390> 2<00:07:51.600> 5<00:07:51.870> packs

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:52.230 
wave 1 ones overall the wave 2 5 packs

and you know as soon think they're still
better<00:07:54.240> than<00:07:54.360> wave<00:07:54.540> 1<00:07:54.810> but<00:07:55.410> the<00:07:55.500> 5<00:07:55.710> packs<00:07:56.010> you

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:56.220 
better than wave 1 but the 5 packs you

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.760 
better than wave 1 but the 5 packs you
may<00:07:56.370> want<00:07:56.550> to<00:07:56.610> pass<00:07:56.790> on<00:07:57.290> unless<00:07:58.290> you<00:07:58.470> just<00:07:58.650> want

may want to pass on unless you just want

00:07:58.770 --> 00:07:59.960 
may want to pass on unless you just want
more<00:07:58.890> drones<00:07:59.190> like<00:07:59.280> I<00:07:59.430> said<00:07:59.580> I<00:07:59.640> like<00:07:59.760> these

drones combined with lead foot here but

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:04.670 
drones combined with lead foot here but
there<00:08:03.570> you<00:08:03.630> have<00:08:03.780> it<00:08:03.900> a<00:08:03.930> lead<00:08:04.320> foot<00:08:04.500> with
