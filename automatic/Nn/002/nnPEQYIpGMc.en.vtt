00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.720
 funda 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.490
 supporting structure of the building 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.849
 constructions which perceives everything 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.410
 loads from overlying structures and 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:16.080
 distributes them across the base as a rule 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.470
 made of concrete foundation one 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.130
 of the main structural elements when 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.400
 building a house if we lay 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.470
 mistake right at the beginning of construction 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.529
 saving on material or not on 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.920
 foundation device calculations at the end 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:39.090
 construction and we will get global 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:41.480
 problems down to the cause of the bearing walls 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.829
 There are several types of foundations. 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.750
 most common 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.700
 the foundation is 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.760
 strip foundation depending on 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.180
 gravity home foundation tape do 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.550
 wider or narrower than the wider the foundation 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.730
 less pressure it exerts on the ground 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.100
 banded this is the most common and 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.019
 the most versatile type of foundation it 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.720
 is a foundation tape 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.909
 structure similar to the wall in the cop onuyu 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.220
 the land and the grounds for the house 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.320
 foundation tape can dig into the ground 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.330
 There are a number of conditions from which 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.820
 depends on the depth of the foundation to 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.259
 such conditions include the view of the building of his 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.810
 design features 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.850
 the presence of basements number of floors and so 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.520
 further values and nature of loads 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.159
 acting on the foundation of geological and 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.290
 hydrogeological conditions of the site 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.100
 also the possibility of soil heaving when 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.040
 freezing 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.409
 and precipitation on standing depending on 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.110
 gravity home foundation tape do 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.939
 wider or narrower than the wider the foundation 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.009
 it puts less pressure on the ground 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.140
 for the same good purpose use so 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.750
 called foundation concrete pads 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.220
 is not a ductile material and 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.590
 tensile effect 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.790
 cracks easily when exposed to forces 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.310
 frost heaving 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.320
 from the ground or uneven 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.570
 load from the building foundation 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.729
 slightly deformed at any 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.950
 deformations in the material are created with one 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.030
 sides of compression zones from another zone 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.759
 stretching and 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.009
 in the stretch zone and cracks occur 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.600
 to prevent cracking 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.060
 foundation must be reinforced 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.840
 the next kind of foundation slab 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.480
 foundation it is spread very little in 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.450
 private housing because visible 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.260
 the foundation is with a monolith on 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.800
 the square of the house itself and is very 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.170
 dear 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.630
 at construction the following types 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.660
 The foundations are columnar and 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.269
 from the war they are used in complex 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.209
 ground conditions where quicksand 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.650
 swamps and can not dig a pit 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.410
 for foundation 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.750
 used extremely rarely would seem 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.530
 that the basement with the basement stands 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.959
 alone 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.440
 this type except its main function 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.150
 also has a purely consumer task 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.760
 increase free non-residential often and 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.310
 residential place due to space under 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.470
 ground first builds the foundation plate 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.360
 and on it is already built the walls of the basement 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.430
 the floor of the cottages so much to us floor 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.430
 the foundation is built only slab 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.379
 Yes
