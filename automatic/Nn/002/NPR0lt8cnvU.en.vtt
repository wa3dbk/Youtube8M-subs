first up what exactly happened was I had

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.470 
first up what exactly happened was I had
this<00:00:52.500> team<00:00:52.860> right<00:00:53.010> here<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.910> best<00:00:54.270> thing

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
this team right here and the best thing

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.049 
this team right here and the best thing
about<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.870> team<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.829> chemistry<00:00:56.219> look<00:00:56.940> at

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
about this team is the chemistry look at

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.240 
about this team is the chemistry look at
this<00:00:57.239> chemistry<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:58.020> decided<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.800> play<00:00:59.010> my

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
this chemistry I decided to play my

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.220 
this chemistry I decided to play my
normal<00:00:59.670> formation<00:01:00.180> because<00:01:00.449> chemistry<00:01:00.840> wise

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
normal formation because chemistry wise

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.770 
normal formation because chemistry wise
this<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.760> team<00:01:03.000> wasn't<00:01:03.329> suitable<00:01:03.629> for

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
this this team wasn't suitable for

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.469 
this this team wasn't suitable for
anything<00:01:04.320> really<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.830> another<00:01:05.760> thing<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.210> you

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
anything really and another thing is you

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.870 
anything really and another thing is you
would<00:01:07.080> definitely<00:01:07.350> see<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.400> game<00:01:08.430> when

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
would definitely see it in the game when

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.539 
would definitely see it in the game when
you<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.210> low<00:01:09.510> chemistry<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.229> time<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
you have low chemistry this time and the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.640 
you have low chemistry this time and the
first<00:01:11.580> team<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.420> did<00:01:12.630> come<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:12.900> wore<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.439> only

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650

let<00:01:26.820> me<00:01:26.970> tell<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:27.900> guy<00:01:28.110> was<00:01:28.380> raping

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
let me tell you that this guy was raping

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.120 
let me tell you that this guy was raping
me<00:01:29.040> throughout<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.479> whole<00:01:30.780> match<00:01:31.350> because<00:01:32.009> of

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
me throughout the whole match because of

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.190 
me throughout the whole match because of
my<00:01:32.310> chemistry<00:01:32.820> first<00:01:33.150> up<00:01:33.360> he<00:01:33.810> gets<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
my chemistry first up he gets the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.800 
my chemistry first up he gets the
free-kick<00:01:34.710> right<00:01:35.220> at<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.520> beginning<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.180> I

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
free-kick right at the beginning and I

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.749 
free-kick right at the beginning and I
thought<00:01:37.470> he<00:01:37.619> was<00:01:37.799> actually<00:01:38.009> gonna<00:01:38.189> screw<00:01:38.579> this

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
thought he was actually gonna screw this

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.730 
thought he was actually gonna screw this
because<00:01:39.180> my<00:01:39.360> keeper<00:01:39.869> doesn't<00:01:40.290> have<00:01:40.439> much

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
because my keeper doesn't have much

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.490 
because my keeper doesn't have much
chemistry<00:01:41.159> neither<00:01:41.970> do<00:01:42.240> my<00:01:42.390> defenders<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.229> I

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
chemistry neither do my defenders so I

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.609 
chemistry neither do my defenders so I
was<00:01:43.770> hoping<00:01:44.220> my<00:01:45.119> defenders<00:01:45.659> won't<00:01:45.960> mess<00:01:46.409> up

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
was hoping my defenders won't mess up

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.310 
was hoping my defenders won't mess up
but<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.430> was<00:01:47.880> lucky<00:01:48.030> there<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.600> another<00:01:49.110> thing

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
but I was lucky there and another thing

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.830 
but I was lucky there and another thing
is<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.770> first<00:01:50.130> touch<00:01:50.399> control<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.060> pretty

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
is the first touch control is pretty

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.130 
is the first touch control is pretty
disgusting<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:53.220> mean<00:01:53.700> really<00:01:54.090> really<00:01:54.540> bad<00:01:54.899> and

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
disgusting I mean really really bad and

disgusting I mean really really bad and
you<00:01:55.470> would<00:01:55.649> definitely<00:01:55.920> feel<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.490> with<00:01:56.820> bronze

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
you would definitely feel it with bronze

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.060 
you would definitely feel it with bronze
players<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.320> me<00:01:58.469> pain<00:01:58.740> from<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
players and this is me pain from the

his dinner tal a really good chemistry

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.499 
his dinner tal a really good chemistry
and<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.530> was<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:07.950> unlucky<00:02:08.459> here<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:09.030> not<00:02:09.209> score

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
and I was so unlucky here to not score

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.900 
and I was so unlucky here to not score
the<00:02:09.629> goal<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:10.440> really<00:02:10.950> wanted<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.340> try<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.670> chip

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
the goal I really wanted to try and chip

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.820 
the goal I really wanted to try and chip
the<00:02:12.720> first<00:02:12.989> goal<00:02:13.230> by

the first goal by
didn't<00:02:14.010> work<00:02:14.190> but<00:02:14.730> I'm<00:02:15.150> gonna<00:02:15.390> keep<00:02:15.660> showing

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
didn't work but I'm gonna keep showing

didn't work but I'm gonna keep showing
you<00:02:16.020> some<00:02:16.200> other<00:02:16.380> clips<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:17.220> will<00:02:17.790> be<00:02:17.970> pretty

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
you some other clips that will be pretty

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.120 
you some other clips that will be pretty
cool<00:02:18.510> look<00:02:18.720> at<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:18.960> one<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.380> impact<00:02:19.740> engine

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
cool look at this one the impact engine

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.490 
cool look at this one the impact engine
I<00:02:20.480> don't<00:02:21.480> even<00:02:21.570> know<00:02:21.750> what<00:02:21.930> happened<00:02:22.320> there

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
I don't even know what happened there

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.830 
I don't even know what happened there
but<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:23.130> know<00:02:23.310> I'm<00:02:23.700> testing<00:02:24.150> here<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.480> Natale

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
but you know I'm testing here the Natale

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.010 
but you know I'm testing here the Natale
with<00:02:25.280> my<00:02:26.280> lot<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.300> his<00:02:27.420> long<00:02:27.630> shots

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
with my lot of his long shots

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.290 
with my lot of his long shots
obviously<00:02:28.740> with<00:02:29.160> chemistry<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.940> can't

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
obviously with chemistry I can't

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.720 
obviously with chemistry I can't
really<00:02:30.480> give<00:02:31.050> him<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.290> fair<00:02:31.590> prediction<00:02:32.430> of<00:02:32.550> how

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
really give him a fair prediction of how

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.790 
really give him a fair prediction of how
good<00:02:32.910> he<00:02:33.030> is<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.300> there<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:33.900> Warner<00:02:34.380> coming<00:02:34.680> to

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
good he is and there a Warner coming to

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.010 
good he is and there a Warner coming to
the<00:02:34.890> rescue<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.460> as<00:02:35.820> you<00:02:35.970> can<00:02:36.120> see<00:02:36.180> I'm<00:02:36.690> pretty

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
the rescue and as you can see I'm pretty

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.010 
the rescue and as you can see I'm pretty
much<00:02:37.290> getting<00:02:37.530> my<00:02:37.920> ass<00:02:38.190> whupped<00:02:38.580> by<00:02:39.210> this<00:02:39.750> guy

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
much getting my ass whupped by this guy

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.710 
much getting my ass whupped by this guy
because<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.590> he<00:02:41.190> has<00:02:41.370> 93<00:02:41.910> chemistry<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.420> think

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
because of he has 93 chemistry I think

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.170 
because of he has 93 chemistry I think
and<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:43.260> had<00:02:43.440> like<00:02:43.620> 41<00:02:44.280> or<00:02:44.430> something<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:44.940> this

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
and I had like 41 or something and this

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
guy is really fast and I was so lucky

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.970 
guy is really fast and I was so lucky
there<00:02:47.820> not<00:02:48.000> even<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:49.170> be<00:02:49.290> handed<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.590> penalty

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
there not even to be handed the penalty

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.830 
there not even to be handed the penalty
he<00:02:50.790> could<00:02:50.940> have<00:02:51.030> easily<00:02:51.270> been<00:02:51.420> handed<00:02:51.750> a

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
he could have easily been handed a

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.320 
he could have easily been handed a
penalty<00:02:52.140> but<00:02:52.590> his<00:02:52.770> d'italia<00:02:53.340> again<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:53.850> he

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
penalty but his d'italia again and he

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.240 
penalty but his d'italia again and he
should<00:02:54.630> normally<00:02:55.020> school<00:02:55.350> that<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.830> then

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
should normally school that and then

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.880 
should normally school that and then
again<00:02:56.580> he<00:02:57.060> was<00:02:57.090> so<00:02:57.480> unlucky<00:02:58.050> there<00:02:58.290> he<00:02:58.620> gives

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
again he was so unlucky there he gives

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.610 
again he was so unlucky there he gives
me<00:02:59.070> a<00:02:59.100> penalty<00:02:59.550> and<00:02:59.810> he<00:03:00.810> could<00:03:01.080> have<00:03:01.230> just<00:03:01.410> not

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
me a penalty and he could have just not

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.210 
me a penalty and he could have just not
done<00:03:01.890> anything<00:03:02.190> but<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:03.330> know<00:03:03.740> he<00:03:04.740> decides<00:03:05.130> to

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
done anything but you know he decides to

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.490 
done anything but you know he decides to
give<00:03:05.400> me<00:03:05.520> a<00:03:05.550> penalty<00:03:05.940> I'll<00:03:06.480> take<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:07.020> I'll<00:03:07.170> take

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
give me a penalty I'll take it I'll take

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.890 
give me a penalty I'll take it I'll take
him<00:03:07.709> but<00:03:07.860> then<00:03:08.010> again<00:03:08.130> I<00:03:08.490> was<00:03:09.000> unlucky<00:03:09.600> yes

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
him but then again I was unlucky yes

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.040 
him but then again I was unlucky yes
again<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:11.220> is<00:03:11.400> what<00:03:11.610> I<00:03:11.640> decided<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.360> do<00:03:12.600> I

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
again and this is what I decided to do I

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.070 
again and this is what I decided to do I
decided<00:03:13.709> to<00:03:13.920> be<00:03:14.070> very<00:03:14.640> cocky<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.360> look<00:03:15.840> what<00:03:16.050> I

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
decided to be very cocky and look what I

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.009 
decided to be very cocky and look what I
gained<00:03:16.440> me<00:03:16.650> nothing<00:03:17.400> nothing<00:03:18.239> I<00:03:18.360> would<00:03:18.630> the

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
gained me nothing nothing I would the

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.050 
gained me nothing nothing I would the
keeper<00:03:19.320> saves<00:03:19.530> it<00:03:19.739> here<00:03:19.980> we<00:03:20.130> go<00:03:20.340> dinner<00:03:20.640> today

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
keeper saves it here we go dinner today

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.030 
keeper saves it here we go dinner today
using<00:03:21.660> that<00:03:21.810> awesome<00:03:22.230> dribbling<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.709> is<00:03:22.860> the

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
using that awesome dribbling of is the

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.310 
using that awesome dribbling of is the
pace<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.580> normally<00:03:24.269> he<00:03:24.300> would<00:03:24.690> be<00:03:24.840> finishing

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
pace and normally he would be finishing

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.259 
pace and normally he would be finishing
those<00:03:25.500> sawed-off<00:03:25.769> shots<00:03:26.160> or<00:03:26.489> finesse<00:03:27.000> shots

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
those sawed-off shots or finesse shots

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.470 
those sawed-off shots or finesse shots
but<00:03:27.810> because<00:03:28.410> of<00:03:28.440> his<00:03:28.650> chemistry<00:03:29.120> this<00:03:30.120> game

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
but because of his chemistry this game

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.720 
but because of his chemistry this game
is<00:03:30.720> completely<00:03:31.470> different<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:32.010> FIFA<00:03:32.280> 12<00:03:32.519> and

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
is completely different to FIFA 12 and

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.850 
is completely different to FIFA 12 and
guys<00:03:33.239> let<00:03:33.600> me<00:03:33.630> tell<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:34.019> bronze<00:03:34.320> plates<00:03:34.620> are

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
guys let me tell you bronze plates are

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.580 
guys let me tell you bronze plates are
really<00:03:35.430> hard<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.090> play<00:03:36.390> with<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.810> as<00:03:37.320> you<00:03:37.470> guys

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
really hard to play with and as you guys

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.350 
really hard to play with and as you guys
could<00:03:37.800> see<00:03:37.860> most<00:03:38.340> of<00:03:38.580> my<00:03:38.700> players<00:03:38.970> are<00:03:39.120> bronze

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
could see most of my players are bronze
