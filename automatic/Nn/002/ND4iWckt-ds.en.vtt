00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
conservatively when I'm in the middle of

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.460 
conservatively when I'm in the middle of
that<00:01:14.430> four<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.000> eight<00:01:15.150> kill<00:01:15.450> mark<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:16.350> know

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
that four to eight kill mark you know

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.080 
that four to eight kill mark you know
when<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.740> don't<00:01:16.950> have<00:01:17.040> any<00:01:17.189> kills<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:17.939> go

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
when I don't have any kills I just go

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.730 
when I don't have any kills I just go
out<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.570> play<00:01:18.810> pretty<00:01:19.020> aggressive<00:01:19.530> and

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
out and I play pretty aggressive and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.100 
out and I play pretty aggressive and
then<00:01:20.310> when<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.460> get<00:01:20.700> into<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.509> killstreak

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
then when I get into that killstreak

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.990 
then when I get into that killstreak
window<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:23.130> know<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.250> tend<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.580> play<00:01:23.729> pretty

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
window you know I tend to play pretty

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.649 
window you know I tend to play pretty
defensively<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:26.000> things<00:01:27.000> like<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.210> just<00:01:27.360> so

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
defensively and things like that just so

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.179 
defensively and things like that just so
that<00:01:27.750> i<00:01:27.810> can<00:01:27.869> try<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.500> get<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.770> kill<00:01:29.009> streak

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
that i can try and get that kill streak

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.520 
that i can try and get that kill streak
and<00:01:29.340> then<00:01:29.430> once<00:01:29.610> i<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:29.939> my<00:01:30.119> kill<00:01:30.390> streak<00:01:30.659> then

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
and then once i have my kill streak then

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.130 
and then once i have my kill streak then
I<00:01:31.619> just<00:01:31.770> go<00:01:31.920> out<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.100> get<00:01:32.340> people<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.140> then

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
I just go out and get people so then

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.080 
I just go out and get people so then
another<00:01:34.530> EMP<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.460> was<00:01:35.610> getting<00:01:35.820> all<00:01:35.909> excited

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.160 
set of my killstreaks and look at this
guy<00:02:20.670> here<00:02:20.910> as<00:02:21.030> he's<00:02:21.239> getting<00:02:21.480> some<00:02:21.780> lag

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
guy here as he's getting some lag

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.000 
guy here as he's getting some lag
compensation<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:23.099> think<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:24.360> now<00:02:24.860> as<00:02:25.860> I'm

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
compensation I think so now as I'm

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.170 
compensation I think so now as I'm
coming<00:02:26.160> back<00:02:26.370> here<00:02:26.610> I'm<00:02:26.730> starting<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.060> realize

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
coming back here I'm starting to realize

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.119 
coming back here I'm starting to realize
that<00:02:27.330> ok<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.019> second<00:02:28.410> EMP<00:02:28.709> is<00:02:28.739> probably

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
that ok that the second EMP is probably

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.759 
that ok that the second EMP is probably
where<00:02:29.340> enough<00:02:29.930> we're<00:02:30.930> probably<00:02:31.170> almost<00:02:31.500> good

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
where enough we're probably almost good

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.600 
where enough we're probably almost good
to<00:02:31.799> go<00:02:32.010> here<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.459> so<00:02:33.209> one<00:02:33.510> second<00:02:33.930> left<00:02:34.489> and<00:02:35.489> I

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
to go here and so one second left and I

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.600 
to go here and so one second left and I
see<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:36.030> score<00:02:36.299> 64<00:02:36.959> 261<00:02:37.590> are<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:38.069> kidding<00:02:38.580> me

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
see the score 64 261 are you kidding me

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.940 
see the score 64 261 are you kidding me
it's<00:02:39.450> like<00:02:39.690> all<00:02:39.870> my<00:02:39.900> Reaper<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.470> I'm<00:02:40.680> telling
