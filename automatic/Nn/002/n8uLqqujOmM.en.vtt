out<00:02:12.020> but<00:02:12.260> what<00:02:12.410> I'm<00:02:12.470> going<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:12.650> do<00:02:12.860> is<00:02:13.420> probably

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
out but what I'm going to do is probably

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:21.370 
out but what I'm going to do is probably
due<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:15.580> layers<00:02:16.580> thick<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:18.770> weather<00:02:20.260> for<00:02:21.260> the

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
due to layers thick the weather for the

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.540 
due to layers thick the weather for the
back<00:02:21.700> plate<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:23.390> lift<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.440> blade<00:02:24.680> up<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:25.340> keep

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
back plate to lift the blade up to keep

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.710 
back plate to lift the blade up to keep
that<00:02:25.760> nice<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:26.660> heavy<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.670> then<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:29.000> can<00:02:29.420> still

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
that nice and heavy and then I can still

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.699 
that nice and heavy and then I can still
put<00:02:29.989> in<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.230> well<00:02:31.239> in<00:02:32.239> there<00:02:32.660> and<00:02:33.110> then<00:02:33.320> this<00:02:33.470> top

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
put in a well in there and then this top

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.090 
put in a well in there and then this top
piece<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:35.030> main<00:02:35.330> piece<00:02:35.750> in<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:36.110> front<00:02:36.470> will

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
piece the main piece in the front will

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.070 
piece the main piece in the front will
be<00:02:37.220> a<00:02:37.250> fold-over<00:02:37.790> so<00:02:38.120> that<00:02:38.269> I<00:02:38.300> loop<00:02:38.570> back<00:02:38.810> on

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
be a fold-over so that I loop back on

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.940 
be a fold-over so that I loop back on
itself<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.860> where<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.040> can<00:02:40.160> have<00:02:40.459> a<00:02:40.489> belt<00:02:41.450> spot

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
itself to where I can have a belt spot

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.420 
itself to where I can have a belt spot
but<00:02:42.950> on<00:02:43.100> my<00:02:43.640> last<00:02:43.910> insert<00:02:45.040> of<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.220> leather

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
but on my last insert of the leather

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.830 
but on my last insert of the leather
that<00:02:46.670> I'm<00:02:46.790> going<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:46.970> be<00:02:47.030> putting<00:02:47.269> underneath

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
that I'm going to be putting underneath

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.460 
that I'm going to be putting underneath
this<00:02:48.050> blade<00:02:48.500> is<00:02:49.180> gonna<00:02:50.180> have<00:02:50.360> two<00:02:50.780> pieces<00:02:51.050> that

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
this blade is gonna have two pieces that

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.040 
this blade is gonna have two pieces that
come<00:02:51.680> out<00:02:51.980> here<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:53.120> that's<00:02:53.330> going<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.600> be<00:02:53.810> for

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
come out here and that's going to be for

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.930 
come out here and that's going to be for
the<00:02:54.080> buckle<00:02:54.590> I'm<00:02:54.950> going<00:02:55.070> to<00:02:55.160> try<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.310> get<00:02:55.550> in<00:02:55.730> my

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
the buckle I'm going to try to get in my

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.080 
the buckle I'm going to try to get in my
one<00:02:56.930> of<00:02:57.019> them<00:02:57.110> little<00:02:57.410> elastic<00:02:57.950> bands<00:02:58.459> for<00:02:59.000> the

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
one of them little elastic bands for the

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.090 
one of them little elastic bands for the
quick<00:02:59.360> release<00:02:59.540> so<00:03:00.050> when<00:03:00.650> this<00:03:00.739> is<00:03:00.890> on<00:03:01.010> the

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
quick release so when this is on the

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.610 
quick release so when this is on the
shoulder<00:03:01.430> rig<00:03:01.640> hanging<00:03:02.060> upside<00:03:02.420> down<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:02.930> he

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
shoulder rig hanging upside down and he

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.759 
shoulder rig hanging upside down and he
pops<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.690> buckle<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:06.230> get<00:03:06.410> it<00:03:06.500> out<00:03:06.590> of<00:03:06.650> the

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
pops the buckle and get it out of the

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.890 
pops the buckle and get it out of the
way<00:03:06.890> to<00:03:06.950> prevent<00:03:07.459> that<00:03:07.670> from<00:03:07.730> being<00:03:08.060> cut<00:03:08.450> so

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
way to prevent that from being cut so

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.840 
way to prevent that from being cut so
that's<00:03:09.650> my<00:03:09.890> idea<00:03:10.190> that's<00:03:10.459> what<00:03:10.610> I'm<00:03:10.670> going

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
that's my idea that's what I'm going

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.210 
that's my idea that's what I'm going
with<00:03:11.000> so<00:03:11.420> we'll<00:03:12.079> see<00:03:12.320> we<00:03:12.739> can't<00:03:12.980> get<00:03:13.100> that

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
with so we'll see we can't get that

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.509 
with so we'll see we can't get that
together<00:03:14.170> okay<00:03:15.170> I'm<00:03:15.860> getting<00:03:16.040> these<00:03:16.220> pieces

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
together okay I'm getting these pieces

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.020 
together okay I'm getting these pieces
cut<00:03:16.880> out<00:03:17.060> now<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:19.190> we'll<00:03:19.400> Scout<00:03:19.610> mall<00:03:19.820> so

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
cut out now and we'll Scout mall so

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.750 
cut out now and we'll Scout mall so
here's<00:03:20.269> what<00:03:20.450> I<00:03:20.540> was<00:03:20.660> talking<00:03:20.900> about<00:03:21.760> with

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
here's what I was talking about with

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.660 
here's what I was talking about with
raising<00:03:23.450> the<00:03:23.600> knife<00:03:23.810> up<00:03:24.190> you<00:03:25.190> had<00:03:25.310> a<00:03:25.340> couple

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
raising the knife up you had a couple

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.160 
raising the knife up you had a couple
layers<00:03:26.000> of<00:03:26.329> leather<00:03:26.480> down<00:03:26.870> there<00:03:27.049> on<00:03:27.140> the

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
layers of leather down there on the

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.819 
layers of leather down there on the
bottom<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:29.450> give<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.870> blade<00:03:30.079> its<00:03:30.290> lift<00:03:30.620> that

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
bottom to give the blade its lift that

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.199 
bottom to give the blade its lift that
it<00:03:30.950> needs<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.430> wear<00:03:31.549> it<00:03:31.640> doesn't<00:03:32.000> winch

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
it needs to wear it doesn't winch

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.670 
it needs to wear it doesn't winch
against<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:35.090> top<00:03:35.329> cover<00:03:35.930> which<00:03:36.230> will<00:03:36.470> never

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
against the top cover which will never

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.949 
against the top cover which will never
we'd<00:03:36.890> be<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:37.130> face<00:03:37.340> of<00:03:37.370> this<00:03:37.700> but<00:03:38.090> got<00:03:38.900> the

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
we'd be the face of this but got the

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.750 
we'd be the face of this but got the
well<00:03:39.670> comes<00:03:40.670> off<00:03:40.970> that<00:03:41.709> goes<00:03:42.709> in<00:03:42.950> there<00:03:43.130> two

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
well comes off that goes in there two

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.199 
well comes off that goes in there two
pieces<00:03:44.329> then<00:03:45.320> this<00:03:46.190> isn't<00:03:46.579> the<00:03:46.640> actual<00:03:46.790> piece

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
pieces then this isn't the actual piece

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.300 
pieces then this isn't the actual piece
but<00:03:47.540> it's<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:47.900> back<00:03:48.079> piece<00:03:48.290> and<00:03:48.950> I<00:03:49.040> have<00:03:49.190> the

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
but it's the back piece and I have the

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.560 
but it's the back piece and I have the
cover<00:03:50.650> which<00:03:51.650> I<00:03:51.769> have<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:52.100> tooling<00:03:52.609> and<00:03:53.209> stuff

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
cover which I have the tooling and stuff

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.360 
cover which I have the tooling and stuff
on<00:03:53.780> it<00:03:53.810> and<00:03:54.230> then<00:03:54.680> I'm<00:03:54.829> probably<00:03:54.980> going<00:03:55.160> to<00:03:55.250> put

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
on it and then I'm probably going to put

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.770 
on it and then I'm probably going to put
a<00:03:55.400> couple<00:03:55.640> of<00:03:55.820> d-rings<00:03:56.299> down<00:03:57.049> here<00:03:57.350> somehow

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
a couple of d-rings down here somehow

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.740 
a couple of d-rings down here somehow
then<00:03:59.780> there's<00:04:00.470> some<00:04:00.860> one<00:04:01.700> more<00:04:02.000> layer<00:04:02.300> to<00:04:02.600> this

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
then there's some one more layer to this

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.990 
then there's some one more layer to this
beast<00:04:03.170> of<00:04:03.500> a<00:04:03.590> sheath<00:04:03.890> for<00:04:04.130> this<00:04:04.280> knife<00:04:04.550> it's

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
beast of a sheath for this knife it's

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.210 
beast of a sheath for this knife it's
going<00:04:05.180> to<00:04:05.240> be<00:04:05.360> a<00:04:05.390> long<00:04:05.630> piece<00:04:06.020> and<00:04:06.440> that's

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
going to be a long piece and that's

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.710 
going to be a long piece and that's
going<00:04:07.520> to<00:04:07.580> form<00:04:07.910> the<00:04:08.690> belt<00:04:09.080> loop<00:04:09.350> that<00:04:10.280> goes

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
going to form the belt loop that goes

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.610 
going to form the belt loop that goes
underneath<00:04:11.720> everything<00:04:13.360> they<00:04:14.360> said<00:04:15.050> I'll<00:04:15.290> set

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
underneath everything they said I'll set

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.930 
underneath everything they said I'll set
that<00:04:17.799> and<00:04:18.799> everything<00:04:19.040> to<00:04:19.310> be<00:04:19.370> pressed<00:04:19.640> down

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
that and everything to be pressed down

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.350 
that and everything to be pressed down
so<00:04:20.269> we'll<00:04:21.109> start<00:04:21.350> gluing<00:04:21.769> together<00:04:21.890> a<00:04:22.370> couple

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
so we'll start gluing together a couple

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
so we'll start gluing together a couple
