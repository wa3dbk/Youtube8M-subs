00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.910 

there<00:00:00.179> are<00:00:00.359> these<00:00:00.570> receptors<00:00:01.530> and<00:00:01.709> I<00:00:01.770> want<00:00:01.890> to

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
there are these receptors and I want to

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.560 
there are these receptors and I want to
get<00:00:02.010> too<00:00:02.159> techy<00:00:02.490> on<00:00:02.580> you<00:00:02.669> guys<00:00:02.760> but<00:00:02.820> this<00:00:03.330> is<00:00:03.449> go

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
get too techy on you guys but this is go

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.749 
get too techy on you guys but this is go
for<00:00:03.720> the<00:00:04.080> 12<00:00:04.290> days<00:00:04.440> so<00:00:05.040> they<00:00:05.220> have<00:00:05.339> it<00:00:05.430> seems<00:00:05.609> to

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
for the 12 days so they have it seems to

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.390 
for the 12 days so they have it seems to
OCT<00:00:06.240> two<00:00:06.450> receptors<00:00:07.020> right<00:00:07.319> is<00:00:07.859> the

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
OCT two receptors right is the

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.709 
OCT two receptors right is the
physiology<00:00:09.000> behind<00:00:09.090> this<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.540> more

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
physiology behind this is more

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.360 
physiology behind this is more
interesting<00:00:10.110> than<00:00:10.200> anything<00:00:10.469> else<00:00:10.590> so<00:00:11.160> these

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
interesting than anything else so these

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.209 
interesting than anything else so these
OCT<00:00:12.059> two<00:00:12.300> receptors<00:00:12.840> are<00:00:12.990> cut<00:00:13.139> organic<00:00:13.650> cation

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
OCT two receptors are cut organic cation

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.880 
OCT two receptors are cut organic cation
transporters<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.210> their<00:00:16.080> transporters<00:00:16.740> so

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
transporters and their transporters so

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.099 
transporters and their transporters so
you<00:00:16.949> think<00:00:17.220> about<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.580> it's<00:00:17.699> like<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.880> gate<00:00:18.270> it's

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
you think about it it's like a gate it's

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.439 
you think about it it's like a gate it's
a<00:00:19.260> gate<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.890> lets<00:00:20.100> things<00:00:20.400> in<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.029> out<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.180> a

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
a gate that lets things in and out of a

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.019 
a gate that lets things in and out of a
cell<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:22.890> if<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.220> gate<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.400> open<00:00:23.789> stuff

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
cell and so if the gate is open stuff

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.849 
cell and so if the gate is open stuff
goes<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.390> if<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.630> gate<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:24.810> blocked<00:00:25.140> then<00:00:25.470> sub

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
goes in if the gate is blocked then sub

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.380 
goes in if the gate is blocked then sub
can't<00:00:26.130> get<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.369> right<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.000> have<00:00:27.240> these

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
can't get in right and so you have these

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.820 
can't get in right and so you have these
OCT<00:00:28.260> two<00:00:28.470> transporters<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.369> your<00:00:30.090> kidneys<00:00:30.480> and

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
OCT two transporters in your kidneys and

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.680 
OCT two transporters in your kidneys and
you<00:00:31.830> have<00:00:32.009> them<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.430> brain<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.510> when

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
you have them in the brain and so when

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.910 
you have them in the brain and so when
we're<00:00:33.809> doing<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.110> urine<00:00:34.350> test<00:00:34.590> what<00:00:34.800> we're

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
we're doing the urine test what we're

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.110 
we're doing the urine test what we're
measuring<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.489> position<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
measuring is the position of the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.430 
measuring is the position of the
transporter<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.870> kidney<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
transporter in the kidney so the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.770 
transporter in the kidney so the
transport<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:37.950> closed<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> kidney<00:00:39.059> it's

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
transport is closed to the kidney it's

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.990 
transport is closed to the kidney it's
blocked<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.920> neurotransmitters<00:00:41.610> can't<00:00:41.850> get

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
blocked the neurotransmitters can't get

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000 
blocked the neurotransmitters can't get
in<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.660> p<00:00:42.870> them<00:00:42.989> out<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.590> see<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:43.950> all

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
in and so you p them out you see it all

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.830 
in and so you p them out you see it all
come<00:00:44.250> up<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.610> urine<00:00:44.940> if<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.629> gate<00:00:45.809> is

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
come up in the urine if the gate is

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.110 
come up in the urine if the gate is
opened<00:00:46.500> then<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.250> neurotransmitters<00:00:47.940> flow

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
opened then the neurotransmitters flow

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.240 
opened then the neurotransmitters flow
into<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.510> body<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.800> when<00:00:50.070> we're

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
into the body and so when we're

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.619 
into the body and so when we're
increasing<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> dosages<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.420> these

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
increasing the dosages of these

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:52.880 
increasing the dosages of these
supplements<00:00:52.050> what<00:00:52.320> we're<00:00:52.440> doing<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.739> we're

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
supplements what we're doing is we're

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.639 
supplements what we're doing is we're
monitoring<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.489> position<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.180> these<00:00:54.719> OCT<00:00:55.440> two

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
monitoring the position of these OCT two

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.920 
monitoring the position of these OCT two
transporters<00:00:56.340> now<00:00:57.530> every<00:00:58.530> mammal<00:00:59.930> every

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
transporters now every mammal every

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.590 
transporters now every mammal every
mammal<00:01:01.170> has<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.980> same<00:01:02.250> OCT<00:01:02.879> two<00:01:03.090> transporters

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
mammal has the same OCT two transporters

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.479 
mammal has the same OCT two transporters
in<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.960> kidneys<00:01:04.350> as<00:01:04.530> they<00:01:04.799> do<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.129> their<00:01:05.220> brain

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
in the kidneys as they do in their brain

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.670 
in the kidneys as they do in their brain
which<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:05.970> pretty<00:01:06.420> convenient<00:01:06.840> because<00:01:07.380> what

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
which is pretty convenient because what

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.990 
which is pretty convenient because what
we're<00:01:07.830> measuring<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> urine<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.790> what's

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
we're measuring in the urine is what's

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.730 
we're measuring in the urine is what's
happening<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.450> kidney<00:01:09.780> but<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.380> turns<00:01:10.560> out

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
happening in the kidney but it turns out

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.500 
happening in the kidney but it turns out
then<00:01:10.979> when<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.250> gates<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.790> kidney<00:01:12.150> open

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
then when the gates and the kidney open

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.539 
then when the gates and the kidney open
the<00:01:13.049> gates<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.500> brain<00:01:13.680> open<00:01:14.040> at<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.250> exact

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
the gates in the brain open at the exact

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.120 
the gates in the brain open at the exact
same<00:01:14.790> time<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.900> by<00:01:16.049> doing<00:01:16.110> these<00:01:16.439> urine<00:01:16.740> tests

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
same time so by doing these urine tests

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.590 
same time so by doing these urine tests
we're<00:01:17.310> doing<00:01:17.490> an<00:01:17.580> indirect<00:01:18.060> measure<00:01:18.270> of

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
we're doing an indirect measure of

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.090 
we're doing an indirect measure of
what's<00:01:18.750> happening<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.200> brain<00:01:19.290> right<00:01:19.860> and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
what's happening in the brain right and

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.249 
what's happening in the brain right and
so<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:21.180> worth<00:01:21.360> understanding<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.900> little<00:01:22.170> bit

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
so it's worth understanding a little bit

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.780 
so it's worth understanding a little bit
about<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.650> effect<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.070> all<00:01:23.189> these<00:01:23.340> drugs<00:01:23.640> so

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
about the effect of all these drugs so

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.179 
about the effect of all these drugs so
like<00:01:23.939> if<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.240> do<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> line<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.630> cocaine<00:01:25.229> or<00:01:25.770> you

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
like if you do a line of cocaine or you

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.490 
like if you do a line of cocaine or you
take<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.400> bunch<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.729> adderall<00:01:27.299> or<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:28.290> do<00:01:28.470> a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
take a bunch of adderall or you do a

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.090 
take a bunch of adderall or you do a
dose<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.950> prozac<00:01:29.189> Zoloft<00:01:29.939> wellbutrin<00:01:30.450> any<00:01:31.200> of

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
dose of prozac Zoloft wellbutrin any of

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.130 
dose of prozac Zoloft wellbutrin any of
these<00:01:32.220> kind<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.579> medications<00:01:33.180> right<00:01:33.600> could<00:01:34.049> be

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
these kind of medications right could be

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.859 
these kind of medications right could be
a<00:01:34.170> recreational<00:01:34.740> drug<00:01:34.920> could<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.720> know<00:01:36.840> a

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
a recreational drug could be you know a

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.499 
a recreational drug could be you know a
prescription<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> depressant<00:01:38.729> what

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
prescription like a depressant what

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.929 
prescription like a depressant what
those<00:01:39.630> drugs<00:01:39.900> do<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.350> they<00:01:40.500> close<00:01:40.920> these<00:01:41.280> OCT

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
those drugs do is they close these OCT

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.569 
those drugs do is they close these OCT
two<00:01:42.150> transporters<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.140> brain<00:01:43.460> so<00:01:44.460> when

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
two transporters in the brain so when

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.859 
two transporters in the brain so when
you<00:01:44.670> close<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.000> transporters<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.659> brain

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
you close the transporters in the brain

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.590 
you close the transporters in the brain
you<00:01:46.350> get<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> flood<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.009> dopamine<00:01:47.880> or<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.180> flood

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
you get a flood of dopamine or a flood

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.789 
you get a flood of dopamine or a flood
of<00:01:48.630> serotonin<00:01:49.320> outside<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.460> cell<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.799> you

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
of serotonin outside the cell and you

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.069 
of serotonin outside the cell and you
know<00:01:52.920> if<00:01:53.040> you've<00:01:53.189> ever<00:01:54.119> taken<00:01:54.600> any<00:01:54.810> kind<00:01:55.020> of

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
know if you've ever taken any kind of

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.660 
know if you've ever taken any kind of
stimulate<00:01:55.409> or<00:01:55.549> antidepressant<00:01:56.549> you're

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
stimulate or antidepressant you're

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.219 
stimulate or antidepressant you're
getting<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.000> rush<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.600> these<00:01:57.750> chemicals

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
getting a rush of these chemicals

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.990 
getting a rush of these chemicals
outside<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.829> cell<00:01:59.040> because<00:01:59.280> you're<00:01:59.430> blocking

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
outside the cell because you're blocking

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.380 
outside the cell because you're blocking
the<00:02:00.540> transporter<00:02:01.170> or<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.439> gate<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:02.210> so<00:02:03.210> what

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
the transporter or the gate and so what

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.910 
the transporter or the gate and so what
we're<00:02:03.540> measuring<00:02:03.780> are<00:02:04.049> these<00:02:04.170> actual<00:02:04.439> gates

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
we're measuring are these actual gates

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.260 
we're measuring are these actual gates
in<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.250> brain<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.460> we're<00:02:05.700> opening<00:02:06.119> and

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
in the brain and we're opening and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.089 
in the brain and we're opening and
closing<00:02:06.509> them<00:02:06.780> with<00:02:06.990> supplements<00:02:07.409> instead<00:02:08.069> of

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
closing them with supplements instead of

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.249 
closing them with supplements instead of
using<00:02:08.340> drugs<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.599> in<00:02:09.750> other<00:02:09.840> words<00:02:10.080> if<00:02:10.170> you

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
using drugs so in other words if you

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.640 
using drugs so in other words if you
take<00:02:10.440> speed<00:02:10.860> if<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.819> take<00:02:12.000> adderall<00:02:12.390> or

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
take speed if you take adderall or

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.809 
take speed if you take adderall or
if<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:13.829> take<00:02:13.980> something<00:02:14.220> well<00:02:14.430> but<00:02:14.640> like

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
if you take something well but like

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.460 
if you take something well but like
wellbutrin<00:02:15.239> you're<00:02:15.720> going<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.930> close<00:02:16.260> the

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
wellbutrin you're going to close the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.259 
wellbutrin you're going to close the
gate<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.040> brain<00:02:17.220> cell<00:02:17.519> and<00:02:17.790> you're<00:02:18.180> going

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
gate in the brain cell and you're going

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.899 
gate in the brain cell and you're going
to<00:02:18.329> get<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.510> flood<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:18.959> more<00:02:19.500> neurotransmitters

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:19.909 
to get a flood of more neurotransmitters

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.729 
to get a flood of more neurotransmitters
outside<00:02:20.909> the<00:02:21.060> cell<00:02:21.269> where<00:02:21.450> they're<00:02:21.599> active<00:02:22.019> if

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
outside the cell where they're active if

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.110 
outside the cell where they're active if
you<00:02:22.920> take<00:02:23.069> Prozac<00:02:23.579> you're<00:02:23.790> going<00:02:23.939> to<00:02:24.000> get<00:02:24.060> a

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
you take Prozac you're going to get a

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.990 
you take Prozac you're going to get a
flood<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:25.010> serotonin<00:02:26.010> outside<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.790> cell

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
flood of serotonin outside the cell

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.490 
flood of serotonin outside the cell
because<00:02:27.329> you<00:02:27.450> close<00:02:27.720> this<00:02:27.930> gate<00:02:28.200> with<00:02:28.379> the

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
because you close this gate with the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.770 
because you close this gate with the
drug<00:02:28.849> and<00:02:29.849> what<00:02:30.060> we're<00:02:30.209> doing<00:02:30.480> with<00:02:30.659> the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
drug and what we're doing with the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.809 
drug and what we're doing with the
supplements<00:02:31.319> is<00:02:31.409> opening<00:02:32.129> these<00:02:32.280> gates<00:02:32.579> and

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
supplements is opening these gates and

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.910 
supplements is opening these gates and
flooding<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.510> inside<00:02:34.019> and<00:02:34.319> outside<00:02:34.439> of<00:02:34.769> the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
flooding the inside and outside of the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.069 
flooding the inside and outside of the
cells<00:02:35.250> with<00:02:35.939> serotonin<00:02:36.239> or<00:02:36.540> dopamine<00:02:36.599> it's

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
cells with serotonin or dopamine it's

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.470 
cells with serotonin or dopamine it's
everywhere<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.920> it's<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.519> much<00:02:38.670> more<00:02:38.849> balanced

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
everywhere and it's a much more balanced

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.740 
everywhere and it's a much more balanced
kind<00:02:39.750> of<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:40.819> beneficial<00:02:41.819> response<00:02:42.299> than

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
kind of a beneficial response than

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.509 
kind of a beneficial response than
people<00:02:43.079> or<00:02:43.349> when<00:02:43.709> we<00:02:43.799> do<00:02:43.920> these<00:02:44.069> things<00:02:44.370> but

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
people or when we do these things but

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.099 
people or when we do these things but
basically<00:02:44.879> that's<00:02:45.060> really<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.540> physiology

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
basically that's really the physiology

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:47.930 
basically that's really the physiology
behind<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.889> manipulation<00:02:47.549> of<00:02:47.790> these

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
behind this is a manipulation of these

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.269 
behind this is a manipulation of these
gates
