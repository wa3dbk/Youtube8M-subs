00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
down into the water up to about ten feet

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.709 
down into the water up to about ten feet
it's<00:00:12.840> high<00:00:13.410> definition<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.280> shoots<00:00:14.519> at

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
it's high definition and it shoots at

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.260 
it's high definition and it shoots at
720p<00:00:15.719> at<00:00:16.470> 30<00:00:16.800> frames<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.279> second<00:00:17.699> that's<00:00:18.000> pretty

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
720p at 30 frames a second that's pretty

cool<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:19.080> lens<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.680> 30<00:00:20.189> X<00:00:20.580> optical<00:00:21.180> zoom

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
cool the lens is a 30 X optical zoom

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.769 
cool the lens is a 30 X optical zoom
that<00:00:22.080> means<00:00:22.289> it's<00:00:22.529> zooms<00:00:23.010> from<00:00:23.550> 35<00:00:24.269> millimeter

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
that means it's zooms from 35 millimeter

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.980 
that means it's zooms from 35 millimeter
equivalent<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.830> 43<00:00:26.550> millimeters<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.720> 12

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
equivalent is 43 millimeters to 12

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.019 
equivalent is 43 millimeters to 12
hundred<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.410> ninety<00:00:28.859> millimeters<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:29.849> real

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
hundred and ninety millimeters it's real

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.110 
hundred and ninety millimeters it's real
easy<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.390> do<00:00:30.630> long<00:00:30.929> with<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> video<00:00:31.890> chip<00:00:32.279> wide

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
easy to do long with a video chip wide

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.410 
easy to do long with a video chip wide
is<00:00:33.480> hard<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.989> do<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.800> 43<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.579> almost<00:00:35.910> normal

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
is hard to do so 43 is almost normal

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.540 
is hard to do so 43 is almost normal
normal<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.079> 50<00:00:37.469> millimeter<00:00:37.860> lens<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.399> is

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
normal it's a 50 millimeter lens this is

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.270 
normal it's a 50 millimeter lens this is
just<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.059> little<00:00:39.300> wider<00:00:39.540> than<00:00:39.719> normal<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.590> I

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
just a little wider than normal and I

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.459 
just a little wider than normal and I
really<00:00:41.700> enjoy<00:00:41.969> shooting<00:00:42.239> wide-angle<00:00:43.140> shots

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
really enjoy shooting wide-angle shots

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.190 
really enjoy shooting wide-angle shots
so<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.610> thirty<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.000> one<00:00:45.030> zoom<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.989> if<00:00:46.110> I

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
so it's a thirty to one zoom and if I

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.680 
so it's a thirty to one zoom and if I
put<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> point<00:00:46.860> five<00:00:47.129> millimeter<00:00:47.730> wide<00:00:48.390> angle

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
put a point five millimeter wide angle

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.139 
put a point five millimeter wide angle
adapter<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.260> front<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:49.980> 35<00:00:50.700> millimeter

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
adapter in front of it in 35 millimeter

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.420 
adapter in front of it in 35 millimeter
equivalent<00:00:51.440> forty<00:00:52.440> three<00:00:52.649> times<00:00:52.860> 0.5<00:00:53.370> equals

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
equivalent forty three times 0.5 equals

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.180 
equivalent forty three times 0.5 equals
twenty<00:00:54.180> one<00:00:54.329> point<00:00:54.629> five<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.170> that's<00:00:55.320> that's<00:00:55.980> a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
twenty one point five so that's that's a

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.400 
twenty one point five so that's that's a
good<00:00:56.219> wide-angle<00:00:56.910> lens<00:00:57.120> if<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.870> want<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.140> zoom

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
good wide-angle lens if you want a zoom

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.100 
good wide-angle lens if you want a zoom
the<00:00:59.070> wide<00:00:59.280> side<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.870> 21.5<00:01:00.870> times<00:01:01.710> 30<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:03.110> 645

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
the wide side is 21.5 times 30 is 645

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.740 
the wide side is 21.5 times 30 is 645
millimeters<00:01:04.830> that's<00:01:05.339> plenty<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.390> may<00:01:06.600> be<00:01:06.659> a

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
millimeters that's plenty so may be a

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.260 
millimeters that's plenty so may be a
good<00:01:06.990> idea<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.500> stick<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.799> wide<00:01:08.490> angle<00:01:08.640> lens<00:01:08.880> in

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
good idea to stick a wide angle lens in

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.300 
good idea to stick a wide angle lens in
front<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.630> camera<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.680> how<00:01:10.860> do<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.040> do

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
front of this camera but how do you do

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.190 
front of this camera but how do you do
it<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.850> front<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.240> camera<00:01:12.450> has<00:01:12.900> no

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
it the front of the camera has no

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.370 
it the front of the camera has no
threads<00:01:13.590> oh<00:01:14.060> yeah<00:01:15.090> typically<00:01:15.689> wide-angle

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
threads oh yeah typically wide-angle

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.320 
threads oh yeah typically wide-angle
adapters<00:01:16.920> don't<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:17.369> very<00:01:17.520> much<00:01:17.759> zoomed

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
adapters don't have very much zoomed

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.109 
adapters don't have very much zoomed
through<00:01:18.479> I've<00:01:19.229> got<00:01:19.530> one<00:01:19.799> that's<00:01:19.830> got<00:01:20.250> 12x

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
through I've got one that's got 12x

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.330 
through I've got one that's got 12x
zoomed<00:01:21.869> through<00:01:21.990> but<00:01:22.740> there's<00:01:22.979> nothing

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
zoomed through but there's nothing

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.289 
zoomed through but there's nothing
that's<00:01:23.759> gonna<00:01:23.909> go<00:01:24.380> 30x<00:01:25.380> zoom<00:01:25.619> through<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
that's gonna go 30x zoom through so the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.359 
that's gonna go 30x zoom through so the
zoom<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.630> limited<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.530> zoom<00:01:28.740> will<00:01:28.890> go<00:01:29.009> out<00:01:29.189> of

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
zoom is limited the zoom will go out of

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.520 
zoom is limited the zoom will go out of
focus<00:01:29.520> pretty<00:01:29.970> quick<00:01:30.299> but<00:01:30.930> that's<00:01:31.170> okay<00:01:31.409> with

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
focus pretty quick but that's okay with

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.469 
focus pretty quick but that's okay with
me<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:32.040> will<00:01:32.549> keep<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> wide<00:01:32.970> angle<00:01:33.150> on

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
me I just will keep the wide angle on

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.800 
me I just will keep the wide angle on
and<00:01:33.720> shoot<00:01:34.020> wide<00:01:34.320> all<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.560> time<00:01:35.060> so<00:01:36.060> my<00:01:36.299> plan

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
and shoot wide all the time so my plan

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.399 
and shoot wide all the time so my plan
is<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.579> put<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.790> wide-angle<00:01:39.119> adapter<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.200> I

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
is to put a wide-angle adapter on it I

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.130 
is to put a wide-angle adapter on it I
have<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.860> point<00:01:41.280> oh<00:01:41.430> five<00:01:41.729> white<00:01:42.720> wide

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
have a point oh five white wide

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.520 
have a point oh five white wide
millimeter<00:01:43.680> here's<00:01:44.460> what<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.640> looks<00:01:44.820> like

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
millimeter here's what that looks like

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.050 
millimeter here's what that looks like
better<00:01:47.990> but<00:01:48.990> how<00:01:49.110> do<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.260> attach<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:50.820> wide

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
better but how do I attach it the wide

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.930 
better but how do I attach it the wide
lens<00:01:51.360> has<00:01:51.920> threads<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.310> that's<00:01:53.490> no<00:01:53.670> good

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
lens has threads on it that's no good

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.320 
lens has threads on it that's no good
sanyo<00:01:54.840> camera<00:01:55.200> has<00:01:55.380> no<00:01:55.590> threads<00:01:56.030> so<00:01:57.030> I'm<00:01:57.120> just

sanyo camera has no threads so I'm just

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.070 
sanyo camera has no threads so I'm just
gonna<00:01:57.510> have<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.780> butt<00:01:58.230> it<00:01:58.350> up<00:01:58.440> against<00:02:00.080> the

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
gonna have to butt it up against the

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.140 
gonna have to butt it up against the
lens<00:02:01.350> somehow<00:02:01.980> and<00:02:02.340> attach<00:02:03.300> it<00:02:04.850> gets<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.970> lot

more<00:02:06.710> wideness<00:02:08.300> pretty<00:02:09.300> cool<00:02:09.540> that's<00:02:10.290> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
more wideness pretty cool that's the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.080 
more wideness pretty cool that's the
only<00:02:10.619> thing<00:02:10.800> about<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:11.190> camera<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.760> it's<00:02:11.970> not

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
only thing about this camera is it's not

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.310 
only thing about this camera is it's not
very<00:02:12.150> wide<00:02:13.310> we'll<00:02:14.310> see<00:02:14.520> what<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.730> can<00:02:14.910> do<00:02:15.290> well<00:02:16.290> I

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
very wide we'll see what I can do well I

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.080 
very wide we'll see what I can do well I
got<00:02:16.530> no<00:02:16.710> clue<00:02:16.980> if<00:02:17.100> this<00:02:17.250> will<00:02:17.430> work<00:02:17.460> but<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:17.880> got

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
got no clue if this will work but I got

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.020 
got no clue if this will work but I got
some<00:02:18.330> thick<00:02:18.740> cable<00:02:19.740> ties<00:02:20.510> there<00:02:22.310> 990<00:02:23.310> 1.4

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
some thick cable ties there 990 1.4

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.810 
some thick cable ties there 990 1.4
centimeters<00:02:25.340> wide

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
centimeters wide

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.530 
centimeters wide
I<00:02:26.850> think<00:02:27.270> 36<00:02:28.200> inches<00:02:29.510> so<00:02:31.580> who<00:02:32.580> knows<00:02:32.790> they<00:02:33.300> may

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
I think 36 inches so who knows they may

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.990 
I think 36 inches so who knows they may
work<00:02:33.840> I've<00:02:34.080> may<00:02:34.290> be<00:02:34.350> able<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.860> stick<00:02:35.820> this

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
work I've may be able to stick this

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.810 
work I've may be able to stick this
wide-angle<00:02:36.840> lens<00:02:37.220> on<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.430> front<00:02:38.459> of<00:02:38.700> this

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
wide-angle lens on the front of this

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:45.160 
wide-angle lens on the front of this
camera<00:02:39.620> with<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.650> thick<00:02:41.040> cable<00:02:41.700> tie<00:02:42.410> we'll<00:02:43.410> see

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
camera with a thick cable tie we'll see

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.100 
camera with a thick cable tie we'll see
well<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.200> thought<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.680> would<00:02:46.740> work<00:02:46.800> but<00:02:48.110> that

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
well I thought it would work but that

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.740 
well I thought it would work but that
little<00:02:49.850> thing<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:51.030> stick<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.450> cable

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
little thing that you stick the cable

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.500 
little thing that you stick the cable
tie<00:02:51.900> through<00:02:52.850> made<00:02:53.850> it<00:02:53.970> so<00:02:54.090> that<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.330> lens

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
tie through made it so that the lens

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.630 
tie through made it so that the lens
wasn't<00:02:54.900> flush<00:02:55.140> well<00:02:55.739> now<00:02:55.890> I'm<00:02:55.980> gonna<00:02:56.100> put<00:02:56.400> some

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
wasn't flush well now I'm gonna put some

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.270 
wasn't flush well now I'm gonna put some
gaffers<00:02:57.630> tape<00:02:57.660> on<00:02:58.080> it<00:02:58.290> maybe<00:02:58.650> that<00:02:58.920> will<00:02:59.070> work

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
gaffers tape on it maybe that will work

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.300 
gaffers tape on it maybe that will work
I'm<00:03:00.239> gonna<00:03:00.420> wiggle<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:01.080> a<00:03:01.110> little<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.950> see<00:03:02.190> if

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
I'm gonna wiggle it a little and see if

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.790 
I'm gonna wiggle it a little and see if
it<00:03:02.489> still<00:03:02.940> works

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
it still works

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.370 
it still works
and<00:03:04.800> wiggling<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:06.120> know<00:03:06.239> this<00:03:06.690> might<00:03:06.959> stay

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
and wiggling it you know this might stay

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.740 
and wiggling it you know this might stay
now<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.709> could<00:03:08.100> try<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.610> find<00:03:08.970> some<00:03:09.239> waterproof

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
now I could try to find some waterproof

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.900 
now I could try to find some waterproof
tape<00:03:10.350> this<00:03:10.650> is<00:03:10.830> just<00:03:11.810> kind<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.900> gaffers<00:03:13.440> tape

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
tape this is just kind of gaffers tape

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.229 
tape this is just kind of gaffers tape
but<00:03:14.910> at<00:03:15.390> least<00:03:15.989> it's<00:03:16.290> working<00:03:16.519> now<00:03:17.519> this<00:03:17.970> lens

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
but at least it's working now this lens

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.710 
but at least it's working now this lens
if<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.630> goes<00:03:18.810> underwater<00:03:19.140> will<00:03:19.680> be<00:03:19.860> probably

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
if it goes underwater will be probably
