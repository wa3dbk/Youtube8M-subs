00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.850 

where<00:01:15.210> does<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.509> think<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.869> think<00:01:16.140> rebounding

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
where does I think I think rebounding

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.760 
where does I think I think rebounding
I<00:01:17.240> think<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.360> twofold<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.900> like<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.350> mean

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
I think it's twofold I like I mean

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.380 
I think it's twofold I like I mean
telling<00:01:20.040> my<00:01:20.159> wife<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:20.759> your<00:01:20.880> size<00:01:21.119> doesn't

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
telling my wife is for your size doesn't

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.100 
telling my wife is for your size doesn't
matter<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.610> and<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.700> really<00:01:24.030> think<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.630> when

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
matter and and I really think that when

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.749 
matter and and I really think that when
it<00:01:25.350> comes<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.710> Reba<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.250> think<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.520> heart

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
it comes to Reba I just think it's heart

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.359 
it comes to Reba I just think it's heart
heart<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.750> effort<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.320> think<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.799> guy's<00:01:28.979> got<00:01:29.250> to

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
heart and effort I think a guy's got to

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.999 
heart and effort I think a guy's got to
just<00:01:29.520> go<00:01:29.610> out<00:01:29.759> there<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.030> play<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.780> um<00:01:31.259> that's

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
just go out there and play and um that's

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.149 
just go out there and play and um that's
the<00:01:32.250> biggest<00:01:32.490> rebound<00:01:33.090> deficit<00:01:33.540> we've<00:01:33.720> had

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
the biggest rebound deficit we've had

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.230 
the biggest rebound deficit we've had
