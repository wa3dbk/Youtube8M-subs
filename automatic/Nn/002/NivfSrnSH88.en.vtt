all have these weaknesses that make them
a<00:01:27.299> little<00:01:27.600> bit<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.960> guess<00:01:28.229> below<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.979> ak-74<00:01:29.790> use

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
a little bit I guess below the ak-74 use

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.289 
a little bit I guess below the ak-74 use
standard<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.320> playing<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.729> lot<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.119> people

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
standard of playing so a lot of people

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.359 
standard of playing so a lot of people
think<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.110> know<00:01:34.229> maybe<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.189> should

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
think that you know maybe you should

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.429 
think that you know maybe you should
buff<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.790> smg's<00:01:36.270> instead<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.380> know

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
buff the smg's instead of you know

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.289 
buff the smg's instead of you know
downgrading<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.280> aks-74u

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
downgrading the aks-74u

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.330 
downgrading the aks-74u
so<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.840> want<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.500> ask<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.740> guys<00:01:40.799> what<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.130> guys

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
so I want to ask you guys what you guys

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.520 
so I want to ask you guys what you guys
think<00:01:41.610> do<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.820> think<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.240> guns<00:01:42.930> like<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.320> Mac

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
think do you think the guns like the Mac

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.620 
think do you think the guns like the Mac
11<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.189> all<00:01:44.310> need<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.670> be<00:01:44.759> changed<00:01:45.149> or<00:01:45.390> do<00:01:45.540> you

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
11 and all need to be changed or do you

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.899 
11 and all need to be changed or do you
need<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.920> case<00:01:47.159> them<00:01:47.399> for<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.820> be

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
need the a case them for you to be

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.490 
need the a case them for you to be
changed<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.329> order<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.630> have<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.810> balanced<00:01:49.290> game

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
changed in order to have a balanced game

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.170 
changed in order to have a balanced game
so<00:01:49.770> it's<00:01:50.189> sort<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.610> about<00:01:50.700> personal

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
so it's sort of about personal

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.030 
so it's sort of about personal
preference<00:01:51.450> it's<00:01:51.840> sort<00:01:52.140> about<00:01:52.229> what<00:01:52.950> you

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
preference it's sort about what you

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.530 
preference it's sort about what you
think<00:01:53.310> about<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.640> assault<00:01:53.970> rifles<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.420> how

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
think about the assault rifles and how

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.630 
think about the assault rifles and how
powerful<00:01:54.869> they<00:01:55.170> are<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.189> want<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.399> know<00:01:56.460> my

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
powerful they are if you want to know my

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.550 
powerful they are if you want to know my
opinion<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:57.149> think<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.990> things<00:01:58.229> like<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
opinion I think that the things like the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.850 
opinion I think that the things like the
mag<00:01:58.770> 11<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.759> Scorpion<00:02:00.659> II<00:02:00.750> debuff<00:02:01.079> not

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
mag 11 and the Scorpion II debuff not

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.230 
mag 11 and the Scorpion II debuff not
the<00:02:02.040> other<00:02:02.159> way<00:02:02.310> around<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.850> because<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.149> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
the other way around just because of the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.569 
the other way around just because of the
fact<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.619> assault<00:02:05.189> rifles<00:02:05.490> are

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
fact that the the assault rifles are

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.600 
fact that the the assault rifles are
already<00:02:06.060> extremely<00:02:06.479> common<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.890> maybe<00:02:08.129> the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
already extremely common and maybe the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.760 
already extremely common and maybe the
SMGs<00:02:09.360> being<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.780> little<00:02:10.020> buffed<00:02:10.259> would<00:02:10.560> make

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
SMGs being a little buffed would make

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.190 
SMGs being a little buffed would make
them<00:02:10.979> all<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.160> little<00:02:11.610> bit<00:02:11.700> more

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
them all a little bit more

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.380 
them all a little bit more
so<00:02:12.500> I<00:02:12.890> don't<00:02:13.370> know<00:02:13.430> if<00:02:13.489> she's<00:02:13.760> my<00:02:13.879> thoughts<00:02:14.180> so

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
so I don't know if she's my thoughts so

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.880 
so I don't know if she's my thoughts so
anyway<00:02:14.810> let's<00:02:14.989> talk<00:02:15.110> a<00:02:15.200> little<00:02:15.230> bit<00:02:15.440> about<00:02:15.709> the

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
anyway let's talk a little bit about the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.100 
anyway let's talk a little bit about the
mac-11<00:02:16.160> so<00:02:16.849> like<00:02:17.300> I<00:02:17.390> just<00:02:17.480> mentioned<00:02:17.720> it's

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
mac-11 so like I just mentioned it's

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.780 
mac-11 so like I just mentioned it's
only<00:02:18.260> got<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.470> 20<00:02:18.860> round<00:02:18.890> clip<00:02:19.370> which<00:02:19.610> is<00:02:19.640> a

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
only got a 20 round clip which is a

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.550 
only got a 20 round clip which is a
little<00:02:20.120> bit<00:02:20.209> unfortunate<00:02:20.510> it's<00:02:21.170> got<00:02:21.349> a<00:02:21.379> decent

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
little bit unfortunate it's got a decent

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.770 
little bit unfortunate it's got a decent
rate<00:02:21.860> of<00:02:21.950> fire<00:02:22.190> I'm<00:02:22.580> not<00:02:22.849> the<00:02:23.030> best<00:02:23.330> damage<00:02:23.569> in

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
rate of fire I'm not the best damage in

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.930 
rate of fire I'm not the best damage in
the<00:02:23.840> world<00:02:23.989> I<00:02:24.140> think<00:02:24.200> it's<00:02:24.410> a<00:02:24.500> 30<00:02:24.800> 20<00:02:25.160> gun<00:02:25.340> so

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
the world I think it's a 30 20 gun so

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.910 
the world I think it's a 30 20 gun so
it's<00:02:26.060> gonna<00:02:26.150> be<00:02:26.330> 4<00:02:26.540> volts<00:02:26.930> up<00:02:27.080> close<00:02:27.349> or

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
it's gonna be 4 volts up close or

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.680 
it's gonna be 4 volts up close or
something<00:02:28.220> like<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.370> I<00:02:28.580> don't<00:02:28.730> know<00:02:28.910> but<00:02:29.599> it

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
something like that I don't know but it

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.589 
something like that I don't know but it
is<00:02:29.840> a<00:02:30.290> fairly<00:02:30.980> bad<00:02:31.160> gun<00:02:31.550> for<00:02:32.300> this<00:02:32.360> game<00:02:32.569> I

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
is a fairly bad gun for this game I

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.020 
is a fairly bad gun for this game I
threw<00:02:32.930> on<00:02:32.959> extended<00:02:33.769> mags<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.400> lot<00:02:34.730> of<00:02:34.819> time

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
threw on extended mags a lot of time

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.699 
threw on extended mags a lot of time
you'll<00:02:35.330> see<00:02:35.510> people<00:02:35.750> use<00:02:35.959> it<00:02:36.110> actually<00:02:36.260> not<00:02:36.680> a

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
you'll see people use it actually not a

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.410 
you'll see people use it actually not a
lot<00:02:36.890> of<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.069> time<00:02:37.220> you<00:02:37.370> never<00:02:37.489> see<00:02:37.730> guns<00:02:37.940> games

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
lot of the time you never see guns games

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.199 
lot of the time you never see guns games
games<00:02:39.170> with<00:02:39.440> this<00:02:39.620> gun<00:02:39.860> but<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.790> games<00:02:41.000> that<00:02:41.180> I

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
games with this gun but the games that I

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.670 
games with this gun but the games that I
have<00:02:41.360> seen<00:02:41.569> with<00:02:41.629> this<00:02:41.750> gun<00:02:41.959> I've<00:02:42.200> seen<00:02:42.470> some

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
have seen with this gun I've seen some

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.640 
have seen with this gun I've seen some
games<00:02:42.830> with<00:02:43.220> rapid<00:02:43.849> fire<00:02:43.879> and<00:02:44.330> rapid<00:02:45.230> fire<00:02:45.410> on

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
games with rapid fire and rapid fire on

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.250 
games with rapid fire and rapid fire on
the<00:02:45.769> mac-11<00:02:46.000> basically<00:02:47.000> is<00:02:47.239> I<00:02:47.480> mean<00:02:47.810> that<00:02:47.840> I

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
the mac-11 basically is I mean that I

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.720 
the mac-11 basically is I mean that I
want<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.680> compare<00:02:48.890> it<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.069> shotgun<00:02:49.370> because

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
want to compare it to a shotgun because

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.550 
want to compare it to a shotgun because
it's<00:02:49.880> like<00:02:49.970> you<00:02:50.060> kill<00:02:50.269> people<00:02:50.569> so<00:02:50.900> fast<00:02:51.290> with

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
it's like you kill people so fast with

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.500 
it's like you kill people so fast with
it<00:02:51.739> but<00:02:52.130> you<00:02:52.250> run<00:02:52.459> out<00:02:52.610> of<00:02:52.640> bullets<00:02:53.000> so<00:02:53.209> fast

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
it but you run out of bullets so fast

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.059 
it but you run out of bullets so fast
because<00:02:53.720> of<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:53.959> fact<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:54.319> all<00:02:54.799> you<00:02:54.980> have

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
because of the fact that all you have

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.740 
because of the fact that all you have
rapid<00:02:55.430> fire<00:02:55.610> are<00:02:55.760> on<00:02:55.880> and<00:02:56.060> you<00:02:56.090> only<00:02:56.239> have<00:02:56.390> 20

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
rapid fire are on and you only have 20

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.660 
rapid fire are on and you only have 20
bullets<00:02:57.049> in<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.230> clip<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:57.620> it<00:02:57.709> has<00:02:57.980> a<00:02:58.010> fairly

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
bullets in the clip and it has a fairly

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.030 
bullets in the clip and it has a fairly
high<00:02:58.720> rate<00:02:59.720> of<00:02:59.750> fire<00:02:59.959> to<00:03:00.170> begin<00:03:00.440> with<00:03:00.620> so<00:03:00.860> what

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
high rate of fire to begin with so what

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.920 
high rate of fire to begin with so what
ends<00:03:01.250> up<00:03:01.340> happening<00:03:01.400> usually<00:03:02.150> is<00:03:02.329> what'll<00:03:02.630> are

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
ends up happening usually is what'll are

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.050 
ends up happening usually is what'll are
what<00:03:03.410> happens<00:03:04.069> in<00:03:04.190> gunfights<00:03:04.610> is<00:03:04.849> you'll

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
what happens in gunfights is you'll

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.970 
what happens in gunfights is you'll
pretty<00:03:05.360> much<00:03:05.480> use<00:03:05.720> all<00:03:05.989> 20<00:03:06.319> bullets<00:03:06.470> on<00:03:06.769> just

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
pretty much use all 20 bullets on just
