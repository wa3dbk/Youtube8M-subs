 defined because yes clearly defined 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.520
 Why do they say dude that in this game? 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.050
 you can be totally personalized 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.210
 part of your character's class then 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.190

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.829
 What are you doing using the incredible thing? 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.239
 it's really good rpg because it will start over 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.219
 late you will not save the stamen anymore 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.110
 will get increasingly thinner even 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.930
 are three main attributes histamine 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.460
 the fury and amanda carolina only the three 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.690
 things can be used together but each 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.340
 one of the things is totally different 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.379
 when the other rage the part you 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.300
 you have the physical attacks that you 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.350
 beating more and accumulating 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.270
 and network 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.650
 so the harder you hit the stronger you go. 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.549
 stay but rather will give to others 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.049
 opponents 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.030
 this mine its agility and movement 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.650
 part of the battlefield with the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.460
 friends will be able to hit at once and everything 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.439
 more 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.240
 and tomorrow from the spells that you 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.650
 will control the power of spells 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.950
 maggi amount can be by time 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.320
 except and force these spells too dude 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.420
 The game is very cool to see the part of the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.500
 confrontation game play gameplay 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.970
 with the monsters 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.530
 You have to really have strategy. 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.150
 to face them using the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.070
 right magic at the right time sometimes for 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.759
 freeze the enemy and then said 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.950
 hitting the millenium and maybe even running away 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.899
 and the part of running away is also very 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.030
 important part of the destruction of the 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.310
 expensive scenery because look you can only 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.340
 be more days or until the attacks on 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.600
 walls of falling tree pillars 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.430
 on the stage and will disrupt their 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.140
 enemies in a cave that sometimes 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.790
 can pass and destroy the pillars of 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.619
 Break the path for your enemies 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.500
 fail over and to continue 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.380
 your way and like 17 and I will follow my 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.180
 way and forget the music very much 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.039
 important that the gameplay of expensive people 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.810
 then the part of the scenery really does 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.640
 difference in the part of the gameplay then 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.870
 You can destroy a tree and it's a guy. 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.580
 He failed to stop 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.989
 already his movements so it is one thing 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.150
 that we have always wanted to see in 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.159
 rpg and is increasingly present 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.470
 we come from an indy game really 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.810
 surprise, we'll talk, guys, they 'll see with 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.239
 that game there and as the wise man would say 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.709
 just live the man looks at the 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.180
 game tell you if you want to leave 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.099
 killing everyone that no guy 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.930
 frenzied rampage beating everyone 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.849
 the animals before him without wanting the 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.920
 Three of the game are going to have fun. 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.090
 Hell but if you want to stick to 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.920
 expensive story 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.060
 they say if you go deep 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.700
 can even discover treasures 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.980
 Lost looks only suddenly if complete 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.930
 omission talk links the mpc quiet 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.970
 he'll give you a tip that is right. 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.900
 region may have a treasure near such a 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.730
 thing 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.739
 I do not know, there's a tree that goes away. 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.209
 identify in the middle of the game then face 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.980
 if you can pay attention to these 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.799
 details that will give you several of 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.200
 lost treasures and rewards as well 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.180
 because sometimes depending on the 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.379
 The person is only beating the mons 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.940
 there is also the type of gameplay 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.440
 What do you want for that other game? 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.519
 differential of the game and the part of creation 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.260
 of houses 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.780
 strange you can create your own 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.970
 house from items you have collected 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.769
 during the dandy 11 from trophies 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.480
 What have you also had in that country? 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.120
 by a head of a monster that killed 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.880
 ball 'the shape of the house and from its 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.989
 house also creates some missions this already 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.060
 it interferes a bit more with the 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.040
 multiplayer where you can call the 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.410
 players to do missions along with 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.629
 you do not cooperate or participate in 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.120
 major events or even a part 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.200
 pvp against the other player 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.359
 Good, let's talk some more then 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.010
 about character customization 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:45.959
 his physical characteristic will be 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.180
 according to the actions you take if you 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.129
 use more fire magic thing like it 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.290
 for example a horn of 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.730
 character may become more nasty or 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.139
 addiction use more cure do not know 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.049
 exactly this kind of thing is going 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:00.389
 set but depending on you can you wings 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.040
 and whatever agreement you're using 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.480
 inside the game if character will stay 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.699
 with a more pleasant appearance and 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.859
 pleasant or according to the style of 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:09.480
 The gameplay you used so dear is a 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.669
 very free game they tell you 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.639
 will have freedom of skyrim will have the 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:16.650
 from devil combats the part of the 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:20.370
 the training day scenery apart from the 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.510
 One and expensive devil scenario is the kind of 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.150
 thing that we like in every 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.320

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.510

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.030
 play this game that was made with 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.770
 Customer at home, then, look, he's talking. 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.390
 the maximum capacity is for indy 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.310
 a good example of what we can do 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.830
 do inside indy game 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.190
 so dude is really really anxious and 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.990
 You are also a copy of the game already 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.290
