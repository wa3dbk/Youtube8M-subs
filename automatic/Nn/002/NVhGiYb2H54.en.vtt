basically<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.880> think<00:00:15.120> we're<00:00:15.599> ready<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.839> start

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
basically I think we're ready to start

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.990 
basically I think we're ready to start
jacking<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.590> thing<00:00:16.830> up<00:00:17.010> hooking<00:00:17.580> up<00:00:17.699> some<00:00:17.730> of

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
jacking this thing up hooking up some of

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.720 
jacking this thing up hooking up some of
our<00:00:18.119> peripherals<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.070> bolt<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.189> in<00:00:20.340> why<00:00:20.670> don't

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
our peripherals and bolt it in why don't

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.490 
our peripherals and bolt it in why don't
you<00:00:20.820> go<00:00:20.970> ahead<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.210> pump<00:00:21.510> over<00:00:21.660> there<00:00:21.900> now<00:00:22.410> I'm

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
you go ahead and pump over there now I'm

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.230 
you go ahead and pump over there now I'm
going<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.680> show<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.830> on<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.070> crossmember<00:00:23.670> now

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
going to show you on the crossmember now

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.820 
going to show you on the crossmember now
we've<00:00:24.510> moved<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.869> back<00:00:25.050> out<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.410> way<00:00:25.560> that

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
we've moved it back out of the way that

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.009 
we've moved it back out of the way that
we<00:00:25.920> can<00:00:26.099> push<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.699> in<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.240> it's<00:00:27.630> longer<00:00:27.900> than

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
we can push this in and it's longer than

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.540 
we can push this in and it's longer than
the<00:00:28.230> old<00:00:28.380> ones<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.859> need<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.099> really<00:00:29.340> kind

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
the old ones so you need to really kind

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.310 
the old ones so you need to really kind
of<00:00:29.609> get<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.880> out<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.119> your<00:00:30.179> way<00:00:30.359> these<00:00:31.080> are<00:00:31.260> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
of get it out of your way these are the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.690 
of get it out of your way these are the
holes<00:00:31.529> we<00:00:31.710> were<00:00:31.830> talking<00:00:32.160> about<00:00:32.250> for<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
holes we were talking about for the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.220 
holes we were talking about for the
crossmember<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.719> gives<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.020> lot<00:00:34.200> of

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
crossmember that gives you a lot of

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.470 
crossmember that gives you a lot of
locations<00:00:34.670> factories<00:00:35.670> do<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.210> they<00:00:36.329> can

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
locations factories do that so they can

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.389 
locations factories do that so they can
do<00:00:36.600> different<00:00:36.960> transmissions<00:00:37.620> makes<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.250> easy

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
do different transmissions makes it easy

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.069 
do different transmissions makes it easy
for<00:00:38.520> us<00:00:38.820> because<00:00:39.210> we<00:00:39.420> can<00:00:39.570> just<00:00:39.750> go<00:00:39.870> ahead<00:00:39.899> and

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
for us because we can just go ahead and

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.260 
for us because we can just go ahead and
install<00:00:40.320> another<00:00:40.950> transmission<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.850> as<00:00:42.059> well

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
install another transmission in as well

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.110 
install another transmission in as well
now<00:00:43.110> right<00:00:43.290> here<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.550> your<00:00:44.670> speedo<00:00:45.090> cable

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
now right here this is your speedo cable

now right here this is your speedo cable
it<00:00:45.870> looks<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.320> same<00:00:46.500> as<00:00:46.680> they<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:46.980> for<00:00:47.250> many

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
it looks the same as they have for many

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.760 
it looks the same as they have for many
years<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:48.239> plugs<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> same<00:00:48.930> as<00:00:49.379> before

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
years that plugs in the same as before

we're going to go ahead and put our
dipstick<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:20.130> we're<00:01:20.280> also<00:01:20.430> going<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.790> put

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
dipstick in and we're also going to put

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.730 
dipstick in and we're also going to put
our<00:01:21.270> let's<00:01:22.049> see<00:01:22.140> we<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.290> one<00:01:22.409> more<00:01:22.590> what's

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
our let's see we have one more what's

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.260 
our let's see we have one more what's
the<00:01:22.770> other<00:01:22.890> one<00:01:23.040> TV<00:01:23.310> cable<00:01:23.670> got<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.880> put<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.090> TV

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
the other one TV cable got to put the TV

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.630 
the other one TV cable got to put the TV
cable<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.380> put<00:01:25.560> those<00:01:25.710> three<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.159> that

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
cable in so we put those three in that

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.920 
cable in so we put those three in that
way<00:01:26.850> they're<00:01:27.090> already<00:01:27.390> on<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
way they're already on to the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.990 
way they're already on to the
transmission<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.799> when<00:01:28.920> we<00:01:29.009> jack<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.490> up<00:01:29.579> it's

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
transmission so when we jack it up it's

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.210 
transmission so when we jack it up it's
going<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.150> be<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> lot<00:01:30.540> easier<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.079> locate<00:01:31.290> ahead

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
going to be a lot easier to locate ahead

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.830 
going to be a lot easier to locate ahead
of<00:01:32.340> time<00:01:32.490> yeah<00:01:32.759> we<00:01:32.880> can<00:01:33.000> run<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> final<00:01:33.570> bolts

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
of time yeah we can run the final bolts

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.420 
of time yeah we can run the final bolts
down<00:01:33.990> nice<00:01:34.380> thing<00:01:34.560> about<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.829> monster<00:01:35.220> kit

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
down nice thing about the monster kit

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.219 
down nice thing about the monster kit
like<00:01:35.820> brian<00:01:36.090> says<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.509> comes<00:01:36.780> with<00:01:36.990> everything

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
like brian says it comes with everything

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.620 
like brian says it comes with everything
but<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:37.979> top<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.520> they<00:01:38.939> can<00:01:39.090> tailor<00:01:39.540> it

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
but on top of that they can tailor it

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.789 
but on top of that they can tailor it
they<00:01:39.720> build<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.140> basically<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.710> your

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
they build it basically to your

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.100 
they build it basically to your
specifications<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:42.240> depending<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:42.869> what

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
specifications so depending on what

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.719 
specifications so depending on what
vehicle<00:01:43.320> you're<00:01:43.710> running<00:01:43.979> what<00:01:44.130> weight<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.579> is

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
vehicle you're running what weight it is

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.749 
vehicle you're running what weight it is
what<00:01:45.240> gear<00:01:45.540> end<00:01:45.720> ratio<00:01:45.930> what<00:01:46.740> tire<00:01:47.040> diameter

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
what gear end ratio what tire diameter

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.179 
what gear end ratio what tire diameter
or<00:01:48.210> what<00:01:48.420> cam<00:01:48.930> spec<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.530> big<00:01:49.770> one<00:01:50.009> for

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
picking out at work order they've got a

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.420 
picking out at work order they've got a
software<00:01:52.290> program<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.829> give<00:01:53.040> them<00:01:53.159> all<00:01:53.280> your

software program you give them all your
specs<00:01:53.820> they'll<00:01:54.299> spit<00:01:54.509> out<00:01:54.600> exactly<00:01:55.049> what<00:01:55.200> you

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
specs they'll spit out exactly what you

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.959 
specs they'll spit out exactly what you
need<00:01:55.320> for<00:01:55.470> converter<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.520> can<00:01:56.549> talk<00:01:56.850> them

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
need for converter you can talk them

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.149 
need for converter you can talk them
about<00:01:57.000> shifts<00:01:57.600> shift<00:01:58.079> quality<00:01:58.380> how<00:01:58.740> hard<00:01:59.040> it

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
about shifts shift quality how hard it

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.639 
about shifts shift quality how hard it
shifts<00:01:59.579> or<00:01:59.820> maybe<00:02:00.180> he'll<00:02:00.329> relax<00:02:00.840> for<00:02:01.170> cruising

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
shifts or maybe he'll relax for cruising

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.380 
shifts or maybe he'll relax for cruising
so<00:02:02.040> they<00:02:02.310> can<00:02:02.430> put<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> kit<00:02:02.850> especially

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
so they can put a kit especially

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.359 
so they can put a kit especially
