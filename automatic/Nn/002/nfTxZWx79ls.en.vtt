00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.869 
marks at all on it very little used I
think<00:00:35.300> and<00:00:38.210> it's<00:00:39.210> got<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> good<00:00:39.570> screen<00:00:40.879> very

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
think and it's got a good screen very

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.690 
think and it's got a good screen very
good<00:00:43.789> keyboard<00:00:45.469> and<00:00:46.469> very<00:00:46.920> very<00:00:47.160> fast<00:00:47.430> of

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
good keyboard and very very fast of

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.700 
good keyboard and very very fast of
course<00:00:47.730> with<00:00:48.420> my<00:00:49.730> improved<00:00:51.710> hardware

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
course with my improved hardware

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.470 
course with my improved hardware
software<00:00:53.510> combination<00:00:55.340> for<00:00:56.340> example<00:00:56.789> let's

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
software combination for example let's

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.630 
software combination for example let's
start<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.230> up<00:00:58.940> and<00:01:00.079> here<00:01:01.079> we<00:01:01.109> go

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
start it up and here we go

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.450 
start it up and here we go
I'm<00:01:03.480> not<00:01:03.660> going<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.870> time<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.140> for<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.339> can

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
I'm not going to time it for you you can

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.080 
I'm not going to time it for you you can
do<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.729> yourself<00:01:06.740> with<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.860> video<00:01:08.070> but<00:01:08.970> you

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
do that yourself with the video but you

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.060 
do that yourself with the video but you
can<00:01:09.119> see<00:01:10.040> that<00:01:11.600> it'll<00:01:12.600> take<00:01:12.840> about<00:01:12.960> 30<00:01:13.560> seconds

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
can see that it'll take about 30 seconds

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.020 
can see that it'll take about 30 seconds
or<00:01:14.250> less

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:26.330 

and<00:01:22.130> that's<00:01:23.130> because<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:24.440> have<00:01:25.440> eliminated<00:01:25.830> all

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
and that's because I have eliminated all

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.520 
and that's because I have eliminated all
of<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.610> unnecessary<00:01:28.729> startup<00:01:29.729> options<00:01:30.540> and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
of the unnecessary startup options and

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.920 
of the unnecessary startup options and
gets<00:01:31.800> right<00:01:31.950> down<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.160> business

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
gets right down to business

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.920 
gets right down to business
there<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.080> is<00:01:35.390> musics<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:38.930> hourglass

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
there it is musics on and the hourglass

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.740 
there it is musics on and the hourglass
will<00:01:40.200> disappear<00:01:41.000> less<00:01:42.000> than<00:01:42.150> 30<00:01:42.330> seconds<00:01:42.690> you

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
will disappear less than 30 seconds you

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.010 
will disappear less than 30 seconds you
can<00:01:42.900> time<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.700> it's<00:01:44.700> nice<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.570> bright<00:01:45.750> there

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
can time that it's nice and bright there

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.050 
can time that it's nice and bright there
are<00:01:46.080> no<00:01:47.030> ghosting<00:01:48.030> spots<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.660> the<00:01:48.810> screen<00:01:48.990> and

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
are no ghosting spots on the screen and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.910 
are no ghosting spots on the screen and
as<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.270> said<00:01:51.649> very<00:01:52.649> very<00:01:52.890> quick<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:54.060> example

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
as I said very very quick for example

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:02.320 
as I said very very quick for example
we'll<00:01:55.920> go<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:58.340> word<00:01:59.340> of<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:01.380> word<00:02:01.590> office<00:02:01.979> and

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
we'll go to word of a word office and

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.380 
we'll go to word of a word office and
just<00:02:03.330> see<00:02:03.539> how<00:02:03.570> quickly<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.200> pops<00:02:04.470> up

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
just see how quickly this pops up

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:13.060 
just see how quickly this pops up

actually<00:03:03.170> now<00:03:04.170> I<00:03:04.230> have<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:05.420> shutdown

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
actually now I have a shutdown

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.710 
actually now I have a shutdown
I've<00:03:06.959> also<00:03:07.590> opted<00:03:07.829> to<00:03:07.890> like<00:03:08.040> shut<00:03:08.280> down<00:03:08.720> taking

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
I've also opted to like shut down taking

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.620 
I've also opted to like shut down taking
about<00:03:09.840> 3<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.290> 4<00:03:10.500> seconds<00:03:11.209> it's<00:03:12.209> going<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.540> take

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
about 3 to 4 seconds it's going to take

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.400 
about 3 to 4 seconds it's going to take
a<00:03:12.660> little<00:03:12.780> bit<00:03:12.959> longer<00:03:13.170> because<00:03:13.440> I

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
a little bit longer because I

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.390 
a little bit longer because I
and<00:03:14.880> configured<00:03:15.880> it<00:03:16.000> so<00:03:16.150> that<00:03:16.330> crap<00:03:16.570> cleaner

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
and configured it so that crap cleaner

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.880 
and configured it so that crap cleaner
runs<00:03:18.400> first<00:03:19.260> eliminating<00:03:20.260> all<00:03:20.410> of<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.770> year

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
runs first eliminating all of the year

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.780 
runs first eliminating all of the year
your<00:03:21.960> crap<00:03:22.960> basically<00:03:23.710> that<00:03:24.520> you've

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
your crap basically that you've
