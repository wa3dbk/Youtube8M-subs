00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
cotton and 12 weight and I'd like to

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.900 
cotton and 12 weight and I'd like to
mention<00:00:07.529> at<00:00:07.799> this<00:00:07.919> time<00:00:08.189> that<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.550> bundle

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
mention at this time that the bundle

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.370 
mention at this time that the bundle
cotton<00:00:09.389> comes<00:00:10.429> in<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.759> variation<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.780> color<00:00:13.049> and

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
cotton comes in a variation of color and

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.799 
cotton comes in a variation of color and
the<00:00:13.559> color<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.160> blended<00:00:14.790> from<00:00:14.969> every<00:00:15.240> two<00:00:15.480> to

the color is blended from every two to

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.330 
the color is blended from every two to
five<00:00:15.990> inches<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:16.650> get<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.890> more<00:00:17.130> dramatic

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
five inches so you get a more dramatic

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.970 
five inches so you get a more dramatic
color<00:00:18.050> faster<00:00:19.050> when<00:00:19.260> you're<00:00:19.380> stitching<00:00:19.650> and
