me Mae fry it with this you know super
high<00:00:33.210> gain<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:33.600> I'll<00:00:33.719> try<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.380> then<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
high gain so I'll try that and then the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.850 
high gain so I'll try that and then the
second<00:00:35.460> I'll<00:00:35.550> do<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.880> sound<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.540> an<00:00:36.690> EDL<00:00:38.629> which

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
second I'll do the sound on an EDL which

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.139 
second I'll do the sound on an EDL which
should<00:00:40.860> give<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.160> lot<00:00:41.399> better<00:00:41.579> sound<00:00:42.000> and

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
should give you a lot better sound and

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.090 
should give you a lot better sound and
I'll<00:00:42.270> see<00:00:42.390> if<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.540> could<00:00:42.719> blend<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.110> two<00:00:43.379> on

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
I'll see if I could blend the two on

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.060 
I'll see if I could blend the two on
YouTube<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.090> hopefully<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.629> works<00:00:45.980> here's<00:00:46.980> a
