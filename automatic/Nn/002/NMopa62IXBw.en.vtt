00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.350
 O 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.610
 the man said it's you and guys 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.980
 journey may once again this morning 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:23.960
 starting day left to work now and 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.550
 will answer two questions first 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.410
 about goalkeeper height 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.460
 There are a lot of people that ask me in 11 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.710
 13 years old 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.780
 there is until the moment 55 of the accounting 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:38.899
 neoton one meter and 70 pumps and goleirÃ£o a 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.090
 modern football it really does today 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.039
 importance to the height of the 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.660
 goalkeeper 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:47.390
 In Brazil they are catching goalkeepers. 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.460
 so much more than 90 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.829
 As I was careful I did not like the 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.350
 modern football the football he has 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.300
 money but has no talent 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.550
 football, but not football 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.199
 had money even if the first thing 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.600
 why I do not like football has become 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:07.100
 the market the company is actually and 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.970
 I think it's all wrong that the 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.100
 people become god players and the 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.250
 players think they are gods 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.840
 so our national team not 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.640
 It is this Brazilian team that we 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.210
 learned to know that the world has learned 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.210
 to meet 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.770
 coming back to the subject about height see 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.530
 only 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.270
 If you're used to it, you're 12 years old. 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.740
 and is in the growth phase of 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.509
 21 years 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.429
 if you are in the growth phase but 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.409
 is accustomed to eating bread and butter 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.929
 You're not going to grow much, are not you? 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.979
 I develop a lot has to 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.659
 eating well and sleeping well is during the 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.110
 sleep that the blow produces reproduce 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:54.080
 produces growth hormones 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:59.030
 and fao food is very important 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:01.820
 fruit vegetables and in milk is very good 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.560
 prove that its decision extends to 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.580
 help in the development of your 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.740
 growth 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.820
 this is the first if you have not arrived 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.440
 more than 90 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.590
 How I told you if you really are a 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.070
 football that will play in the neighborhood team 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.510
 for example a fourth division team 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.920
 because it does not matter at first to me 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.450
 At least it does not matter at first 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.300
 division or not, what matters is you 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.770
 live your life and you be happy 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.570
 You can play football in any 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:32.390
 football does not exist just the 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:34.640
 about the questions of 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.680
 height taboa otherwise tap 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.690
 see it's just hard for me to answer this 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.640
 kind of question why I'm not 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.320
 doctor 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.790
 Hey, I do not know your tree. 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.830
 family 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.959
 I for example have a meter and eighty 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.080
 Dad is shorter than me. He's got a meter. 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.370
 and seventy-two more or less but not 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.200
 It means you're going to be taller. 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.320
 that your father you can also pull the 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.940
 family your mother and your mother for the family 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.190
 low you will be low too 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.230
 This does not mean anything then. 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.090
 it is very difficult to answer about this 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.540
 type of question about the height of 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.540
 goalkeeper 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.750
 Another question they asked me was 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.170
 what are my techniques from my 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.000
 strategies to get the 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.130
 to win a penalty 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.850
 I always say that football it does not 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.490
 begins when the judge whistles football 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.420
 start the game begins before the game 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.000
 begin 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.590
 what does this have to do? 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.480
 research and if the first thing to do 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.550
 a search 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.720
 the best and the worst players that 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.310
 have that team you're going to face 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.090
 to know who the foul beaters are 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.850
 there you will have a 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.910
 idea for example the penalty kicker 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.890
 you find out what they are 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.290
 What side does he hit the most? 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.120
 often the supposed name of the Moscow 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.870
 Debate of the 8 goodies will hit your 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.290
 right 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.480
 then you will take an average and in-game 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.830
 you can can suffer the goal you can 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.200
 choose the side he hits with more 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.040
 frequency or, in turn, your 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.040
 left side 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.129
 you 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.019
 You can skip that and hopefully 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:21.250
 touch the ball for example but this is a 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.780
 it's a game of chance and you do not know if 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:31.020
 You are going to have anybody just right 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:33.729
 really average the other thing during 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.920
 game you do not know player player 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:39.140
 you have little information about him 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.000
 to observe where you are looking at 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.860
 players who look where they are going to hit the 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.990
 others who look while there is time 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.580
 to look and say that it is not exactly 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.590
 that place he's going to hit is not 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.170
 always also sometimes make it 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:56.030
 purpose to be so deceived 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:59.450
 now see only if the player is right-handed 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:04.250
 position to your right and the 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:07.220
 right in the case of the ball is very likely 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.350
 that he hit in the middle of the strong goal or 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:13.610
 put on your left 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:15.560
 ie the opposite side player right to 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.260
 ball to the left 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.510
 happens the same as the other in the 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.580
 opposite the player on the left 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:26.660
 or in between I will see on your right 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.220
 right includes players 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:32.990
 funky that will make a difference 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:34.310
 I'm talking about in odds never 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.870
 say that is it 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.340
 and if you like it, everybody just got it 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:43.150
 and everybody loses a penalty 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.699
 it's just an average thing else I notice 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:49.090
 when you can observe it is obviously 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:51.880
 tired for reflexes or something of the kind 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.580
 the hip position of the batsman 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.229
 at the time of the penalty we notice when 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.910
 he is not even a body when it's time to hit 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:59.440
 and 10 let's assume body leader to 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.870
 left 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:05.500
 usually she sees in his on his left 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:08.729
 also a right-handed player 80 bit body 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.830
 and is it twisting a little if the hip 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:15.220
 and see the body to the left or right 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.110
 to the left behind both is very 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.729
 likely that the ball came in his in his 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.400
 writing is the same thing happens with a 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:25.410
 left handed player 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.410
 are small details that can help 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:33.310
 I just need to train on that side and if I do not 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:35.410
 train the team because no one 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.090
 launch target what kind of ball 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.430
 You have to train a cross without 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.620
 to train always broken ball has to 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.120
 always stay all training everything is 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.370
 practice in fact everything in life is that 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.080
 you do it is practice whether at work or 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.800
 in football, or the school is in 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.880
 anywhere 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.090
 Practice doubt 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.800
 Do you know how many two plus two are 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.540
 you practice every day every day 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.590
 everyday you will never forget 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.800
 that 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:03.110
 riding a bike today has to be 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.790
 punished such dwelt the guitar to a 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.620
 musical instrument or to always have 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.810
 indicating that it will only get better for you 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:12.070
 it's going to get worse 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:14.450
 all practice makes perfect then 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:17.180
 this went out with football in all 

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.560
 points especially in the penalty shootout 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.590
 missing government 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.670
 ball is one against a whole 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.880
 training 

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:27.770
 So these were the tips today and 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.840
 Any questions, just ask
