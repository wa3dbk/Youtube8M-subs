hi<00:00:05.100> it's<00:00:05.279> mr.<00:00:05.520> Andersen<00:00:05.910> and<00:00:06.029> in<00:00:06.089> this<00:00:06.150> podcast

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
hi it's mr. Andersen and in this podcast

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.390 
hi it's mr. Andersen and in this podcast
I'm<00:00:06.839> going<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:06.990> talk<00:00:07.080> about<00:00:07.319> nucleic<00:00:07.799> acids

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
I'm going to talk about nucleic acids

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.919 
I'm going to talk about nucleic acids
when<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:08.670> talk<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:09.090> students<00:00:09.450> about<00:00:09.570> nucleic

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
when I talk to students about nucleic

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.810 
when I talk to students about nucleic
acids<00:00:10.440> they're<00:00:10.830> confused<00:00:11.309> they<00:00:11.550> don't<00:00:11.730> know

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
acids they're confused they don't know

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.730 
acids they're confused they don't know
what<00:00:12.000> they<00:00:12.120> do<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.809> they<00:00:13.080> don't<00:00:13.200> usually<00:00:13.440> know

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
what they do and they don't usually know

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.709 
what they do and they don't usually know
what<00:00:13.860> they're<00:00:14.009> made<00:00:14.219> up<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.700> they<00:00:15.240> do<00:00:15.299> know

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
what they're made up of they do know

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.439 
what they're made up of they do know
that<00:00:16.049> their<00:00:16.230> DNA<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.920> RNA<00:00:17.279> but<00:00:18.029> let's<00:00:18.210> start

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
that their DNA and RNA but let's start

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.260 
that their DNA and RNA but let's start
with<00:00:18.539> what<00:00:18.869> they<00:00:19.050> do<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.800> so<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.400> biggest<00:00:20.699> job

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
with what they do and so the biggest job

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.960 
with what they do and so the biggest job
the<00:00:21.570> DNA<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.109> RNA<00:00:22.230> have<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:23.010> making<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
the DNA and RNA have is making the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.420 
the DNA and RNA have is making the
proteins<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.840> proteins<00:00:24.869> inside<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.189> cell

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
proteins the proteins inside the cell

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.550 
proteins the proteins inside the cell
and<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:26.730> when<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.300> look<00:00:27.599> at<00:00:27.779> me<00:00:28.050> you're

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
and so when you look at me you're

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.250 
and so when you look at me you're
looking<00:00:28.980> at<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.550> proteins<00:00:30.179> but<00:00:30.869> where<00:00:31.140> are

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
looking at the proteins but where are

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.080 
looking at the proteins but where are
the<00:00:31.380> directions<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.250> make<00:00:32.399> those<00:00:32.640> proteins

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
the directions to make those proteins

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.150 
the directions to make those proteins
those<00:00:33.390> are<00:00:33.540> found<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.930> DNA<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.710> how<00:00:35.100> do

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
those are found in the DNA and how do

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.740 
those are found in the DNA and how do
they<00:00:35.370> get<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.969> proteins<00:00:36.360> well<00:00:36.600> they're

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
they get to the proteins well they're

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.020 
they get to the proteins well they're
shuttled<00:00:37.110> out<00:00:37.200> by<00:00:37.410> RNA<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.129> RNA<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.579> more<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.940> a

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
shuttled out by RNA and RNA is more of a

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.450 
shuttled out by RNA and RNA is more of a
worker<00:00:39.360> that's<00:00:39.989> making<00:00:40.710> these<00:00:40.920> proteins

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
worker that's making these proteins

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.910 
worker that's making these proteins
inside<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.030> ribosome<00:00:42.469> so<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.590> first<00:00:43.800> job

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
inside the ribosome so the first job

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.490 
inside the ribosome so the first job
they<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.670> making<00:00:45.000> proteins<00:00:45.629> what's<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
they have is making proteins what's the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.020 
they have is making proteins what's the
second<00:00:46.920> thing<00:00:46.950> they<00:00:47.190> do<00:00:47.250> well<00:00:47.640> they<00:00:47.760> make<00:00:47.910> up

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
second thing they do well they make up

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.090 
second thing they do well they make up
our<00:00:48.149> genes<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.020> that's<00:00:49.230> what<00:00:49.410> we<00:00:49.500> pass<00:00:49.829> on

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
our genes and so that's what we pass on

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.250 
our genes and so that's what we pass on
to<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.399> next<00:00:50.520> generation<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.079> my

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
to the next generation and so this is my

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.279 
to the next generation and so this is my
son<00:00:52.559> he<00:00:53.190> contains<00:00:53.699> half<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> DNA<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.230> I

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
son he contains half of the DNA that I

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.950 
son he contains half of the DNA that I
do<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.890> gave<00:00:56.190> him<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.460> random<00:00:57.030> half<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.600> my<00:00:57.750> DNA

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
do so I gave him a random half of my DNA

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.139 
do so I gave him a random half of my DNA
and<00:00:58.410> my<00:00:58.739> wife<00:00:59.039> did<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.399> same<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.000> he's<00:01:00.120> a

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
and my wife did the same so he's a

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.770 
and my wife did the same so he's a
combination<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.289> me<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.219> my<00:01:02.399> wife<00:01:02.780> and

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
combination of of me and my wife and

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.250 
combination of of me and my wife and
life<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.350> just<00:01:04.890> past<00:01:05.700> DNA<00:01:06.270> down<00:01:06.479> generation

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
life is just past DNA down generation

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.870 
life is just past DNA down generation
after<00:01:07.380> generation<00:01:07.530> after<00:01:08.130> generation<00:01:08.280> we've

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
after generation after generation we've

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.399 
after generation after generation we've
never<00:01:09.119> found<00:01:09.360> life<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.780> our<00:01:09.840> planet<00:01:09.960> that

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
never found life on our planet that

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.320 
never found life on our planet that
doesn't<00:01:10.770> have<00:01:10.860> DNA<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.549> means<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.210> we're

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
doesn't have DNA that means that we're

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.450 
doesn't have DNA that means that we're
all<00:01:12.540> connected<00:01:13.200> through<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> single<00:01:14.250> thread

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
all connected through the single thread

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.120 
all connected through the single thread
back<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.090> first<00:01:15.950> Universal<00:01:16.950> common

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
back to that first Universal common

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.310 
back to that first Universal common
ancestor<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:18.210> what<00:01:18.390> are<00:01:18.450> they<00:01:18.540> made<00:01:18.780> up<00:01:19.020> of

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
ancestor but what are they made up of

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.380 
ancestor but what are they made up of
those<00:01:19.920> are<00:01:20.040> nucleotides<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.180> these<00:01:21.330> are

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
those are nucleotides and so these are

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.170 
those are nucleotides and so these are
the<00:01:21.600> building<00:01:22.110> blocks<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.590> DNA<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
the building blocks of DNA and the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.390 
the building blocks of DNA and the
building<00:01:24.479> blocks<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.900> RNA<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:26.009> let's<00:01:26.189> look

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
building blocks of RNA so let's look

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.190 
building blocks of RNA so let's look
specifically<00:01:26.970> at<00:01:27.090> one<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.750> one

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
specifically at one so this is one

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.980 
specifically at one so this is one
nucleotide<00:01:28.920> right<00:01:29.369> here<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.820> nucleotide<00:01:30.630> is

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
nucleotide right here a nucleotide is

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.319 
nucleotide right here a nucleotide is
made<00:01:31.170> up<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.560> three<00:01:32.009> parts<00:01:32.369> we've<00:01:32.880> got<00:01:33.119> a

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
made up of three parts we've got a

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.120 
made up of three parts we've got a
phosphate<00:01:34.020> group<00:01:34.049> that's<00:01:34.770> going<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.040> be

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
phosphate group that's going to be

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.190 
phosphate group that's going to be
pictured<00:01:35.460> right<00:01:35.670> here<00:01:36.030> it's<00:01:36.180> an<00:01:36.329> phosphorus

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
pictured right here it's an phosphorus

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.719 
pictured right here it's an phosphorus
in<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.380> middle<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.829> then<00:01:37.920> oxygen<00:01:38.430> around<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
in the middle and then oxygen around the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.179 
in the middle and then oxygen around the
outside<00:01:39.439> phosphate<00:01:40.439> groups<00:01:40.650> are<00:01:40.770> really

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
outside phosphate groups are really

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.340 
outside phosphate groups are really
famous<00:01:41.790> in<00:01:42.090> biology<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.630> they're<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
famous in biology so they're the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.620 
famous in biology so they're the
phosphates<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:44.009> are<00:01:44.100> found<00:01:44.310> in

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
phosphates that are found in

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.399 
phosphates that are found in
phospholipids<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.750> make<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.229> cell

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
phospholipids that make the cell

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.350 
phospholipids that make the cell
membranes<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:47.009> all<00:01:47.130> life<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.759> it's<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.119> same

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
membranes of all life and it's the same

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.999 
membranes of all life and it's the same
phosphate<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.840> we're<00:01:49.079> going<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.259> find<00:01:49.500> in

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
phosphate that we're going to find in

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.310 
phosphate that we're going to find in
ATP<00:01:50.610> adenosine<00:01:51.329> triphosphate<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
ATP adenosine triphosphate it's the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.280 
ATP adenosine triphosphate it's the
energy<00:01:52.770> source<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:53.640> fact<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.290> adenosine

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
energy source and in fact the adenosine

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.560 
energy source and in fact the adenosine
triphosphate<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:56.340> exactly<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.390> same

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
triphosphate is exactly the same

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.510 
triphosphate is exactly the same
adenosine<00:01:58.049> triphosphate<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.860> we<00:01:58.950> add<00:01:59.130> to

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
adenosine triphosphate that we add to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.999 
adenosine triphosphate that we add to
make<00:01:59.820> DNA<00:02:00.689> we'll<00:02:01.020> get<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.680> second

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
make DNA we'll get to that just a second

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.649 
make DNA we'll get to that just a second
what<00:02:02.549> else<00:02:02.729> do<00:02:02.850> we<00:02:02.909> have<00:02:02.969> well<00:02:03.420> we<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:03.630> a

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
what else do we have well we have a

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.719 
what else do we have well we have a
pentose<00:02:04.290> sugar<00:02:04.619> pentose<00:02:05.070> sugar<00:02:05.310> means<00:02:05.579> we

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
pentose sugar pentose sugar means we

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.660 
pentose sugar pentose sugar means we
have<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.850> five<00:02:06.180> carbon<00:02:06.689> sugar<00:02:06.719> in<00:02:07.429> DNA<00:02:08.429> that's

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
have a five carbon sugar in DNA that's

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.609 
have a five carbon sugar in DNA that's
going<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.849> be<00:02:09.020> deoxyribose<00:02:10.020> sugar<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.530> then

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
going to be deoxyribose sugar and then

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.660 
going to be deoxyribose sugar and then
in<00:02:10.739> RNA<00:02:11.129> it's<00:02:11.280> going<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.459> be<00:02:11.550> a

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
in RNA it's going to be a

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.550 
in RNA it's going to be a
ribose<00:02:12.209> sugar<00:02:12.240> and<00:02:12.870> then<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.410> most

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
ribose sugar and then the most

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.380 
ribose sugar and then the most
interesting<00:02:14.190> part<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.490> a<00:02:14.550> nucleotide<00:02:14.940> is

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
interesting part of a nucleotide is

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.300 
interesting part of a nucleotide is
going<00:02:15.599> to<00:02:15.660> be<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.870> nitrogenous<00:02:16.680> base<00:02:16.980> and

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
going to be the nitrogenous base and

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.160 
going to be the nitrogenous base and
it's<00:02:17.430> called<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.790> nitrogenous<00:02:18.510> base<00:02:18.750> because

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
it's called a nitrogenous base because

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.949 
it's called a nitrogenous base because
it<00:02:19.290> has<00:02:19.440> nitrogen<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.370> so<00:02:20.819> most<00:02:21.360> things<00:02:21.660> in

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
it has nitrogen and so most things in

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.540 
it has nitrogen and so most things in
life<00:02:21.989> are<00:02:22.410> made<00:02:22.500> up<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.770> carbon<00:02:23.040> but<00:02:23.400> there's

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
life are made up of carbon but there's

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.339 
life are made up of carbon but there's
going<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.700> be<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.849> lot<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.120> nitrogen<00:02:24.930> here<00:02:25.200> in

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
going to be a lot of nitrogen here in

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.880 
going to be a lot of nitrogen here in
the<00:02:25.500> base<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:26.209> this<00:02:27.209> nucleotide<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:28.680> is

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
the base of this nucleotide and this is

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.979 
the base of this nucleotide and this is
going<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.069> be<00:02:29.220> different<00:02:29.580> in<00:02:29.700> each<00:02:30.030> nucleotide

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
going to be different in each nucleotide

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.229 
going to be different in each nucleotide
and<00:02:31.200> so<00:02:31.920> let's<00:02:32.100> take<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.280> look<00:02:32.580> at<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.850> the

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
and so let's take a look at the the

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.030 
and so let's take a look at the the
nucleotides<00:02:33.780> found<00:02:34.020> in<00:02:34.140> DNA<00:02:34.319> and<00:02:34.830> so

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
nucleotides found in DNA and so

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.460 
nucleotides found in DNA and so
basically<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.670> have<00:02:35.940> adenine<00:02:36.660> cytosine

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
basically you have adenine cytosine

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.880 
basically you have adenine cytosine
guanine<00:02:38.069> and<00:02:38.760> thymine<00:02:38.819> and<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:40.200> we<00:02:40.319> have<00:02:40.470> four

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
guanine and thymine and so we have four

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.640 
guanine and thymine and so we have four
different<00:02:41.310> bases<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.870> therefore<00:02:43.380> we<00:02:43.560> have

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
different bases and therefore we have

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.100 
different bases and therefore we have
four<00:02:44.010> different<00:02:44.390> nucleotides<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:45.959> can

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
four different nucleotides and you can

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.080 
four different nucleotides and you can
just<00:02:46.350> see<00:02:46.560> looking<00:02:47.100> at<00:02:47.250> them<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.489> size<00:02:47.730> is

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
just see looking at them the size is

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.759 
just see looking at them the size is
going<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.330> be<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.450> little<00:02:48.780> different<00:02:49.050> on<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.560> on

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
going to be a little different on the on

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.539 
going to be a little different on the on
all<00:02:49.980> four<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.340> these<00:02:50.610> um<00:02:50.970> in<00:02:52.130> RNA<00:02:53.130> they<00:02:53.340> don't

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
all four of these um in RNA they don't

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.130 
all four of these um in RNA they don't
have<00:02:53.700> thymine<00:02:54.209> you<00:02:54.420> might<00:02:54.600> know<00:02:54.750> this<00:02:54.930> but

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
have thymine you might know this but

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.420 
have thymine you might know this but
they<00:02:55.200> have<00:02:55.230> uracil<00:02:55.890> it's<00:02:56.069> going<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.250> look<00:02:56.340> a

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
they have uracil it's going to look a

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.190 
they have uracil it's going to look a
lot<00:02:56.640> like<00:02:56.880> thymine<00:02:57.390> but<00:02:57.569> it's<00:02:57.690> not<00:02:57.870> going<00:02:58.140> to

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
lot like thymine but it's not going to

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.590 
lot like thymine but it's not going to
be<00:02:58.350> thymine<00:02:58.950> if<00:02:59.580> we're<00:02:59.700> going<00:02:59.819> to<00:02:59.880> now<00:03:00.060> look<00:03:00.090> at

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
be thymine if we're going to now look at

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.410 
be thymine if we're going to now look at
all<00:03:00.630> those<00:03:01.080> nucleotides<00:03:01.709> together<00:03:01.920> so<00:03:02.400> AC<00:03:02.730> G

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
all those nucleotides together so AC G

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.970 
all those nucleotides together so AC G
and<00:03:03.660> T<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.170> that's<00:03:04.319> where<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.560> names<00:03:04.769> come

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
and T and that's where the names come

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.789 
and T and that's where the names come
from<00:03:05.040> in<00:03:05.340> DNA<00:03:05.819> we're<00:03:06.030> talking<00:03:06.330> about<00:03:06.420> these

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
from in DNA we're talking about these

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.350 
from in DNA we're talking about these
nitrogenous<00:03:07.799> bases<00:03:08.069> or<00:03:08.519> these<00:03:08.700> nucleotides

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
nitrogenous bases or these nucleotides

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.140 
nitrogenous bases or these nucleotides
now<00:03:09.690> we've<00:03:09.840> got<00:03:09.959> uracil<00:03:10.640> basically<00:03:11.640> if<00:03:11.730> we<00:03:11.880> put

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
now we've got uracil basically if we put

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.300 
now we've got uracil basically if we put
them<00:03:12.239> in<00:03:12.330> order<00:03:12.690> by<00:03:12.930> their<00:03:13.230> size<00:03:13.590> we've<00:03:14.100> got

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
them in order by their size we've got

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.729 
them in order by their size we've got
two<00:03:14.549> major<00:03:14.819> groups<00:03:15.090> we<00:03:15.780> have<00:03:15.930> these<00:03:16.140> ones<00:03:16.470> that

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
two major groups we have these ones that

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.160 
two major groups we have these ones that
have<00:03:16.890> two<00:03:17.250> rings<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:18.030> we<00:03:18.150> call<00:03:18.299> these<00:03:18.450> purines

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
have two rings and we call these purines

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.020 
have two rings and we call these purines
so<00:03:19.440> this<00:03:19.590> is<00:03:19.709> adenine<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.579> this<00:03:20.700> is<00:03:20.820> going<00:03:20.940> to

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
so this is adenine and this is going to

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.759 
so this is adenine and this is going to
be<00:03:21.150> guanine<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:21.840> then<00:03:22.410> we<00:03:22.530> have<00:03:22.650> the

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
be guanine and then we have the

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.080 
be guanine and then we have the
perimeters<00:03:23.310> they're<00:03:23.640> just<00:03:23.820> going<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.000> have

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
perimeters they're just going to have

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.690 
perimeters they're just going to have
one<00:03:24.120> ring<00:03:24.600> so<00:03:24.840> cytosine<00:03:25.440> thymine<00:03:25.829> and<00:03:26.250> uracil

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
one ring so cytosine thymine and uracil

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.060 
one ring so cytosine thymine and uracil
are<00:03:26.940> all<00:03:27.090> going<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.299> have<00:03:27.450> one<00:03:27.840> ring<00:03:28.560> so

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
are all going to have one ring so

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.500 
are all going to have one ring so
they're<00:03:29.220> going<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.370> be<00:03:29.519> smaller<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.269> that'll

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
they're going to be smaller and that'll

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.670 
they're going to be smaller and that'll
become<00:03:30.600> really<00:03:31.079> important<00:03:31.440> when<00:03:31.560> we<00:03:31.650> start

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
become really important when we start

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.920 
become really important when we start
bonding<00:03:32.100> them<00:03:32.430> together<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.600> let's<00:03:33.750> talk

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
bonding them together so let's talk

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.960 
bonding them together so let's talk
about<00:03:33.989> bounding<00:03:34.769> how<00:03:35.220> do<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:35.430> connect<00:03:35.820> them

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
about bounding how do you connect them

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.430 
about bounding how do you connect them
together<00:03:36.180> well<00:03:36.750> when<00:03:36.930> we<00:03:37.019> talked<00:03:37.230> about

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
together well when we talked about

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.840 
together well when we talked about
carbohydrates<00:03:37.799> there's<00:03:38.400> really<00:03:38.549> only<00:03:38.640> one

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
carbohydrates there's really only one

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.729 
carbohydrates there's really only one
way<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.299> connect<00:03:39.690> carbohydrates<00:03:40.320> or<00:03:40.530> when<00:03:40.650> we

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
way to connect carbohydrates or when we

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.110 
way to connect carbohydrates or when we
talk<00:03:40.769> about<00:03:41.100> amino<00:03:41.340> acids<00:03:41.790> there's<00:03:41.970> really

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
talk about amino acids there's really

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.120 
talk about amino acids there's really
only<00:03:42.239> one<00:03:42.450> way<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.930> connect<00:03:43.320> them<00:03:43.470> but

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
only one way to connect them but

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.890 
only one way to connect them but
especially<00:03:44.549> when<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.030> get<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.269> DNA<00:03:45.630> you<00:03:45.690> can

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
especially when you get to DNA you can

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.229 
especially when you get to DNA you can
connect<00:03:46.380> nucleotides<00:03:47.370> in<00:03:47.549> two<00:03:47.730> ways<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.150> let's

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
connect nucleotides in two ways so let's

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.569 
connect nucleotides in two ways so let's
start<00:03:48.570> with<00:03:48.630> way<00:03:48.840> one<00:03:49.109> way<00:03:49.410> one<00:03:49.709> we<00:03:50.340> can<00:03:50.459> put

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
start with way one way one we can put

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:51.979 
start with way one way one we can put
this<00:03:50.700> in<00:03:50.850> one<00:03:50.970> right<00:03:51.239> underneath<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.780> so<00:03:51.900> we've

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
this in one right underneath it so we've

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.110 
this in one right underneath it so we've
got<00:03:52.109> an<00:03:52.230> adenine<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:52.799> guanine<00:03:52.890> and<00:03:53.489> then

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
got an adenine and guanine and then

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.240 
got an adenine and guanine and then
through<00:03:54.630> a<00:03:54.660> dehydration<00:03:54.980> reaction<00:03:55.980> we<00:03:56.100> could

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
through a dehydration reaction we could

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.009 
through a dehydration reaction we could
lose<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.489> water<00:03:56.910> right<00:03:57.239> here<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:57.810> we<00:03:57.930> could

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
lose a water right here and we could

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.870 
lose a water right here and we could
form<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.380> covalent<00:03:58.590> bond<00:03:59.250> between<00:03:59.400> two

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
form a covalent bond between two

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.729 
form a covalent bond between two
nucleotides<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:00.780> so<00:04:01.290> if<00:04:01.350> we<00:04:01.410> were<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.620> add

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
nucleotides and so if we were to add

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.069 
nucleotides and so if we were to add
another<00:04:01.769> one<00:04:02.370> we<00:04:02.850> would<00:04:02.970> add<00:04:03.209> another

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
another one we would add another

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.140 
another one we would add another
nucleotide<00:04:04.500> here<00:04:04.950> we<00:04:05.100> lose<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.430> water<00:04:05.819> and

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
nucleotide here we lose a water and

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.130 
nucleotide here we lose a water and
we're<00:04:06.299> going<00:04:06.420> to<00:04:06.450> make<00:04:06.569> another<00:04:06.840> covalent

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
we're going to make another covalent

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.080 
we're going to make another covalent
bond<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:07.950> so<00:04:08.100> we<00:04:08.220> can<00:04:08.370> attach<00:04:08.670> them<00:04:08.940> together

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
bond and so we can attach them together

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.050 
bond and so we can attach them together
like<00:04:09.569> that<00:04:09.630> and<00:04:10.109> so<00:04:10.500> that's<00:04:10.709> what<00:04:10.859> RNA<00:04:11.340> is<00:04:11.579> RNA

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
like that and so that's what RNA is RNA

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.910 
like that and so that's what RNA is RNA
is<00:04:12.150> a<00:04:12.209> number<00:04:12.630> of<00:04:12.750> nucleotides<00:04:13.109> simply<00:04:13.739> in<00:04:13.829> a

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
is a number of nucleotides simply in a

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.710 
is a number of nucleotides simply in a
row<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:14.519> they're<00:04:14.639> connected<00:04:15.060> with<00:04:15.090> covalent

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
row and they're connected with covalent

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.050 
row and they're connected with covalent
bonds<00:04:15.989> between<00:04:16.049> each<00:04:16.350> one<00:04:16.739> there's<00:04:17.639> another

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
bonds between each one there's another

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.330 
bonds between each one there's another
way<00:04:18.359> however<00:04:18.780> when<00:04:18.989> we<00:04:19.079> get<00:04:19.229> DNA<00:04:19.530> that<00:04:20.039> we<00:04:20.130> can

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
way however when we get DNA that we can

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.310 
way however when we get DNA that we can
we<00:04:20.909> can<00:04:21.060> bond<00:04:21.299> them<00:04:21.539> and<00:04:21.750> so<00:04:21.900> let's<00:04:22.080> say<00:04:22.200> we

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
we can bond them and so let's say we

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.170 
we can bond them and so let's say we
have<00:04:22.470> these<00:04:22.560> two<00:04:22.650> nucleotides<00:04:23.460> adenine<00:04:24.000> and

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
have these two nucleotides adenine and

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.280 
have these two nucleotides adenine and
guanine

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
guanine

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.350 
guanine
how<00:04:25.650> could<00:04:25.830> it<00:04:25.860> attach<00:04:26.250> this<00:04:26.490> thymine<00:04:27.090> right

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
how could it attach this thymine right

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.600 
how could it attach this thymine right
here<00:04:27.690> well<00:04:27.930> basically<00:04:28.170> I<00:04:28.530> can<00:04:28.770> turn<00:04:28.980> it<00:04:29.100> upside

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
here well basically I can turn it upside

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.550 
here well basically I can turn it upside
down<00:04:29.640> and<00:04:30.360> it's<00:04:30.870> going<00:04:30.960> to<00:04:31.020> form<00:04:31.290> hydrogen

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
down and it's going to form hydrogen

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.560 
down and it's going to form hydrogen
bonds<00:04:32.130> here<00:04:32.490> between<00:04:32.700> the<00:04:32.970> adenine<00:04:33.420> and

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
bonds here between the adenine and

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.300 
bonds here between the adenine and
thymine<00:04:33.660> and<00:04:34.590> you've<00:04:34.740> probably<00:04:34.830> heard<00:04:35.010> this

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
thymine and you've probably heard this

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.180 
thymine and you've probably heard this
before<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:35.790> adenine<00:04:36.270> will<00:04:36.480> always<00:04:36.840> bond<00:04:37.190> to

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
before the adenine will always bond to

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.120 
before the adenine will always bond to
thymine<00:04:38.520> and<00:04:39.000> guanine<00:04:39.060> will<00:04:40.050> always<00:04:40.500> bond<00:04:40.740> to

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
thymine and guanine will always bond to

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.430 
thymine and guanine will always bond to
cytosine<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:42.060> that's<00:04:42.630> why<00:04:42.900> there's<00:04:43.260> going<00:04:43.380> to

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
cytosine and that's why there's going to

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.430 
cytosine and that's why there's going to
be<00:04:43.500> interactions<00:04:44.490> between<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:45.930> oxygen

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
be interactions between the oxygen

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.380 
be interactions between the oxygen
nitrogen<00:04:46.620> and<00:04:47.190> the<00:04:47.400> hydrogen<00:04:47.430> and<00:04:48.090> make<00:04:48.240> these

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
nitrogen and the hydrogen and make these

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.540 
nitrogen and the hydrogen and make these
hydrogen<00:04:48.960> bonds<00:04:49.170> that<00:04:49.350> are<00:04:49.500> connect<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.370> two

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
hydrogen bonds that are connect the two

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.180 
hydrogen bonds that are connect the two
and<00:04:50.850> so<00:04:51.330> when<00:04:51.420> you're<00:04:51.540> looking<00:04:51.570> at<00:04:52.140> DNA<00:04:52.350> let's

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
and so when you're looking at DNA let's

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.830 
and so when you're looking at DNA let's
kind<00:04:53.370> of<00:04:53.460> switch<00:04:53.670> to<00:04:54.000> this<00:04:54.120> next<00:04:54.420> slide<00:04:54.600> when

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
kind of switch to this next slide when

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.810 
kind of switch to this next slide when
you're<00:04:54.960> looking<00:04:55.260> at<00:04:55.410> DNA<00:04:55.590> that's<00:04:56.430> what's

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
you're looking at DNA that's what's

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.670 
you're looking at DNA that's what's
being<00:04:57.000> connected<00:04:57.570> right<00:04:57.750> here<00:04:58.050> in<00:04:58.200> the<00:04:58.380> middle

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
being connected right here in the middle

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.410 
being connected right here in the middle
so<00:04:59.070> that's<00:04:59.220> going<00:04:59.430> to<00:04:59.490> be<00:04:59.640> those<00:04:59.790> hydrogen

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
so that's going to be those hydrogen

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.990 
so that's going to be those hydrogen
bonds<00:05:00.630> between<00:05:00.900> the<00:05:01.430> nitrogenous<00:05:02.430> bases<00:05:02.700> on

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
bonds between the nitrogenous bases on

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.840 
bonds between the nitrogenous bases on
either<00:05:03.270> side<00:05:03.690> and<00:05:04.140> so<00:05:04.650> why<00:05:04.920> do<00:05:04.980> we<00:05:05.220> have<00:05:05.460> DNA

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
either side and so why do we have DNA

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.940 
either side and so why do we have DNA
well<00:05:06.300> we<00:05:06.420> think<00:05:06.570> life<00:05:06.840> started<00:05:07.320> with<00:05:07.440> RNA

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
well we think life started with RNA

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.130 
well we think life started with RNA
because<00:05:08.340> it<00:05:08.460> contains<00:05:08.820> a<00:05:08.970> message<00:05:09.180> but<00:05:09.810> over

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
because it contains a message but over

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.920 
because it contains a message but over
time<00:05:10.410> we<00:05:11.280> kind<00:05:11.490> of<00:05:11.580> had<00:05:11.700> to<00:05:11.910> rnase<00:05:12.330> wrap<00:05:12.570> around

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
time we kind of had to rnase wrap around

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.020 
time we kind of had to rnase wrap around
each<00:05:13.110> other<00:05:13.350> and<00:05:13.530> we<00:05:13.680> eventually<00:05:13.950> had<00:05:14.340> DNA

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
each other and we eventually had DNA

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.690 
each other and we eventually had DNA
there's<00:05:15.570> more<00:05:15.930> to<00:05:16.170> it<00:05:16.350> than<00:05:16.500> that<00:05:16.560> but<00:05:17.190> DNA<00:05:17.610> is

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
there's more to it than that but DNA is

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.400 
there's more to it than that but DNA is
going<00:05:17.820> to<00:05:17.910> be<00:05:18.030> a<00:05:18.060> more<00:05:18.300> stable<00:05:18.720> structure

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
going to be a more stable structure

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.660 
going to be a more stable structure
we're<00:05:19.620> going<00:05:19.740> to<00:05:19.800> have<00:05:19.890> these<00:05:20.010> hydrogen<00:05:20.490> bonds

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
we're going to have these hydrogen bonds

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:21.710 
we're going to have these hydrogen bonds
here<00:05:21.030> and<00:05:21.180> then<00:05:21.300> we're<00:05:21.390> going<00:05:21.480> to<00:05:21.540> have

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
here and then we're going to have

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.600 
here and then we're going to have
hydrogen<00:05:22.170> bonds<00:05:22.500> between<00:05:22.610> different

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
hydrogen bonds between different

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.120 
hydrogen bonds between different
backbones<00:05:24.390> of<00:05:24.540> the<00:05:24.660> DNA<00:05:24.960> as<00:05:25.080> well<00:05:25.290> and<00:05:25.560> so<00:05:25.950> what

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
backbones of the DNA as well and so what

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.040 
backbones of the DNA as well and so what
did<00:05:26.220> the<00:05:26.340> backbone<00:05:26.910> of<00:05:26.940> DNA<00:05:27.450> really<00:05:27.630> made<00:05:27.900> up

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
did the backbone of DNA really made up

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.900 
did the backbone of DNA really made up
of<00:05:28.260> it's<00:05:28.560> just<00:05:28.800> a<00:05:28.920> sugar<00:05:29.250> attached<00:05:29.700> to<00:05:29.880> a

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
of it's just a sugar attached to a

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.880 
of it's just a sugar attached to a
phosphate<00:05:30.180> to<00:05:30.600> a<00:05:30.630> sugar<00:05:30.840> to<00:05:31.170> a<00:05:31.200> phosphate<00:05:31.710> to<00:05:31.860> a

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
phosphate to a sugar to a phosphate to a

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.220 
phosphate to a sugar to a phosphate to a
sugar<00:05:32.130> and<00:05:32.460> so<00:05:33.060> what<00:05:33.270> are<00:05:33.360> some<00:05:33.390> differences

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
sugar and so what are some differences

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.800 
sugar and so what are some differences
between<00:05:34.440> DNA<00:05:35.160> on<00:05:35.400> the<00:05:35.670> right<00:05:35.850> and<00:05:36.150> RNA<00:05:36.600> on<00:05:36.690> the

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
between DNA on the right and RNA on the

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.420 
between DNA on the right and RNA on the
left<00:05:37.050> well<00:05:37.440> the<00:05:37.560> first<00:05:37.830> one<00:05:38.070> would<00:05:38.280> be<00:05:38.340> the

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
left well the first one would be the

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.790 
left well the first one would be the
uracil<00:05:39.120> versus<00:05:39.750> the<00:05:39.960> thymine<00:05:40.410> so<00:05:40.620> that's

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
uracil versus the thymine so that's

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.580 
uracil versus the thymine so that's
going<00:05:40.920> to<00:05:40.980> be<00:05:41.100> a<00:05:41.130> different<00:05:41.610> nitrogenous<00:05:42.150> base

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
going to be a different nitrogenous base

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.440 
going to be a different nitrogenous base
DNA<00:05:43.590> is<00:05:43.710> going<00:05:43.860> to<00:05:43.920> be<00:05:44.070> a<00:05:44.280> double<00:05:44.880> helix<00:05:45.090> and

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
DNA is going to be a double helix and

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.330 
DNA is going to be a double helix and
RNA<00:05:45.810> is<00:05:45.960> going<00:05:46.080> to<00:05:46.140> be<00:05:46.260> a<00:05:46.290> single<00:05:46.680> helix<00:05:47.130> and

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
RNA is going to be a single helix and

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.980 
RNA is going to be a single helix and
then<00:05:47.430> in<00:05:47.580> life<00:05:47.790> DNA<00:05:48.300> is<00:05:48.360> going<00:05:48.540> to<00:05:48.600> be<00:05:48.660> found<00:05:48.810> in

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
then in life DNA is going to be found in

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.570 
then in life DNA is going to be found in
the<00:05:49.050> nucleus<00:05:49.200> and<00:05:49.710> RNA<00:05:50.010> is<00:05:50.070> going<00:05:50.130> to<00:05:50.280> be<00:05:50.370> found

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
the nucleus and RNA is going to be found

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.730 
the nucleus and RNA is going to be found
pretty<00:05:50.910> much<00:05:51.060> everywhere<00:05:51.840> that<00:05:52.140> we<00:05:52.290> need<00:05:52.530> it

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
pretty much everywhere that we need it

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.890 
pretty much everywhere that we need it
so<00:05:53.370> if<00:05:53.460> you're<00:05:53.550> confused<00:05:53.790> on<00:05:54.240> how<00:05:54.450> we<00:05:54.510> go<00:05:54.750> from

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
so if you're confused on how we go from

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.020 
so if you're confused on how we go from
DNA<00:05:55.170> to<00:05:55.500> proteins<00:05:56.160> or<00:05:56.550> if<00:05:56.640> you're<00:05:56.760> really

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
DNA to proteins or if you're really

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.700 
DNA to proteins or if you're really
interested<00:05:57.240> in<00:05:57.570> the<00:05:57.660> whole<00:05:57.810> secret<00:05:58.350> of<00:05:58.410> life

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
interested in the whole secret of life

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.310 
interested in the whole secret of life
I'll<00:05:59.310> put<00:05:59.580> a<00:05:59.610> little<00:05:59.820> link<00:06:00.450> to<00:06:00.600> a<00:06:00.630> video<00:06:00.840> I<00:06:01.020> made

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
I'll put a little link to a video I made

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.750 
I'll put a little link to a video I made
that<00:06:01.470> kind<00:06:01.650> of<00:06:01.710> talks<00:06:01.920> you<00:06:02.070> through<00:06:02.100> how<00:06:02.460> we<00:06:02.520> go

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
that kind of talks you through how we go

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.600 
that kind of talks you through how we go
from<00:06:02.910> DNA<00:06:03.180> to<00:06:03.480> proteins<00:06:04.380> but<00:06:05.130> the<00:06:05.220> last<00:06:05.430> thing

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
from DNA to proteins but the last thing

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.040 
from DNA to proteins but the last thing
I<00:06:05.700> wanted<00:06:05.940> to<00:06:06.000> leave<00:06:06.180> you<00:06:06.360> with<00:06:06.390> is<00:06:06.780> how

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
I wanted to leave you with is how

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.110 
I wanted to leave you with is how
important<00:06:07.500> they<00:06:07.620> are<00:06:07.650> if<00:06:08.340> you're<00:06:08.640> interested

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
important they are if you're interested

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.880 
important they are if you're interested
in<00:06:09.240> RNA<00:06:09.660> and<00:06:09.870> if<00:06:09.930> you're<00:06:10.050> interested<00:06:10.560> in

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:10.890 
in RNA and if you're interested in

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.860 
in RNA and if you're interested in
science<00:06:11.310> and<00:06:11.460> video<00:06:11.850> games<00:06:12.150> then<00:06:12.570> you<00:06:12.750> may

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
science and video games then you may

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.480 
science and video games then you may
want<00:06:12.960> to<00:06:13.050> check<00:06:13.200> this<00:06:13.380> out<00:06:13.590> this<00:06:13.800> is<00:06:13.860> Eterna

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
want to check this out this is Eterna

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.150 
want to check this out this is Eterna
Eterna<00:06:15.060> is<00:06:15.270> a<00:06:15.300> video<00:06:15.750> game<00:06:16.080> I<00:06:16.380> think<00:06:17.070> it's

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
Eterna is a video game I think it's

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.680 
Eterna is a video game I think it's
centered<00:06:17.490> at<00:06:17.640> Stanford<00:06:18.090> University<00:06:18.660> and

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
centered at Stanford University and

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.090 
centered at Stanford University and
basically<00:06:19.290> what<00:06:19.500> they're<00:06:19.620> doing<00:06:19.860> is<00:06:19.980> they're

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
basically what they're doing is they're

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.910 
basically what they're doing is they're
letting<00:06:20.310> people<00:06:20.610> on<00:06:20.880> the<00:06:20.970> internet<00:06:21.360> build

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:21.920 
letting people on the internet build

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.100 
letting people on the internet build
sections<00:06:22.920> of<00:06:23.160> RNA<00:06:23.790> and<00:06:24.120> so<00:06:24.570> basically<00:06:24.930> you

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
sections of RNA and so basically you

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.470 
sections of RNA and so basically you
build<00:06:25.440> sections<00:06:25.950> of<00:06:26.070> RNA<00:06:26.490> they<00:06:27.390> have

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:27.480 
build sections of RNA they have

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.630 
build sections of RNA they have
competitions<00:06:28.170> each<00:06:28.320> week<00:06:28.710> and<00:06:29.010> basically<00:06:29.190> the

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:29.640 
competitions each week and basically the

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.670 
competitions each week and basically the
winners<00:06:30.000> each<00:06:30.030> week<00:06:30.480> they<00:06:30.780> will<00:06:30.960> make<00:06:31.380> your

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
winners each week they will make your

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.520 
winners each week they will make your
RNA<00:06:32.130> so<00:06:32.190> they'll<00:06:32.520> actually<00:06:33.050> synthesize<00:06:34.050> and

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
RNA so they'll actually synthesize and

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.140 
RNA so they'll actually synthesize and
make<00:06:34.800> your<00:06:35.040> section<00:06:35.460> of<00:06:35.550> RNA<00:06:35.880> and<00:06:36.060> then

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
make your section of RNA and then

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.320 
make your section of RNA and then
they'll<00:06:36.300> see<00:06:36.540> how<00:06:36.570> it<00:06:36.870> does<00:06:37.080> so<00:06:37.710> I'm<00:06:37.770> going<00:06:37.890> to

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
they'll see how it does so I'm going to

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.210 
they'll see how it does so I'm going to
the<00:06:38.509> videogame<00:06:38.990> and<00:06:39.259> tuck<00:06:39.800> you<00:06:39.919> through<00:06:40.099> the

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
the videogame and tuck you through the

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.610 
the videogame and tuck you through the
first<00:06:40.400> level<00:06:40.699> and<00:06:41.090> if<00:06:41.539> you're<00:06:41.689> interested<00:06:41.930> in

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
first level and if you're interested in

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.010 
first level and if you're interested in
RNA<00:06:43.370> or<00:06:43.610> making<00:06:44.000> things<00:06:44.240> real<00:06:44.629> in

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
RNA or making things real in

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.629 
RNA or making things real in
biochemistry<00:06:45.860> you<00:06:46.039> may<00:06:46.189> want<00:06:46.370> to<00:06:46.400> give<00:06:46.520> this

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 
biochemistry you may want to give this

it's a tutorial so I can click on next

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:53.170 
it's a tutorial so I can click on next
and<00:06:52.099> it'll<00:06:52.280> talk<00:06:52.460> me<00:06:52.639> through<00:06:52.669> what<00:06:52.969> I'm<00:06:53.060> going

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.180 
and it'll talk me through what I'm going

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.339 
and it'll talk me through what I'm going
to<00:06:53.210> do<00:06:53.389> so<00:06:53.750> you're<00:06:53.810> going<00:06:53.960> to<00:06:53.990> build<00:06:54.169> your<00:06:54.259> own

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:54.349 
to do so you're going to build your own

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:56.890 
to do so you're going to build your own
RNA<00:06:55.009> let<00:06:55.490> me<00:06:55.580> click<00:06:55.729> on<00:06:55.849> the<00:06:55.909> next<00:06:56.210> one<00:06:56.270> RNA<00:06:56.840> is

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:56.900 
RNA let me click on the next one RNA is

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.779 
RNA let me click on the next one RNA is
made<00:06:56.960> up<00:06:57.199> of<00:06:57.289> 4<00:06:57.590> bases<00:06:58.189> hopefully<00:06:58.639> you<00:06:58.699> know

00:06:58.779 --> 00:06:58.789 
made up of 4 bases hopefully you know

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:01.029 
made up of 4 bases hopefully you know
what<00:06:58.879> that<00:06:59.060> means<00:06:59.300> now<00:06:59.659> yellow<00:07:00.590> base<00:07:00.830> is

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:01.039 
what that means now yellow base is

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:05.980 
what that means now yellow base is
adenine<00:07:01.580> guanine<00:07:02.590> uracil<00:07:03.590> and<00:07:04.389> cytosine<00:07:05.389> and

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:05.990 
adenine guanine uracil and cytosine and

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.589 
adenine guanine uracil and cytosine and
so<00:07:06.560> as<00:07:06.710> a<00:07:06.740> warm-up<00:07:07.189> drill<00:07:07.460> let's<00:07:07.610> convert<00:07:08.449> all

00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:08.599 
so as a warm-up drill let's convert all

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:10.959 
so as a warm-up drill let's convert all
the<00:07:08.750> bases<00:07:09.199> to<00:07:09.439> guanine<00:07:10.340> so<00:07:10.580> let<00:07:10.699> me<00:07:10.789> click

00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:10.969 
the bases to guanine so let me click

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:12.999 
the bases to guanine so let me click
here<00:07:11.120> to<00:07:11.240> start<00:07:11.300> so<00:07:12.289> basically<00:07:12.620> what<00:07:12.830> you<00:07:12.889> can

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:13.009 
here to start so basically what you can

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:14.559 
here to start so basically what you can
do<00:07:13.099> is<00:07:13.190> go<00:07:13.280> down<00:07:13.430> here<00:07:13.789> I'm<00:07:13.940> going<00:07:14.060> to<00:07:14.120> get<00:07:14.389> my

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:14.569 
do is go down here I'm going to get my

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:16.740 
do is go down here I'm going to get my
mutate<00:07:15.080> and<00:07:15.319> I'm<00:07:15.469> going<00:07:15.590> to<00:07:15.620> mutate<00:07:16.009> this<00:07:16.219> to

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:16.750 
mutate and I'm going to mutate this to

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.629 
mutate and I'm going to mutate this to
guanine<00:07:17.750> I<00:07:17.930> love<00:07:18.500> the<00:07:18.740> music<00:07:18.889> in<00:07:19.219> here<00:07:19.460> the

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:19.639 
guanine I love the music in here the

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:23.809 
guanine I love the music in here the
little<00:07:19.969> sound<00:07:20.240> effects

00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:23.819 

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:26.700 

nice<00:07:24.819> so<00:07:25.060> I<00:07:25.090> cleared<00:07:25.419> level<00:07:25.720> one<00:07:25.900> and<00:07:26.380> then<00:07:26.620> you

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:26.710 
nice so I cleared level one and then you

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.200 
nice so I cleared level one and then you
can<00:07:26.740> go<00:07:26.889> to<00:07:26.949> the<00:07:27.099> next<00:07:27.280> puzzle<00:07:27.789> and<00:07:28.030> we<00:07:28.060> can

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.210 
can go to the next puzzle and we can

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.909 
can go to the next puzzle and we can
just<00:07:28.360> going<00:07:28.630> through<00:07:28.660> and<00:07:29.289> so<00:07:29.410> basically<00:07:29.740> on

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 
just going through and so basically on

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:31.800 
just going through and so basically on
this<00:07:30.039> one<00:07:30.250> what<00:07:30.370> you<00:07:30.460> can<00:07:30.610> do<00:07:30.759> is<00:07:31.060> they<00:07:31.630> will

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:31.810 
this one what you can do is they will

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.370 
this one what you can do is they will
attract<00:07:32.590> each<00:07:32.770> other<00:07:33.039> so<00:07:33.520> for<00:07:33.789> example

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:34.380 
attract each other so for example

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.930 
attract each other so for example
they're<00:07:35.380> going<00:07:35.410> to<00:07:35.560> say<00:07:35.710> that<00:07:36.039> adenine<00:07:36.550> and

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:36.940 
they're going to say that adenine and

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.700 
they're going to say that adenine and
uracil<00:07:37.599> are<00:07:37.780> going<00:07:37.930> to<00:07:37.990> come<00:07:38.139> together<00:07:38.289> and

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:38.710 
uracil are going to come together and

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.710 
uracil are going to come together and
the<00:07:39.190> guanine<00:07:39.639> and<00:07:39.819> cytosine<00:07:40.090> are<00:07:40.509> going<00:07:40.660> to

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 
the guanine and cytosine are going to

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.719 
the guanine and cytosine are going to
come<00:07:40.870> together<00:07:41.020> and<00:07:41.949> so<00:07:42.099> basically<00:07:42.430> what<00:07:42.639> you

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:42.729 
come together and so basically what you

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:44.400 
come together and so basically what you
do<00:07:42.910> is<00:07:42.940> you<00:07:43.330> get<00:07:43.449> to<00:07:43.599> play<00:07:43.840> around<00:07:43.990> with

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:44.410 
do is you get to play around with

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:46.950 
do is you get to play around with
pairing<00:07:45.130> these<00:07:45.370> and<00:07:45.880> so<00:07:46.449> I'm<00:07:46.569> going<00:07:46.720> to<00:07:46.780> stop

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:46.960 
pairing these and so I'm going to stop

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.240 
pairing these and so I'm going to stop
playing<00:07:47.080> the<00:07:47.319> video<00:07:47.590> game<00:07:47.770> in<00:07:47.889> front<00:07:48.099> of<00:07:48.190> you

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:48.250 
playing the video game in front of you

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.529 
playing the video game in front of you
but<00:07:48.400> give<00:07:48.580> it<00:07:48.610> a<00:07:48.699> look<00:07:48.910> it's<00:07:49.120> a<00:07:49.180> really<00:07:49.389> cool

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:49.539 
but give it a look it's a really cool

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:52.950 
but give it a look it's a really cool
idea<00:07:49.750> people<00:07:50.680> competing<00:07:51.370> to<00:07:51.759> make<00:07:52.030> RNA<00:07:52.300> and

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 
idea people competing to make RNA and

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.360 
idea people competing to make RNA and
then<00:07:53.229> they're<00:07:53.380> actually<00:07:53.650> building<00:07:54.009> it<00:07:54.099> in<00:07:54.250> the

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:54.370 
then they're actually building it in the

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.670 
then they're actually building it in the
real<00:07:54.520> world<00:07:54.729> and<00:07:55.360> so<00:07:55.479> that's<00:07:55.690> nucleic<00:07:56.229> acids

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:56.680 
real world and so that's nucleic acids

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.559 
real world and so that's nucleic acids
incredibly<00:07:57.220> important<00:07:57.639> and<00:07:57.819> I<00:07:58.270> hope<00:07:58.449> that's

00:07:58.559 --> 00:07:58.569 
incredibly important and I hope that's

00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:00.690 
incredibly important and I hope that's
helpful
