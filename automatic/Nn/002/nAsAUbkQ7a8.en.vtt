foils<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.659> side<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.380> highlighted<00:01:37.829> it

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
foils on this side and I highlighted it

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.490 
foils on this side and I highlighted it
and<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.939> put<00:01:39.090> probably<00:01:39.240> about<00:01:39.450> four<00:01:39.780> files<00:01:40.290> on

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500

this<00:01:40.799> side<00:01:41.009> just<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.579> some<00:01:41.790> more

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
this side just so I have some more

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.510 
this side just so I have some more
pieces<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.450> top<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:43.649> match<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.310> hair

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
pieces on top to match the hair

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.020 
pieces on top to match the hair
underneath<00:01:45.079> so<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.320> would<00:01:46.439> look<00:01:46.590> more

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
underneath so that it would look more

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.450 
underneath so that it would look more
natural<00:01:48.030> since<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.290> had<00:01:49.860> these<00:01:49.979> little<00:01:50.220> light
