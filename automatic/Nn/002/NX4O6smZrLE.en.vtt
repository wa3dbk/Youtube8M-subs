00:00:02.471 --> 00:00:03.911
- All right?
- Ok.

00:00:04.031 --> 00:00:06.325
But eat up your octopus gnocchi.

00:00:06.445 --> 00:00:08.925
Oh, mom, all right.

00:00:09.045 --> 00:00:12.742
- This octopus isn't real, is it?
- No.

00:00:12.862 --> 00:00:17.527
OK, then. And it neither speaks 
nor has a head, right?

00:00:17.647 --> 00:00:21.293
- Where's its head?
- It has no head.

00:00:21.413 --> 00:00:24.476
Those are only its little legs, chopped.

00:00:25.184 --> 00:00:28.451
Is its head in the sea?

00:00:28.571 --> 00:00:30.448
It's at the fisherman's.

00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:37.240
- Did the man hack it like this?
- He did.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.362
- Why?
- So we could eat it

00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:41.717
or we'd have to swallow it whole.

00:00:41.837 --> 00:00:44.110
But why?

00:00:45.387 --> 00:00:48.778
So we can eat, dear,
just like they hack the ox, the chicken.

00:00:48.898 --> 00:00:51.117
Eh? The chicken?

00:00:51.237 --> 00:00:54.092
- Nobody eats it either.
- Nobody eats chicken?

00:00:54.212 --> 00:00:57.897
- They are 'the animals'.
- Are they? - Yes.

00:01:01.335 --> 00:01:04.762
But let's eat the gnocchi.
Eat the potato, then.

00:01:05.072 --> 00:01:08.359
- Only this potato and this rice.
- Ok.

00:01:08.807 --> 00:01:12.147
- Not the octopus, it's 'the animals'.
- All right.

00:01:12.267 --> 00:01:15.538
All those are 'the animals'

00:01:15.818 --> 00:01:18.381
fish is 'the animals'...

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.793
octopus is 'the animals'...

00:01:21.913 --> 00:01:24.123
chicken is 'the animals'...

00:01:25.313 --> 00:01:27.859
cow is 'the animals'...

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.290
pig is 'the animals'...

00:01:31.202 --> 00:01:33.682
- Is it?
- So...

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.479
when we eat 'the animals'..

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:39.425
- They die.
- They do...

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:43.487
- Why?
- So we can eat, dear.

00:01:43.607 --> 00:01:44.946
Why do they die?

00:01:46.684 --> 00:01:49.115
I don't like that they die.

00:01:50.296 --> 00:01:53.093
I like that they keep standing

00:01:53.688 --> 00:01:55.136
and happy.

00:01:55.256 --> 00:01:58.398
All right, then.
We won't eat them anymore, ok?

00:01:58.518 --> 00:01:59.352
OK.

00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:04.119
Those animals are...

00:02:04.636 --> 00:02:07.299
for us to take care, 
not to eat them.

00:02:09.703 --> 00:02:11.334
All right, my son.

00:02:11.454 --> 00:02:13.897
Eat just your potato and rice, then.

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.490
All right.

00:02:15.757 --> 00:02:18.671
- Why are you crying?
- I'm not crying.

00:02:18.791 --> 00:02:21.167
- What?
- I'm just a little moved by you.

00:02:22.511 --> 00:02:25.241
I'm seeing a water leaving

00:02:26.634 --> 00:02:29.313
Eat up, then.
You don't have to eat the octopus, ok?

00:02:29.433 --> 00:02:30.828
All right.

00:02:30.948 --> 00:02:33.946
So, this octopus will be 
like meat for me.

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:36.744
- So it seems...
- Hi!

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.607
catchup tongue hurts...
