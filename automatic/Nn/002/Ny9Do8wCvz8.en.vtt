00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.359 
leave them to cool and then we're going
to<00:01:35.939> brush<00:01:36.180> through<00:01:36.210> them<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.810> break<00:01:36.960> them<00:01:37.020> up

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
to brush through them and break them up

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.039 
to brush through them and break them up
so<00:01:38.369> using<00:01:38.820> your<00:01:38.939> fingers<00:01:39.329> just<00:01:39.450> run<00:01:39.900> your

so using your fingers just run your

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.870 
so using your fingers just run your
fingers<00:01:40.439> through<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.740> curl<00:01:41.040> or<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.759> could

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
fingers through the curl or you could

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.969 
fingers through the curl or you could
use<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> wide<00:01:42.299> tooth<00:01:42.479> comb<00:01:42.540> either<00:01:43.140> just<00:01:43.860> to

use a wide tooth comb either just to

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.499 
use a wide tooth comb either just to
break<00:01:44.189> them<00:01:44.399> up<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.850> they<00:01:44.880> don't<00:01:45.000> look<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.390> much

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
break them up so they don't look so much
