00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Every thursday I await,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
A new video of Smosh,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I turn it on and I can't help,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
the need to hear my favourite song,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Finding twitter questions,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Maybe one day I will move to USA,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Even though your continent's so far away,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I'd get a job in KFC just to hear you sing,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
the lunchtime version of the best of all the things,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Finding twitter questions,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Why do you say that you 
answer twitter questions if you
haven't answered even one of mine,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Why do you say that you 
answer twitter questions if you 
still haven't answered mine,
