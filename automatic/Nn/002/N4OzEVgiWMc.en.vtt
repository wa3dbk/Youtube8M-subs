00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
really enjoyed it but it was just

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.700 
really enjoyed it but it was just
something<00:04:11.630> a<00:04:11.660> little<00:04:11.840> bit<00:04:11.930> different<00:04:12.290> but<00:04:12.530> now

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
something a little bit different but now

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.250 
something a little bit different but now
going<00:04:12.980> back<00:04:13.160> to<00:04:13.460> what<00:04:13.970> the<00:04:14.240> core<00:04:14.570> viewers<00:04:15.080> if

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
going back to what the core viewers if

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.960 
going back to what the core viewers if
that<00:04:15.440> makes<00:04:15.650> sense<00:04:15.740> enjoy<00:04:16.220> that's<00:04:16.549> a<00:04:16.640> bit<00:04:16.790> of<00:04:16.880> a

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
that makes sense enjoy that's a bit of a

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.670 
that makes sense enjoy that's a bit of a
weird<00:04:17.180> analogy<00:04:17.390> I<00:04:17.900> feel<00:04:18.200> like<00:04:18.380> that's<00:04:18.590> the

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
weird analogy I feel like that's the

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.930 
weird analogy I feel like that's the
best<00:04:18.739> way<00:04:19.010> to<00:04:19.040> put<00:04:19.310> it<00:04:19.430> we<00:04:19.549> had<00:04:19.670> something

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
best way to put it we had something

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.970 
best way to put it we had something
different<00:04:20.209> but<00:04:20.810> it<00:04:20.930> was<00:04:21.020> still<00:04:21.230> similar<00:04:21.500> stuff

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
different but it was still similar stuff

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.530 
different but it was still similar stuff
it<00:04:22.130> was<00:04:22.250> still<00:04:22.460> me<00:04:22.640> playing<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.090> game<00:04:23.270> me

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
it was still me playing the game me

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.880 
it was still me playing the game me
sniping<00:04:24.020> and<00:04:24.080> making<00:04:24.290> videos<00:04:24.560> so<00:04:24.800> that's

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
sniping and making videos so that's

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.590 
sniping and making videos so that's
pretty<00:04:25.130> much<00:04:25.220> why<00:04:25.520> I<00:04:25.550> wanted<00:04:25.850> to<00:04:25.970> cover<00:04:26.150> in

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
pretty much why I wanted to cover in

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.060 
pretty much why I wanted to cover in
