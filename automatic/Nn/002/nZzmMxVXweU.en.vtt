00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.980
 the right look in front of him this jumper 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.450
 seems confident though since six 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.429
 years gerard foucher is in a chair 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.740
 rolling he suffers from sclerosis in 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.730
 plates right on his horse he 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.080
 mobilizes 300 of his muscles 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.840
 we get up we go we grow up 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.619
 now we sit well 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.269
 symmetrical 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.949
 that's fine 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.570
 symmetric the sixteen much better his 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.340
 way at every step of the horse the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.900
 the balance of the rider 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:40.690
 destabilized and the rider puts it into play 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.700
 a whole bunch of reflexes that improves his 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.820
 tone of trunks his posture so his 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:51.489
 balance very well go look far 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:53.500
 in front of you and we leave or not for better 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.500
 feel the movements of the horse 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.670
 patients my sense she is without stirrups 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.110
 they can only count on 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.970
 their maintenance to achieve 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.479
 the balance 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:07.000
 the horse mobilizes the rider's pelvis 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.250
 in a way that has been studied which 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.250
 exactly the mobilization of the pelvis that 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:17.290
 we find when the rider is 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.790
 standing and moving while walking for 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.630
 evaluate the effects of this session 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.759
 riding 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.380
 physiotherapists ask gerard 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.020
 to ride on this platform 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.509
 posture analysis for a minute 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.289
 this one has to stand up the most 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.450
 possible right 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.550
 meanwhile the platform 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.860
 records the displacement of his center 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.509
 of gravity 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.789
 just before the session we can see that 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.009
 the center of gravity is shifted to the 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.890
 right and who had there were some 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.229
 imbalances compared after the 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.599
 equitherapy session where it's good 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.700
 centered his property symmetrical the patient to 

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:55.530
 regain that balance he had 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.530
 not two and three 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.729
 victim of a stroke 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.830
 cerebral gerard landry is paralyzed from 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.170
 left side as a lot of me please 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.550
 gicardard tends not to look 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.800
 on the side where he is paralyzed 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.030
 a tendency that the doctor tries to 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.610
 correct to make circles to the left 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.060
 you have to move your shoulder 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.750
 right 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:24.280
 there you focus your eyes towards the 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:28.140
 center of the circle permanently as long as 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.090
 we turn around the plot 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.890
 this session is also an opportunity to 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.330
 make voice work and 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:41.010
 pronunciation exercises the heroes said 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.569
 or not what is interesting with the 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.459
 sessions of equitherapy is that we are 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.690
 really in another frame in our 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.450
 offices it can be sometimes a little 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.760
 artificial there we are in a frame 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.590
 concrete with the horse and in addition if a 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.020
 immediate result squeezes that the patient 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.300
 if he speaks too low he the voice is not 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.790
 not enough projected past articulate the 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.350
 horse will not move so there actually 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.120
 has the benefit right away and they 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.019
 see who can again have a 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.940
 indirect impact on someone there on the 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.830
 horse so that's very rewarding 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:16.530
 for him 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:18.810
 bravo for anais riding on horseback is a 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.650
 real challenge because of a serious 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.810
 motorcycle accident 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.850
 she is now paralyzed from the 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.340
 thorax and no longer has any sensation in 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.140
 under the breast for three months 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.739
 she spends all her days in a chair 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.570
 rolling 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.140
 this session is for her a real 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:37.590
 moment of pleasure does it on a 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.170
 horse is not already high by 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.980
 chair ratio be lower than 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.090
 usually 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:49.230
 so that changes it changes a lot of 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:52.350
 voice differently things and it's a 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.060
 little sense of freedom to 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.560
 find on something else than in a 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.360
 armchair 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.760
 these patients when a reeducation that 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.120
 is long which often lasts several 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.079
 month they are far from imagining when he 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.570
 arrives at a rehabilitation center 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.769
 functional one day they go 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.920
 put their buttocks on the back of a 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.299
 horse and be able to be autonomous and I 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.500
 believe this is something that is 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.450
 very very rewarding for 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.130
 him our rehab process 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.799
 and I think it can boost it for 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.670
 everything else his reeducation 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:26.200
 janati pines the next session 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.420
 riding is planned in three 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.430
 weeks the time for our riders to 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.030
 to work well their posture before the 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.030
 next ride
