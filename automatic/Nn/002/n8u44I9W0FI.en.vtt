00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
talking or so about light and different

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.020 
talking or so about light and different
direction<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:04.410> think<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:04.890> first<00:02:05.190> idea<00:02:05.490> for<00:02:05.880> me

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
direction I think the first idea for me

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.000 
direction I think the first idea for me
was<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.450> look<00:02:06.600> through<00:02:06.870> a<00:02:06.930> diamond<00:02:07.620> and<00:02:07.770> you

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
was to look through a diamond and you

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.760 
was to look through a diamond and you
see<00:02:08.190> all<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.460> different<00:02:09.410> intensity<00:02:10.410> of

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
see all this different intensity of

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.830 
see all this different intensity of
light<00:02:10.800> there<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:11.760> some<00:02:11.940> element<00:02:12.090> who<00:02:12.570> comes

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
light there is some element who comes

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.080
