00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
and now you have the bushing all the way

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.580

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
loosen the clamp all the way you don't

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.469 
loosen the clamp all the way you don't
need<00:01:34.850> to<00:01:35.030> remove<00:01:35.390> it<00:01:35.630> you<00:01:37.060> want<00:01:38.060> to<00:01:38.150> use<00:01:38.270> the

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
need to remove it you want to use the

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.320 
need to remove it you want to use the
the<00:01:39.229> tailpipe<00:01:39.770> expander<00:01:40.430> and<00:01:40.550> you<00:01:41.060> want<00:01:41.240> to

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
the tailpipe expander and you want to

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.969 
the tailpipe expander and you want to
drop<00:01:41.510> it<00:01:41.690> all<00:01:41.870> the<00:01:42.080> way<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.229> about<00:01:42.740> that<00:01:42.920> point

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
drop it all the way to about that point

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:52.900 
drop it all the way to about that point
right<00:01:43.490> there<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:51.220> just<00:01:52.220> like<00:01:52.400> that<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:52.850> can

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
right there and just like that you can

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.070 
right there and just like that you can
see<00:01:53.150> the<00:01:53.270> little<00:01:53.979> little<00:01:54.979> metal<00:01:55.810> tools<00:01:56.810> are

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
see the little little metal tools are

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.410 
see the little little metal tools are
kind<00:01:57.380> of<00:01:57.500> lined<00:01:57.680> up<00:01:57.860> with<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.220> gaps<00:01:58.460> here<00:01:58.790> so

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
kind of lined up with the gaps here so

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.980 
kind of lined up with the gaps here so
you<00:01:59.479> have<00:01:59.600> a<00:01:59.720> gap<00:01:59.990> here<00:02:00.260> a<00:02:00.320> gap<00:02:00.560> here<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.990> go

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
you have a gap here a gap here and go

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.560 
you have a gap here a gap here and go
ahead<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.320> tighten<00:02:03.649> it<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:04.360> this<00:02:05.360> will

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
ahead and tighten it and this will

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.320 
ahead and tighten it and this will
expand<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:09.800> that's<00:02:10.160> about<00:02:10.489> as<00:02:10.790> much<00:02:10.820> as<00:02:11.209> you

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
expand and that's about as much as you

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.060 
expand and that's about as much as you
want<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.570> take<00:02:11.780> it<00:02:11.989> a<00:02:12.170> little<00:02:12.650> less<00:02:12.860> than<00:02:13.010> a

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
want to take it a little less than a

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:21.250 
want to take it a little less than a
quarter-inch<00:02:13.430> on<00:02:13.850> those<00:02:14.060> gaps<00:02:14.870> there<00:02:20.170> so<00:02:21.170> you

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
quarter-inch on those gaps there so you

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.930 
quarter-inch on those gaps there so you
need<00:02:21.380> see<00:02:21.650> though<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.780> new<00:02:23.780> bushing<00:02:24.790> drop<00:02:25.790> it

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
need see though the new bushing drop it

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.250 
need see though the new bushing drop it
right<00:02:25.970> in<00:02:26.270> sometimes<00:02:26.660> you<00:02:26.750> could<00:02:26.870> push<00:02:27.020> it<00:02:27.050> in

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
right in sometimes you could push it in

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.640 
right in sometimes you could push it in
with<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.560> palm<00:02:27.800> of<00:02:27.830> your<00:02:27.980> hand<00:02:32.260> these<00:02:33.260> two<00:02:33.470> go

tighten it too much and once you get

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.679 
tighten it too much and once you get
this<00:04:54.800> tighten<00:04:55.219> you<00:04:55.520> go<00:04:55.699> ahead<00:04:55.789> and<00:04:56.060> tighten
