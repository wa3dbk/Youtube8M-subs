00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
is just MERIS and she's actually not

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.390 
is just MERIS and she's actually not
very<00:04:17.709> good

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
whole fight she's 100% vulnerable to

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.850 
whole fight she's 100% vulnerable to
force<00:04:59.380> or<00:04:59.560> pulse<00:04:59.710> and<00:05:01.380> yeah<00:05:02.380> if<00:05:02.470> you<00:05:02.590> just<00:05:02.710> keep

force or pulse and yeah if you just keep

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.920 
force or pulse and yeah if you just keep
that<00:05:03.039> up<00:05:03.190> there's<00:05:03.520> there's<00:05:04.330> really<00:05:04.449> nothing

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
just a matter of practicing the timing

to use the lightning after that's

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.120 
to use the lightning after that's
probably<00:05:41.110> good<00:05:41.260> call<00:05:41.470> just<00:05:41.770> pretty<00:05:42.010> good
