because as you can see it doesn't always

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.140

dry evenly I've got this line here that

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.359 
dry evenly I've got this line here that
I'm<00:00:19.270> not<00:00:19.420> crazy<00:00:19.570> about<00:00:20.160> generally<00:00:21.160> what<00:00:21.340> I

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369

I'm not crazy about generally what I
what<00:00:22.090> I<00:00:22.119> do<00:00:22.240> instead<00:00:22.689> of<00:00:22.750> blow-drying<00:00:23.230> my

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
what I do instead of blow-drying my

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.810 
what I do instead of blow-drying my
paintings<00:00:23.830> to<00:00:23.890> have<00:00:24.279> them<00:00:24.430> dry<00:00:24.579> more<00:00:24.790> quickly

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
paintings to have them dry more quickly

paintings to have them dry more quickly
if<00:00:25.210> I<00:00:25.360> just<00:00:25.570> think<00:00:26.079> of<00:00:26.290> that<00:00:26.320> drying<00:00:26.800> time<00:00:27.070> as

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
if I just think of that drying time as

if I just think of that drying time as
my<00:00:27.340> thinking<00:00:27.730> time<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.880> gives<00:00:31.000> me<00:00:31.210> an

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
my thinking time it gives me an

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.569 
my thinking time it gives me an
opportunity<00:00:31.900> to<00:00:32.020> think<00:00:32.800> about<00:00:33.280> what<00:00:33.430> I'm

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
mixture a little bit mixed with new

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.149 
mixture a little bit mixed with new
gamboge<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.329> make<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:34.480> bit<00:02:34.659> of<00:02:34.750> an<00:02:34.840> orange<00:02:35.159> and

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
gamboge to make a bit of an orange and

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.500 
gamboge to make a bit of an orange and
touch<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.549> in<00:02:36.760> here<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.060> there<00:02:37.209> because

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
touch that in here and there because

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.170 
touch that in here and there because
it's<00:02:37.659> wet<00:02:37.870> it's<00:02:38.079> going<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.319> want<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.560> blend

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
it's wet it's going to want to blend

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.699 
it's wet it's going to want to blend
because<00:02:40.180> this<00:02:40.359> petal<00:02:40.689> is<00:02:40.780> under<00:02:41.049> this<00:02:41.200> one<00:02:41.439> I

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
because this petal is under this one I

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.800 
because this petal is under this one I
can<00:02:42.280> make<00:02:42.310> it<00:02:42.609> a<00:02:42.640> little<00:02:42.790> bit<00:02:42.970> darker<00:02:43.269> on<00:02:43.599> this

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
can make it a little bit darker on this

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.690 
can make it a little bit darker on this
side<00:02:44.079> and<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:46.569> other<00:02:46.720> thing<00:02:46.959> I<00:02:47.049> can<00:02:47.079> do<00:02:47.700> and

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
side and the other thing I can do and

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.770 
side and the other thing I can do and
this<00:02:48.879> is<00:02:49.090> you're<00:02:49.209> going<00:02:49.329> to<00:02:49.389> think<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.599> little

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
this is you're going to think a little

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.479 
this is you're going to think a little
bit<00:02:49.930> crazy<00:02:50.200> maybe<00:02:50.560> if<00:02:51.159> you're<00:02:51.310> new<00:02:51.459> to

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
bit crazy maybe if you're new to

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.729 
bit crazy maybe if you're new to
painting<00:02:52.030> is<00:02:52.209> I'm<00:02:53.200> going<00:02:53.409> to<00:02:53.470> grab<00:02:53.620> some

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
painting is I'm going to grab some

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.509 
painting is I'm going to grab some
purple<00:02:54.459> and<00:02:54.909> I<00:02:55.060> use<00:02:55.329> Windsor<00:02:55.720> violet<00:02:56.200> as<00:02:57.099> my

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
purple and I use Windsor violet as my

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.530 
purple and I use Windsor violet as my
purple<00:02:57.909> and<00:02:58.920> I'm<00:02:59.920> going<00:03:00.909> to<00:03:00.970> mix<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.239> little<00:03:01.269> bit

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
purple and I'm going to mix a little bit

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.759 
purple and I'm going to mix a little bit
of<00:03:01.629> that<00:03:01.689> in<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.930> corner<00:03:02.290> over<00:03:02.349> here<00:03:02.470> what

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
of that in the corner over here what

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.319 
of that in the corner over here what
happens<00:03:03.099> is<00:03:03.220> purple<00:03:03.579> is<00:03:03.670> a<00:03:03.700> compliment<00:03:04.269> to

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
happens is purple is a compliment to

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.539 
happens is purple is a compliment to
yellow<00:03:04.870> so<00:03:05.530> it's<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.769> opposite<00:03:06.220> of<00:03:06.310> yellow

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
yellow so it's the opposite of yellow

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.849 
yellow so it's the opposite of yellow
and<00:03:06.819> they<00:03:07.120> make<00:03:07.329> a<00:03:07.359> really<00:03:07.659> good<00:03:08.170> neutral<00:03:08.680> when

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
and they make a really good neutral when

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:09.690 
and they make a really good neutral when
they're<00:03:09.010> mixed<00:03:09.159> together

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
they're mixed together

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.949 
they're mixed together
and<00:03:10.269> so<00:03:10.750> it's<00:03:10.930> going<00:03:11.139> to<00:03:11.200> be<00:03:11.319> my<00:03:11.470> shadow<00:03:11.769> color

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
and so it's going to be my shadow color

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.240 
and so it's going to be my shadow color
ordinarily<00:03:13.959> you<00:03:14.200> might<00:03:14.349> think<00:03:14.590> of<00:03:14.709> blue<00:03:15.010> as

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
ordinarily you might think of blue as

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.039 
ordinarily you might think of blue as
being<00:03:15.489> a<00:03:15.579> shadow<00:03:15.819> color<00:03:16.180> if<00:03:16.599> you<00:03:16.780> want<00:03:16.959> to

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
being a shadow color if you want to

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.390 
being a shadow color if you want to
paint<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.319> shadow<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:17.739> would<00:03:17.950> use<00:03:18.129> blue

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
paint a shadow you would use blue

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.309 
paint a shadow you would use blue
problem<00:03:19.239> with<00:03:19.359> the<00:03:19.450> mixing<00:03:19.810> blue<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:20.200> yellow

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
problem with the mixing blue and yellow

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.460 
problem with the mixing blue and yellow
though<00:03:20.650> is<00:03:20.859> you<00:03:21.250> get<00:03:21.430> green<00:03:21.669> don't<00:03:21.970> you<00:03:22.379> so<00:03:23.379> I'm

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
though is you get green don't you so I'm

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.089 
though is you get green don't you so I'm
going<00:03:23.620> to<00:03:23.650> use<00:03:23.769> purple<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.310> make<00:03:24.430> my<00:03:24.609> shadows

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
going to use purple to make my shadows

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.580 
going to use purple to make my shadows
and<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:28.480> that<00:03:28.599> petal<00:03:28.930> I'm<00:03:29.049> going<00:03:29.169> to<00:03:29.230> leave<00:03:29.410> it

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
and so that petal I'm going to leave it

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.930 
and so that petal I'm going to leave it
I'm<00:03:29.799> not<00:03:30.160> going<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:30.370> paint<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:30.669> one<00:03:30.790> right

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
I'm not going to paint the one right

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.460 
I'm not going to paint the one right
beside<00:03:31.090> it<00:03:31.389> if<00:03:31.510> I<00:03:31.599> painted<00:03:31.930> them<00:03:32.079> side<00:03:32.260> by<00:03:32.290> side

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
beside it if I painted them side by side

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.949 
beside it if I painted them side by side
those<00:03:32.919> colors<00:03:33.220> would<00:03:33.400> bleed<00:03:33.699> the<00:03:34.569> other<00:03:34.690> thing

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
those colors would bleed the other thing

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.899 
those colors would bleed the other thing
I've<00:03:35.109> noticed<00:03:35.319> is<00:03:35.680> when<00:03:35.889> I<00:03:35.919> painting<00:03:36.430> petals

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:36.909 
I've noticed is when I painting petals

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.629 
I've noticed is when I painting petals
like<00:03:37.120> this<00:03:37.359> I<00:03:37.599> often<00:03:38.379> you'll<00:03:39.010> you'll<00:03:39.250> start<00:03:39.519> to

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
like this I often you'll you'll start to

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.819 
like this I often you'll you'll start to
refine<00:03:39.970> your<00:03:40.150> technique<00:03:40.329> as<00:03:40.750> you<00:03:40.780> go<00:03:41.079> so<00:03:41.709> if

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
refine your technique as you go so if

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.379 
refine your technique as you go so if
your<00:03:41.980> first<00:03:42.159> petal<00:03:42.459> is<00:03:42.669> here<00:03:42.970> and<00:03:43.090> your<00:03:43.180> last

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
your first petal is here and your last

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:44.759 
your first petal is here and your last
petal<00:03:43.690> is<00:03:43.870> here<00:03:44.109> and<00:03:44.230> you<00:03:44.319> work<00:03:44.470> all<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.680> way

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
petal is here and you work all the way

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.089 
petal is here and you work all the way
across<00:03:45.180> this<00:03:46.180> this<00:03:46.930> paddle<00:03:47.379> is<00:03:47.530> going<00:03:47.829> to<00:03:47.979> be

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
across this this paddle is going to be

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:49.619 
across this this paddle is going to be
your<00:03:48.280> beginner<00:03:48.790> petal<00:03:49.180> where<00:03:49.329> you're<00:03:49.419> kind<00:03:49.510> of

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
your beginner petal where you're kind of

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.210 
your beginner petal where you're kind of
learning<00:03:49.959> as<00:03:50.079> you<00:03:50.199> go<00:03:50.349> this<00:03:50.889> one's<00:03:51.099> probably

learning as you go this one's probably
going<00:03:51.489> to<00:03:51.549> be<00:03:51.669> one<00:03:51.760> of<00:03:51.879> your<00:03:52.000> best<00:03:52.180> ones

going to be one of your best ones

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.089 
going to be one of your best ones
because<00:03:53.079> right<00:03:53.229> about<00:03:53.409> here<00:03:53.650> you'll<00:03:53.799> start<00:03:54.010> to

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
because right about here you'll start to

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.589 
because right about here you'll start to
figure<00:03:54.220> it<00:03:54.430> out<00:03:54.549> and<00:03:54.729> you'll<00:03:55.090> see<00:03:55.150> the

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
figure it out and you'll see the

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.110 
figure it out and you'll see the
transformation<00:03:56.470> so<00:03:57.099> this<00:03:57.310> way<00:03:57.579> if<00:03:57.819> I<00:03:57.909> paint

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
transformation so this way if I paint

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.520 
transformation so this way if I paint
this<00:03:58.269> one<00:03:58.510> and<00:03:58.810> then<00:03:58.900> I'll<00:03:59.019> paint<00:03:59.199> this<00:03:59.379> one

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
this one and then I'll paint this one

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.099 
this one and then I'll paint this one
over<00:03:59.769> here<00:04:01.349> you'll<00:04:02.349> see<00:04:02.470> you'll<00:04:02.829> notice<00:04:03.280> that

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
over here you'll see you'll notice that

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.629 
over here you'll see you'll notice that
you<00:04:05.109> won't<00:04:05.290> notice<00:04:05.440> that<00:04:05.769> transformation

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
you won't notice that transformation

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.789 
you won't notice that transformation
because<00:04:07.109> you<00:04:08.109> know<00:04:08.229> it's<00:04:08.379> going<00:04:08.500> to<00:04:08.590> be<00:04:08.709> you're

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
because you know it's going to be you're

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.520 
because you know it's going to be you're
going<00:04:08.889> to<00:04:08.979> have<00:04:09.159> been<00:04:09.310> skipping<00:04:09.729> all<00:04:09.879> over<00:04:10.209> the

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
going to have been skipping all over the

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.909 
going to have been skipping all over the
all<00:04:11.530> over<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.949> page<00:04:12.930> all<00:04:13.930> over<00:04:14.199> the<00:04:14.319> flower<00:04:14.590> to

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:14.919 
all over the page all over the flower to

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:19.409 
all over the page all over the flower to
make<00:04:15.099> design<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:18.250> this<00:04:18.519> one<00:04:18.699> I<00:04:18.729> even<00:04:19.060> left<00:04:19.269> a

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
make design and this one I even left a

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.060 
make design and this one I even left a
little<00:04:19.690> spot<00:04:21.539> with<00:04:22.539> our<00:04:22.780> original<00:04:23.020> wash<00:04:23.710> of

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
little spot with our original wash of

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.170 
little spot with our original wash of
raw<00:04:25.029> Sienna<00:04:25.450> showing<00:04:25.810> through<00:04:26.050> I<00:04:27.180> should

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
raw Sienna showing through I should

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.940 
raw Sienna showing through I should
mention<00:04:28.360> too<00:04:28.810> that<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:29.139> raw<00:04:29.289> and<00:04:29.529> this<00:04:29.620> petals

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
mention too that the raw and this petals

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:30.749 
mention too that the raw and this petals
over<00:04:30.159> top<00:04:30.340> of<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.550> other

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
over top of the other

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.189 
over top of the other
so<00:04:31.029> I'm<00:04:31.150> not<00:04:31.300> going<00:04:31.449> to<00:04:31.509> even<00:04:31.719> add<00:04:31.839> a<00:04:31.870> lot<00:04:32.080> of

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
so I'm not going to even add a lot of

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:33.299 
so I'm not going to even add a lot of
shadow<00:04:32.379> to<00:04:32.469> it<00:04:32.620> I'm<00:04:32.740> just<00:04:32.770> going<00:04:32.949> to<00:04:33.039> leave<00:04:33.189> it

00:04:33.299 --> 00:04:33.309 
shadow to it I'm just going to leave it

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:35.369 
shadow to it I'm just going to leave it
this<00:04:33.939> is<00:04:34.120> only<00:04:34.270> our<00:04:34.479> first<00:04:34.509> layer<00:04:34.990> we're<00:04:35.259> going

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:35.379 
this is only our first layer we're going

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:37.529 
this is only our first layer we're going
to<00:04:35.439> do<00:04:35.559> a<00:04:35.589> couple<00:04:35.860> glazes<00:04:36.460> or<00:04:36.669> layers<00:04:37.150> on<00:04:37.509> our

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
to do a couple glazes or layers on our

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.709 
to do a couple glazes or layers on our
petals<00:04:37.960> and<00:04:38.699> I<00:04:39.699> should<00:04:39.909> mention<00:04:40.120> too<00:04:40.509> that

00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:40.719 
petals and I should mention too that

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:43.140 
petals and I should mention too that
this<00:04:41.469> butter<00:04:41.979> yellow<00:04:42.219> that<00:04:42.430> we<00:04:42.580> painted<00:04:42.969> with

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
this butter yellow that we painted with

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.480 
this butter yellow that we painted with
the<00:04:43.300> raw<00:04:43.479> Sienna<00:04:43.979> dried<00:04:44.979> a<00:04:45.009> little<00:04:45.129> bit

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
the raw Sienna dried a little bit

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.890 
the raw Sienna dried a little bit
lighter<00:04:45.729> than<00:04:45.879> we<00:04:46.120> originally<00:04:46.240> laid<00:04:46.719> it<00:04:46.870> down

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
lighter than we originally laid it down

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.360 
lighter than we originally laid it down
and<00:04:47.259> do<00:04:47.349> keep<00:04:47.559> that<00:04:47.589> in<00:04:47.770> mind<00:04:48.039> that<00:04:48.159> your

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
and do keep that in mind that your

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.670 
and do keep that in mind that your
watercolor<00:04:48.909> painting<00:04:49.419> will<00:04:50.110> dry<00:04:50.319> slightly

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
watercolor painting will dry slightly

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.249 
watercolor painting will dry slightly
lighter<00:04:51.069> not<00:04:51.639> a<00:04:51.669> huge<00:04:52.089> dramatic<00:04:52.779> difference

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
lighter not a huge dramatic difference

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.709 
lighter not a huge dramatic difference
but<00:04:53.949> slightly<00:04:54.219> different<00:04:54.699> slightly<00:04:55.270> lighter

00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:55.719 
but slightly different slightly lighter

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:58.529 
but slightly different slightly lighter
and<00:04:56.610> some<00:04:57.610> colors<00:04:57.939> you'll<00:04:58.120> notice<00:04:58.389> the

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
and some colors you'll notice the

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.149 
and some colors you'll notice the
distinct<00:04:59.199> in<00:04:59.409> more<00:04:59.559> than<00:04:59.710> others

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:00.159 
distinct in more than others

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:03.119 
distinct in more than others
and<00:05:00.870> I<00:05:01.870> kind<00:05:02.080> of<00:05:02.139> liked<00:05:02.349> leaving<00:05:02.770> that<00:05:02.860> little

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:03.129 
and I kind of liked leaving that little

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:04.860 
and I kind of liked leaving that little
spot<00:05:03.430> so<00:05:03.460> I'm<00:05:03.819> going<00:05:03.969> to<00:05:04.029> do<00:05:04.210> it<00:05:04.330> again<00:05:04.539> here

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
spot so I'm going to do it again here

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.929 
spot so I'm going to do it again here
there's<00:05:05.589> a<00:05:05.649> little<00:05:05.889> dot<00:05:06.039> of<00:05:06.069> straight<00:05:06.460> cadmium

00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:06.939 
there's a little dot of straight cadmium

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:09.749 
there's a little dot of straight cadmium
red<00:05:07.589> some<00:05:08.589> more<00:05:08.740> straight<00:05:09.069> cadmium<00:05:09.550> red

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 
red some more straight cadmium red

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.820 
red some more straight cadmium red
because<00:05:10.689> it's<00:05:10.839> wet<00:05:11.020> it's<00:05:11.229> just<00:05:11.379> going<00:05:11.469> to<00:05:11.529> mix

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
because it's wet it's just going to mix

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.790 
because it's wet it's just going to mix
so<00:05:12.430> it's<00:05:12.550> not<00:05:12.639> going<00:05:12.819> to<00:05:12.879> be<00:05:12.939> quite<00:05:13.180> so

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
so it's not going to be quite so

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.469 
so it's not going to be quite so
brilliant<00:05:15.569> kind<00:05:16.569> of<00:05:16.689> like<00:05:16.839> that

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
brilliant kind of like that

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.639 
brilliant kind of like that
now<00:05:19.479> I'm<00:05:19.599> just<00:05:19.689> going<00:05:19.839> to<00:05:19.930> continue<00:05:20.110> to<00:05:20.499> move

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:20.649 
now I'm just going to continue to move

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:32.430 
now I'm just going to continue to move
let's<00:05:21.069> do<00:05:21.279> one<00:05:21.399> over<00:05:21.610> here

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:26.940 
here's a look a little bit at these

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.330 
here's a look a little bit at these
petals<00:07:27.210> now<00:07:27.570> in<00:07:27.750> this<00:07:27.870> first<00:07:28.170> layer<00:07:28.410> stage<00:07:28.800> I'm

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:29.340 
petals now in this first layer stage I'm

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.830 
petals now in this first layer stage I'm
going<00:07:29.490> to<00:07:29.580> continue<00:07:29.880> to<00:07:30.120> paint<00:07:30.330> all<00:07:30.540> the<00:07:30.660> ones

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:30.840

going to continue to paint all the ones
around<00:07:31.080> here<00:07:31.260> and<00:07:31.590> allow<00:07:32.310> them<00:07:32.520> to<00:07:32.550> dry<00:07:32.820> we've

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:33.540 
around here and allow them to dry we've

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.600 
around here and allow them to dry we've
got<00:07:33.780> a<00:07:33.810> lot<00:07:34.050> of<00:07:34.080> subtle<00:07:34.500> color<00:07:34.740> we<00:07:35.220> don't<00:07:35.430> have

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:35.610 
got a lot of subtle color we don't have

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.670 
got a lot of subtle color we don't have
a<00:07:35.640> lot<00:07:35.880> of<00:07:35.910> crisp<00:07:36.300> lines<00:07:36.630> few<00:07:37.050> little<00:07:37.320> streaks

a lot of crisp lines few little streaks

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.430 
a lot of crisp lines few little streaks
where<00:07:37.890> I<00:07:37.950> left<00:07:38.220> this<00:07:39.180> raw<00:07:39.690> Sienna<00:07:40.080> to<00:07:40.230> show

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.440 
where I left this raw Sienna to show

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.380 
where I left this raw Sienna to show
through<00:07:40.740> for<00:07:41.430> the<00:07:41.520> most<00:07:41.700> part<00:07:42.000> everything<00:07:42.180> is

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:42.390 
through for the most part everything is
