with<00:00:54.250> the<00:00:54.430> two<00:00:54.640> engines<00:00:54.820> you<00:00:55.480> can<00:00:55.660> make

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.160 

compact<00:01:00.280> engine<00:01:02.670> which<00:01:03.670> are<00:01:03.940> slightly<00:01:04.449> bigger

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
compact engine which are slightly bigger

dispenser rich is really useful for one
of<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:21.969> my<00:01:22.149> car<00:01:22.420> and<00:01:22.689> this<00:01:23.109> is<00:01:23.409> probably<00:01:23.590> the

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
of the my car and this is probably the

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:30.089 
of the my car and this is probably the
most<00:01:23.889> expensive<00:01:24.880> thing<00:01:26.399> to<00:01:27.399> build<00:01:27.609> in<00:01:27.969> the<00:01:29.099> in

most expensive thing to build in the in
the<00:01:30.159> mind<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:30.880> that<00:01:31.659> the<00:01:31.840> mining<00:01:32.200> gadget<00:01:32.700> you

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
the mind and that the mining gadget you

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.309 
the mind and that the mining gadget you
build<00:01:34.479> it<00:01:34.719> but<00:01:35.109> during<00:01:35.649> an<00:01:35.770> X<00:01:36.179> and<00:01:37.179> placing<00:01:38.139> a

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
build it but during an X and placing a

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.839 
build it but during an X and placing a
dumb<00:01:38.649> pickups<00:01:39.249> and<00:01:40.179> a<00:01:40.419> dot<00:01:41.159> diamond<00:01:42.159> shovel

dumb pickups and a dot diamond shovel

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:50.099 
dumb pickups and a dot diamond shovel
like<00:01:43.539> so<00:01:44.099> you<00:01:45.099> get<00:01:45.310> a<00:01:45.340> mining<00:01:45.789> gadget<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.840> next

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109 
like so you get a mining gadget the next

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:55.729 
like so you get a mining gadget the next
thing<00:01:50.229> you<00:01:50.349> would<00:01:50.469> want<00:01:50.590> to<00:01:50.739> build<00:01:50.979> is<00:01:51.249> a
