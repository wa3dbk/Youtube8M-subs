00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.640
 hello to all the guys we do today 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:09.610
 today I will show you a simple tutorial in 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.670
 which it is possible to light a fire with 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.299
 a can is a piece of non-chocolate 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.059
 believe it 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.890
 instead it is possible I will try to give 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.580
 a little educational imprint to the 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.220
 project because I also participate e 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.760
 I believe in the Italian aid project 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:31.330
 created by science for fun that I will leave you 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.079
 here the link to go to view the 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.760
 his channel but you can just write 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.730
 hashtag and youtube italia to find 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.090
 many other videos that are proposed as 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.760
 educational channels and try to give a 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.590
 something more to the youtube platform 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.200
 it seemed a little strange to me 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.789
 light a fire with the dwarf wing and or of 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.699
 a piece of chocolate but actually it is 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:57.340
 very simple the fundamental part for 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:00.100
 carry out this experience the fund 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.680
 in fact, as you can see 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.239
 to a parabola form 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.240
 this is the principle of mirrors 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.979
 the legend tells of the son of 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.560
 Syracuse in which Archimedes invented a 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.390
 system to burn Roman ships but 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.759
 I refer you to the break channel the mysteries 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.340
 which is a channel that treats very well 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.930
 historical events and I invite you to ask 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.470
 he some more information a 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.020
 about 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.090
 as you see the bottom of the can one 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.159
 form very similar to these mirrors 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.680
 parabolic dishes that are used for 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.970
 light baits and the like 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.740
 and it is precisely this form that 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.479
 we will use, however, first we need 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.320
 of the chocolate that is fundamental in 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.600
 this process 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.390
 if you notice the aluminum in this part 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.729
 it is not polished, in fact it is opaque and brushed 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.770
 our job is to polish it 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.250
 up to make the background a mirror 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.140
 take the chocolate and rub it 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.810
 then clean the part with a piece of 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.000
 clean cloth 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.969
 repeat the process until you do 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.950
 you will have a reflective surface yes 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.659
 could also use of the municipality 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.299
 toothpaste or abrasive paste 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.520
 because both have an abrasive power 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.590
 and polishing the next thing to 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.050
 get us are very common sheets of 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.290
 especially few newspaper 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.600
 black in fact the black color is 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.660
 fundamental to speed up the 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.270
 process you can tell me why it is a 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.960
 black sheet burns earlier than a 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.110
 White sheet 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.500
 write it in the comments or go to 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.060
 see you speak science channel e 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.050
 ask him for sure he will know 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.760
 answer 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.040
 now to start worn a nice pair 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.620
 of sunglasses not to disturb 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.730
 too much sight and let's start with the part 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.230
 funny 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.330
 the next step is to 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.610
 direct the can towards the sun 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.530
 moving the hand at certain points 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.690
 to observe what the point of 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.000
 fire what we will have to go to 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.430
 to do is to bend ours in several parts 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.680
 piece of paper as already mentioned 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:02.650
 preferably black and look for the point 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.500
 of fire moving it until it does 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.690
 we will see the maximum concentration of the 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.600
 sun that will be represented by a 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.800
 little dot if we would have done everything 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.900
 correctly 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.180
 we will see that after a while the piece of paper 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.130
 will start smoking means the point 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.890
 fire is the right one and we will have to 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.040
 wait a while before you start smoking 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.640
 get warm enough 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.959
 but how does he really develop the 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.579
 fire 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.890
 we must keep in mind the triangle of 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:36.370
 fire that is very important 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.560
 or to trigger a combustion 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.120
 we need the fuel that the 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.980
 our piece of paper 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.439
 the source of ignition that our heat 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.900
 and the comburent in fact after we will have to 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:49.209
 take the piece of paper and wave it 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.069
 gently to give him some 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.769
 oxygen 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.650
 then just take this piece 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:59.829
 of paper and insert it inside a 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.379
 little bit of dry straw or at least some 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:05.680
 dry grass is fine the important thing is 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.689
 that heat is increased by closing it 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.480
 maybe in my hands I recommend you do 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:12.370
 be careful not to burn and later 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.069
 we will only have to blow gently 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.500
 until we see a lot of smoke coming out 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:20.079
 when we have achieved a good deal of 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.180
 smoke it will suffice us to blow very strong and 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.539
 we will see the actual lighting up 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.250
 fire 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.830
 I can assure you that it will take a while 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.440
 little time but if the outside temperature 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.720
 and adequate and very strong sun 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.060
 especially in summer you will have fun 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.860
 much to perform this link experience 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.680
 or even the experiment of danger doc which 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.710
 he really did well he realized 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:45.060
 a giant burning mirror with 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:48.360
 inside a series of many mirrors 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.680
 which all lead to a single point 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.330
 the idea of ​​this great rock video 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.010
 with and b 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.220
 I suggest you go and see her 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.419
 channel realized think more than 100 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.490
 alternative methods to turn on a 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.800
 fire something fantastic 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.990
 in addition I leave you also the indication to 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.010
 green power science carts he has 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.300
 also realized on the experience 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:13.870
 trying to light a boat in 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:17.260
 miniature with following what is 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.259
 history of the siege of syracuse 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.870
 I hope you enjoyed this video and 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:27.090
 what to say see you next time 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.090
 hello guys a greeting from ludwig
