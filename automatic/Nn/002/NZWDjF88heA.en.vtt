00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200

every other style but the spear style is
really<00:00:54.470> slow<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:55.070> it<00:00:55.160> can<00:00:55.280> feel<00:00:55.430> clunky<00:00:55.940> at

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
really slow and it can feel clunky at

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.100 
really slow and it can feel clunky at
times<00:00:56.240> if<00:00:56.480> you're<00:00:56.600> just<00:00:56.750> doing<00:00:56.870> normal

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
times if you're just doing normal

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.380 
times if you're just doing normal
attacks<00:00:57.620> with<00:00:57.830> square<00:00:58.130> the<00:00:58.490> Partizan's<00:00:59.000> quite

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
attacks with square the Partizan's quite

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.030 
attacks with square the Partizan's quite
a<00:00:59.420> bit<00:00:59.630> quicker<00:00:59.960> and<00:01:00.260> it's<00:01:00.410> also<00:01:00.560> got<00:01:00.830> a<00:01:00.860> lot

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
a bit quicker and it's also got a lot

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.800 
a bit quicker and it's also got a lot
more<00:01:01.070> damage<00:01:01.430> and<00:01:01.790> a<00:01:01.850> lot<00:01:02.000> better<00:01:02.180> parry<00:01:02.540> than

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
more damage and a lot better parry than

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:03.970 
more damage and a lot better parry than
all<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.050> other<00:01:03.170> Spears<00:01:03.560> so<00:01:03.740> it<00:01:03.830> definitely

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
all the other Spears so it definitely

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.649 
all the other Spears so it definitely
lessens<00:01:04.549> all<00:01:04.729> of<00:01:04.850> those<00:01:04.909> negatives<00:01:05.420> that<00:01:05.509> I

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
lessens all of those negatives that I

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.480 
lessens all of those negatives that I
was<00:01:05.750> mentioning<00:01:05.960> you<00:01:06.409> can<00:01:06.650> also<00:01:06.770> upgrade<00:01:07.070> this

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
was mentioning you can also upgrade this

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.850 
was mentioning you can also upgrade this
spear<00:01:07.729> to<00:01:07.909> have<00:01:08.000> an<00:01:08.150> extra<00:01:08.509> 25%<00:01:09.290> damage<00:01:09.500> which

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
spear to have an extra 25% damage which

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.680 
spear to have an extra 25% damage which
is<00:01:09.890> what<00:01:10.130> I've<00:01:10.280> done<00:01:10.549> and<00:01:10.970> it<00:01:11.090> does<00:01:11.270> make<00:01:11.510> it<00:01:11.540> a

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
is what I've done and it does make it a

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.780 
is what I've done and it does make it a
really<00:01:12.020> formidable<00:01:12.320> weapon<00:01:12.950> it<00:01:13.130> is<00:01:13.460> a<00:01:13.550> lot<00:01:13.760> of

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
really formidable weapon it is a lot of

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.580 
really formidable weapon it is a lot of
fun<00:01:14.030> to<00:01:14.150> use<00:01:14.330> like<00:01:14.570> I<00:01:14.690> said<00:01:14.900> before<00:01:15.050> so<00:01:15.350> I<00:01:15.409> would

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
fun to use like I said before so I would

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.050 
fun to use like I said before so I would
recommend<00:01:16.100> getting<00:01:16.310> it<00:01:16.520> especially<00:01:16.850> if

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
recommend getting it especially if

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.060 
recommend getting it especially if
you've<00:01:17.180> already<00:01:17.330> got<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.780> heavy<00:01:17.930> Falcon<00:01:18.590> the

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
you've already got the heavy Falcon the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.220 
you've already got the heavy Falcon the
sword<00:01:19.370> of<00:01:19.520> Eden<00:01:19.909> and<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:20.330> rifle<00:01:20.750> as<00:01:20.870> well<00:01:20.900> I

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
sword of Eden and the rifle as well I

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.570 
sword of Eden and the rifle as well I
definitely<00:01:21.620> still<00:01:21.740> think<00:01:21.980> the<00:01:22.040> rifle<00:01:22.400> is<00:01:22.460> the

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
definitely still think the rifle is the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.070 
definitely still think the rifle is the
best<00:01:22.790> gun<00:01:22.970> in<00:01:23.150> the<00:01:23.210> game<00:01:23.300> as<00:01:23.659> far<00:01:23.840> as<00:01:23.960> all<00:01:24.050> the

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
best gun in the game as far as all the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.899 
best gun in the game as far as all the
ones<00:01:24.320> that<00:01:24.500> I've<00:01:24.620> used<00:01:24.650> although<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.670> sword

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
ones that I've used although the sword

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.610 
ones that I've used although the sword
of<00:01:26.000> Eden<00:01:26.300> is<00:01:26.450> still<00:01:26.659> probably<00:01:26.960> my<00:01:27.110> favorite

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
of Eden is still probably my favorite

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.380 
of Eden is still probably my favorite
