congenital disorder trauma disease

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.009 
congenital disorder trauma disease
infection<00:00:11.250> that<00:00:11.550> stops<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.630> bones<00:00:12.809> from

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
infection that stops the bones from

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.259 
infection that stops the bones from
growing<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.590> proper<00:00:13.980> length<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.969> current

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
growing to the proper length the current

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.849 
growing to the proper length the current
procedure<00:00:15.420> for<00:00:15.900> doing<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.529> called

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
procedure for doing that is called

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.429 
procedure for doing that is called
linear<00:00:17.100> distraction<00:00:17.940> we<00:00:18.600> are<00:00:18.750> team<00:00:18.960> break<00:00:19.260> and

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
linear distraction we are team break and

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.380 
linear distraction we are team break and
make<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.890> break<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.400> mate<00:00:20.490> comes<00:00:20.760> from<00:00:21.060> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
make and break and mate comes from the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.810 
make and break and mate comes from the
process<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:22.140> making<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.800> bone<00:00:22.920> longer<00:00:23.310> you

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
process of making the bone longer you

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.490 
process of making the bone longer you
surgically<00:00:24.210> fracture<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.930> break<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.350> and

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
surgically fracture it you break it and

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.870 
surgically fracture it you break it and
then<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.710> make<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:25.949> longer<00:00:26.160> by<00:00:26.609> slowly

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
then you make it longer by slowly

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.970 
then you make it longer by slowly
pulling<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.330> apart<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:28.320> our<00:00:28.470> team<00:00:28.619> brake<00:00:28.830> and

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
pulling it apart so our team brake and

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.040 
pulling it apart so our team brake and
make<00:00:29.099> our<00:00:29.250> team<00:00:29.429> BAM<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.000> we<00:00:30.480> were<00:00:30.630> working<00:00:30.779> to

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
make our team BAM and we were working to

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.500 
make our team BAM and we were working to
improve<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.679> currently<00:00:31.980> existing<00:00:32.790> device

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
improve the currently existing device

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.959 
improve the currently existing device
for<00:00:33.989> completing<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:34.770> procedure<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.760> our

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
for completing this procedure so our

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.479 
for completing this procedure so our
nomination<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:37.050> improve<00:00:37.620> after<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
nomination is to improve after the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.670 
nomination is to improve after the
device<00:00:38.790> put<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:40.079> actually<00:00:40.440> automate

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
device put on it to actually automate

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.490 
device put on it to actually automate
the<00:00:41.219> whole<00:00:41.460> destruction<00:00:42.390> process<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.050> to

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
the whole destruction process and to

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.529 
the whole destruction process and to
actually<00:00:43.620> create<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> force<00:00:44.579> feedback<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.390> is

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
actually create a force feedback that is

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.869 
actually create a force feedback that is
actually<00:00:46.079> customized<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> personal<00:00:47.610> growth

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
actually customized to a personal growth

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.639 
actually customized to a personal growth
of<00:00:48.090> each<00:00:48.210> patient<00:00:48.660> okay<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.350> what<00:00:49.530> you're

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
of each patient okay so what you're

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.410 
of each patient okay so what you're
seeing<00:00:49.829> here<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.489> what<00:00:51.239> we're

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
seeing here is this is what we're

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.229 
seeing here is this is what we're
modeling<00:00:51.750> as<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.020> leg<00:00:52.350> bone<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.399> say<00:00:54.030> this

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
modeling as a leg bone and so say this

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.389 
modeling as a leg bone and so say this
leg<00:00:54.510> bone<00:00:54.690> were<00:00:55.020> shorter<00:00:55.559> than<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.890> other<00:00:56.100> of

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
leg bone were shorter than the other of

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.660 
leg bone were shorter than the other of
your<00:00:56.820> two<00:00:56.969> legs<00:00:57.180> you'd<00:00:57.780> want<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.680> do<00:00:59.579> this

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
your two legs you'd want to do this

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.369 
your two legs you'd want to do this
procedure<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:00.359> called<00:01:00.600> distraction

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
procedure and it's called distraction

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.170 
procedure and it's called distraction
osteogenesis<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:02.280> basically<00:01:02.609> that's<00:01:02.820> just

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
osteogenesis but basically that's just

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.509 
osteogenesis but basically that's just
to<00:01:03.600> make<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.930> leg<00:01:04.140> longer<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
to make the leg longer so that it's the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.760 
to make the leg longer so that it's the
same<00:01:05.670> length<00:01:05.880> as<00:01:06.030> your<00:01:06.119> other<00:01:06.330> one<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.439> what

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
same length as your other one so what

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.109 
same length as your other one so what
they<00:01:07.890> do<00:01:07.950> now<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.490> they'll<00:01:08.640> start<00:01:08.760> with<00:01:08.970> this

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
they do now is they'll start with this

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.080 
they do now is they'll start with this
bone<00:01:09.360> they'll<00:01:09.900> drill<00:01:10.229> these<00:01:10.350> pins<00:01:10.710> here<00:01:11.220> into

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
bone they'll drill these pins here into

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.880 
bone they'll drill these pins here into
the<00:01:12.210> bone<00:01:12.390> like<00:01:12.930> you'd<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.350> like<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.710> see

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
the bone like you'd see like you see

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.530 
the bone like you'd see like you see
here<00:01:14.130> they<00:01:14.280> drill<00:01:14.549> them<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.060> then<00:01:15.360> they'll

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
here they drill them in and then they'll

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.330 
here they drill them in and then they'll
put<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:15.900> frame<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.500> they'll<00:01:16.770> attach<00:01:17.070> this

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
put this frame and they'll attach this

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.399 
put this frame and they'll attach this
in<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.790> part<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.360> that's<00:01:18.930> what<00:01:19.140> they<00:01:19.229> have

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
in this part and that's what they have

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.609 
in this part and that's what they have
now<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.920> they'll<00:01:20.670> use<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> wrench<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:22.110> turn

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
now and they'll use a wrench to turn

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.950 
now and they'll use a wrench to turn
this<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.189> that'll<00:01:23.700> slowly<00:01:24.030> slowly<00:01:24.390> separate

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
this and that'll slowly slowly separate

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.440 
this and that'll slowly slowly separate
these<00:01:25.140> two<00:01:25.380> pieces<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.460> bone<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
these two pieces of the bone and the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.550 
these two pieces of the bone and the
bone<00:01:27.630> grows<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.590> between<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.579> gap<00:01:29.820> so

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
bone grows in in between in this gap so

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.679 
bone grows in in between in this gap so
what<00:01:31.560> we've<00:01:31.829> done<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.340> we've<00:01:33.000> created<00:01:33.210> an

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
what we've done is we've created an

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.380 
what we've done is we've created an
automated<00:01:34.439> device<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.790> uses<00:01:36.060> these

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
automated device that uses these

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.359 
automated device that uses these
components<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.079> they<00:01:37.229> use<00:01:37.350> already<00:01:37.560> but

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
components that they use already but

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.999 
components that they use already but
added<00:01:38.700> some<00:01:38.880> extra<00:01:39.030> parts<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:40.140> make<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.380> to

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
added some extra parts to make it to

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.830 
added some extra parts to make it to
basically<00:01:41.520> improve<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.090> process<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.720> goes

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
basically improve the process so it goes

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.109 
basically improve the process so it goes
faster<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:44.040> will<00:01:44.280> take<00:01:44.460> less<00:01:44.610> time<00:01:44.850> and

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
faster and it will take less time and

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.109 
faster and it will take less time and
take<00:01:45.270> cost<00:01:46.020> less<00:01:46.649> money<00:01:46.950> for<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.460> patient<00:01:47.820> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
take cost less money for the patient and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.880 
take cost less money for the patient and
for<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.750> patient's<00:01:49.170> insurance<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.680> for<00:01:49.799> the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
for the patient's insurance and for the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.700 
for the patient's insurance and for the
hospital<00:01:50.070> as<00:01:50.430> well<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.450> what<00:01:52.020> we<00:01:52.049> have<00:01:52.259> here<00:01:52.290> is

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
hospital as well so what we have here is

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.950 
hospital as well so what we have here is
the<00:01:52.950> original<00:01:53.040> device<00:01:53.670> mounted<00:01:54.540> in<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.780> bone

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
the original device mounted in the bone

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.020 
the original device mounted in the bone
and<00:01:55.170> then<00:01:55.259> we've<00:01:55.470> added<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:56.070> part<00:01:56.280> here<00:01:56.610> this

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
and then we've added this part here this

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.340 
and then we've added this part here this
is<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> motor<00:01:57.509> which<00:01:58.259> when<00:01:58.950> turned<00:01:59.250> on<00:02:00.170> you<00:02:01.170> can

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
is a motor which when turned on you can

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.440 
is a motor which when turned on you can
see<00:02:01.500> now<00:02:01.619> it's<00:02:01.770> turning<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:02.969> instead<00:02:03.390> of

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
see now it's turning so this instead of

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.380 
see now it's turning so this instead of
using<00:02:03.719> your<00:02:03.899> hand<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.649> screw<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.579> just<00:02:06.090> to

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
using your hand and a screw to just to

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.089 
using your hand and a screw to just to
open<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.810> up<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.200> stretch<00:02:07.469> this<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.950> to

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
open this up to stretch this and to

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.400 
open this up to stretch this and to
stretch<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.580> bone<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.509> motor<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.989> now<00:02:10.140> doing

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
stretch the bone the motor is now doing

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.650 
stretch the bone the motor is now doing
that<00:02:10.560> automatically<00:02:11.150> this<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.209> doing<00:02:12.540> it

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
that automatically this is doing it

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.490 
that automatically this is doing it
about

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
about

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.170 
about
five<00:02:13.590> thousand<00:02:14.190> times<00:02:14.370> faster<00:02:14.700> than<00:02:15.060> you

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
five thousand times faster than you

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.120 
five thousand times faster than you
would<00:02:15.240> actually<00:02:15.660> do<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:15.840> on<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.140> person<00:02:16.590> but

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
would actually do this on a person but

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.560 
would actually do this on a person but
it's<00:02:17.280> just<00:02:17.460> so<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:17.820> you<00:02:17.940> can<00:02:18.060> see<00:02:18.240> right<00:02:18.420> now

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
it's just so that you can see right now

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.630 
it's just so that you can see right now
how<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.050> works<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.650> motors<00:02:19.920> going<00:02:20.100> and<00:02:20.340> going

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
how it works the motors going and going

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.120 
how it works the motors going and going
and<00:02:20.760> then<00:02:20.970> if<00:02:21.210> it<00:02:21.420> gets<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:22.410> be<00:02:22.530> going<00:02:22.710> too<00:02:22.890> fast

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
and then if it gets to be going too fast

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.950 
and then if it gets to be going too fast
to<00:02:23.700> where<00:02:23.880> it's<00:02:24.060> doing<00:02:24.330> damage<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.750> your

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
to where it's doing damage to your

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.140 
to where it's doing damage to your
nerves<00:02:25.350> or<00:02:25.710> your<00:02:26.190> muscles<00:02:26.550> or<00:02:26.700> your<00:02:26.730> tendons

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
nerves or your muscles or your tendons

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.380 
nerves or your muscles or your tendons
around<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.720> bone<00:02:27.900> it'll<00:02:29.060> automatically<00:02:30.060> shut

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
around the bone it'll automatically shut

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.060 
around the bone it'll automatically shut
off<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.690> motor<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.110> it'll<00:02:31.320> stop<00:02:31.620> stretching

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
off the motor and it'll stop stretching

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.500 
off the motor and it'll stop stretching
the<00:02:32.280> bone<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:32.610> it<00:02:32.730> doesn't<00:02:32.940> do<00:02:33.000> any<00:02:33.120> damage<00:02:33.330> and

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
the bone so it doesn't do any damage and

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.090 
the bone so it doesn't do any damage and
you<00:02:33.600> don't<00:02:33.780> have<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.020> go<00:02:34.140> back<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.709> get

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
you don't have to go back and and get

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.410 
you don't have to go back and and get
another<00:02:35.310> surgery<00:02:35.700> or<00:02:35.850> something<00:02:36.120> like<00:02:36.209> that

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
another surgery or something like that

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.780 
another surgery or something like that
it<00:02:36.690> was<00:02:36.900> an<00:02:37.200> amazing<00:02:37.620> opportunity<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:38.430> didn't

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
it was an amazing opportunity I didn't

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.460 
it was an amazing opportunity I didn't
even<00:02:38.880> know<00:02:39.060> about<00:02:39.180> this<00:02:39.450> problem<00:02:39.750> existing

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
even know about this problem existing

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.500 
even know about this problem existing
before<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:40.980> heard<00:02:41.370> about<00:02:41.490> this<00:02:41.700> project<00:02:41.880> got<00:02:42.360> to

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
before I heard about this project got to

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.110 
before I heard about this project got to
work<00:02:42.660> on<00:02:42.990> it<00:02:43.400> we<00:02:44.400> had<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.580> opportunity<00:02:45.000> to

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
work on it we had the opportunity to

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.660 
work on it we had the opportunity to
meet<00:02:45.240> some<00:02:45.480> patients<00:02:46.050> who<00:02:46.140> are<00:02:46.230> undergoing

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
meet some patients who are undergoing

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.550 
meet some patients who are undergoing
limb<00:02:47.670> lengthening<00:02:48.060> in<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.540> process<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.350> see

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
limb lengthening in the process and see

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.650 
limb lengthening in the process and see
the<00:02:49.680> device<00:02:49.950> on<00:02:50.160> them<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.580> talk<00:02:50.730> about<00:02:50.760> how<00:02:51.540> it

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
the device on them and talk about how it

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.510 
the device on them and talk about how it
was<00:02:51.780> changing<00:02:51.810> their<00:02:52.350> lives<00:02:52.680> we<00:02:53.280> were<00:02:53.400> also

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
was changing their lives we were also

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.600 
was changing their lives we were also
able<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.880> do<00:02:54.120> some<00:02:54.540> animal<00:02:54.900> testing<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:56.459> got

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
able to do some animal testing and I got

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.170 
able to do some animal testing and I got
to<00:02:56.730> learn<00:02:56.880> all<00:02:57.510> sorts<00:02:57.840> of<00:02:58.230> things<00:02:58.290> about

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
to learn all sorts of things about

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.210 
to learn all sorts of things about
biomechanics<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.989> electrical<00:03:01.770> engineering

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
biomechanics and electrical engineering

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.190 
biomechanics and electrical engineering
and<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:02.910> really<00:03:03.150> opened<00:03:03.420> up<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.600> whole<00:03:03.750> new<00:03:03.780> an

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
and it really opened up a whole new an

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.870 
and it really opened up a whole new an
aspect<00:03:05.010> of<00:03:05.250> what<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.459> could<00:03:05.550> do<00:03:05.730> with<00:03:05.820> my

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
aspect of what I could do with my

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:14.540 
aspect of what I could do with my
engineering<00:03:06.390> degree

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.610
