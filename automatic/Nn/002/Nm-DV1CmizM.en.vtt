 cents the cost per piece of 20 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.670

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.769
 it's 40 cents either the cost and the 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.810

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.600
 that weighs 30 grams and is 55 cents 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.250
 exactly and as soon as they are sold 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:43.220

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:43.220
 granite cost and 35 pesos 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:58.170

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.520
 marble table and why so that the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.190
