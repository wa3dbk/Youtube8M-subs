00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
not particularly good anymore and he

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.070 
not particularly good anymore and he
wants<00:00:14.130> his<00:00:14.820> character<00:00:15.299> just<00:00:15.480> be<00:00:15.630> tweaked<00:00:15.990> a

small<00:00:17.820> minor<00:00:18.330> changes<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.080> hopefully<00:00:20.010> that

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
small minor changes and hopefully that

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.290 
small minor changes and hopefully that

anything<00:01:27.920> as<00:01:28.100> well<00:01:28.250> jumps<00:01:31.119> dashes<00:01:32.119> that<00:01:32.299> could

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
anything as well jumps dashes that could

anything as well jumps dashes that could
be<00:01:32.539> quite<00:01:32.659> useful<00:01:33.039> just<00:01:34.039> torn<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:34.520> dash

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439

apparently it's a really good anti air
oh<00:01:38.259> it's<00:01:39.259> a<00:01:39.289> reasonable<00:01:39.710> and<00:01:39.829> here<00:01:40.659> so<00:01:41.659> let's

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
oh it's a reasonable and here so let's
