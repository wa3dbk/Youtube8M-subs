00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.420
hi I'm Joe wiesenfelder from cars com

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.530
the King has returned for 2008 that's
the king ranch version of the ford

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.330
expedition full size SUV

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.410
the King Ranch is now the highest trim
level above the Eddie Bauer and limited

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.530
there's been some increased interest in
the expedition recently and that's

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.070
because the chevy tahoe its main
competitor has been redesigned recently

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.580
it's a very strong car but its
reliability hasn't been that good

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.109
I'm starting in the third row seat for a
good reason and that's because it's

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:37.149
probably this model's biggest advantage

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.629
I'm six feet tall I'm completely
comfortable in here

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.729
aside from being a little narrower in
terms of the overall vehicles with the

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:49.960
dimensions are all better in this and
they are in the chevy tahoe and actually

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.499
can't think of many vehicles and have
his room the third row seat is this even

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:55.329
though there are more on the market than
ever

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.510
also I like the way the second row seats
work to make it easy to get in and out

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.309
of the third row now

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.850
I also like the execution here the head
restraints pop down one step to fold one

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.320
step to raise

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.800
that's pretty standard but what I
especially like is it's so easy to put

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.730
back down

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.180
this version of the truck has two
captains chairs here instead of the

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.910
three seat bench that is standard

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.690
these are a little bit narrow where is
the center armrest always good

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.400
my leg room is decent not great though
the driver's seat is all the way back

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.900
a great feature that standard on the
king ranch powered running boards

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.160
you'll watch this they come on down at
my height

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.610
this is still a pretty high step so it's
good to have running boards

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.570
the reason that these come down aside
from being really cool is when they're

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.230
permanent they tend to decrease your
ground clearance and such

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.670
you want to have them but you don't want
to limiting you in any way in terms of

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.020
the interior quality

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.530
bear in mind that this is a king ranch
edition King Ranch is not a salad

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.159
dressing

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.360
it's an actual ranch

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.470
oddly enough if you were to buy a truck
like this to use on an actual ranch

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.620
this is probably the last one you would
get with the exception of the seats

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.520
which are this relatively high quality
orangish brownish leather

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.890
I think things look pretty decent here
the main short coming is in the touch

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.320
things are relatively hard

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.340
pretty much everywhere the glove
compartment is inexcusably small and the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.790
door pockets are relatively small and
actually kind of hard to get to

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.570
along the seats another great feature is
the backup camera

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.890
the image when you put the transmission
in Reverse comes up on the rearview

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.489
mirror itself which is nice because you
get the reflection in the mirror you get

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.260
the image behind you

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.220
this is a standalone option it's under
five hundred dollars you don't have to

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.850
get the navigation system which
typically will cost you about two grand

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.480
in any car and sometimes it comes with a
backup camera sometimes you pay more on

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.290
top of it

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.380
we are people who want the safety
without the frills of navigation can pay

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.600
a few hundred bucks and get it

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.130
so those the tie might be a stronger
vehicle overall it is comparable the

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.790
tahoe might be a little bit classier
inside it has better fuel economy too

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:05.989
much for gallon city

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.260
one mile per gallon highway but if
you're concerned about reliability

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.250
this model has been doing better it's
definitely worth checking out

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.680
