00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.270
 And then okay, how are you? Thank you . 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.589
 today I show my apps 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.690
 again in making this video because the 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.570
 other the quality is very poor and 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.099
 because some time has passed and I 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.440
 I wanted to show my 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.330
 applications you ask me a lot for me 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.460
 tell me how I say my pictures then 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.470
 in that I also teach continue 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.420
 watching the video here I'll give you tips 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.820
 for you apps that I do not use 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.060
 also but I know it's very good 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.180
 for example the fmi light a lot of people 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.550
 Like the light up because you can create the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.610
 You can make your own 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.420
 itself its own filter then it is 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.399
 super good off the light but I prefer the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.710
 risk though that is what I use 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.930
 always a while ago i started to 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.180
 leave my instagram all white 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.360
 because I wanted him to stay all over 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.920
 that in all of Korea, the modinha that is 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.920
 so you 're also recording everything 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.739
 so people here limit a lot 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.720
 I could not take a photo where I was because 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.400
 no white wall could not take 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.680
 picture of something because it had no 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.680
 white wall what the background was white 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.500
 So I said not enough, I do not want more 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.720
 now i will have the colorful instagram and the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.560
 way I now like in instagram're 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.580
 so then now it is so it is 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.049
 with the gray background and a little blue that 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.420
 I 'm doing it for my luck. 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.060
 stay like this since always I use 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.000
 only three applications is the risk 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.310
 You want to pay and I do all this here. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.200
 I use the three bridge fact is this 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.810
 application here he is to do 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.580
 mounts and collages in photos 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.370
 that is you click here 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:52.460
 So you choose the photo you want. 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:56.330
 I chose here, let's assume two photos 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.270
 my with him two photos of my step 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.290
 Here he comes and creates two photos in 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.360
 One only there is where you come, choose where 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.030
 Do you want to put the photos? 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.250
 so that's basically what I use here 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.420
 in the midi photo is just to do the assembly 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.970
 two photos 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.180
 already on a trip is when he has just taken 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.700
 photo I correct wake up photo by 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.690
 I'm going to take a picture here now from 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.690
 my scenery for you 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:30.640
 I have aviary open fault and here I go 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.370
 Correct her color, I'll do it here. 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.800
 increase brightness or decrease brightness 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.100
 contrast - contrast or more contrast 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.810
 more shadowed - health shadow more 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.150
 shade or less shade 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.330
 After I did this I open the 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.930
 my aviar near mazinho entered the photo 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.900
 and they will play the effect the people effect it 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.300
 that I use the most and if the 6 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.440
 this is the only effect I use or 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.370
 when I want to leave the photo more 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.239
 populated 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:05.660
 I like it good game the effect on the whole 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:08.000
 I have here in configurations of a 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.130
 brightness of the moment in brightness 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.200
 this usually I do 9 area then 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.690
 here I am showing that you also have 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.120
 the options and here I always play the 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:21.170
 A little colder temperature I put 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.930
 always a blue one ready, my photo is 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.640
 edited is really easy to edit 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.320
 Photos I've never changed applications 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.940
 because when I usually 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.970
 I do not like to change things 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.360
 I always like having the same options 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.430
 now beginning with other applications 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.550
 the application that I really like 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:44.420
 Music is the claim be youtube is this 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:48.270
 application here was this old 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:52.480
 here then this is the old 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:55.360
 which does not exist anymore but still remains 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.060
 my songs here and this is the new one 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.850
 the same thing i do not know why they changed 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.730
 But this is the same thing in this 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.930
 application you can is to search for music 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.870
 whatever you want 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.060
 she searches directly from youtube because 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:14.520
 she stays here in history and you always 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.520
 can listen to music because it is saved O 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.360
 so always stay safe 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.450
 the only problem is that there is a lot of memory 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.090
 because they are downloaded because the 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.410
 applications continues the same thing here 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.410
 the translator 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.360
 I use a lot google translator the 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.110
 facebook messenger 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.660
 the safari songs that come to youtube 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.180
 obviously always have to have here are 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.670
 my three photo apps 1 on 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.450
 stroke is to know who follows who does not 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.120
 can 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.580
 skype i always use tumblr ama 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.100
 that this application is mine. 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.340
 Samsung to connect my camera to 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.660

 that already comes in the phone itself and I 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.110
 I always leave in that first room 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.270
 My salary is well organized. 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.940
 I do not have much is like the pictures 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.860
 photos are also not well organized 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.480
 I like having lots of pasta and I do not like 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.970
 leave a lot of photo on the cell phone that goes 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.190
 a lot of memory and down here I leave
