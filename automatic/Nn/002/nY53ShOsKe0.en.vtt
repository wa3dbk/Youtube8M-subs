00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
we didn't really have time to google it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.580 
we didn't really have time to google it
like<00:01:54.210> because<00:01:54.630> they<00:01:54.750> start<00:01:55.020> teaching<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.470> up

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
like because they start teaching it up

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.230 
like because they start teaching it up
like<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.070> us<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.430> told<00:01:56.520> us<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.729> concept<00:01:57.149> right

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.910 
like to us and told us the concept right
away<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.570> then<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:57.719> learn<00:01:57.869> choreo<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.439> they

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
away and then we learn choreo so they

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.139 
away and then we learn choreo so they
just<00:01:59.130> told<00:01:59.280> us<00:01:59.340> exactly<00:01:59.460> what<00:01:59.880> they<00:02:00.000> were

just told us exactly what they were
looking<00:02:00.180> for<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.840> then<00:02:00.869> over<00:02:01.439> time<00:02:01.649> we

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
looking for and then over time we

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.859 
looking for and then over time we
develop<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.579> characters<00:02:03.119> yeah<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:03.600> you'd<00:02:03.719> say

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
develop the characters yeah so you'd say

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.179 
develop the characters yeah so you'd say
your<00:02:04.020> character<00:02:04.170> developed<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.770> little<00:02:05.009> more

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
your character developed a little more

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.459 
your character developed a little more
over<00:02:05.520> time<00:02:05.549> yeah<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.570> cuz<00:02:06.899> we<00:02:07.049> had<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.320> like

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
over time yeah it cuz we had to like

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.900 
over time yeah it cuz we had to like
focus<00:02:07.829> on<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.039> movement<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.610> then<00:02:08.700> we<00:02:08.789> would

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
focus on the movement and then we would

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.490 
focus on the movement and then we would
fall<00:02:09.090> out<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.209> character<00:02:09.660> such<00:02:09.869> was<00:02:10.020> not<00:02:10.259> easy

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
fall out a character such was not easy

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.070 
fall out a character such was not easy
yeah<00:02:10.770> not<00:02:11.009> easy<00:02:11.190> at<00:02:11.400> all<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.910> then<00:02:12.209> once<00:02:12.930> we

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
yeah not easy at all and then once we
