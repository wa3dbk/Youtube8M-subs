last<00:00:01.260> time<00:00:01.500> when<00:00:01.800> a<00:00:01.860> village

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:03.429 
last time when a village

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:06.090 
last time when a village
the<00:00:03.909> we've<00:00:04.450> got<00:00:04.630> some<00:00:04.840> scoring<00:00:05.170> up<00:00:05.710> and<00:00:05.979> down

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.100 
the we've got some scoring up and down

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:17.770 
the we've got some scoring up and down
scoring

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:17.780 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.220 

you<00:00:18.780> ticked<00:00:19.410> off<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.860> fuel<00:00:20.279> pump<00:00:20.990> not<00:00:21.990> sure<00:00:22.140> if

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
you ticked off the fuel pump not sure if

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.839 
you ticked off the fuel pump not sure if
it<00:00:22.320> got<00:00:22.410> damaged<00:00:22.860> in<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.070> accident<00:00:23.100> or<00:00:23.640> not

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:23.849 
it got damaged in the accident or not

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.330 
it got damaged in the accident or not
but<00:00:24.330> we<00:00:24.510> know<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.720> tweaked<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.830> little<00:00:26.010> bit

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
but we know that tweaked a little bit

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.480 
but we know that tweaked a little bit
we're<00:00:27.029> replacing<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.660> with<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.840> high-volume

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
we're replacing it with a high-volume

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.190 
we're replacing it with a high-volume
mechanical<00:00:29.490> fuel<00:00:29.730> pump<00:00:30.050> so<00:00:31.050> we're<00:00:31.170> just

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
mechanical fuel pump so we're just

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.359 
mechanical fuel pump so we're just
getting<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.619> off<00:00:31.710> getting<00:00:31.919> it<00:00:32.070> out<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.220> the<00:00:32.279> way

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
getting it off getting it out of the way

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.380 
getting it off getting it out of the way
since<00:00:32.669> we're<00:00:32.790> tearing<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.120> engine

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
since we're tearing the engine

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.639 
since we're tearing the engine
completely<00:00:33.780> down<00:00:33.930> anyway<00:00:36.440> these<00:00:37.440> are<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
completely down anyway these are the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.550 
completely down anyway these are the
engine<00:00:38.100> mounts<00:00:38.430> right<00:00:38.610> here<00:00:39.410> let's<00:00:40.410> take

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.560 
engine mounts right here let's take

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.830 
engine mounts right here let's take
those<00:00:40.770> off<00:00:41.010> both<00:00:41.280> sides

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.110 

those<00:00:44.379> are<00:00:44.559> called<00:00:44.710> lifters<00:00:45.190> we're<00:00:45.789> gonna<00:00:45.910> put

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
those are called lifters we're gonna put

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.079 
those are called lifters we're gonna put
these<00:00:46.210> at<00:00:47.399> room<00:00:48.399> right<00:00:48.579> put<00:00:49.120> them<00:00:49.210> in<00:00:49.300> here<00:00:51.089> why

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.089 
these at room right put them in here why

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:53.639 
these at room right put them in here why
are<00:00:52.149> they<00:00:52.420> magnetized<00:00:52.960> yes

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
are they magnetized yes

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.880 
are they magnetized yes
oh<00:00:53.800> hey<00:00:54.489> like<00:00:54.670> that<00:00:54.820> neck<00:00:55.030> roll<00:00:55.239> I<00:00:55.769> can<00:00:56.769> turn

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
oh hey like that neck roll I can turn

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:04.899 
oh hey like that neck roll I can turn
the<00:00:57.010> motor<00:00:57.160> over

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.230 

an<00:01:05.600> awesome<00:01:05.960> job<00:01:06.280> she's<00:01:07.280> taking<00:01:07.729> the<00:01:07.880> crank

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
an awesome job she's taking the crank

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.670 
an awesome job she's taking the crank
pulley<00:01:08.479> off<00:01:10.840> and<00:01:11.840> then<00:01:12.079> we're<00:01:12.380> gonna<00:01:12.469> take<00:01:12.619> the

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
pulley off and then we're gonna take the

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.950 
pulley off and then we're gonna take the
harmonic<00:01:13.159> balancer<00:01:13.189> off<00:01:13.729> after<00:01:14.060> that<00:01:14.210> if<00:01:14.869> you

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
harmonic balancer off after that if you

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.630 
harmonic balancer off after that if you
put<00:01:15.140> a<00:01:15.170> belt<00:01:15.439> on<00:01:15.560> here<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:15.829> belt<00:01:15.979> is<00:01:16.159> this<00:01:16.369> wide

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
put a belt on here the belt is this wide

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.959 
put a belt on here the belt is this wide
it<00:01:17.180> would<00:01:17.390> not<00:01:17.810> fit<00:01:18.079> down<00:01:18.259> into<00:01:18.470> that<00:01:18.649> groove

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:18.969 
it would not fit down into that groove

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:27.249 
it would not fit down into that groove
so<00:01:19.969> we<00:01:20.060> got<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.270> get<00:01:20.329> a<00:01:20.420> new<00:01:20.509> pulley<00:01:25.960> yep

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
so we got to get a new pulley yep

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.270 
so we got to get a new pulley yep
hold<00:01:28.100> it<00:01:28.189> back<00:01:28.340> we<00:01:29.210> are<00:01:29.299> hooking<00:01:29.810> up<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.530> polar

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
hold it back we are hooking up the polar

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.350 
hold it back we are hooking up the polar
the<00:01:31.880> harmonic<00:01:32.420> balance<00:01:33.110> balancer<00:01:33.979> puller<00:01:34.360> to

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
the harmonic balance balancer puller to

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.749 
the harmonic balance balancer puller to
get<00:01:35.509> that<00:01:35.659> off<00:01:35.840> so<00:01:36.789> once<00:01:37.789> we<00:01:37.880> get<00:01:37.970> it<00:01:38.090> set<00:01:38.330> up

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
get that off so once we get it set up

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:56.499 
get that off so once we get it set up
easy-peasy<00:01:40.759> it<00:01:41.149> should<00:01:41.330> come<00:01:41.450> right<00:01:41.479> off

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:10.139 

don't<00:01:57.509> lift<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.780> up<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:57.990> off

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.630 

face<00:02:10.929> it<00:02:11.140> we<00:02:12.299> are<00:02:13.299> taking<00:02:13.720> off<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.140> center

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
face it we are taking off the center

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.220 
face it we are taking off the center
main<00:02:15.640> cap<00:02:15.970> this<00:02:16.629> is<00:02:16.689> what<00:02:16.930> holds<00:02:17.049> the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
main cap this is what holds the

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.559 
main cap this is what holds the
crankshaft<00:02:17.530> in<00:02:17.920> place<00:02:18.269> we're<00:02:19.269> going<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.450> take

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
crankshaft in place we're going to take

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.059 
crankshaft in place we're going to take
it<00:02:19.689> off<00:02:19.840> we're<00:02:20.019> gonna<00:02:20.110> put<00:02:20.290> plastic<00:02:20.650> age<00:02:20.799> in<00:02:20.980> it

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
it off we're gonna put plastic age in it

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.250 
it off we're gonna put plastic age in it
just<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.340> get<00:02:21.430> an<00:02:21.549> idea<00:02:21.970> before<00:02:22.720> we<00:02:22.959> tear<00:02:23.140> the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
just to get an idea before we tear the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.350 
just to get an idea before we tear the
whole<00:02:23.349> thing<00:02:23.560> apart<00:02:23.879> are<00:02:24.879> we<00:02:25.000> gonna<00:02:25.150> need

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
whole thing apart are we gonna need

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.229 
whole thing apart are we gonna need
bearings<00:02:25.840> main<00:02:26.349> bearings<00:02:26.909> it's<00:02:27.909> got<00:02:28.060> some

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
bearings main bearings it's got some

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.990 
bearings main bearings it's got some
grooves<00:02:28.510> in<00:02:28.750> we're<00:02:29.439> gonna<00:02:29.530> feel<00:02:29.799> it<00:02:30.010> feel

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
grooves in we're gonna feel it feel

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.149 
grooves in we're gonna feel it feel
right<00:02:31.180> there<00:02:31.379> so<00:02:32.379> there's<00:02:32.560> some<00:02:32.769> grooving

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
right there so there's some grooving

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:37.679 
right there so there's some grooving
going<00:02:33.939> on<00:02:35.459> my<00:02:36.459> guess<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:37.090> we're<00:02:37.450> going<00:02:37.569> to

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
going on my guess is we're going to

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.500 
going on my guess is we're going to
either<00:02:37.750> have<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:37.989> turn<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.319> crank<00:02:38.470> or<00:02:39.480> get<00:02:40.480> a

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
either have to turn the crank or get a

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
either have to turn the crank or get a
new

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.710 

okay<00:02:52.100> there's<00:02:52.760> our<00:02:52.880> plastic<00:02:53.330> age<00:02:53.480> right<00:02:53.750> there

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.110 

it's<00:02:59.080> actually<00:02:59.500> within<00:02:59.680> spec<00:03:00.130> it's<00:03:00.400> in<00:03:00.580> within

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
it's actually within spec it's in within

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.910 
it's actually within spec it's in within
mm

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.110 

with<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.430> grooves<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.000> feel<00:03:07.790> on<00:03:08.790> there

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
with the grooves that I feel on there

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.280 
with the grooves that I feel on there
I'm<00:03:09.660> thinking<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:11.660> yeah<00:03:12.720> bearings<00:03:13.200> are

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
I'm thinking that yeah bearings are

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.620 
I'm thinking that yeah bearings are
cheap<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.800> mean<00:03:14.160> you're<00:03:14.340> this<00:03:14.490> far<00:03:14.730> apart<00:03:14.880> like

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
cheap I mean you're this far apart like

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.060 
cheap I mean you're this far apart like
yeah<00:03:15.780> we<00:03:15.900> could<00:03:16.050> slap<00:03:16.350> it<00:03:16.530> back<00:03:16.650> together<00:03:16.830> and

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
yeah we could slap it back together and
