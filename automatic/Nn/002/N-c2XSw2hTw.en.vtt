00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
how to replace the phone brake pads on

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.980 
how to replace the phone brake pads on
your<00:00:06.960> Honda<00:00:07.919> Civic<00:00:08.450> this<00:00:09.450> one<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.870> 8th

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
your Honda Civic this one is the 8th

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.820 
your Honda Civic this one is the 8th
generation<00:00:10.849> so<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.120> same<00:00:12.300> from<00:00:12.620> 2006<00:00:13.620> and

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
generation so is the same from 2006 and

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.039 
generation so is the same from 2006 and
to<00:00:14.000> 2011<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.120> think<00:00:15.360> it's<00:00:15.509> even<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.870> same

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
to 2011 I think it's even the same

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.170 
to 2011 I think it's even the same
procedure<00:00:16.470> for<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:17.010> older<00:00:17.279> generation<00:00:17.310> but<00:00:17.970> I

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
procedure for the older generation but I

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.750 
procedure for the older generation but I
cannot<00:00:18.480> confirm<00:00:18.869> for<00:00:19.230> sure<00:00:19.439> so<00:00:20.369> what<00:00:20.550> we<00:00:20.640> need

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760

cannot confirm for sure so what we need
to<00:00:20.789> do<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.300> need<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.480> go<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.990> side

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
to do is you need to go to the side

we're doing the right side folks but

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.040 
we're doing the right side folks but
both<00:00:25.019> sides<00:00:25.320> are<00:00:25.560> identical<00:00:26.660> those<00:00:27.660> are<00:00:27.900> the

clean this one with sandpaper your will
will<00:01:09.570> slide<00:01:09.930> back<00:01:10.200> on<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.619> hub<00:01:10.830> with<00:01:11.070> no

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
will slide back on the hub with no

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.260 
will slide back on the hub with no
problem<00:01:11.640> at<00:01:11.820> all

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
problem at all

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.560 
problem at all
so<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.409> brake<00:01:13.619> pad<00:01:13.890> right<00:01:14.220> here<00:01:14.299> first<00:01:15.299> thing

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
so the brake pad right here first thing

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.690 
so the brake pad right here first thing
that<00:01:15.720> we<00:01:15.900> need<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.290> do<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:17.159> need<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.430> stick<00:01:17.670> a

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
that we need to do is we need to stick a

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.940 
that we need to do is we need to stick a
big<00:01:17.970> screwdriver<00:01:18.600> between<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.229> caliper<00:01:19.740> and

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
big screwdriver between the caliper and

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.140 
big screwdriver between the caliper and
the<00:01:20.040> disc<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:21.590> just<00:01:22.590> by<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> little<00:01:23.220> bit<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:23.909> it

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
the disc and just by a little bit so it

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.840 
the disc and just by a little bit so it
pulls<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.259> piston<00:01:25.740> back<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.460> way<00:01:26.670> we

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
pulls the piston back and that way we

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.670 
pulls the piston back and that way we
would<00:01:26.970> have<00:01:27.180> enough<00:01:27.479> room<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.810> put<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.439> new

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
would have enough room to put the new

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.539 
would have enough room to put the new
brakes<00:01:29.610> on<00:01:30.500> next<00:01:31.500> thing<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.740> we<00:01:32.070> need<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.280> do

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
brakes on next thing that we need to do

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.910 
brakes on next thing that we need to do
right<00:01:33.210> here<00:01:33.479> there<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.900> two<00:01:34.170> bolts<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
right here there is two bolts on the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.030 
right here there is two bolts on the
back<00:01:35.070> with<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> 12<00:01:35.759> millimeter<00:01:36.030> socket<00:01:36.960> we<00:01:37.860> need

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
back with a 12 millimeter socket we need

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
back with a 12 millimeter socket we need
to<00:01:38.159> take<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.640> one

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.420 

and<00:01:45.060> say<00:01:45.540> spin<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.620> is<00:01:46.830> a<00:01:46.950> nineteen

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
and say spin this is a nineteen

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.450 
and say spin this is a nineteen
millimeter<00:01:48.120> or<00:01:48.900> the<00:01:49.140> bags<00:01:49.350> we<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:49.950> hold<00:01:50.220> to

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
millimeter or the bags we can hold to

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.120 
millimeter or the bags we can hold to
the<00:01:50.550> nine-millimeter<00:01:51.450> duty<00:01:52.260> say<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.800> they

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
the nine-millimeter duty say that they

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.200 
the nine-millimeter duty say that they
stink<00:01:53.690> up<00:01:55.490> time<00:01:56.490> stand<00:01:57.000> still

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.410 

and<00:01:59.660> now<00:02:00.050> the<00:02:00.110> whole<00:02:00.470> caliper<00:02:01.190> comes<00:02:02.180> right

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
and now the whole caliper comes right

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.770 
and now the whole caliper comes right
off<00:02:02.830> if<00:02:03.830> you<00:02:04.220> can<00:02:04.430> see<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.700> caliper<00:02:05.300> and<00:02:05.540> this

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
off if you can see the caliper and this

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.650 
off if you can see the caliper and this
