00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:07.519 

so<00:00:05.819> this<00:00:06.029> segment<00:00:06.270> I<00:00:06.540> call<00:00:06.750> keeping<00:00:07.170> it<00:00:07.260> in<00:00:07.380> the

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
so this segment I call keeping it in the

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.480 
so this segment I call keeping it in the
pocket<00:00:07.740> and<00:00:08.450> really<00:00:09.450> it's<00:00:09.960> it's<00:00:10.320> about<00:00:10.590> the

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
pocket and really it's it's about the

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.930 
pocket and really it's it's about the
groove<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:13.130> start<00:00:14.130> off<00:00:14.219> by<00:00:14.400> playing<00:00:14.610> something

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
groove I start off by playing something

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.950 
groove I start off by playing something
I've<00:00:15.030> actually<00:00:15.150> set<00:00:15.630> up<00:00:16.369> set<00:00:17.369> up<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.610> delay<00:00:17.939> on

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.340 

the<00:00:21.960> with<00:00:22.350> my<00:00:22.560> pedal<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.430> I've<00:00:23.850> got<00:00:24.350> even

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
the with my pedal so that I've got even

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.800 
the with my pedal so that I've got even
though<00:00:25.699> it<00:00:26.699> doesn't<00:00:26.910> sound<00:00:27.269> like<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.630> when<00:00:27.779> I

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
though it doesn't sound like it when I

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.740 
though it doesn't sound like it when I
stopped<00:00:28.170> when<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.830> just<00:00:29.070> picked<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.430> note<00:00:29.750> that

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
stopped when I just picked the note that

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.890 
stopped when I just picked the note that
when<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:30.930> stopped<00:00:31.289> playing<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.680> groove<00:00:32.900> it's

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
when I stopped playing the groove it's

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.299 
when I stopped playing the groove it's
one<00:00:34.199> two<00:00:34.320> three<00:00:34.530> one<00:00:34.680> two<00:00:34.830> three<00:00:34.860> one<00:00:35.040> two

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
one two three one two three one two

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.100 
one two three one two three one two
three<00:00:35.370> one<00:00:35.519> it's<00:00:35.820> like<00:00:35.910> setting<00:00:36.300> up<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.630> triplet

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
three one it's like setting up a triplet

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:57.619 
three one it's like setting up a triplet
feel<00:00:53.750> and<00:00:55.309> that<00:00:56.309> kind<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.610> builds<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
feel and that kind of builds in the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.680 
feel and that kind of builds in the
groove<00:00:57.930> -<00:00:58.289> -<00:00:58.500> when<00:00:58.649> I'm<00:00:58.770> playing<00:00:59.300> without<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
groove - - when I'm playing without the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.850 
groove - - when I'm playing without the
delay<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:02.039> will<00:01:04.940> i'd<00:01:05.940> have<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.619> i'd<00:01:07.619> have<00:01:07.830> to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
delay on it will i'd have to i'd have to

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.070 
delay on it will i'd have to i'd have to
actually<00:01:08.310> kind<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.549> physically<00:01:09.090> play<00:01:09.390> those

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
actually kind of physically play those

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.600 
actually kind of physically play those
triplets<00:01:10.650> but<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:10.979> one<00:01:11.100> two<00:01:11.220> three<00:01:11.250> one<00:01:11.580> two

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
triplets but it's one two three one two

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.580 
triplets but it's one two three one two
three<00:01:11.760> it's<00:01:12.030> like<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.180> shuffle<00:01:12.630> field<00:01:13.070> and<00:01:14.510> that

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
three it's like a shuffle field and that

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.980 
three it's like a shuffle field and that
keeping<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.920> pocket<00:01:17.130> keeping

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
keeping it in the pocket keeping

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.749 
keeping it in the pocket keeping
consistent<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.710> groove<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.460> having

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
consistent to the groove and and having

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.160 
consistent to the groove and and having
a<00:01:20.820> delay<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.659> kind<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.960> cool

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
a delay like that is kind of cool

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.630 
a delay like that is kind of cool
because<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.770> gives<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:25.520> kind<00:01:26.520> of

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
because it gives you a kind of

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.609 
because it gives you a kind of
mechanical<00:01:27.240> way<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.630> keeping<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.380> consistent

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
mechanical way of keeping it consistent

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.820 
mechanical way of keeping it consistent
but<00:01:29.580> but<00:01:30.030> just<00:01:30.240> keeping<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.259> groove<00:01:31.530> going

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
but but just keeping that groove going

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.210 
but but just keeping that groove going
so<00:01:32.580> that<00:01:32.850> if<00:01:33.180> I'm<00:01:33.810> I'm<00:01:34.049> playing<00:01:34.409> let's<00:01:34.619> say<00:01:34.890> you

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
so that if I'm I'm playing let's say you

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.469 
so that if I'm I'm playing let's say you
know<00:01:35.340> let's<00:01:35.759> say<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> reggae<00:01:36.329> thing<00:01:41.479> let's

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
know let's say a reggae thing let's

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:55.850 
know let's say a reggae thing let's
smooth<00:01:43.229> out<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.590> sound<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.920> bit<00:01:53.149> and<00:01:54.680> really<00:01:55.680> my

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
smooth out the sound a bit and really my

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:07.400 
smooth out the sound a bit and really my
machine<00:01:56.280> there<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.640> my<00:01:56.970> right<00:01:57.180> hand

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.690 

alright<00:02:08.410> let's<00:02:08.590> say<00:02:08.739> I've<00:02:08.860> got<00:02:09.009> a<00:02:09.039> jazz<00:02:09.310> feel

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
alright let's say I've got a jazz feel

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:30.330 
alright let's say I've got a jazz feel
going<00:02:10.149> on<00:02:28.019> again<00:02:29.019> it's<00:02:29.230> it's<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.650> mechanical

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
going on again it's it's the mechanical

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.190 
going on again it's it's the mechanical
part<00:02:30.610> of<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:30.880> is<00:02:31.030> what<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.630> right<00:02:31.810> hand<00:02:32.080> is

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
part of it is what the right hand is

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.170 
part of it is what the right hand is
doing<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.890> there's<00:02:33.190> all<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.700> harmonic

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
doing and there's all the the harmonic

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.820 
doing and there's all the the harmonic
information<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.380> you<00:02:36.370> notice<00:02:36.819> here<00:02:37.209> that

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
information and you notice here that

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.979 
information and you notice here that
what<00:02:38.830> I'm<00:02:38.950> doing<00:02:39.250> is<00:02:39.400> is<00:02:39.580> using<00:02:40.000> those<00:02:40.600> kinds

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
what I'm doing is is using those kinds

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.430 
what I'm doing is is using those kinds
of<00:02:41.049> three<00:02:41.350> note<00:02:41.590> chords<00:02:42.130> so<00:02:42.519> like<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:43.150> G<00:02:43.840> major

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
of three note chords so like a a G major

sometimes the role of the rhythm guitar

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.330 
sometimes the role of the rhythm guitar
might<00:03:28.600> be<00:03:28.780> nothing<00:03:29.170> more<00:03:29.410> than<00:03:29.739> you<00:03:30.010> know

there's an acoustic guitar playing and

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.070 
there's an acoustic guitar playing and
it<00:03:38.220> might<00:03:38.430> be<00:03:38.460> one<00:03:38.850> two<00:03:39.380> one<00:03:40.380> two<00:03:40.860> one<00:03:41.250> two<00:03:42.240> one

it might be one two one two one two one
two<00:03:43.860> one<00:03:44.240> two<00:03:45.260> you<00:03:46.260> know<00:03:46.380> so<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:47.430> it's<00:03:47.820> a

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
two one two you know so the it's a

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.230 
two one two you know so the it's a
rhythm<00:03:48.210> part<00:03:48.770> but<00:03:49.770> it's<00:03:49.950> not<00:03:50.250> a<00:03:50.460> consistent

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
rhythm part but it's not a consistent

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.800 
rhythm part but it's not a consistent
rhythm<00:03:51.930> part<00:03:52.320> it's<00:03:52.560> an<00:03:52.740> accented<00:03:53.460> part<00:03:53.810> three

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
rhythm part it's an accented part three

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.830 
rhythm part it's an accented part three
one<00:03:55.290> two<00:03:55.740> three<00:03:56.010> or<00:03:56.490> it<00:03:56.790> might<00:03:56.970> be<00:03:57.060> one<00:03:57.330> two

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
one two three or it might be one two

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.410 
one two three or it might be one two
three<00:03:58.350> one<00:03:58.740> but<00:03:59.550> whatever<00:04:00.000> it<00:04:00.270> is<00:04:00.390> it's<00:04:00.900> it's

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
three one but whatever it is it's it's

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.970 
three one but whatever it is it's it's
placing<00:04:03.420> an<00:04:03.540> accent<00:04:04.020> in<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.350> place<00:04:04.590> where<00:04:04.830> it's

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
placing an accent in a place where it's

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.340 
placing an accent in a place where it's
adding<00:04:05.460> information<00:04:05.720> to<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.840> overall

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
adding information to the overall

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.540 
adding information to the overall
texture<00:04:09.020> you<00:04:10.020> know<00:04:10.110> in<00:04:10.320> a<00:04:10.410> rock<00:04:10.650> context<00:04:11.340> let's

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
texture you know in a rock context let's

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:35.339 
texture you know in a rock context let's
say<00:04:12.350> let<00:04:13.350> me<00:04:13.470> get<00:04:13.650> some<00:04:14.030> some<00:04:15.709> some<00:04:16.709> crank

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:39.100 

and<00:04:36.349> in<00:04:37.069> rock<00:04:37.400> in<00:04:37.610> particular<00:04:37.940> you<00:04:38.660> get<00:04:38.900> what<00:04:39.080> I

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
and in rock in particular you get what I

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:46.960 
and in rock in particular you get what I
call<00:04:39.199> rhythm<00:04:39.710> riffs<00:04:39.979> which<00:04:40.910> is<00:04:41.090> where<00:04:45.970> where

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
call rhythm riffs which is where where

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.360 
call rhythm riffs which is where where
there's<00:04:47.180> a<00:04:47.270> rhythm<00:04:47.509> guitar<00:04:47.960> part<00:04:48.229> but<00:04:48.590> it<00:04:48.830> kind

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
there's a rhythm guitar part but it kind

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.620 
there's a rhythm guitar part but it kind
of<00:04:49.430> builds<00:04:49.699> a<00:04:50.539> riff<00:04:51.410> into<00:04:51.860> it<00:04:52.039> so<00:04:52.699> that<00:04:52.970> it

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
of builds a riff into it so that it

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.469 
of builds a riff into it so that it
becomes<00:04:53.949> the<00:04:54.949> driving<00:04:55.220> force<00:04:55.699> of<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:56.000> song<00:04:56.240> I

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
becomes the driving force of the song I

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:09.550 
becomes the driving force of the song I
mean<00:05:06.220> and<00:05:07.220> you<00:05:07.400> see<00:05:07.639> I'm<00:05:07.759> using<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.509> the<00:05:09.259> right

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
mean and you see I'm using the the right

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.300 
mean and you see I'm using the the right
hand<00:05:10.210> mutes<00:05:11.210> the<00:05:11.840> left<00:05:12.110> hand<00:05:12.440> choke<00:05:12.830> and

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
hand mutes the left hand choke and

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.749 
hand mutes the left hand choke and
throwing<00:05:14.180> it<00:05:14.680> throwing<00:05:15.680> in<00:05:15.800> some<00:05:16.069> single

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
throwing it throwing in some single

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:20.260 
throwing it throwing in some single
lines<00:05:17.000> two<00:05:17.530> single<00:05:18.530> notes<00:05:18.860> just<00:05:19.310> you<00:05:19.520> know<00:05:19.639> to

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
lines two single notes just you know to

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.059 
lines two single notes just you know to
create<00:05:20.690> part<00:05:20.990> of<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:21.199> texture<00:05:21.680> because

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:22.069 
create part of the texture because

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:24.640 
create part of the texture because
otherwise<00:05:22.990> yeah<00:05:23.990> I<00:05:24.020> could<00:05:24.259> do<00:05:24.349> that<00:05:24.500> in

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
otherwise yeah I could do that in

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:25.540 
otherwise yeah I could do that in
Achtung

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
Achtung

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.580 
Achtung
but<00:05:26.120> it<00:05:26.300> gets<00:05:26.479> a<00:05:26.630> little<00:05:26.840> sick<00:05:27.080> if<00:05:27.259> I<00:05:27.349> put<00:05:27.560> a

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
but it gets a little sick if I put a

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:36.670 
but it gets a little sick if I put a
chord<00:05:27.889> in<00:05:28.069> there

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.870 

and<00:05:37.550> so<00:05:38.410> these<00:05:39.410> things<00:05:39.680> all<00:05:39.919> kind<00:05:40.639> of<00:05:40.669> work

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
and so these things all kind of work

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.499 
and so these things all kind of work
together<00:05:41.169> to<00:05:42.169> keep<00:05:42.500> things<00:05:42.830> in<00:05:43.009> it<00:05:43.130> in<00:05:43.340> a

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:43.509 
together to keep things in it in a

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:47.189 
together to keep things in it in a
stylistically<00:05:44.509> appropriate<00:05:45.350> place<00:05:46.009> so<00:05:46.880> that

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 
stylistically appropriate place so that

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:49.570 
stylistically appropriate place so that
you're<00:05:48.199> not<00:05:48.350> only<00:05:48.560> just<00:05:48.919> keeping<00:05:49.220> the<00:05:49.310> groove

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
you're not only just keeping the groove

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.189 
you're not only just keeping the groove
going<00:05:49.850> but<00:05:50.120> you're<00:05:50.240> actually<00:05:50.419> you<00:05:50.870> know<00:05:50.900> kind

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 
going but you're actually you know kind

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:54.210 
going but you're actually you know kind
of<00:05:51.310> subscribing<00:05:52.310> to<00:05:52.699> that<00:05:53.090> particular<00:05:53.720> genre

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
of subscribing to that particular genre

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.370 
of subscribing to that particular genre
and<00:05:55.220> I<00:05:55.400> think<00:05:55.669> it's<00:05:55.789> a<00:05:55.940> really<00:05:56.180> important<00:05:57.080> part

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
and I think it's a really important part

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.779 
and I think it's a really important part
of<00:05:57.620> what<00:05:58.310> we<00:05:58.430> do<00:05:58.669> as<00:05:59.389> rhythm<00:05:59.690> players<00:06:00.110> to<00:06:01.039> to

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:01.789 
of what we do as rhythm players to to

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:04.409 
of what we do as rhythm players to to
pay<00:06:02.000> attention<00:06:02.449> to<00:06:02.570> those<00:06:02.720> kinds<00:06:03.110> of<00:06:03.169> details

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
pay attention to those kinds of details

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.540 
pay attention to those kinds of details
the<00:06:05.419> you<00:06:05.930> know<00:06:06.020> the<00:06:06.440> different<00:06:07.009> factors<00:06:07.220> of

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
the you know the different factors of

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.870 
the you know the different factors of
style<00:06:08.000> of<00:06:08.360> groove<00:06:08.930> tempo<00:06:09.880> articulation

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
style of groove tempo articulation

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.200 
style of groove tempo articulation
voicing<00:06:11.840> the<00:06:11.990> harmonic<00:06:12.650> density<00:06:13.310> of<00:06:13.490> it<00:06:13.729> the

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
voicing the harmonic density of it the

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.219 
voicing the harmonic density of it the
tonal<00:06:14.930> density<00:06:15.500> of<00:06:15.710> it<00:06:15.919> you<00:06:16.310> know<00:06:16.400> the<00:06:16.520> fact<00:06:16.789> of

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229 
tonal density of it you know the fact of

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:20.290 
tonal density of it you know the fact of
using<00:06:18.229> a<00:06:18.289> tone<00:06:18.530> like<00:06:18.710> that<00:06:18.949> maybe<00:06:19.250> you<00:06:20.210> know

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
using a tone like that maybe you know

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.080 
using a tone like that maybe you know
kind<00:06:20.570> of<00:06:20.660> gets<00:06:21.440> to<00:06:21.530> woman<00:06:22.010> e<00:06:22.130> to<00:06:22.490> woman<00:06:22.850> Toni

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
kind of gets to woman e to woman Toni

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.370 
kind of gets to woman e to woman Toni
might<00:06:23.720> be<00:06:23.840> cool<00:06:24.080> for<00:06:24.410> a<00:06:24.470> lead<00:06:24.740> thing

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
might be cool for a lead thing

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.430 
might be cool for a lead thing
but<00:06:27.060> for<00:06:28.060> rhythm<00:06:28.300> stuff<00:06:28.750> it<00:06:28.960> might<00:06:29.080> kind<00:06:29.380> of

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
but for rhythm stuff it might kind of

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.660 
but for rhythm stuff it might kind of
turn<00:06:29.740> a<00:06:29.770> little<00:06:29.980> too<00:06:30.190> muddy<00:06:30.430> so<00:06:32.430> so<00:06:33.430> you<00:06:33.520> want

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:33.670
