00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:17.250
 Toyota's Hagrid started development about 30 years ago 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:19.680
 In particular , aiming at this hybrid will be reduced earlier and after all 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.680
 In the matter of energy 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:28.450
 What kind of fuel would be lost 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:31.210
 Sonaruto car than Well the fact that the measures from the fact Tteyuu I'm subsequent amateur 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:35.440
 I started development but it's also 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.840
 I is kind of amazing I mean was I to make of the car of the 21st century 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:43.710
 Challenger of Bull 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:46.860
 Working with a goal is an engineer who will lead to the electric car in the future 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:52.410
 Then Toka that fuel cell 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:55.489
 It is an art that can be applied to many places, so we will polish it there 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.489
 It is not terrorism 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:07.970
 4 cv though that is a fuel-cell vehicle this is Fi outside of 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:11.530
 Even though I bear to fuel cell thorn get the old man allowed to do chemical reactions produce electricity 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:16.020
 Taking advantage of the technology of the various core of hybrid 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:21.060
 There is one that is a mosquito net This is our 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:24.710
 After all, when fossil fuel runs out, it is rain as a new energy source 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.970
 In the future this fcv is called 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:33.950
 I also think that there is a high possibility of replacement 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.940
 We talk about putting out in 2015, but from there 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:41.570
 that 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:42.830
 It may be a mistake as it is learned, but I hope you can ride a lot of people 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.160
 While 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:50.160
 There a place that has developed very hard now 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
 me
