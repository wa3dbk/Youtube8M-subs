the fully functional this is a really
really<00:00:20.460> cool<00:00:21.120> tweak<00:00:21.420> however<00:00:22.110> there<00:00:22.290> is<00:00:22.410> one

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:22.440 
really cool tweak however there is one

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.710 
really cool tweak however there is one
kind<00:00:22.950> of<00:00:23.130> small<00:00:23.430> bug<00:00:23.700> and<00:00:23.940> that<00:00:24.270> is<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.600> the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
kind of small bug and that is that the

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.840 
kind of small bug and that is that the
app<00:00:24.900> shortcuts<00:00:25.650> kind<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.070> take<00:00:26.280> a<00:00:26.310> long<00:00:26.640> time

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:26.850 
app shortcuts kind of take a long time

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.310 
app shortcuts kind of take a long time
to<00:00:26.910> press<00:00:27.360> you<00:00:27.480> have<00:00:27.600> to<00:00:27.660> press<00:00:27.870> them<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.140> number

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
to press you have to press them a number

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.570 
to press you have to press them a number
of<00:00:28.410> times<00:00:28.560> before<00:00:28.800> they<00:00:29.010> actually<00:00:29.130> load

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
of times before they actually load

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.340 
of times before they actually load
hopefully<00:00:30.270> that'll<00:00:30.450> be<00:00:30.539> fixed<00:00:31.110> with<00:00:31.230> an

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.350 
hopefully that'll be fixed with an

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.260 
hopefully that'll be fixed with an
update<00:00:31.740> shortly<00:00:31.770> though<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.700> configure

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
the tweak within this app and it will be

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.280 
the tweak within this app and it will be
placed<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.090> your<00:00:36.210> springboard<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.900> as<00:00:37.200> you

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
placed on your springboard and as you

placed on your springboard and as you
can<00:00:37.440> see<00:00:37.470> this<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.980> my<00:00:38.130> layout<00:00:38.550> currently<00:00:39.030> i

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.060 
can see this is my layout currently i

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.540 
can see this is my layout currently i

that<00:01:07.830> might<00:01:07.979> be<00:01:08.100> helpful<00:01:08.250> but<00:01:08.880> then<00:01:09.060> as<00:01:09.240> you

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
that might be helpful but then as you

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.910 
that might be helpful but then as you
can<00:01:09.450> see<00:01:09.690> you<00:01:09.780> just<00:01:09.810> press<00:01:10.080> save<00:01:10.320> once<00:01:10.560> again

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
and then for example the amazon shortcut

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.530 
and then for example the amazon shortcut
will<00:01:14.010> be<00:01:14.130> there<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.790> just<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.090> second<00:01:15.360> ago<00:01:15.420> I

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
will be there so just a second ago I

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.450

talked about delete mode and that is the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.730 
talked about delete mode and that is the
way<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.640> delete<00:01:18.119> certain<00:01:18.540> apps<00:01:18.930> or<00:01:19.320> certain

way you delete certain apps or certain
widgets<00:01:20.430> from<00:01:20.729> your<00:01:20.940> lock<00:01:21.090> screen<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.630> then

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
widgets from your lock screen and then

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.510 
widgets from your lock screen and then
just<00:01:22.140> lock<00:01:22.380> your<00:01:22.530> device<00:01:22.590> again<00:01:23.010> and<00:01:23.220> the

device or you could just swipe anywhere
and<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.820> will<00:01:38.909> do<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.060> same<00:01:39.330> thing<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:40.260> you

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
and it will do the same thing so you

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.800 
and it will do the same thing so you
just<00:01:40.740> see<00:01:40.890> there<00:01:41.159> double<00:01:41.729> tap<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.420> unlock

which<00:01:45.689> again<00:01:46.020> doesn't<00:01:46.080> really<00:01:46.650> seem<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.070> work

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
which again doesn't really seem to work

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.370 
which again doesn't really seem to work
to<00:01:47.610> me<00:01:47.759> because<00:01:48.240> whenever<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.659> double<00:01:49.020> tap<00:01:49.049> on

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
to me because whenever I double tap on

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.130 
to me because whenever I double tap on
an<00:01:49.590> icon<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.250> just<00:01:50.759> double<00:01:51.060> taps<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.570> unlocks

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
an icon it just double taps and unlocks

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.710 
an icon it just double taps and unlocks
your<00:01:52.409> actual<00:01:52.860> device<00:01:53.189> here<00:01:53.580> so<00:01:54.210> if<00:01:54.330> we<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:54.600> go

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
your actual device here so if we just go

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.719 
your actual device here so if we just go
ahead<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:54.990> lock<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.619> then<00:01:56.159> double<00:01:56.430> tap<00:01:56.610> on

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729

the<00:01:56.790> amazon<00:01:57.240> app<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.930> unlock<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.409> actual

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
the amazon app just unlock the actual

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.289 
the amazon app just unlock the actual
device<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> little<00:01:59.670> bit<00:01:59.790> buggy<00:02:00.030> and

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
device so a little bit buggy and

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.060 
device so a little bit buggy and
hopefully<00:02:00.840> they'll<00:02:00.990> get<00:02:01.140> sorted<00:02:01.470> out<00:02:01.590> then<00:02:01.860> we

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
hopefully they'll get sorted out then we

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.010 
hopefully they'll get sorted out then we
have<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.310> Apple<00:02:02.640> built-in<00:02:03.030> items<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.750> these

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
are the things which already exist on

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.640 
are the things which already exist on
your<00:02:05.909> lock<00:02:06.150> screen<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:07.020> if<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:07.259> go<00:02:07.380> ahead<00:02:07.500> and

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
time bar you see that's just basically a

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.250

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
on your lock screen so that is quite

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.360 
on your lock screen so that is quite
cool<00:02:16.049> if<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.290> want<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.590> maybe<00:02:16.739> turn<00:02:17.010> those<00:02:17.189> off

and then finally down the bottom we have

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.170 
and then finally down the bottom we have
the<00:02:19.379> grid<00:02:19.680> setting<00:02:20.099> so<00:02:20.549> if<00:02:20.670> we<00:02:20.790> just<00:02:20.939> go<00:02:21.060> ahead

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
the grid setting so if we just go ahead

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.509
