had an awful lot of perlite that has

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.679 
had an awful lot of perlite that has

container systems we also more recently

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.380 
container systems we also more recently
have<00:01:31.710> had<00:01:31.920> transition<00:01:32.610> into<00:01:32.939> things<00:01:33.270> like

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
have had transition into things like

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.289 
have had transition into things like
composted<00:01:34.290> pine<00:01:34.530> bark<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:36.030> there's<00:01:36.240> a

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
composted pine bark and so there's a

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.240 
composted pine bark and so there's a
number<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.659> different<00:01:37.049> choices<00:01:37.259> all<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:38.100> which

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
number of different choices all of which

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.300 
number of different choices all of which
have<00:01:38.430> produced<00:01:38.670> similar<00:01:39.590> yields<00:01:40.590> for<00:01:40.950> crops

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.440 
have produced similar yields for crops
like<00:01:41.759> tomatoes<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.509> cucumbers<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:44.450> these

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
like tomatoes and cucumbers and these

like tomatoes and cucumbers and these
two<00:01:45.990> systems<00:01:46.500> here<00:01:46.920> we<00:01:47.369> have<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
two systems here we have the

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.999 
two systems here we have the
configuration<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.960> containers<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.770> would

manufactured<00:04:09.600> troughs<00:04:10.470> make<00:04:11.070> it<00:04:11.190> a<00:04:11.280> lot

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
manufactured troughs make it a lot

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.099 
manufactured troughs make it a lot
easier<00:04:11.489> for<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.209> grower<00:04:12.420> to<00:04:12.630> get<00:04:12.750> in<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.049> out

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
easier for the grower to get in and out

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:13.819 
easier for the grower to get in and out
of<00:04:13.290> production

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
of production

of production
that's<00:04:14.640> right<00:04:14.850> Bob<00:04:15.060> and<00:04:15.269> you<00:04:15.329> can<00:04:15.480> use<00:04:15.630> any<00:04:15.810> of

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
that's right Bob and you can use any of

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.469 
that's right Bob and you can use any of
the<00:04:16.079> media<00:04:16.350> that<00:04:16.859> we<00:04:16.979> discussed<00:04:17.400> earlier<00:04:17.609> it's

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
the media that we discussed earlier it's

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.090 
the media that we discussed earlier it's
really<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:18.959> growers<00:04:19.350> preference<00:04:19.829> what<00:04:19.979> is

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
really the growers preference what is

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.070 
really the growers preference what is
available<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.789> the<00:04:20.910> cost<00:04:21.150> issue<00:04:21.390> comes<00:04:21.750> in<00:04:21.900> at

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
available and the cost issue comes in at

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.580 
available and the cost issue comes in at
that<00:04:22.200> point

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
that point

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.010 
that point
we<00:04:23.220> want<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.520> remember<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:24.360> media<00:04:24.659> needs<00:04:24.870> to

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
we want to remember the media needs to

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.520 
we want to remember the media needs to
be<00:04:25.140> at<00:04:25.229> a<00:04:25.320> depth<00:04:25.590> of<00:04:25.770> around<00:04:25.890> 60

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
be at a depth of around 60

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.530 
be at a depth of around 60
is<00:04:26.740> to<00:04:26.889> allow<00:04:27.100> for<00:04:27.340> adequate<00:04:27.430> root<00:04:28.180> system

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
is to allow for adequate root system

is to allow for adequate root system
development<00:04:29.130> one<00:04:30.130> of<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.340> things<00:04:30.580> that<00:04:30.850> is<00:04:31.060> a

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
development one of the things that is a

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.940 
development one of the things that is a
special<00:04:31.660> interest<00:04:32.020> for<00:04:32.050> these<00:04:32.260> open<00:04:32.650> troughs

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
special interest for these open troughs

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.570 
special interest for these open troughs
is<00:04:33.250> if<00:04:33.400> a<00:04:33.490> grower<00:04:33.820> is<00:04:34.180> trying<00:04:34.870> to<00:04:35.020> be<00:04:35.169> a

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
is if a grower is trying to be a

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.030 
is if a grower is trying to be a
certified<00:04:36.580> organic<00:04:36.900> producer<00:04:37.900> we<00:04:38.500> can<00:04:38.710> use

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
certified organic producer we can use

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.310 
certified organic producer we can use
some<00:04:39.340> of<00:04:39.460> these<00:04:39.550> media<00:04:40.240> like<00:04:40.480> a<00:04:40.510> composted

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
some of these media like a composted

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.680 
some of these media like a composted
pine<00:04:41.560> bark<00:04:41.860> or<00:04:42.130> perlite<00:04:42.520> both<00:04:42.790> are<00:04:43.030> able<00:04:43.510> to<00:04:43.540> be

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
pine bark or perlite both are able to be

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.480 
pine bark or perlite both are able to be
used<00:04:43.930> in<00:04:44.110> a<00:04:44.200> certified<00:04:44.560> organic<00:04:44.620> production

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
used in a certified organic production

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.510 
used in a certified organic production
system<00:04:45.880> and<00:04:46.090> in<00:04:46.600> our<00:04:46.720> case<00:04:46.960> we<00:04:47.290> have<00:04:47.860> been<00:04:48.220> able

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
system and in our case we have been able

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.460 
system and in our case we have been able
to<00:04:48.700> demonstrate<00:04:48.970> the<00:04:49.630> use<00:04:49.810> of<00:04:49.990> these<00:04:50.080> open

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
to demonstrate the use of these open

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.070 
to demonstrate the use of these open
troughs<00:04:50.770> with<00:04:51.370> drip<00:04:51.639> irrigation<00:04:51.790> tape<00:04:52.690> to

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
troughs with drip irrigation tape to

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.620 
troughs with drip irrigation tape to
deliver<00:04:53.440> water<00:04:53.860> only<00:04:54.250> and<00:04:54.730> because<00:04:55.450> the

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
deliver water only and because the

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.840 
deliver water only and because the
troughs<00:04:55.900> are<00:04:56.139> open<00:04:56.590> we<00:04:56.980> can<00:04:57.190> then<00:04:57.400> go<00:04:57.580> back<00:04:57.820> and

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
troughs are open we can then go back and

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.290 
troughs are open we can then go back and
apply<00:04:58.419> the<00:04:59.169> organic<00:04:59.980> fertilizer<00:05:00.640> materials

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
apply the organic fertilizer materials

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.450 
apply the organic fertilizer materials
that<00:05:01.419> would<00:05:01.570> be<00:05:01.720> required<00:05:02.200> for<00:05:02.460> certification

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
that would be required for certification

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.909 
that would be required for certification
so<00:05:04.000> these<00:05:04.120> open<00:05:04.510> troughs<00:05:04.780> are<00:05:05.050> especially

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
so these open troughs are especially

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.450 
so these open troughs are especially
attractive<00:05:06.490> to<00:05:06.520> our<00:05:07.240> organic<00:05:08.160> producers<00:05:09.160> here

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
attractive to our organic producers here
