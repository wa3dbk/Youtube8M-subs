00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.379
 hi everyone with you alexander would like to 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.630
 show me what happened 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:12.809
 Sorry for not taking off 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.340
 video but here's another video like you 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:23.039
 see here this rack was planted 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:25.369
 today we also see near the rack 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:35.040
 which was planted 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:37.649
 5 days ago different varieties of onions 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.399
 Nastya was about the grove already 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.850
 woke up 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.460
 some a little delayed here 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.219
 above warmer 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.920
 temperature as you see here is better 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.350
 already woke up and let's see 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.370
 the first rack which rented at the very 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:00.449
 the first video here is this bow that you see 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:06.720
 such a whole exuberant juicy green elastic 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:08.909
 the feathers were planted the very first afterwards 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:17.130
 the bottom shelf was planted the next 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:20.430
 day and top as you can see everything is already so 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:27.320
 Looks interesting temperature can 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.320
 see the temperature we have is 18 17 degrees 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.470
 Now I like I said elastic color 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.430
 rich green 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.079
 after trimming wanted to show feathers who 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.829
 thinks that when you cut the period 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:47.759
 wide as you can see not healed for 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:51.479
 Rosstat and rural is the minimum I 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:55.670
 I think in the process of growth agree with 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.670
 sneaks at all press 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:05.979
 enough light I want to show upstairs 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:08.200
 stalks light falls from the window and falls from 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.300
 lamp like the stems no longer know where 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.130
 im grow 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:17.530
 some look at the window 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:23.040
 others look at the lamp let's say 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.040
 forgive us now here such racks 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.450
 this rack grouper made this was 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.269
 made 2 and as you see wanted to show 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.799
 another 30 shelving under the second rack 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:42.730
 there were four tiers on the third 3 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:46.260
 I decided so that's how this is so 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.790
 rack number three is the best 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.220
 when I walk up to full height here 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.599
 head level visible 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.959
 greens that is actually possible 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.120
 work even without knocking without stepladder 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:05.560
 very convenient distance between one 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:10.600
 tier and second 70 centimeters as it was 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:14.069
 said the video earlier in general to all until 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.069
 see you soon was alexander
