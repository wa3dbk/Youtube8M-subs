00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
and that's something I'd like to do down

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.099 
and that's something I'd like to do down
the<00:00:27.180> line<00:00:27.320> I<00:00:28.320> just<00:00:29.220> don't<00:00:29.699> have<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.390> sort<00:00:31.050> of

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
the line I just don't have the sort of

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.200 
the line I just don't have the sort of
financial<00:00:31.710> means<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.189> buy<00:00:32.340> any<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.910> larger

old<00:00:33.390> sets<00:00:33.630> at<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.840> moment<00:00:34.170> but<00:00:34.290> hopefully<00:00:34.620> in

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
old sets at the moment but hopefully in

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.620 
old sets at the moment but hopefully in
the<00:00:34.770> near<00:00:34.890> future

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
the near future

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.400 
the near future
so<00:00:36.630> what<00:00:37.530> did<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.739> get<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:38.670> would<00:00:39.210> be<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:40.200> is

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
so what did I get this would be this is

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.100 
so what did I get this would be this is
sort<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.649> like<00:00:41.010> an<00:00:41.280> off-road<00:00:41.850> racer<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.899> don't

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
sort of like an off-road racer I don't

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.979 
sort of like an off-road racer I don't
know<00:00:43.200> if<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.410> can<00:00:43.530> see<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.120> that<00:00:45.120> well<00:00:45.420> he

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
know if you can see that that well he

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.869 
know if you can see that that well he
packaged<00:00:46.469> them<00:00:46.590> up<00:00:46.739> really<00:00:47.010> really<00:00:47.280> tiny<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.820> do

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
packaged them up really really tiny I do

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.830 
packaged them up really really tiny I do
like<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.300> way<00:00:48.390> these<00:00:48.510> are<00:00:48.719> packaged<00:00:49.020> though

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
like the way these are packaged though

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.080 
like the way these are packaged though
let's<00:00:51.840> see<00:00:52.020> if<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.289> can<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.890> can't<00:00:53.730> get<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.940> tape

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
let's see if I can I can't get the tape

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.700 
let's see if I can I can't get the tape
off<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.629> like<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> sort<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.620> an

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
off so this is like a sort of an

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.740 
off so this is like a sort of an
off-road<00:00:56.010> racer<00:00:56.460> here<00:00:56.640> these<00:00:57.210> are<00:00:57.360> all<00:00:57.390> sets
