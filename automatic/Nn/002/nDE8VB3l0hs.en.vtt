00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 the meaning of towards mine mine 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.400
 it was the fire that did not catch was concrete 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.070
 concrete block quill was also 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.010
 concrete also if ok and you tile this 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.550
 mud not but the thickest good very 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.070
 well I want to tell you that I also 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.189
 I'm pleasantly surprised when 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.990
 I saw them in the first round because it was 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.789
 Clearly they were good and talented 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.369
 but they are the acts that one has left 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.710
 the doubt what would happen in a next 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.320
 instance today they showed me no 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.940
 only they are very good at what 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.100
 they do and that they are left over in their 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.700
 discipline but they were creative 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.309
 they were smart to bet and to another 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.460
 kind of show just for 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.770
 surprise and besides that you are 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.329
 the test or the example of the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.660
 participants who do not expect another 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.770
 opportunity to surprise but that 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.170
 independently without knowing if they passed 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.399
 today or did not play everything demonstrate 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.399
 I better congratulate you 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:14.270

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:16.159
 and we do not have the time but you 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.000
 do not go sit down, do not go 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.100
 break the benches 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.140
 they are boys on a bench and they go with 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.550
 the command is to sit quietly 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.470
 ok, we saw our shows 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.470
 tonight they are going to have the time you 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.910
 to be able to look at those who choose each 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.910
 day is harder this for god 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.680

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.979
 dances 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.030
 the difficult moment of this has already arrived 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.130
 night the decision of our juries 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.600

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.080

 all that this has been the most 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.670
 difficult at least for me because 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.890

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.819

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.480

 and I also saw great talent that I see 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.769
 turned into great acts if they were not 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:46.579

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:52.239

 a stage where there can be no mistakes 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.740
 the fiscal act was creative and novel 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.770
 coordinated but had failures the act of 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.950

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.170
 they left almost without words in an act 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.980
 who did not have much faith in the 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:59.930
