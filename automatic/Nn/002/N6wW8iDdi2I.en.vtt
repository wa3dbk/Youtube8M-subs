 important in the world of technology 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.230
 Apple apparently is in some 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.360
 problems with icloud and is that the end of 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.550

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.740
 famous technology magazine called mad 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.230
 holder announced that his 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.570
 Icloud's good account is supposed to be 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.279
 very safe these accounts the apple the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.439
 problem is that they managed to hack the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.089
 thanks to engineering social engineering 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.790
 social is a very good way to 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:34.079
 tell you a cheat by apple phone 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.180
 had the option to recover the 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.970
 ai cloud password using the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.460
 technical support by apple phone 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.770
 have in usa with applecare the service 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.110
 let's say sap products warranty 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.200
 It's good, cheating the ones in the call 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.200
 center of this service managed to obtain 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.770
 your account your icloud password deleted 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.360
 your phone your computer your ipad all 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.240
 the information was deleted but here what 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.300
 important and what has been put on fabric 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.339
 of judgment is the security of a single 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.920
 password and a single username 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.899
 for virtually any product of 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.909
 apple when you login on itunes 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.560
 for example the music store uses 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.170
 the same password and the same name 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.600
 user the same goes for the appstore and 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.189
 the same for icloud with that they steal a 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.630
 of those passwords can access 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.219
 everything and it's not that you buy an application 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.219
 of a weight nothing more than requests up to 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:28.530
 I do not know 500 pesos or even with that same 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.719
 password can buy in the store 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.340
 where then a computer costs more than 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.439
 30 thousand pesos also with that you can 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.450
 buy and upload it to your card 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.099
 I think you have to change this 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.569
 politics is what they are saying there is in 

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:40.649

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:42.390

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.140
 different passwords in each of 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.759
 the apple products but good if 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.670
 you have an icloud account change 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.819
