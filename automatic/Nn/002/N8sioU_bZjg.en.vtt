stop<00:00:37.570> things<00:00:37.930> not<00:00:38.410> a<00:00:38.440> clutch<00:00:38.650> that<00:00:38.769> you're

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
stop things not a clutch that you're

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.140 
stop things not a clutch that you're
going<00:00:39.040> to<00:00:39.129> want<00:00:39.250> to<00:00:39.280> put<00:00:39.489> in<00:00:39.550> a<00:00:39.670> performance

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
going to want to put in a performance

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.840 
going to want to put in a performance
car<00:00:40.410> these<00:00:41.410> clutches<00:00:41.770> are<00:00:42.130> going<00:00:42.309> to<00:00:42.399> have<00:00:42.550> you

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
car these clutches are going to have you

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.430 
car these clutches are going to have you
know<00:00:42.940> a<00:00:42.969> stock<00:00:43.270> pedal<00:00:43.690> effort<00:00:44.050> and<00:00:44.320> they're

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
know a stock pedal effort and they're

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.530 
know a stock pedal effort and they're
going<00:00:44.620> to<00:00:44.890> have<00:00:45.010> perfect<00:00:45.790> drivability

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
going to have perfect drivability

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.990 
going to have perfect drivability
characteristics<00:00:47.500> so<00:00:48.129> this<00:00:48.370> is<00:00:48.520> a<00:00:48.550> clutch<00:00:48.879> that

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
characteristics so this is a clutch that

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.549 
characteristics so this is a clutch that
you<00:00:49.120> want<00:00:49.300> to<00:00:49.360> put<00:00:49.510> in<00:00:49.629> your<00:00:49.660> daily<00:00:50.020> driver<00:00:50.260> car

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
you want to put in your daily driver car

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.560 
you want to put in your daily driver car

that has no mods stepping up from that
you're<00:00:52.750> gonna<00:00:52.840> go<00:00:53.020> to<00:00:53.079> your<00:00:53.260> state<00:00:53.530> one<00:00:53.920> your

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
you're gonna go to your state one your

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.490 
you're gonna go to your state one your
stage<00:00:55.000> 1<00:00:55.300> clutch<00:00:55.480> is<00:00:55.719> gonna<00:00:55.899> have<00:00:56.079> a<00:00:56.110> little

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
stage 1 clutch is gonna have a little

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.380 
stage 1 clutch is gonna have a little
bit<00:00:56.739> firmer<00:00:57.100> pedal<00:00:57.520> effort<00:00:57.820> than<00:00:57.969> stopping

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
bit firmer pedal effort than stopping

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.090 
bit firmer pedal effort than stopping
but<00:00:58.480> not<00:00:58.719> harsh<00:00:58.989> by<00:00:59.230> any<00:00:59.410> means<00:00:59.710> and<00:01:00.010> the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
but not harsh by any means and the

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.040 
but not harsh by any means and the
friction<00:01:00.430> material<00:01:00.460> is<00:01:00.940> gonna<00:01:01.149> be<00:01:01.360> a<00:01:01.570> little

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
friction material is gonna be a little

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.930 
friction material is gonna be a little
bit<00:01:02.230> more<00:01:02.410> aggressive<00:01:02.980> these<00:01:03.399> clutches<00:01:03.699> are

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
bit more aggressive these clutches are

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.609 
bit more aggressive these clutches are
going<00:01:04.059> to<00:01:04.119> handle<00:01:04.360> up<00:01:04.539> to<00:01:04.570> 400<00:01:05.259> rear-wheel

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
going to handle up to 400 rear-wheel

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.529 
going to handle up to 400 rear-wheel
horsepower<00:01:05.649> so<00:01:06.399> it'll<00:01:06.610> cover<00:01:06.820> you<00:01:07.240> know<00:01:07.330> a<00:01:07.360> lot

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:07.539 
horsepower so it'll cover you know a lot

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:09.240 
horsepower so it'll cover you know a lot
of<00:01:07.570> your<00:01:07.780> bolt<00:01:07.990> ons<00:01:08.229> and<00:01:08.470> some<00:01:08.649> of<00:01:08.710> you<00:01:08.860> have

your<00:01:09.430> mods<00:01:09.640> however<00:01:10.210> a<00:01:10.300> stage<00:01:10.600> 1<00:01:10.810> clutch<00:01:11.020> is

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
your mods however a stage 1 clutch is

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:12.870 
your mods however a stage 1 clutch is
not<00:01:11.560> gonna<00:01:11.740> live<00:01:12.009> very<00:01:12.039> long<00:01:12.550> if<00:01:12.759> you're

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
not gonna live very long if you're

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.390 
not gonna live very long if you're
running<00:01:13.090> drag<00:01:13.810> radials<00:01:14.290> or<00:01:14.500> full<00:01:14.710> slicks<00:01:15.100> and

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.039 
running drag radials or full slicks and
it's<00:01:15.790> definitely<00:01:16.090> not<00:01:16.270> that<00:01:16.330> clutch<00:01:16.750> you<00:01:16.900> want

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
it's definitely not that clutch you want

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:18.510 
it's definitely not that clutch you want
