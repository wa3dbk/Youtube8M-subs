00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.119
 Hello everyone, doctor at and I 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:16.699
 slightly decided to change the video format in 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:18.140
 heading top 5 top 10 and now i want 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.380
 communicate with you like this directly 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.440
 I think this is cool and most importantly to you 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.420
 enjoyed it this time i decided 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.450
 share with you five games about 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.520
 mafia or gaster and yes it is all purely 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.440
 my personal opinion is so smaller 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.030
 memory in the comments as she 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.030
 in any way not a cult to coincide with yours 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.999
 her name is scarf and the stars they heard about 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.010
 this game then you definitely need to 

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:48.559
 her play video section on 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.929
 famous film of the same name which is 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.679
 turn was a remake of gazar 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:57.379
 action movie 1932 game completely 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:59.539
 dedicated to gangster or mafia life 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.149
 where you need to not only rob 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:05.269
 banks and take hostages while still 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.760
 shoot back from the mainstream police heap 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.640
 The way to make money in this game is 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.460
 cocaine yes you can pass street 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.520
 huckster or deliver huge reserves 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.830
 according to their institution what else is needed for 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.690
 good game 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.360
 women yes they are also present in this 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.070
 the game to the woman drew on 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.510
 you need to earn attention 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.630
 special glasses 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.840
 the more sophisticated the murder the more 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:37.040
 gives points though playing old but i 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:40.550
 I think it's worth playing the following 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.460
 I know the game many year phase 2 and I tried 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.690
 pass it twice yes it tried and about 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.550
 this I will tell later 1 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.590
 on the feature film godfather 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.720
 which turn is 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.980
 adaptation of the novel American 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.330
 writer mario puzo game starts in 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.020
 harbor in cuba 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.630
 roughly 60s night realized 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.820
 flashes of violence in the streets of the 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.040
 time is assigned to our player 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.240
 family responsibility 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.030
 corleone 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.910
 in general in the whole mess of the protagonist 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.850
 viola and tab they are not lucky enough to survive 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.210
 by the will of the screenwriters but his laughter gave 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.550
 start your mafia career after 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.890
 creating your family you can 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.320
 invite new members to the gang who 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.500
 every family member will help you 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.800
 has certain skills for example 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.140
 treat blow something set fire as well 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.260
 crack some safes and locks 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.200
 in order to enrich your wallet in general for 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.340
 helpers account and build this game 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.500
 but about this game community from different countries 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.660
 they said that the creators I often 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.480
 i use drugs yes i'm talking about 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.120
 center 4 and a her crazy additions 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.360
 Well, I decided to discuss the rather old 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.650
 part of sensors 2 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.040
 original 1 sensor 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.340
 logged on to xbox 360 for many owners 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.530
 became one of my favorites 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.560
 the most interesting games of the time, unfortunately 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.470
 evil never transferred to pc instead 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.620
 this developers have concentrated their 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.290
 focus on the second part 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.120
 actions take place in a fictional city 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.940
 skill altar the main character runs from 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.940
 prison and pulls out of the hall here his 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.100
 mate johnny ghetto with whom they 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.370
 go to the city to restore their 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.310
 gang of saints from third street they 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.130
 seize slum shelter for their 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.160
 gangs then the main character finds for 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.760
 her three main gangsters each of 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.970
 which 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.130
 sends to other gangs while trying 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.610
 expand its territory 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:57.030
 when I passed this game plot to me 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:00.180
 I liked it very much and now I am already 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.610
 I don't remember him, but I definitely liked him 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.860
 seize gangs though it was and 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.860
 monotonous but very fun 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.400
 I singled out two parts of the grid line 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.620
 fifth and gta san andreas they 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.690
 gorgeous and who disagree with me 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.850
 let this munafik because when i 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:27.700
 I had a story I just did not have 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.700
 words and in my opinion the standard is shit 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:39.740
 For the first time in the history of gta 5 parts were doing 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.350
 Immediately three protagonists michael trevor and 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.990
 franklin I initially did not understand at all 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:48.460
 how to play for three characters at once 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:52.010
 when the game came out everything fell into place 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:55.040
 gta5 just awesome graphics yes 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.440
 there are games with better graphics but in my 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.450
 top is the most beautiful game except 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.240
 graphics in the game a unique story 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:05.000
 who tells us a difficult fate 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.870
 three characters and it's not monotonous 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.810
 stories 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.750
 This is a completely different hero with different 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.720
 characters and deeds franklin 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.480
 born the bottom and the family and stole cars 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.960
 it was him and led to a meeting with the hero 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:24.050
 michael michael awesome character 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:27.200
 which is always well, no luck in terms 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:30.650
 family son ignores wife don't see him 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.919
 man and copulates with others and daughter 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.740
 looking for fame on different TV channels but 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:39.890
 she's not doing anything because 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.520
 persistently father who always objects 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.040
 the alarm 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.520
 oh this character for me always 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.740
 remain a mystery mad mystery it 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.710
 just a crazy guy and if he 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.290
 cross the road it will not seem like it 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.900
 in general, the game just came out 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.540
 amazing and thought to offer to play 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.910
 not 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.150
 you need it since everyone has already done so 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.150
 after all 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:11.349
 and finally the first place on him I 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:12.189
 put mafia 2 this game i never 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:15.759
 forget 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:19.509
 looking forward to the third part but why 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:21.550
 I chew 2 on 1 place in this game very 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:23.769
 interesting plot that you want 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.949
 pass over and over again and 

00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:30.399
 again and there are no stupid quests that 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:33.689
 all games when imaginative and stupid and 

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:36.939
 senseless and i really like them 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:39.849
 the atmospheric city is just as gorgeous 

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:42.849
 as if you really plunge into the life of america 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:45.669
 in the forties to the 50s there are the same 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:48.639
 people what kind of clothes ja sounding in 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:51.189
 cars or even roadside cafes that 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:53.169
 very happy does not give even more 

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:54.189
 atmospheric city â€‹â€‹itself is made 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:57.159
 awesome 

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:59.379
 I want to pay special attention to cars 

00:06:57.159 --> 00:07:02.019
 in the game a large number of cars 

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:05.469
 every car is a rarity of the time and 

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:08.110
 although control in the game is very sharp but to 

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:10.990
 it can be easy to get used summing 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:14.110
 results i want say mafia 2 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:16.899
 this is the best game about the mafia, I also 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.629
 I look forward to the third part and I think 

00:07:16.899 --> 00:07:20.679
 what will she look like her 

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:23.499
 the predecessors of the planets are the same 

00:07:20.679 --> 00:07:24.870
 interesting plot thanks to all who 

00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:27.500
 looked it 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:30.780
 hero and if you like it 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:41.190
 like it further subscribe to 

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:44.910
