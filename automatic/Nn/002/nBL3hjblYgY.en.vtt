championship<00:01:57.009> this<00:01:57.130> year<00:01:57.280> I<00:01:57.520> think<00:01:57.610> they<00:01:57.789> I

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
championship this year I think they I

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:59.309 
championship this year I think they I
think<00:01:58.090> they<00:01:58.509> definitely<00:01:58.600> of<00:01:58.869> the<00:01:58.929> potential

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
think they definitely of the potential

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.800 
think they definitely of the potential
if<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.039> guys<00:02:00.189> stay<00:02:00.369> healthy<00:02:00.670> they<00:02:00.970> keep<00:02:01.720> the

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
if the guys stay healthy they keep the

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.080 
if the guys stay healthy they keep the
minutes<00:02:02.080> low<00:02:02.259> if<00:02:02.950> they<00:02:03.099> gel<00:02:03.340> well<00:02:03.520> together<00:02:03.700> I

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
minutes low if they gel well together I

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.120 
minutes low if they gel well together I
think<00:02:04.840> kids<00:02:05.080> can<00:02:05.229> do<00:02:05.319> a<00:02:05.349> great<00:02:05.530> job<00:02:05.679> managing

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
think kids can do a great job managing

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.219 
think kids can do a great job managing
the<00:02:06.220> personalities<00:02:06.789> he's<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.659> best<00:02:07.840> ever<00:02:08.049> do

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
the personalities he's the best ever do

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.779 
the personalities he's the best ever do
what<00:02:08.440> he<00:02:08.530> did<00:02:08.709> on<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.039> basketball<00:02:09.399> court

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
what he did on the basketball court

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.759 
what he did on the basketball court
I<00:02:09.819> think<00:02:10.780> I'm<00:02:11.019> not<00:02:11.200> guaranteeing<00:02:11.680> anything

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
I think I'm not guaranteeing anything

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.110 
I think I'm not guaranteeing anything
but<00:02:12.069> I<00:02:12.099> think<00:02:12.190> there's<00:02:12.370> potential<00:02:12.610> for<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.940> I

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
but I think there's potential for it I

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.550 
but I think there's potential for it I
think<00:02:13.540> they<00:02:13.660> have<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:13.840> good<00:02:14.019> shot<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.260> taking

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
think they have a good shot of taking

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.440 
think they have a good shot of taking
down<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.769> heat<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.040> be<00:02:15.160> honest<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.970> team<00:02:16.269> kind

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
down the heat to be honest the team kind

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.539 
down the heat to be honest the team kind
of<00:02:16.569> reminds<00:02:16.840> me<00:02:16.930> of<00:02:17.049> like<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.739> Mavs<00:02:18.099> team<00:02:18.400> that

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
of reminds me of like the Mavs team that

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:19.890 
of reminds me of like the Mavs team that
won<00:02:18.670> in<00:02:18.790> 2010<00:02:19.180> or<00:02:19.269> what<00:02:19.360> they<00:02:19.420> put<00:02:19.599> a<00:02:19.630> lot<00:02:19.750> of

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
won in 2010 or what they put a lot of

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.809 
won in 2010 or what they put a lot of
like<00:02:20.049> good<00:02:20.230> players<00:02:20.440> together<00:02:20.650> it's<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.700> good

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
like good players together it's a good

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.360 
like good players together it's a good
veteran<00:02:22.180> leadership<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:23.620> think<00:02:24.100> it's

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
veteran leadership and I think it's

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.039 
veteran leadership and I think it's
gonna<00:02:24.489> depend<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.910> lot<00:02:25.030> on<00:02:25.090> what<00:02:25.540> kid<00:02:25.750> does<00:02:25.900> as<00:02:26.019> a

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
gonna depend a lot on what kid does as a

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.319 
gonna depend a lot on what kid does as a
coach<00:02:26.290> though<00:02:26.500> I<00:02:26.739> think<00:02:27.370> he's<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.609> key

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
coach though I think he's the key

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.180 
coach though I think he's the key
if<00:02:28.600> he<00:02:28.810> does<00:02:28.989> as<00:02:29.109> good<00:02:29.290> as<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:29.829> know<00:02:29.920> people

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
if he does as good as you know people

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.380 
if he does as good as you know people
expect<00:02:30.459> them<00:02:30.549> to<00:02:30.609> do<00:02:30.760> with<00:02:30.910> this<00:02:31.000> roster<00:02:31.329> I

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
expect them to do with this roster I

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.340 
expect them to do with this roster I
think<00:02:31.570> they<00:02:31.630> can<00:02:31.780> definitely<00:02:31.870> win<00:02:32.109> the<00:02:32.230> ring

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
think they can definitely win the ring

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.720 
think they can definitely win the ring
this<00:02:32.920> year<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:34.380> do<00:02:35.380> not<00:02:35.739> think<00:02:36.010> so<00:02:36.069> I<00:02:36.400> feel<00:02:36.700> like

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
this year I do not think so I feel like

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.449 
this year I do not think so I feel like
they<00:02:37.000> need<00:02:37.329> at<00:02:37.900> least<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:38.230> year<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.560> just<00:02:38.799> jail

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
they need at least a year to just jail

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.090 
they need at least a year to just jail
and<00:02:39.810> see<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.900> chemistry<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.440> everything<00:02:41.680> I

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
and see the chemistry and everything I

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.130 
and see the chemistry and everything I
feel<00:02:42.430> like<00:02:42.579> they'll<00:02:42.790> get<00:02:42.970> Eastern<00:02:43.840> Conference

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
feel like they'll get Eastern Conference

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.220 
feel like they'll get Eastern Conference
Finals<00:02:44.470> this<00:02:44.590> year<00:02:46.139> loose<00:02:47.139> why<00:02:47.380> I'm<00:02:47.530> here

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
that's what we have our eye on our eye

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.110 
that's what we have our eye on our eye
on<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.769> prize<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.190> championship<00:02:55.819> I<00:02:55.940> mean

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
on the prize the championship I mean

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.699 
on the prize the championship I mean
we're<00:02:56.330> definitely<00:02:56.480> gonna<00:02:56.810> be<00:02:57.019> playoff

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
we're definitely gonna be playoff

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.979 
we're definitely gonna be playoff
contenders<00:02:58.190> definitely<00:02:58.870> working<00:02:59.870> our<00:02:59.959> way

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
contenders definitely working our way

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.449 
contenders definitely working our way
towards<00:03:00.349> that<00:03:00.470> championship<00:03:01.099> I<00:03:01.190> think<00:03:01.370> we

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
towards that championship I think we

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.160 
towards that championship I think we
could<00:03:01.610> do<00:03:01.700> it<00:03:01.849> I<00:03:02.090> never<00:03:02.330> expect<00:03:02.989> a

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
could do it I never expect a

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.780 
could do it I never expect a
championship<00:03:03.830> because<00:03:04.099> championships<00:03:04.670> are

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
championship because championships are

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.780 
championship because championships are
earned<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:05.300> not<00:03:05.540> handed<00:03:06.019> over<00:03:06.160> but<00:03:07.160> anything

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
earned and not handed over but anything

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:08.620 
earned and not handed over but anything
less<00:03:07.819> than<00:03:08.060> an<00:03:08.150> appearance<00:03:08.510> in<00:03:08.569> the

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
less than an appearance in the

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.820 
less than an appearance in the
Conference<00:03:08.959> Finals<00:03:09.019> would<00:03:09.380> be<00:03:09.440> totally

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
Conference Finals would be totally

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.020 
Conference Finals would be totally
disappointing<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:10.430> if<00:03:10.489> they're<00:03:10.610> healthy

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
disappointing and if they're healthy
