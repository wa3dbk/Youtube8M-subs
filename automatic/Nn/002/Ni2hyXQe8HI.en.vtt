00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
just as much as part of the process as

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.210 
just as much as part of the process as
you<00:02:16.319> would<00:02:16.470> like<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.739> feel<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.920> part<00:02:17.129> of<00:02:17.160> the

you would like to feel a part of the

you would like to feel a part of the
process<00:02:17.459> you're<00:02:18.060> basically<00:02:18.450> learning<00:02:18.660> how<00:02:18.900> to

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
process you're basically learning how to

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.850 
process you're basically learning how to
do<00:02:19.140> things<00:02:19.379> on<00:02:19.500> your<00:02:19.560> own

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
do things on your own

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.400 
do things on your own
and<00:02:20.220> be<00:02:20.459> independent<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.450> think<00:02:21.720> sometimes

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
and be independent and I think sometimes

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.229 
and be independent and I think sometimes
being<00:02:23.280> in<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.580> traditional<00:02:24.030> classroom

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
being in the traditional classroom

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.420 
being in the traditional classroom
you're<00:02:25.019> not<00:02:25.200> necessarily<00:02:25.500> given<00:02:26.280> those

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
you're not necessarily given those

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.729 
you're not necessarily given those
opportunities<00:02:26.459> I<00:02:27.390> think<00:02:27.810> programs<00:02:28.290> like<00:02:28.470> the

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
opportunities I think programs like the

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.270 
opportunities I think programs like the
mountaintop<00:02:29.160> program<00:02:29.549> are<00:02:30.470> really<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:32.069> next

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
mountaintop program are really the next

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.680 
mountaintop program are really the next
step<00:02:32.519> and<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.670> see<00:02:32.790> Lehigh<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.120> seems<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.599> be

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
step and I see Lehigh it seems to be

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.360 
step and I see Lehigh it seems to be
really<00:02:33.840> pursuing<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.829> was<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:34.980> technical

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
really pursuing that it was a technical

really pursuing that it was a technical
entrepreneurship<00:02:36.120> master's<00:02:36.480> program<00:02:36.900> with

entrepreneurship master's program with

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.240 
entrepreneurship master's program with
programs<00:02:37.950> really<00:02:38.069> focus<00:02:38.519> on<00:02:38.730> this<00:02:39.090> element<00:02:39.480> of

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
programs really focus on this element of

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.069 
programs really focus on this element of
explorative<00:02:41.250> learning<00:02:41.910> when<00:02:42.569> I<00:02:42.630> first<00:02:42.900> heard

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
explorative learning when I first heard

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.050 
explorative learning when I first heard
of<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.349> I<00:02:43.470> was<00:02:43.590> really<00:02:43.829> nervous<00:02:44.040> because<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.760> I

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
of it I was really nervous because I I

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.569 
of it I was really nervous because I I
wasn't<00:02:45.630> sure<00:02:45.720> about<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:46.019> expectations<00:02:46.829> but

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
wasn't sure about the expectations but

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.250 
wasn't sure about the expectations but
at<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.730> same<00:02:47.910> time<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.299> was<00:02:48.390> exciting<00:02:49.019> because

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
at the same time it was exciting because

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.580 
at the same time it was exciting because
it's<00:02:49.709> like<00:02:50.480> options<00:02:51.480> are<00:02:51.690> limitless

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
it's like options are limitless

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.619 
it's like options are limitless
you're<00:02:53.010> like<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.370> mast<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.910> your<00:02:54.090> own<00:02:54.269> feet

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629

graduate<00:03:09.660> I<00:03:10.340> think<00:03:11.340> is<00:03:11.519> an<00:03:11.819> essential<00:03:12.600> part<00:03:12.900> of

graduate I think is an essential part of
what<00:03:14.370> we<00:03:14.940> consider<00:03:15.269> a<00:03:15.420> university<00:03:16.139> education

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.990 

it<00:03:19.350> was<00:03:19.500> freeing<00:03:20.190> after<00:03:20.489> a<00:03:20.519> while<00:03:20.639> because<00:03:20.910> we

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
it was freeing after a while because we

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.490 
it was freeing after a while because we
could<00:03:21.150> use<00:03:21.299> our<00:03:21.420> advisors<00:03:21.810> for<00:03:21.989> support<00:03:22.380> we

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
could use our advisors for support we

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.710 
could use our advisors for support we
could<00:03:22.650> use<00:03:22.769> them<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.459> give<00:03:23.609> us<00:03:23.790> resources<00:03:24.120> and

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
could use them to give us resources and

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.210 
could use them to give us resources and
give<00:03:24.870> us<00:03:24.959> suggestions<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.590> hear<00:03:25.739> our<00:03:25.859> ideas

give us suggestions and hear our ideas

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.800 
give us suggestions and hear our ideas
but<00:03:26.819> we<00:03:26.940> were<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.180> ones<00:03:27.329> that<00:03:27.389> were<00:03:27.510> guiding

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
options for yourself to realize that

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
project create their own ideas and take

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.280 
project create their own ideas and take
that<00:03:54.670> where<00:03:54.910> it's<00:03:55.090> going<00:03:55.360> to<00:03:55.480> go<00:03:55.630> it's

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
that where it's going to go it's

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.470 
that where it's going to go it's
research<00:03:56.710> and<00:03:57.100> it's<00:03:57.280> ongoing<00:03:57.460> research<00:03:58.090> if<00:03:58.360> we

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
research and it's ongoing research if we

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.810 
research and it's ongoing research if we
knew<00:03:58.720> where<00:03:59.020> we're<00:03:59.350> going<00:03:59.560> to<00:03:59.680> end<00:03:59.860> and<00:04:00.670> it

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
knew where we're going to end and it

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.120 
knew where we're going to end and it
wouldn't<00:04:01.030> be<00:04:01.150> quite<00:04:01.270> so<00:04:01.540> interesting<00:04:02.130> they

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
wouldn't be quite so interesting they

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.940 
wouldn't be quite so interesting they
have<00:04:03.160> time<00:04:03.670> to<00:04:03.910> think<00:04:04.180> they<00:04:04.630> work<00:04:05.350> problems

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
have time to think they work problems

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.830 
have time to think they work problems
out<00:04:06.130> or<00:04:06.460> it<00:04:06.550> doesn't<00:04:06.760> work<00:04:07.030> you<00:04:07.240> can<00:04:07.420> test<00:04:07.720> new

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
out or it doesn't work you can test new

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.700 
out or it doesn't work you can test new
ideas<00:04:08.500> there's<00:04:09.130> a<00:04:09.250> sort<00:04:09.640> of<00:04:10.530> intimacy<00:04:11.530> that

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
ideas there's a sort of intimacy that

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.380 
ideas there's a sort of intimacy that
you<00:04:11.770> gain<00:04:12.070> with<00:04:12.280> a<00:04:12.340> project<00:04:12.640> and<00:04:13.030> a<00:04:13.090> sort<00:04:13.330> of

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
you gain with a project and a sort of

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.730 
you gain with a project and a sort of
perspective<00:04:13.960> that<00:04:14.110> you<00:04:14.260> get<00:04:14.440> from<00:04:14.650> the

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
perspective that you get from the

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.990 
perspective that you get from the
project<00:04:15.340> when<00:04:16.000> you<00:04:16.030> are<00:04:16.269> always<00:04:18.000> continuously

mountaintop<00:04:23.320> project<00:04:23.950> I<00:04:24.160> realized<00:04:24.640> that<00:04:25.120> I

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
mountaintop project I realized that I

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.170 
mountaintop project I realized that I
had<00:04:25.780> a<00:04:25.810> passion<00:04:26.260> for<00:04:26.290> design<00:04:26.880> but<00:04:27.880> I<00:04:27.910> wasn't

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
had a passion for design but I wasn't

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.500 
had a passion for design but I wasn't
sure<00:04:28.390> how<00:04:28.900> I<00:04:29.230> can<00:04:29.640> incorporate<00:04:30.640> that<00:04:31.060> to<00:04:31.120> my

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
sure how I can incorporate that to my

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.200 
sure how I can incorporate that to my
curricular<00:04:32.440> activities<00:04:33.250> once<00:04:33.940> I<00:04:34.120> had

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
curricular activities once I had

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.000 
curricular activities once I had
participated<00:04:34.450> in<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.080> mountaintop<00:04:35.500> project

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
participated in the mountaintop project

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.060 
participated in the mountaintop project
I<00:04:36.220> found<00:04:36.700> that<00:04:36.880> missing<00:04:37.210> link<00:04:37.500> this<00:04:38.500> project

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
I found that missing link this project

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.560 
I found that missing link this project
taught<00:04:39.310> me<00:04:39.520> how<00:04:39.700> to<00:04:39.730> look<00:04:39.970> at<00:04:40.150> it<00:04:40.300> from<00:04:40.450> another

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570

students like myself opportunities to
tap<00:05:02.830> into<00:05:03.040> things<00:05:03.340> that<00:05:03.400> they<00:05:03.550> probably

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
tap into things that they probably

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.700 
tap into things that they probably
cannot<00:05:04.360> have<00:05:04.600> before<00:05:04.990> or<00:05:05.290> they<00:05:05.440> didn't<00:05:05.590> have

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
the resources to before and just pushing

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.450 
the resources to before and just pushing
the<00:05:08.169> envelope<00:05:08.350> when<00:05:08.770> it<00:05:08.890> comes<00:05:09.070> to<00:05:09.220> what<00:05:09.370> the

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
the envelope when it comes to what the

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.280 
the envelope when it comes to what the
traditional<00:05:09.910> education<00:05:10.480> process<00:05:10.900> looks<00:05:11.200> like

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
traditional education process looks like

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.460 
traditional education process looks like
this<00:05:12.220> type<00:05:12.430> of<00:05:12.460> projects<00:05:13.210> just<00:05:13.810> changed<00:05:14.350> the

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
this type of projects just changed the

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.080 
this type of projects just changed the
way<00:05:14.620> I<00:05:14.650> looked<00:05:14.980> at<00:05:15.040> education<00:05:15.669> and<00:05:15.820> like

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
way I looked at education and like

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.360 
way I looked at education and like
schooling<00:05:16.750> and<00:05:16.930> what<00:05:17.290> it<00:05:17.380> means<00:05:17.620> to<00:05:18.160> have<00:05:18.310> a

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
schooling and what it means to have a

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.340 
schooling and what it means to have a
project<00:05:18.850> right<00:05:19.660> because<00:05:19.840> this<00:05:19.900> it<00:05:20.080> wasn't

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
project right because this it wasn't

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.270 
project right because this it wasn't
something<00:05:20.500> we<00:05:20.620> were<00:05:20.710> doing<00:05:20.740> for<00:05:20.980> a<00:05:21.040> grade<00:05:21.190> it

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
something we were doing for a grade it

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.770 
something we were doing for a grade it
was<00:05:21.400> something<00:05:21.640> we<00:05:21.700> were<00:05:21.790> doing<00:05:21.820> because<00:05:22.120> we

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
was something we were doing because we

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.060 
was something we were doing because we
thought<00:05:23.050> we<00:05:23.200> could<00:05:23.380> make<00:05:23.410> a<00:05:23.560> difference<00:05:23.919> and

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
thought we could make a difference and

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.879 
thought we could make a difference and
we<00:05:24.190> knew<00:05:24.340> we<00:05:24.430> had<00:05:24.580> to<00:05:24.610> scale

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
we knew we had to scale

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:29.899 
we knew we had to scale
to<00:05:26.490> make<00:05:26.639> it<00:05:26.759> happen<00:05:27.240> and<00:05:28.610> doing<00:05:29.610> the<00:05:29.699> things

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909 
to make it happen and doing the things

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:31.820 
to make it happen and doing the things
that<00:05:30.030> I<00:05:30.060> would<00:05:30.240> want<00:05:30.479> to<00:05:30.629> do<00:05:30.840> I<00:05:31.080> know<00:05:31.319> that<00:05:31.620> this

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
that I would want to do I know that this

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.040 
that I would want to do I know that this
experience<00:05:32.189> brings<00:05:32.490> me<00:05:32.610> closer<00:05:32.849> to<00:05:33.270> my<00:05:33.539> my
