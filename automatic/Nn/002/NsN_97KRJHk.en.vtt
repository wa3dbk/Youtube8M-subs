00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
transitioning for seven months

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.929 
transitioning for seven months
so<00:01:48.109> that<00:01:48.350> hair<00:01:48.530> didn't<00:01:48.770> take<00:01:48.890> in<00:01:49.039> the<00:01:49.130> back<00:01:49.310> so

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939

inches<00:02:12.740> how<00:02:12.890> many<00:02:12.920> inches<00:02:13.250> this<00:02:13.520> is<00:02:13.700> back<00:02:13.910> here

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
inches how many inches this is back here

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.580 
inches how many inches this is back here
if<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:14.210> was<00:02:14.390> straightening<00:02:14.630> out<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.350> another

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
if I was straightening out and another

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.110 
if I was straightening out and another
thing<00:02:15.890> with<00:02:16.099> how<00:02:16.280> much<00:02:16.489> faster

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
thing with how much faster

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.270 
thing with how much faster
this<00:02:17.269> hair<00:02:17.480> grows<00:02:17.720> back<00:02:17.750> here<00:02:18.260> this<00:02:18.769> hair<00:02:19.069> was

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
this hair grows back here this hair was

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.550 
this hair grows back here this hair was
trimmed<00:02:19.640> evenly<00:02:20.299> and<00:02:20.540> as<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.049> can<00:02:21.200> see<00:02:21.409> I'm

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
trimmed evenly and as you can see I'm

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.770 
trimmed evenly and as you can see I'm
gonna<00:02:21.739> have<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:21.920> trim<00:02:22.190> it<00:02:22.250> again<00:02:22.730> because<00:02:23.629> the

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
gonna have to trim it again because the

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.710 
gonna have to trim it again because the
hair<00:02:24.019> with<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.260> process<00:02:24.830> ends<00:02:25.790> it's<00:02:26.540> not

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
hair with the process ends it's not

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.170 
hair with the process ends it's not
growing<00:02:26.959> as<00:02:27.170> fast<00:02:27.370> so<00:02:28.370> people<00:02:28.940> have<00:02:29.060> always

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
growing as fast so people have always

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.089 
growing as fast so people have always
said<00:02:29.540> that<00:02:29.569> your<00:02:30.260> hair<00:02:30.440> will<00:02:30.560> grow<00:02:30.650> faster

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
said that your hair will grow faster

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.030 
said that your hair will grow faster
without<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:32.200> relaxed<00:02:33.200> ends<00:02:33.379> and<00:02:33.709> I<00:02:33.769> didn't

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
without the relaxed ends and I didn't

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.860 
without the relaxed ends and I didn't
understand<00:02:34.549> that<00:02:34.640> because<00:02:34.940> what<00:02:35.659> are<00:02:35.750> your

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
understand that because what are your

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.500 
understand that because what are your
intend<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.319> do<00:02:36.440> with<00:02:36.560> your<00:02:36.709> roots<00:02:36.940> but<00:02:37.940> this<00:02:38.360> is

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
intend to do with your roots but this is

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.020 
intend to do with your roots but this is
living<00:02:38.870> proof<00:02:38.900> here<00:02:39.500> that<00:02:39.530> that's<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.489> case<00:02:40.670> I

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
living proof here that that's the case I

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.180 
living proof here that that's the case I
have<00:02:41.420> this<00:02:41.870> hair<00:02:42.110> back<00:02:42.349> here<00:02:42.590> isn't<00:02:42.799> longer

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
have this hair back here isn't longer

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.280 
have this hair back here isn't longer
this<00:02:43.310> is<00:02:43.370> my<00:02:43.579> natural<00:02:43.640> hair<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:44.870> was<00:02:44.989> even

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
this is my natural hair and it was even

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.710 
this is my natural hair and it was even
with<00:02:45.860> this<00:02:46.069> a<00:02:46.370> couple<00:02:46.610> of<00:02:46.790> months<00:02:47.030> ago<00:02:47.209> but

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
with this a couple of months ago but

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.400 
with this a couple of months ago but
it's<00:02:47.900> growing<00:02:48.200> faster<00:02:48.920> than<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.879> hair<00:02:50.410> that

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
it's growing faster than the hair that

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.160 
it's growing faster than the hair that
still<00:02:52.280> has<00:02:52.489> more<00:02:52.790> process<00:02:53.329> ends<00:02:53.629> because<00:02:53.900> the

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
still has more process ends because the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.500 
still has more process ends because the
texturizer<00:02:54.560> took<00:02:55.099> more<00:02:55.549> on<00:02:55.790> this<00:02:56.000> hair<00:02:56.239> here

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
texturizer took more on this hair here

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.449 
texturizer took more on this hair here
so<00:02:57.019> that's<00:02:57.200> why<00:02:57.349> I<00:02:57.379> have<00:02:57.620> more<00:02:57.799> straight<00:02:58.099> ends

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
so that's why I have more straight ends

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.039 
so that's why I have more straight ends
so<00:03:01.000> that's<00:03:02.000> my<00:03:02.150> story<00:03:02.359> guys<00:03:02.659> I'm<00:03:02.959> getting

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
haven't gotten tired of transitioning

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.150 
haven't gotten tired of transitioning
yet<00:03:23.510> I<00:03:23.810> have<00:03:24.019> no<00:03:24.169> idea<00:03:24.500> how<00:03:24.620> long<00:03:24.829> I'm<00:03:24.950> going<00:03:25.099> to

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
yet I have no idea how long I'm going to

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.670 
yet I have no idea how long I'm going to
transition<00:03:25.609> I<00:03:26.030> may<00:03:26.630> never<00:03:26.930> have<00:03:27.169> to<00:03:27.200> really<00:03:27.530> do

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
transition I may never have to really do

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.920 
transition I may never have to really do
a<00:03:27.709> big<00:03:27.980> shot<00:03:28.250> especially<00:03:28.609> since<00:03:29.120> all<00:03:29.630> this

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
a big shot especially since all this

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.690 
a big shot especially since all this
hair<00:03:30.169> is<00:03:30.290> already<00:03:30.440> transitioned<00:03:31.250> so<00:03:31.549> I

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
hair is already transitioned so I

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.789 
hair is already transitioned so I
wouldn't<00:03:32.090> you<00:03:32.690> know<00:03:32.720> this<00:03:33.500> has<00:03:33.650> definitely

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
wouldn't you know this has definitely

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.150 
wouldn't you know this has definitely
passed<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:35.049> teeny-weenie<00:03:36.049> afro<00:03:36.500> stage<00:03:36.799> back

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
passed the teeny-weenie afro stage back

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.449 
passed the teeny-weenie afro stage back
here<00:03:37.370> so<00:03:38.120> my<00:03:38.900> hair<00:03:39.139> is<00:03:39.169> not<00:03:39.410> really<00:03:39.680> growing<00:03:40.250> a

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
here so my hair is not really growing a

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:41.920 
here so my hair is not really growing a
lot<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.940> you<00:03:41.090> guys<00:03:41.269> because<00:03:41.540> I'm<00:03:41.660> still

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
lot to you guys because I'm still

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.960 
lot to you guys because I'm still
trimming<00:03:42.440> this<00:03:42.590> hair<00:03:42.799> so<00:03:42.980> it<00:03:43.099> catches<00:03:43.340> up<00:03:43.730> with

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
trimming this hair so it catches up with

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.970 
trimming this hair so it catches up with
this<00:03:44.540> hair<00:03:44.780> back<00:03:45.019> here<00:03:45.200> in<00:03:45.349> terms<00:03:45.560> of<00:03:45.739> how<00:03:45.829> much

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
this hair back here in terms of how much

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.390 
this hair back here in terms of how much
natural<00:03:46.220> hair<00:03:46.609> is<00:03:46.699> on<00:03:46.879> there<00:03:47.090> so<00:03:47.629> growth<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:49.310> I

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
natural hair is on there so growth and I

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.710 
natural hair is on there so growth and I
really<00:03:49.760> my<00:03:49.940> hair's<00:03:50.090> pretty<00:03:50.329> much<00:03:50.510> been<00:03:50.690> the

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
really my hair's pretty much been the

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.189 
really my hair's pretty much been the
same<00:03:51.049> length<00:03:51.639> for<00:03:52.639> probably<00:03:53.329> the<00:03:53.449> past<00:03:53.780> couple

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
same length for probably the past couple

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:55.539 
same length for probably the past couple
