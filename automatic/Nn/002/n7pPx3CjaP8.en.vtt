grapes in Michigan it's more than 100
years<00:00:13.879> old<00:00:14.209> but<00:00:14.840> it's<00:00:14.990> really<00:00:15.170> focused<00:00:15.650> on

newspapers in these 70s there was a

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.960 
newspapers in these 70s there was a
professor<00:00:18.800> here<00:00:18.949> at<00:00:19.160> Michigan<00:00:19.490> State<00:00:19.640> his

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
professor here at Michigan State his

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.910 
professor here at Michigan State his
name<00:00:20.150> was<00:00:20.360> Stan<00:00:20.690> Howell<00:00:20.930> he<00:00:21.289> became

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
name was Stan Howell he became

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.329 
name was Stan Howell he became
interested<00:00:22.160> in<00:00:22.640> grape<00:00:23.650> physiology<00:00:24.650> and<00:00:24.920> the

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:25.339 
interested in grape physiology and the

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:27.669 
interested in grape physiology and the
possibility<00:00:26.000> of<00:00:26.029> having<00:00:26.480> actual<00:00:27.230> wine<00:00:27.410> grapes

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:27.679 
possibility of having actual wine grapes

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.890 
possibility of having actual wine grapes
here<00:00:27.919> and<00:00:28.189> he<00:00:28.490> was<00:00:28.669> the<00:00:28.820> one<00:00:28.970> who<00:00:29.029> really<00:00:29.539> was

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
here and he was the one who really was

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.890 
here and he was the one who really was
doing<00:00:30.109> all<00:00:30.439> of<00:00:30.500> the<00:00:31.009> preliminary<00:00:31.820> research<00:00:32.119> to

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
doing all of the preliminary research to

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.660 
doing all of the preliminary research to
make<00:00:33.080> it<00:00:33.260> possible<00:00:33.500> for<00:00:33.890> Michigan<00:00:34.430> to<00:00:34.460> get

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
make it possible for Michigan to get

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.390 
make it possible for Michigan to get
back<00:00:35.120> into<00:00:35.600> the<00:00:35.840> wine<00:00:35.990> business<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:36.770> we<00:00:37.220> knew

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
back into the wine business and we knew

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.060 
back into the wine business and we knew
that<00:00:37.640> what<00:00:37.850> we<00:00:37.970> needed<00:00:38.210> were<00:00:38.750> wine<00:00:39.200> grapes<00:00:39.680> and

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
that what we needed were wine grapes and

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.550 
that what we needed were wine grapes and
not<00:00:40.190> juice<00:00:40.640> grapes<00:00:41.090> and<00:00:41.450> that's<00:00:42.200> where<00:00:42.410> dr.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:42.560 
not juice grapes and that's where dr.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.830 
not juice grapes and that's where dr.
Howell<00:00:43.040> really<00:00:43.460> came<00:00:43.730> in<00:00:44.030> and<00:00:44.210> made<00:00:44.360> made<00:00:44.810> a

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
Howell really came in and made made a

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.140 
Howell really came in and made made a
name<00:00:45.080> for<00:00:45.110> himself<00:00:45.410> was<00:00:46.000> looking<00:00:47.000> at

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
name for himself was looking at

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.120 
name for himself was looking at
empirical<00:00:47.660> data<00:00:47.780> from<00:00:48.170> Europe<00:00:48.470> and<00:00:48.800> then

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
empirical data from Europe and then

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.790 
empirical data from Europe and then
establishing<00:00:50.120> test<00:00:50.570> vineyards<00:00:51.080> all<00:00:51.320> over<00:00:51.650> the

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
establishing test vineyards all over the

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.550 
establishing test vineyards all over the
state<00:00:52.070> to<00:00:52.310> try<00:00:52.640> to<00:00:52.700> see<00:00:53.000> what<00:00:53.360> would<00:00:53.690> grow<00:00:54.020> one

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.560 
state to try to see what would grow one

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.070 
state to try to see what would grow one
of<00:00:54.650> the<00:00:54.740> most<00:00:54.920> important<00:00:55.520> red<00:00:56.360> vinifera

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
of the most important red vinifera

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.440 
of the most important red vinifera
varieties<00:00:57.620> for<00:00:57.830> us<00:00:57.980> in<00:00:58.370> Michigan<00:00:58.790> this<00:00:59.180> Pinot

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
varieties for us in Michigan this Pinot

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.110 
varieties for us in Michigan this Pinot
Noir<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:00.560> a<00:01:00.890> lot<00:01:01.160> of<00:01:01.190> research<00:01:01.460> that<00:01:01.700> we<00:01:02.060> are

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
Noir so a lot of research that we are

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.359 
Noir so a lot of research that we are
doing<00:01:02.240> this<00:01:02.480> summer<00:01:02.750> to<00:01:03.530> try<00:01:03.710> to<00:01:03.770> reduce<00:01:04.129> the

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
doing this summer to try to reduce the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.580 
doing this summer to try to reduce the
number<00:01:04.670> of<00:01:04.699> berries<00:01:05.150> set<00:01:05.479> so<00:01:06.200> we<00:01:06.350> get<00:01:06.560> a

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
number of berries set so we get a

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.890 
number of berries set so we get a
smaller<00:01:07.189> cluster<00:01:07.790> but<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:08.150> same<00:01:08.330> time<00:01:08.630> very

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
smaller cluster but the same time very

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.050 
smaller cluster but the same time very
loose<00:01:09.170> you<00:01:09.950> see<00:01:10.160> that<00:01:10.340> there<00:01:10.490> is<00:01:10.550> no<00:01:10.790> pressure

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
loose you see that there is no pressure

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.910 
loose you see that there is no pressure
between<00:01:11.420> between<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:12.170> berries<00:01:12.500> between<00:01:12.830> each

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
between between the berries between each

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.400 
between between the berries between each
other<00:01:13.100> and<00:01:13.400> there<00:01:13.880> is<00:01:13.910> totally<00:01:14.510> no<00:01:14.720> rot<00:01:15.020> Pinot

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
other and there is totally no rot Pinot

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.980 
other and there is totally no rot Pinot
Noir<00:01:15.650> probably<00:01:16.610> is<00:01:17.210> one<00:01:17.540> of<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:17.780> most

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
Noir probably is one of the most

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.170 
Noir probably is one of the most
sensitive<00:01:18.530> varieties<00:01:19.130> to<00:01:19.310> rot<00:01:19.520> that<00:01:19.850> we<00:01:19.940> grow

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
sensitive varieties to rot that we grow

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.720 
sensitive varieties to rot that we grow
in<00:01:20.210> Michigan<00:01:20.690> so<00:01:21.560> solving<00:01:22.040> this<00:01:22.100> problem<00:01:22.700> for

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
in Michigan so solving this problem for

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.160 
in Michigan so solving this problem for
the<00:01:22.970> Michigan<00:01:23.210> grower<00:01:23.540> would<00:01:23.840> be<00:01:23.960> very

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
the Michigan grower would be very

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.110 
the Michigan grower would be very
important<00:01:24.650> so<00:01:24.680> when<00:01:24.950> I<00:01:24.980> do<00:01:25.100> my<00:01:25.190> experiments<00:01:26.000> in

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
important so when I do my experiments in

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.300 
important so when I do my experiments in
the<00:01:26.240> venire<00:01:26.570> I'm<00:01:26.810> always<00:01:27.020> taking<00:01:27.530> with<00:01:27.680> me<00:01:27.710> the

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
the venire I'm always taking with me the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.740 
the venire I'm always taking with me the
graduate<00:01:28.700> students<00:01:29.180> and<00:01:29.330> a<00:01:29.510> lot<00:01:29.720> of

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
graduate students and a lot of

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.840 
graduate students and a lot of
undergraduate<00:01:30.710> students<00:01:31.040> so<00:01:31.190> my<00:01:31.310> using<00:01:31.700> the

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
undergraduate students so my using the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.899 
undergraduate students so my using the
ALP<00:01:32.150> for<00:01:33.110> my<00:01:33.590> experiments<00:01:34.400> but<00:01:34.580> at<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.729> same

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
ALP for my experiments but at the same

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.090 
ALP for my experiments but at the same
time<00:01:35.210> they<00:01:35.780> learn<00:01:35.990> a<00:01:36.020> lot<00:01:36.380> about<00:01:36.680> what<00:01:36.979> it

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
time they learn a lot about what it

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.910 
time they learn a lot about what it
takes<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.550> produce<00:01:38.030> high-quality<00:01:38.750> grapes<00:01:39.380> in

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
takes to produce high-quality grapes in

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.740 
takes to produce high-quality grapes in
a<00:01:40.070> very<00:01:40.310> difficult<00:01:40.580> climate<00:01:41.210> like<00:01:41.390> Michigan

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
a very difficult climate like Michigan

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.170 
a very difficult climate like Michigan
dr.<00:01:42.080> Sabatini<00:01:42.710> was<00:01:42.979> looking<00:01:43.280> for<00:01:43.490> a<00:01:43.520> lab

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
dr. Sabatini was looking for a lab

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.550 
dr. Sabatini was looking for a lab
assistant<00:01:44.479> and<00:01:44.960> since<00:01:45.200> I<00:01:45.290> already<00:01:45.380> had

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
assistant and since I already had

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.649 
assistant and since I already had
research<00:01:45.920> experience<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:47.240> just<00:01:47.420> walked

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
research experience and just walked

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.990 
research experience and just walked
right<00:01:47.870> in<00:01:48.080> and<00:01:48.229> started<00:01:48.979> working<00:01:49.280> for<00:01:49.490> him

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
right in and started working for him

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.480 
right in and started working for him
but<00:01:50.299> to<00:01:50.420> come<00:01:50.600> out<00:01:50.750> here<00:01:51.020> and<00:01:51.110> be<00:01:51.320> outside

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
but to come out here and be outside

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.160 
but to come out here and be outside
that's<00:01:52.490> pretty<00:01:53.150> much<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.479> main<00:01:53.600> draw<00:01:53.900> and

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
that's pretty much the main draw and

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.530 
that's pretty much the main draw and
then<00:01:54.350> I<00:01:54.650> got<00:01:55.130> bitten<00:01:55.400> by<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:55.640> wine<00:01:55.940> bug<00:01:56.270> and

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
then I got bitten by the wine bug and

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.930 
then I got bitten by the wine bug and
have<00:01:57.470> it<00:01:57.590> left<00:01:57.799> when<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.460> students<00:01:58.850> are

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
have it left when the students are

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.270 
have it left when the students are
coming<00:01:59.060> to<00:01:59.240> my<00:01:59.420> program<00:01:59.930> and<00:02:00.170> there<00:02:01.130> were

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
coming to my program and there were

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.580 
coming to my program and there were
researched<00:02:01.750> responsibilities<00:02:02.750> but<00:02:03.409> also

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
researched responsibilities but also

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.859 
researched responsibilities but also
also<00:02:04.340> they<00:02:04.640> have<00:02:04.729> responsibility<00:02:05.479> manager

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
also they have responsibility manager

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.960 
also they have responsibility manager
Vinny<00:02:06.110> so<00:02:06.740> we<00:02:07.159> do<00:02:07.280> everything<00:02:07.760> in<00:02:07.850> the

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970
