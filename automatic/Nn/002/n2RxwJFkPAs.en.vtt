00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.160
 Courage of respect for you, too 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.160

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.470

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.730
 you can not quite agree 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.930
 the couple here is the red and white but wanted 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.680
 that it worked out that way 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.450
 Dr. Oberschöneweide 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.980

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.570

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.390

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.390

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:24.589
 that would later regret 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:33.709
 Either way, I wanted to have a bigger Gold Community 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.309

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:38.679
