00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:14.180
 at 14 you do not know how 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:16.800
 you think you are the smartest one 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.750
 often listen to the parents 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.600
 I would miss that one, too 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.250
 I already regret some things when I wake up 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.230
 my mum would have been mine 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.010
 maybe a little better through life 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.840
 come 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.840
 in the end, my designs 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.340
 My name is different at the table and me 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.650
 I'm a gourmet seller 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.510
 the cleaning that makes me the most fun 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.030
 I like that everything is picobello 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.440
 Fine and I'll take it on 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.120
 Dearest ones, because yes, because then I am 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.870
 I'm sure it was done the same way 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.870
 it wanted to have 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.120
 to stay calm if you have the customers 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.340
 that's not too polite then 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.500
 There's always this and this one 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.930
 shift change the lingering has it 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.549
 there are new people there are sure to be those 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.310
 I would be ready for a week now 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.350
 once from 13 to 19 and process and 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.740
 the next week from six to thirteen 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.119
 Clock 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.820
 that is then there you need it 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.479
 getting used to when you start here and 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.479
 get in there 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.180
 So my task at merkur exists 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.780

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.789

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.770
 to keep the whole department clean so 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.770
 that it is appealing to a customer and 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.689
 The customer generally looks attractive 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.000
 help if you need market help 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.310

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.899
 you are there department is that you 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:48.020
 they help you to sell 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.840
 Offer active sale to the customer 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.340
 constantly to keep up to date 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.860
 when I come in early the first one 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.289
 what I do is purely in the department 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.600
 the ovens turn on to preheat them 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.580
 Then I'll go get changed 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.920
 down again and then I prepare the 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:08.149
 hot counter before saying the leberkÃ¤se the 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.549
 stilts in the oven then I'll get through 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.959
 from the cold store all the things so 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.360
 the whole baked things to 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:18.010
 refill for the whole so so 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.010
 do it all right 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.239
 then we generally prepare a song showcase 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:28.310
 in the morning before was cut off 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:32.060
 were feeling cakes in the morning 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.440
 make and leave at 7am if we go 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.120
 then come on lock then it is already 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.950
 the first customers and then you do 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.319
 actually only serve 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.690
 basically so especially in the 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.370
 earliest already very much going on the whole 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.290
 children who go to school and the 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.790
 all the workers who are close by 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.689
 Yes 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.340
 I was two years in the hak and has 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.760
 by the way as a saturday force at 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.469
 Miners also in the delicatessen and where 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.540
 I then realized that the hak was not 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:02.099
 This is something I am in 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.629
 So the future imagine what I in 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.209
 the future wants to continue on the 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.099
 I then have a teaching also in the trade 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.159
 not made in the food trade in 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.900
 Another branch is surprised 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.639
 the teaching then was finished has me 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.730
 then not fun anymore and 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:20.280
 I will be back through my old one 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.349
 Ship where I still live a Saturday 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.970
 my strength was again to mercury 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.060
 come and now I am close 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.000
 one and a half years back here 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.989
 You can actually any industry 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.819
 Change food industry if you 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.370
 really behind champion has it when 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.380
 make it fun so fun 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.730
 must say in any case if you are 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.590
 somehow you do not like people 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.140
 surround when you get annoyed quickly 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.870
 I would not recommend it 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.430
 you have to be very communicative and you have to 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.110
 must also be very flexible because you 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.709
 stop acting in something else 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.720
 Working hours have such as the office 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.590
 works on Fridays it is with us 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.150
 until 19.30 before three quarters of an eight you go 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.489
 not on a friday evening either 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.650
 Do not get out of work and on Saturdays 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.080
 is also until 18 o'clock and who to 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.799
 I would not want that either 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.799
 do not recommend
