00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.260
 and we are already here bought and 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.850
 the color or I say a goal to 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.550
 in 3 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.550
 the other one goes big 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.800
 but I'm going to 4 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:39.970
 for the skills we are going to see them with 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.829
 the acknowledgment and that I can show enough of 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.399
 near 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.510
 lounge grabs his new shield then 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.309
 with the e 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.079
 you get a shield full speed 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:57.149
 movement the skill 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:00.540
 and then blocks the toilet pulls for a 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.160
 ally let's see it 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.320
 record the last one let's see the times 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.320
 what donations throw up 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.359
 and then you know that the passive is that 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.800
 fourth hit 

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:19.210
 will study now 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.210
 in all the basics 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.390
 to study at 15 seconds I did not have them 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.150
 a lot and it gets 150 years magical but good 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.200
 Stoner 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.030
 it takes four times but the safest 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.420
 is that you end up seeing brawn with 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.280
 attack creation to empower it that's 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.770
 what w 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.020
 I will repeat it in case you do not know all the 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:49.620
 world already knows how to put minus 56 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.620
 what I am avoiding 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.640
 once set no longer passive 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.490
 the annual contract yes 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.730
 really at your request of the 80s 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:19.340
 because the android pond is a folk 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.340
 it's up to you 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.720
 here everyone is not half is 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.030
 I'll take it three where are you how 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.830
 play not 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.830
 and good is the normal skin 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:41.070
 and now we will take the corner and good 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.070
 this is the brown 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:50.090
 kill dragons on the shield they have to 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:53.470
 the passive then explodes when he pulls 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.470
 fire style option love 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.950
 now they have seen us 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.020
 and then the multi 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.480
 sean penn 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.480
 no fire on the ground 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.700
 so we could also decide 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:22.160
 to scale with life they escalated magically 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.310
 no scale 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.990
 and that make maximum damage 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:35.010
 then the 1 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.010
 I do not know 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.820
 Oh 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.240
 the 2 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:56.060
 and if only one variant in 3 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.660
 dance the same 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.349
 the picture is equal to you 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.349
 I would change the 1 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.570
 the pole burns 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.720
 but it's very fresh in school 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.330
 and well this is the jump does not change 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.389
 much more than now instead of the time 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:23.470
 red blue 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.900
 and it is already 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.620
 then it's here brown I do not expect you 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:32.230
 have liked the video comment if 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:37.710
 you want me to make a skin of some 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.710
 Character that you like especially seen 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.539
 that is, it makes you 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:47.679
 of hearts and I do not know if I had 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:50.080
 bought after putting you are then yes could 

00:04:47.679 --> 00:04:52.839
 buy it this account to buy them 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:57.249
 and you will see that normally when they go out 

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:59.610
 the new ones write are still so that of 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:59.610
 fact is 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.310
 see you later
