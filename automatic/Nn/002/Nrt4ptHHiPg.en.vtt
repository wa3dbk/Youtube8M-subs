00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
closer you get to 60th minute the high

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.959 
closer you get to 60th minute the high
rated<00:00:40.079> cards<00:00:40.410> are<00:00:40.559> going<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.770> be<00:00:40.860> there<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.879> you

can see that I've got halo there on the
30th<00:00:44.309> minute<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:46.219> you<00:00:47.219> might<00:00:47.399> wonder<00:00:47.610> how

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
30th minute and you might wonder how

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.069 
30th minute and you might wonder how
much<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.270> want<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.480> bid<00:00:48.629> on<00:00:48.660> these<00:00:48.840> players

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
much you want to bid on these players

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.930 
much you want to bid on these players
and<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.980> search<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.309> player's<00:00:50.520> price<00:00:50.730> you

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
and to search a player's price you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.819 
and to search a player's price you
literally<00:00:51.180> just<00:00:51.420> put<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.690> their<00:00:51.870> criteria<00:00:52.199> and

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
literally just put in their criteria and

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.680 
literally just put in their criteria and
then<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.460> keep<00:00:53.640> going<00:00:53.699> up<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.059> maximum<00:00:54.480> price

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
then you keep going up a maximum price

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.709 
then you keep going up a maximum price
to<00:00:54.960> find<00:00:55.230> out<00:00:55.730> their<00:00:56.730> lowest<00:00:56.910> by<00:00:57.210> now<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.600> then

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
to find out their lowest by now and then

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.299 
to find out their lowest by now and then
just<00:00:57.750> put<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.109> up<00:00:58.170> about<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.680> or<00:00:58.859> maybe<00:00:59.160> a

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
just put it up about that or maybe a

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.979 
just put it up about that or maybe a
couple<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.609> hundred<00:00:59.850> gold<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.030> lower<00:01:00.180> but<00:01:00.870> if

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
couple of hundred gold is lower but if

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.510 
couple of hundred gold is lower but if
they're<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.260> decent<00:01:01.620> formation<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.039> 4<00:01:02.280> 12

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
they're in decent formation like 4 12

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.870 
they're in decent formation like 4 12
and<00:01:02.550> 2<00:01:02.730> or<00:01:02.940> 4<00:01:03.120> 42<00:01:03.449> or<00:01:03.629> 43<00:01:04.140> it's<00:01:05.040> worth<00:01:05.549> and

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
and 2 or 4 42 or 43 it's worth and

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.550 
and 2 or 4 42 or 43 it's worth and
putting<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.299> formation<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.869> my<00:01:06.930> criteria<00:01:07.470> as

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
putting that formation in my criteria as

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.350 
putting that formation in my criteria as
well<00:01:07.710> because<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.490> will<00:01:08.580> up<00:01:08.760> their<00:01:08.939> price<00:01:09.150> by

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
well because that will up their price by

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.390 
well because that will up their price by
a<00:01:09.390> few<00:01:09.600> thousand<00:01:10.049> coins<00:01:10.200> for<00:01:11.010> two<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.340> two

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
a few thousand coins for two and two

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.070 
a few thousand coins for two and two
cards<00:01:11.820> are<00:01:11.970> about<00:01:12.150> six<00:01:12.450> thousand<00:01:12.780> coins<00:01:12.869> i

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
cards are about six thousand coins i

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.350 
cards are about six thousand coins i
believe<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.500> ever<00:01:14.220> price<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> players<00:01:15.119> do

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
believe so ever price of the players do

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.359 
believe so ever price of the players do
vice<00:01:15.720> because<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:17.040> see<00:01:17.189> something

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
vice because of that you see something

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.609 
vice because of that you see something
forms<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:17.880> doubutsu<00:01:18.299> dare<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.020> i<00:01:19.259> think<00:01:19.320> for
