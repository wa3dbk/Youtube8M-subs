00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello welcome to kitchen for everyone today 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.899
 let's make cold pasta salad the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.620
 ingredients that we will need the 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.920
 following 60 grams of pasta in my case 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.840
 in a special pasta for salads a 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.789
 liter of water 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:23.489
 to tuna 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.870
 sweet corn tomato chopped 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:29.310
 chopped turkey 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:34.430
 pieces of fresh cheese type burgos 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.829
 chopped chive olive oil 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.859
 vinegar 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.960
 and a pinch of salt the first thing that 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:44.359
 we have to do is put the liter of 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.179
 water in a saucepan, put it on fire 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:48.920
 strong and we wait until it boils 

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:51.409
 when it starts to boil a little 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.710
 we added a little bit of the salt that we had 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:57.619
 and let's wait about two or three 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.119
 minutes have already passed two minutes and as 

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:01.850
 we can see the water is already boiling 

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:04.140
 very strong so let's add the 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.110
 pasta 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.110
 a little and we're going to leave it on high heat 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.210
 until the base is cooked have passed 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.640
 eleven minutes and the pasta and enter list 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.580
 so we put out the fire we remove them 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.360
 and let's move on to rinse and drain 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.070
 the in the sink with a drainer 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.070
 let's put all the pasta here 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.040
 and we are going to rinse the water 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.109
 cold so that the pasta cools 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.109
 [Music] 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.230

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.200

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.490
