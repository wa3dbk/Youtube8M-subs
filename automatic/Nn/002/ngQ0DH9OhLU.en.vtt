00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.089
 but 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:11.689
 on Monday 

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:15.200
 personally I'm a fan of the 90's will no longer be solid 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.880
 and I'm his dad 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.130
 reporters 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.130
 Marie Louise 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.119
 lÃ©opold 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.769
 each obviously the gign 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.140
 here a gignac may seem a genius a little despite me a little awkward I 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.860
 means 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.320
 he's crem 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.650
 I just wanted it because that daddy before the birth of the little village and 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.810
 his career but his fame 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:45.739
 all in the air 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.820
 treatment well 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.410
 money work 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.410
 laura 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.940
 until the day 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.550
 where believe in my existence 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.550
 so they are shaking 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.050
 and then all of a sudden obviously in a few minutes the childbirth 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.810
 completed 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.560
 no more work 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.560
 logic 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
 after 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.350
 you have to be precise 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.330
 we do not respect for sophie's golly the historical reality we 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.580
 we have killed the conflict that we like obviously it's more fun 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.070
 into a room 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.600
 but so actually here he reacts at some point after being 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.990
 discouraged she is desperate 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.250
 he says to himself but I will find an idea because I become poor him 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.250
 becomes poster this unfair well I'm going to enjoy 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.909
 2 what 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.150
 8 he wins to get rich as well i'm going to exploit him 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.150
 whatever it is for living with the disease 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.219
 alain akouala at the el-mouggar hall so I leave with iran for my 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:16.319
 concerts I become are that manager and so we play for me I was happy 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.749
 the monkey scholar some small shops that does not hesitate to make 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:21.329
 multiple acrobatics 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.329
 to highlight but a metamorphosis 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.619
 the rebels did better with her 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:32.619
 the current drought 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:37.499
 the actor 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:40.620
 do you know cell 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.620
 so we have to act 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.060
 nothing for us have ourselves 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.420
 seduced as they say 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.879
 the symphonies the great concertos of mozart 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.389
 a puzzle tortosa fin we did the same and his scores without 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.940
 play here by excellent musicians violinists and cellists a 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:00.540
 contrabassist a puzzle 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.240
 accor should we for the repeat not knowing what it helps us 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.689
 a lot 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.139
 and I think that music lovers are also there because yesterday there are 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.049
 a lot of work to do I emphasize the work of Bernard it is he who has 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.189
 priori it's all the musical arrangement and yesterday towards a work almost others 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.970
 mozart compositions what's interesting and who use 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.970
 I find beautiful tripled at the museum that quite 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:23.689
 jobs 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:27.539
 she 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.089
 and to continue 

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:45.969
 the truth 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:47.779
 europe 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:51.459
 he civ for which m 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.399
 often against classical training 

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:54.489
 we master well 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.219
 strong of an instrument even to ask the alms of one is a bit our 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:59.410
 specificity 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.540
 we really got involved in this process of learning 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.719
 several instruments 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:09.069
 that we control the body even more difficult if these rentals of dede 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.219
 to pass a little everywhere because all styles and of course 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:14.619
 a sweetness in all styles 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:18.459
 while just showing that the the barrier and the border between the 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.809
 different musical styles 

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:22.609
 it's something very artificial it's the story that has 

00:04:22.609 --> 00:04:23.640
 wanted to associate with children 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.320
 people who have made differences between different musical genres to 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.800
 the time of mozart 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.449
 but popular music where classical music all were a lot more 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:32.229
 mixed 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.360
 nowadays it is very this entry and we our approach hqe others 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.320
 players chicks 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.840
 so you will see that 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.700
 after the ritual that is played in salsa 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.749
 what do you think of judgment can be played in costume 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:46.289
 for the duck dance to undertake something in its 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.259
 posture sing and play 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:51.259
 ambrose 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:24.129
 i think toulouse would be amused to see the show what i think to be 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.239
 his time is that it's a great comic and maybe mozart to 

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:28.200
 the current time 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.480
 might be the current team dfid indicates gilles exceptional 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.850
 so here I think that 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.560
 for fire liberty includes pt6a social hard is certainly more than 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.560
 all this is a screen will be paid to date 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.889
 I think for them we do not disavow his spirit 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.930
 when we read a little bit of his story when we get closer to reality 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.490
 history in fact 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.580
 it was a use that someone who really wanted to go to 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.659
 people to go do some very concrete things 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:18.919
 you have always dreamed of playing for the Libyan people ever could do 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:23.229
 to thwart for the world cup and we have the pretension to bring back 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:25.470
 mozart at the general public 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.710
 avoid making them accountable 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.710
 in a certain continuity the itunes cia which is released for itself 

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:34.319
 pala 90 hours 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.180
 not really the case 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.180
 what now 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:48.669
 lady to 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.979
 it makes me crazy 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:52.249
