playing ground war something huge when

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.000 
playing ground war something huge when
you<00:03:55.850> go<00:03:56.390> against<00:03:56.600> nine<00:03:56.780> players<00:03:57.079> were<00:03:57.320> instead

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010

kind of played differently but but going

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.819 
kind of played differently but but going
against<00:04:02.690> nine<00:04:02.900> is<00:04:03.140> a<00:04:03.170> lot<00:04:03.350> easier<00:04:03.380> to<00:04:03.680> get

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
against nine is a lot easier to get

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.050 
against nine is a lot easier to get
kills<00:04:04.070> you<00:04:04.160> know<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.400> bombing<00:04:04.700> runs<00:04:04.910> get<00:04:05.030> a

the enemies if they don't have low

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.710 
the enemies if they don't have low
profile<00:04:13.130> on<00:04:13.370> and<00:04:13.609> it's<00:04:14.060> a<00:04:14.120> great<00:04:14.209> decision<00:04:14.480> so

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720

i'm<00:04:36.650> playing<00:04:36.919> against<00:04:37.159> in<00:04:37.280> this<00:04:37.370> game<00:04:37.580> play

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
i'm playing against in this game play

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.309 
i'm playing against in this game play
they<00:04:38.270> were<00:04:38.330> really<00:04:38.690> newbie<00:04:39.080> so<00:04:39.199> i<00:04:39.229> took

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:39.319 
they were really newbie so i took

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:40.990 
they were really newbie so i took
advantage<00:04:39.650> of<00:04:39.889> that<00:04:39.979> in<00:04:40.099> Randy<00:04:40.370> UAV<00:04:40.699> like<00:04:40.879> I

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
advantage of that in Randy UAV like I

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.640 
advantage of that in Randy UAV like I
always<00:04:41.210> do<00:04:41.509> meaning<00:04:42.139> that<00:04:42.169> they<00:04:42.470> probably

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
always do meaning that they probably

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.409 
always do meaning that they probably
don't<00:04:42.889> know<00:04:43.039> to<00:04:43.099> run<00:04:43.280> low<00:04:43.400> profile<00:04:43.849> so<00:04:44.120> i<00:04:44.150> would

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
don't know to run low profile so i would

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:45.999 
don't know to run low profile so i would
suggest<00:04:44.539> you<00:04:44.780> guys<00:04:44.930> to<00:04:45.139> run<00:04:45.289> low<00:04:45.440> profile<00:04:45.860> if

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
suggest you guys to run low profile if

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:47.110 
suggest you guys to run low profile if
you're<00:04:46.129> playing<00:04:46.250> against<00:04:46.550> people<00:04:46.819> who<00:04:46.849> are<00:04:47.000> d

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.300 
you're playing against people who are d
anywhere<00:04:47.750> decent<00:04:47.930> and<00:04:48.289> run<00:04:48.680> a<00:04:48.710> UAV<00:04:48.949> because

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
anywhere decent and run a UAV because

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.409 
anywhere decent and run a UAV because
they'll<00:04:49.460> be<00:04:49.550> bobbing<00:04:49.909> up<00:04:50.000> and<00:04:50.090> you<00:04:50.210> want<00:04:50.360> to

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
they'll be bobbing up and you want to

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.629 
they'll be bobbing up and you want to
run<00:04:50.509> it<00:04:50.599> with<00:04:50.690> threat<00:04:50.900> detection<00:04:51.229> i<00:04:51.639> believe

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
run it with threat detection i believe

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.369 
run it with threat detection i believe
its<00:04:52.789> speed<00:04:53.150> and<00:04:53.389> then<00:04:53.509> extended<00:04:53.990> time<00:04:54.169> which

00:04:54.369 --> 00:04:54.379 
its speed and then extended time which

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:55.390 
its speed and then extended time which
is<00:04:54.500> really<00:04:54.680> helpful<00:04:54.949> you<00:04:55.159> would<00:04:55.280> think

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
is really helpful you would think

through your streaks over and over but

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:00.999 
through your streaks over and over but
that<00:04:59.780> doesn't<00:05:00.020> really<00:05:00.080> help<00:05:00.259> the<00:05:00.530> UAV<00:05:00.830> but

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.009 
that doesn't really help the UAV but

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.459 
that doesn't really help the UAV but
