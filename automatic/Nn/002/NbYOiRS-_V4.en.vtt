which slows hair growth it's also

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.990 
which slows hair growth it's also
important<00:03:18.350> to<00:03:18.410> know<00:03:18.709> your<00:03:18.889> hair's<00:03:19.280> porosity

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
important to know your hair's porosity

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.979 
important to know your hair's porosity
as<00:03:20.630> well<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:22.340> porosity<00:03:22.730> refers<00:03:23.420> to<00:03:23.450> how<00:03:23.959> well

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
as well the porosity refers to how well

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.849 
as well the porosity refers to how well
your<00:03:24.530> hair<00:03:24.829> can<00:03:25.130> hold<00:03:25.459> and<00:03:25.760> retain<00:03:26.000> moisture

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
your hair can hold and retain moisture

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.670 
your hair can hold and retain moisture
high<00:03:27.859> porosity<00:03:28.310> hair<00:03:28.760> has<00:03:29.359> a<00:03:29.389> raised<00:03:30.049> cuticle

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
high porosity hair has a raised cuticle

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.759 
high porosity hair has a raised cuticle
layer<00:03:31.609> which<00:03:32.359> means<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:32.900> hair<00:03:33.170> strand<00:03:33.560> can

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
layer which means the hair strand can

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.280 
layer which means the hair strand can
absorb<00:03:34.160> too<00:03:34.489> much<00:03:34.730> moisture<00:03:35.180> and<00:03:35.720> also<00:03:36.019> I<00:03:36.049> can

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
absorb too much moisture and also I can

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.710 
absorb too much moisture and also I can
leak<00:03:36.500> out<00:03:36.709> moisture<00:03:36.980> in<00:03:37.549> other<00:03:38.030> words<00:03:38.299> it<00:03:38.569> is

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
leak out moisture in other words it is

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.720 
leak out moisture in other words it is
hard<00:03:39.650> I<00:03:40.099> mean<00:03:40.700> it<00:03:41.389> is<00:03:42.200> a<00:03:42.230> hard<00:03:42.650> time<00:03:43.010> retaining

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
hard I mean it is a hard time retaining

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.770 
hard I mean it is a hard time retaining
moisture<00:03:44.380> so<00:03:45.380> if<00:03:45.859> you<00:03:46.160> have<00:03:46.340> high<00:03:46.780> porosity

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
moisture so if you have high porosity

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.890 
moisture so if you have high porosity
hair<00:03:48.290> it<00:03:49.160> will<00:03:49.609> have<00:03:49.760> a<00:03:49.790> hard<00:03:50.239> time<00:03:50.540> retaining

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
hair it will have a hard time retaining

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.740 
hair it will have a hard time retaining
moisture<00:03:51.680> and<00:03:52.370> that's<00:03:52.579> usually<00:03:53.120> found<00:03:53.389> in

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
moisture and that's usually found in

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.940 
moisture and that's usually found in
damaged<00:03:54.290> hair<00:03:55.269> low<00:03:56.269> porosity<00:03:56.510> hair<00:03:56.660> is<00:03:57.590> when

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
damaged hair low porosity hair is when

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.909 
damaged hair low porosity hair is when
the<00:03:58.069> cuticle<00:03:58.579> layer<00:03:58.819> of<00:03:59.269> the<00:03:59.419> hair<00:03:59.660> a<00:03:59.930> strand

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
the cuticle layer of the hair a strand

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:03.640 
the cuticle layer of the hair a strand
is<00:04:01.280> tightly<00:04:01.760> closed<00:04:02.389> which<00:04:03.169> means<00:04:03.470> the

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
is tightly closed which means the

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.490 
is tightly closed which means the
strands<00:04:04.099> are<00:04:04.280> resistant<00:04:04.970> are<00:04:05.630> resistant<00:04:06.440> to

strands are resistant are resistant to

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.670 
strands are resistant are resistant to
absorbing<00:04:07.220> moisture<00:04:07.750> this<00:04:08.750> is<00:04:08.959> when<00:04:09.139> products

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
absorbing moisture this is when products

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.009 
absorbing moisture this is when products
seem<00:04:09.859> to<00:04:10.099> just<00:04:10.340> sit<00:04:10.639> on<00:04:10.669> the<00:04:10.910> hair<00:04:11.180> like<00:04:11.840> it's

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
seem to just sit on the hair like it's

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.740 
seem to just sit on the hair like it's
just<00:04:12.200> coating<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.709> hair<00:04:13.069> not<00:04:13.400> really
