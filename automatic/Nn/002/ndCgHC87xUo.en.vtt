now I'm going to show you I'm going to
show<00:00:09.960> you<00:00:10.019> why<00:00:10.969> grooming<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.210> especially

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
show you why grooming and especially

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.900 
show you why grooming and especially
separating<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.040> launch<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.490> some<00:00:14.639> people

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
separating the launch of some people

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.000 
separating the launch of some people
call<00:00:15.150> it<00:00:15.179> popping<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.839> locks<00:00:16.049> because<00:00:16.710> you're

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
call it popping the locks because you're

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.550 
call it popping the locks because you're
separating<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.910> hair<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:19.080> locks<00:00:19.289> have<00:00:19.529> a

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
separating the hair you the locks have a

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.500 
separating the hair you the locks have a
tendency<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.279> grow<00:00:20.400> together<00:00:20.609> let<00:00:21.180> me<00:00:21.270> pull<00:00:21.480> up

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
tendency to grow together let me pull up

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.080 
tendency to grow together let me pull up
on<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.020> little<00:00:22.199> bit<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.910> why

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
on this a little bit and this is why

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.109 
on this a little bit and this is why
it's<00:00:24.330> crucial<00:00:24.630> for<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.119> separate

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
it's crucial for you to separate

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.750 
it's crucial for you to separate
especially<00:00:27.810> after<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.260> shampoo<00:00:28.730> the<00:00:29.730> hair

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
especially after you shampoo the hair

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.780 
especially after you shampoo the hair
because<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.510> hair<00:00:30.689> because<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.289> texture

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
because the hair because of the texture

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.520 
because the hair because of the texture
and<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.850> coiling<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.870> curly<00:00:34.260> isn't<00:00:34.500> a

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
and the coiling and the curly isn't a

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.410 
and the coiling and the curly isn't a
kinkiness<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.160> our<00:00:35.309> hair<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:36.000> hair<00:00:36.210> has<00:00:36.390> a

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
kinkiness of our hair the hair has a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.959 
kinkiness of our hair the hair has a
tendency<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.079> grab<00:00:37.320> on<00:00:37.649> together<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.610> we<00:00:38.820> want

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
tendency to grab on together so we want

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.670 
tendency to grab on together so we want
to<00:00:39.030> prevent<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.450> because<00:00:39.870> what<00:00:40.440> we're<00:00:40.649> doing

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
to prevent that because what we're doing

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.080 
to prevent that because what we're doing
is<00:00:41.250> forming<00:00:42.149> or<00:00:42.300> helping<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.719> locs<00:00:42.930> form<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:44.129> a

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
is forming or helping the locs form in a

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.850 
is forming or helping the locs form in a
way<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.570> they<00:00:45.719> don't<00:00:45.930> grow<00:00:46.200> together<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.739> we

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
way that they don't grow together so we

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.080 
way that they don't grow together so we
have<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.100> keep<00:00:47.250> those<00:00:47.399> separate<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:47.879> that's

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
have to keep those separate and that's

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.760 
have to keep those separate and that's
not<00:00:48.300> coming<00:00:48.539> that's<00:00:48.870> not<00:00:49.050> coming<00:00:49.260> apart<00:00:49.379> too

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
not coming that's not coming apart too

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.670 
not coming that's not coming apart too
readily<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.670> I'm<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:50.910> gonna<00:00:51.059> literally<00:00:52.020> mist

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
readily so I'm just gonna literally mist

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.160 
readily so I'm just gonna literally mist
it<00:00:52.829> with<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.160> conditioning<00:00:53.850> mist<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.960> watch

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
it with the conditioning mist and watch

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.150 
it with the conditioning mist and watch
what<00:00:55.410> happens<00:00:55.879> there<00:00:56.879> we<00:00:57.000> go<00:00:57.410> see<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.590> now

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
what happens there we go see that now

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.619 
what happens there we go see that now
I'm<00:00:59.399> gonna<00:00:59.550> show<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.879> where<00:01:00.120> she<00:01:00.270> has<00:01:00.449> some

those hairs are between there are

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.070 
those hairs are between there are
starting<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.580> grab<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.180> adjoining<00:01:18.570> locks

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
starting to grab on to adjoining locks

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.450 
starting to grab on to adjoining locks
these<00:01:19.439> are<00:01:19.590> locks<00:01:19.770> up<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.040> top<00:01:20.250> these<00:01:20.400> are

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
these are locks up to top these are

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.800 
these are locks up to top these are
locks<00:01:20.729> down<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.060> bottom<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.509> hairs

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
locks down to bottom and you have hairs

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.870 
locks down to bottom and you have hairs
in<00:01:21.990> between<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.250> needs<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.520> be<00:01:23.640> separated

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
in between so that needs to be separated

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.289 
in between so that needs to be separated
but<00:01:24.810> look<00:01:25.020> she's<00:01:25.320> really<00:01:25.650> meshing<00:01:26.130> here<00:01:26.520> can

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
but look she's really meshing here can

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.609 
but look she's really meshing here can
you<00:01:27.390> see<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.979> this<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.130> almost<00:01:30.560> this<00:01:31.560> is

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you see that and this is almost this is

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.740 
you see that and this is almost this is
really<00:01:32.009> that's<00:01:32.729> really<00:01:33.060> really<00:01:33.270> bad<00:01:33.329> there

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
really that's really really bad there

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.880 
really that's really really bad there
that's<00:01:33.900> not<00:01:34.020> gonna<00:01:34.170> pull<00:01:34.409> together<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.829> I

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
that's not gonna pull together so I

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.140 
that's not gonna pull together so I
could<00:01:35.040> do<00:01:35.130> something<00:01:35.159> special<00:01:35.640> with<00:01:35.939> these

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
could do something special with these

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.359 
could do something special with these
but<00:01:36.840> look<00:01:36.990> at<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.500> see<00:01:37.650> how<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.950> hair<00:01:38.250> is

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
but look at that you see how the hair is

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.179 
but look at that you see how the hair is
starting<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.759> grow<00:01:39.119> together<00:01:40.079> you'll<00:01:40.920> see<00:01:41.100> if

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
starting to grow together you'll see if

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.960 
starting to grow together you'll see if
I'm<00:01:41.310> Gill<00:01:41.490> more<00:01:41.640> closer<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:46.640> okay<00:01:47.640> let's
