00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:19.360

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.120
 share of knowing of discovering a 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.300
 super entertaining person interesting

 costumes in different different data 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.970
 aspects because people do not know much 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.350

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.820

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.070
 and I like it 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.860
 and the question 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:19.110
 according to what he said what he said is 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.269
 a set of civil buildings 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:36.030
 religious 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:36.030
 in the south of the square for the world 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.079
 start with the tips in Russian hey have 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.209
 where the family will arrive no longer the village 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.469

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.569
 mom is on the other side but nobody has 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:52.430
 final we do not have a house or not in panama 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.760
 we have carlos we have where to get 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.760
 we have 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:12.069
 in the summer on the climate of Moscow 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.069
 because we arrived but 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.129
 he says maura cap take you high because 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.129
 It is very cold 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:30.280
 it's cold the heat does not heat up 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:36.769
 so put me the goat we should know 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.099
 the differences between a polo is 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:42.549
 question in chile six verses clear a 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:47.269
 tropical celebrated its great trafficker 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:49.819
 Brazilian tropical and a cold and Nordic 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.319
 Russian that comes leaving headquarters too 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.389
 of dialogue love because he lives in 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.720
 argentina a mixture is that a mixture 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.760
 He also has a lot from the Latin thing 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.069
 but these years 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.829
 in argentina the Russian thing for example 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.110
 that the fall of Russian I believe in addition I 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:11.319
 I think that personality and character 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.319
 things about that is like half german 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:28.520
 how to know ordered things are like this 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:31.600
 they are from a line there is no how technician is 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.600
 very good is very good 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.419
 then it's like super reliable if you 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.789
 says something does it at the time it is 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.610
 committed today arrives happens any 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:45.310
 thing if it arrives as it is as well and 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.889
 so we have attacked with the schedules 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.260
 there is no commitment not to lock each 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:55.120
 two but always patient gave their 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.120
 8 words when 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:06.690
 I hate that Chileans find that they are 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:10.259
 very faithful Chileans and Latinos in 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:14.220
 not Chileans and what they read 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:16.740
 of many friends who are pololeando 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.050
 then months I do not understand and viewings 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.729
 looking right it 's clear that you 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:29.629
 they tell things that show them with 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:29.629
 make sure you are seeing the reality 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.540
 not but for example from the computer if 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.590
 you do not have because suddenly that 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.590
 any one needs then 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.970
 look I think that one has to place 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.070
 some time you need to review the 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.560
 bills 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.780
 the fundamental link space in each 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.400
 one has its space but square that 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.720
 you have to get the other thing what 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.640
 was really if one does not have anything 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.910
 what to hide really because Andrei 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:11.230
 with and it is the duty to know him 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:13.420
 mine is mine and yours is mine but 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.820
 clear certain times certainly when 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.200
 it suits us is sometimes a clear one can 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.600
 have all the confidence is the super faithful 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.400
 but there are things that go out of context and 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.550
 one can suddenly check without 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.550
 understand the pound of madrid where the 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.550
 problem 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:37.590
 looking for things 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:37.590
 against the messages 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:50.650
 one thing that also matters the origin 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:53.229
 let's say because the hip movement 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:56.010
 I do not know I do not know to whom everywhere as 

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:56.010
 camps to dance 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:06.120
 with a lot of listening movement and the 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.120
 Russian is who I am and half 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:13.620
 he is a hip hop dancer and the gymnast 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.620
 so 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:29.270
 and hip hop dancer and singer joss 

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.810
 gymnastics after the gymnast in 

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.810
 Argentina 

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.560
 it's called gymnast 

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:56.240
 Today we are just talking about CristiÃ¡n 

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.240
 arriagada you saw where 

00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:06.050
 yes, I have seen what it is that they have 

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:06.050
 suddenly happened in the commercial
