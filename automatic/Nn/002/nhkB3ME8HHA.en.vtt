00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
 two 

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.319
 hello youtube friends as they walk in 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:10.370
 this video I will teach you how to trick 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.310
 a 110 motorcycle lock makes a lock 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:18.039
 of helmet d 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:19.960
 Raul or the starting part 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.960
 what we are going to do is to modify 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.760
 this drum so that a key that neither of 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.780
 can work here 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.970
 How can you see these birds here? 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.920
 to work 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.329
 it does not work 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.519
 and what we are going to do is going to be 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.460
 modify the inner part of the drum 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:42.620
 so that in order to adapt a key 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.190
 I do not know what we're going to do first 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.190
 will disarm 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:57.039
 [Applause] 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.780
 we remove the mechanism that releases the 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.990
 work 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.990
 [Applause] 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.670
 [Applause] 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.670
 we get the job 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.850
 then on the inside 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.750
 we go down a critical loop inside 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.750
 the second saw 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.560
 we push the drum 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.560
 [Music] 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.170
 good as we can see this is the 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.920
 which locking mechanism is that when 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.159
 we put the key to accommodate 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.159
 the way the key 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.530
 as we can see there are some obstacles that 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.220
 what we do is lifted 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.310
 we have to do is that this is smooth 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.310
 to rotate inside the 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.030
 drum well what are we going to do is going to 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.030
 be with the key 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.420
 and the city of a crime 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.940
 [Applause] 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.319
 let's file the sleepers so that 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.820
 stay at the height of the drum 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.979
 ah 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.979
 [Applause] 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.030
 [Applause] 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:14.229
 [Applause] 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.459
 to 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.230
 something like that 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.880
 the last one is not necessary to file because it is 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.180
 simply a stop to not stop the 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.180
 drum 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.480
 now we assemble it 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.060
 until the last obstacle 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.710
 A) Yes 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.490
 [Applause] 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.490
 and we call 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.699
 ah 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:33.039
 Hahaha 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.790
 in the spring 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.790
 ah 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.500
 [Music] 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.699
 [Applause] 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.699
 [Music] 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.130
 or is it a little bit 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.399
 we put the lid 

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:37.369
 good 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.470
 as we can see 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.680
 but perfection we work 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.100
 [Applause] 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.920
 olive 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:59.050
 this system works for the drums 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:06:02.440
 of lock of helmet lock of trunk and good 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.680
 this apparent case I do not have it but the 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.030
 of the main lock of the motorbike 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.980
 only change the method to disarm 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.830
 in this case different but the mechanism 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:15.240
 same in all in good I hope that 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.240
 have you enjoyed a greeting
