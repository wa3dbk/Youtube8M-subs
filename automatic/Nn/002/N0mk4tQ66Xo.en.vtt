00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:11.759
 dokic at the train meeting 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.259
 india 14 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:16.829
 of January he had 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.359
 the society street fancier 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.050
 isa union that was seen 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.130
 in that food and development though 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.859
 It's a lot of people 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:32.240
 that would return to face new how nice that had that last night and hopefully it 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:33.940
 repeat again very soon 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.300
 for 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.500
 for this that we like so much that it is very common that the passion of 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.630
 iztapalapa giokela colombofilia 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.050
 if it seems that the tc did not know any we started the year 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.850
 in the control session after 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.900
 very reprehensible 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.850
 its by yahoo comments 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.880
 it was very nice goal 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.730
 we try to inform and not 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.710
 have a good time friend and brother 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.740
 clear why 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.510
 personally we reporter 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.750
 it happens here we our city and we say but 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.380
 I think 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.880
 gil maybe we are like we are the pigeon fancier 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.150
 because there is a little bit 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
 very united even though we are not a large quantity 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.940
 It has just been a city of Cáceres 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.120
 60 70 thousand inhabitants 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.920
 30 associates 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.920
 of which 16 and 17 compete 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.619
 it's a good number despite how it is because even in some countries of 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:37.370
 Europe 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.370
 7 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.850
 a great sport that the second sport 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.360
 it's fine this has worked with whole city spread society 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.700
 but 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.439
 so let's hope that here is a mercedina traveler can achieve what 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.360
 we always want the union that works for 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.250
 point is a good climate 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.710
 now we hope to continue with that enthusiasm with panama 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.219
 michael waltrip town 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:09.349
 the famous chelís 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.579
 I have in front 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:15.709
 returning to recover his quilín stroll 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.779
 what I have done in my taste a lot of strength and integration between 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.689
 two generations 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.539
 admitted let's say generations because 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:28.759
 we do not commit Sunday on the subject track 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:32.179
 he wanted medium-low so on the tables 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:33.309
 Ismailia 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:39.099
 very few people and less than 50 finally watched if a panning and most of the 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.849
 what 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.979
 of the president were all over 50 and then 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.829
 Ines better than what the Canary Islands had been that was persecuted 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.549
 if he had found out 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.169
 almost full 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:54.169
 many under 30 years 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:57.119
 Mars keep in mind everything 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:59.390
 the four under 30 and who 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.069
 of the four majors of 50 charges 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.379
 so peru the integration linda a respect and a kind a clique 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.989
 extraordinary really that night I was very happy 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.459

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.139

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:22.939

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.949
 it remains totally positive beyond 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.229
 reed specify things in me 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:29.789
 the world bank bm 

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:30.869

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.279
 a happy because 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:38.199
 after getting ahead was little 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:39.559

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.849

 not only doing radiophilia daract to the radio 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:03.309
