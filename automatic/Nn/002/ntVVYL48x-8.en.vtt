problems<00:02:28.110> with<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:29.610> probably<00:02:30.030> differs

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
problems with it and probably differs

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.900 
problems with it and probably differs
for<00:02:30.480> each<00:02:30.540> one<00:02:30.810> again<00:02:30.930> also<00:02:31.740> as<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.040> renowned

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
for each one again also as the renowned

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.030 
for each one again also as the renowned
problem<00:02:33.330> with<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.540> arm<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:34.560> she'll<00:02:34.740> get<00:02:34.860> to

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
problem with the arm and she'll get to

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.660 
problem with the arm and she'll get to
in<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.220> moment

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
in a moment

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.540 
in a moment
luckily<00:02:36.300> mine's<00:02:36.630> not<00:02:36.870> broken<00:02:37.080> but<00:02:37.500> yeah
