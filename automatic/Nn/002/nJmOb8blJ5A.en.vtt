00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.449 
fabulous there's no other university
that<00:03:37.540> has<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:37.870> combination<00:03:38.470> of<00:03:38.650> student<00:03:39.250> body

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459

does<00:03:44.410> Baylor<00:03:44.769> I<00:03:45.280> really<00:03:45.670> think<00:03:45.940> that<00:03:46.390> the

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
does Baylor I really think that the

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.199 
does Baylor I really think that the
small<00:03:47.560> classes<00:03:48.069> allows<00:03:48.580> you<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:49.060> learn

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
small classes allows you to learn

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.690 
small classes allows you to learn
material<00:03:49.720> really<00:03:49.900> well<00:03:50.160> but<00:03:51.160> also<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:51.519> large

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
material really well but also the large

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.490 
material really well but also the large
pre-med<00:03:52.120> population<00:03:52.660> gives<00:03:52.900> you<00:03:53.019> a<00:03:53.140> lot<00:03:53.470> of

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
pre-med population gives you a lot of

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.990 
pre-med population gives you a lot of
really<00:03:53.739> great<00:03:53.920> resources<00:03:54.130> that<00:03:54.670> you<00:03:54.880> can

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
really great resources that you can

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.720 
really great resources that you can
