00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:16.280 
the way and it's easier to cut it off
before<00:03:10.830> we<00:03:11.070> cut<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:14.610> shirt<00:03:15.300> into<00:03:15.480> strips<00:03:15.990> then

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
before we cut the shirt into strips then

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:28.510 
before we cut the shirt into strips then
it<00:03:16.950> is<00:03:17.100> after<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:18.870> saves<00:03:19.140> your<00:03:19.350> step<00:03:19.620> later<00:03:21.230> so

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.890 

what<00:03:29.150> this<00:03:29.330> is<00:03:29.510> neat<00:03:29.780> this<00:03:30.050> and<00:03:30.500> as<00:03:31.900> straight

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
what this is neat this and as straight

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.990 
what this is neat this and as straight
as<00:03:33.050> possible<00:03:33.280> now<00:03:34.280> we're<00:03:34.550> going<00:03:34.640> to<00:03:34.700> cut<00:03:34.880> these

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
as possible now we're going to cut these

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.140 
as possible now we're going to cut these
an<00:03:35.150> approximately<00:03:36.050> 1<00:03:36.350> inch<00:03:36.710> you<00:03:37.670> see<00:03:38.000> I've<00:03:38.120> got

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
an approximately 1 inch you see I've got

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.210 
an approximately 1 inch you see I've got
my<00:03:38.390> board<00:03:38.810> 1<00:03:39.770> inch<00:03:40.130> pieces<00:03:40.880> a<00:03:41.920> little<00:03:42.920> less

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
my board 1 inch pieces a little less

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
my board 1 inch pieces a little less
little<00:03:43.490> more<00:03:43.670> it's<00:03:43.820> not<00:03:43.880> a<00:03:44.000> big<00:03:44.150> deal<00:03:46.240> there's

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240 
little more it's not a big deal there's

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:56.050 
little more it's not a big deal there's
one<00:03:50.590> and<00:03:51.590> two<00:03:53.710> so<00:03:54.710> after<00:03:55.280> we<00:03:55.400> go<00:03:55.580> through<00:03:55.910> and

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
one and two so after we go through and

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.810 
one and two so after we go through and
cut<00:03:56.270> all<00:03:56.480> of<00:03:56.690> these<00:03:59.320> individually<00:04:00.520> then<00:04:01.520> what

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
cut all of these individually then what

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.770 
cut all of these individually then what
I'm<00:04:01.910> gonna<00:04:02.090> do<00:04:02.300> is<00:04:02.570> I'm<00:04:02.780> gonna<00:04:02.960> so<00:04:04.600> I'm<00:04:05.600> not

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna so I'm not

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.180 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna so I'm not
sewing<00:04:06.050> machine<00:04:06.580> them<00:04:07.580> together<00:04:08.260> yeah<00:04:09.260> gonna

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
sewing machine them together yeah gonna

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.190 
sewing machine them together yeah gonna
have<00:04:10.460> to<00:04:10.670> solve<00:04:10.910> if<00:04:11.450> you<00:04:11.630> don't<00:04:11.840> have<00:04:11.930> a<00:04:12.020> sewing

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
have to solve if you don't have a sewing

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.150 
have to solve if you don't have a sewing
machine<00:04:12.460> you<00:04:13.460> can<00:04:13.730> tie<00:04:14.210> them<00:04:14.950> but<00:04:15.950> when<00:04:16.130> you

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
machine you can tie them but when you

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.750 
machine you can tie them but when you
tie<00:04:16.610> them<00:04:17.170> you<00:04:18.170> have<00:04:18.290> to<00:04:18.410> tie<00:04:18.620> them<00:04:18.799> in<00:04:18.920> a<00:04:19.040> solid

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
tie them you have to tie them in a solid

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.070 
tie them you have to tie them in a solid
square<00:04:19.970> knot<00:04:20.299> or<00:04:20.510> else<00:04:20.630> they<00:04:20.810> will<00:04:20.930> come

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
square knot or else they will come

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:28.010 
square knot or else they will come
undone<00:04:21.490> or

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.990 

or<00:04:30.380> you<00:04:31.380> can<00:04:31.560> also<00:04:31.740> connect<00:04:32.340> them<00:04:32.430> another<00:04:32.789> way

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
or you can also connect them another way

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.659 
or you can also connect them another way
which<00:04:33.180> I<00:04:33.300> could<00:04:33.509> show<00:04:33.690> you<00:04:33.750> but<00:04:34.130> I<00:04:35.130> prefer<00:04:35.639> to

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
which I could show you but I prefer to

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:42.379 
which I could show you but I prefer to
say<00:04:36.180> because<00:04:36.690> I<00:04:36.780> like<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.229> meet<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:42.180> neatness

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
say because I like the meet the neatness

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:49.360 
say because I like the meet the neatness
of<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:43.560> scene

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.960 

so

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.640 

almost<00:04:55.970> to<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.240> end<00:04:56.479> here<00:04:56.840> this<00:04:57.259> one's<00:04:57.470> going

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
almost to the end here this one's going

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.020 
almost to the end here this one's going
to<00:04:57.710> be<00:04:57.770> a<00:04:57.860> little<00:04:58.039> bit<00:04:58.250> off<00:04:58.430> but<00:04:58.699> I'm<00:04:58.789> going<00:04:58.970> to

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
to be a little bit off but I'm going to

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.670 
to be a little bit off but I'm going to
do<00:04:59.180> is<00:04:59.330> I'm<00:04:59.600> just<00:04:59.660> going<00:05:00.020> to<00:05:00.050> even<00:05:00.380> it<00:05:00.500> up<00:05:02.680> I'm

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
do is I'm just going to even it up I'm

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.409 
do is I'm just going to even it up I'm
not<00:05:03.800> worried<00:05:04.100> about<00:05:04.160> this<00:05:04.460> piece

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.720 

so<00:05:08.419> now<00:05:09.730> now<00:05:10.730> that<00:05:10.760> I<00:05:10.940> have<00:05:11.150> those<00:05:11.360> all<00:05:12.200> done

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
so now now that I have those all done

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:21.100 
so now now that I have those all done
you<00:05:13.730> take<00:05:14.120> them<00:05:15.490> and<00:05:16.490> sew<00:05:17.270> them<00:05:17.600> together<00:05:20.110> one

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
you take them and sew them together one

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.920 
you take them and sew them together one
at<00:05:21.290> a<00:05:21.320> time<00:05:21.620> or<00:05:22.400> two<00:05:22.580> if<00:05:22.730> I'm<00:05:22.910> actually<00:05:23.120> went<00:05:23.780> to

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
at a time or two if I'm actually went to

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.140 
at a time or two if I'm actually went to
the<00:05:24.020> next<00:05:24.350> and<00:05:25.220> connect<00:05:26.060> them<00:05:26.210> and<00:05:26.240> create<00:05:26.750> a

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
the next and connect them and create a

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.440 
the next and connect them and create a
long<00:05:29.150> strip<00:05:29.780> of<00:05:29.900> yarn<00:05:30.169> or<00:05:30.850> not<00:05:31.850> yarn<00:05:32.060> it's<00:05:32.300> not

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
long strip of yarn or not yarn it's not

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.370 
long strip of yarn or not yarn it's not
actually<00:05:32.780> arc<00:05:32.990> is<00:05:33.200> matte<00:05:33.500> it's<00:05:35.110> some<00:05:36.110> people

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
actually arc is matte it's some people
