00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:07.040
 hello friends and welcome once again to 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.040
 one of the tutorials of tables 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.300
 well the other day a boy asked me 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.869
 especially on facebook for a trick 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.189
 of a routine that you had seen then 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.500
 I was checking it I thought that what 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.200
 I had but what I really had was him 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.030
 the total bread 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.300
 and this trick that I'm going to teach you is 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.540
 much simpler and it's the beginning of 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.220
 the topa bread application is like a 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.200
 kind of insolation the trick itself 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.950
 consists in 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.950
 in this 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.230
 and the ball that I'm using is a 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.380
 training of 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.710
 of play is still a kind of 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.239
 core to add weights and good the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.680
 result is not exactly the same as 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.860
 with a critical ball of cons but 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.600
 as I had to come with a backpack and 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.759
 so I prefer to carry this to be able 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.180
 train and do not break to wear a 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:18.630
 criticism and that here it breaks on the ground 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.490
 Take steps that you must do to 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.810
 this trick first position 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.510
 hand in hand 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.400
 is the hand fully extended 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.430
 you can 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.980
 so with the thumb and this hand the same 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.310
 then you have to know how to match 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:41.520
 the back of the hand this part of 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.700
 here with this gap that you have between 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.650
 little finger and this next finger that is the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.530
 heart second memory 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.760
 then you would put your hand here 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.370
 heart 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.220
 and here 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.860
 wrong 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.550
 and that's in this way you'll have the ball 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.500
 here you put but 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:09.990
 you put the ball drops you put the ball that 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.760
 you put the ball that is tilting a 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.190
 little hand to you bow down is 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.680
 a little hand down and it's going to come out 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.190
 it is to incline less and less the 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.460
 position and is to continue doing 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.250
 the newspaper is practically very 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.470
 simple is to match these two fingers 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.880
 with this part of here and vice versa and it's 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.880
 a movement of matches 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.819
 would lower the ball as in front I put 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.970
 front as before I put front I put 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.010
 in front of 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.250
 and that's what gives the effect of this 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.830
 sunstroke that you 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.850
 this is the hand back 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.850
 while you stop tipping 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.700
 and so 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.319
 the ball seems to be all the time in 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.999
 the 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.189
 in the same place at the moment 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:06.709
 you can give them some speed and it's 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:09.139
 it's exactly a ball that gives and I hope 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:13.299
 that you liked the tutorial and we 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:13.299
 we see in another so nothing until later
