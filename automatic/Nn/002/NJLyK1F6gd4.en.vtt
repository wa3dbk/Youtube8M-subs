00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.300
 ah 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.030
 good your fears to a good new video 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.440
 we are in a game called wait vale 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.500
 really the way in which what 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:18.400
 discovering was pretty curious I was 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.140
 watching a streaming to explain how 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.520
 although under all good I was seeing a 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.199
 instrument a deadly kombat and good the 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.199
 Uncle when he ended up he started to play 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:28.210
 this and I was freaking out because I had the 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:31.840
 whore looks great, I said 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.850
 when I played it, it really hurts me 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.620
 It seemed like the re really cock 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.140
 it is very very very addictive 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.729
 Sincerely, well, I'm going to tell you that 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.820
 surely many of you 

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:45.400
 you say to me I do not like I do not know what but 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.930
 well those of us who come from games maybe 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.750
 more traditional we had not grown 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.390
 with tetrisia or puzzle games looking 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.769
 very good, well, this kind of 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.530
 games because they call us a lot of attention 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.790
 and they are also as well made as this one 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.430
 really good in the description 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.589
 you will have a beta to download them and if 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.360
 you really want it is that it cost me 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.890
 until you find the game in google 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.780
 really including the name not what 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.100
 I found I could not find it and in the 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.110
 first thing that happens to me with the good game 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.560
 As you can see, it's like a tetris 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.270
 right now I'm playing online myself 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.800
 I'm playing with command to see if I 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.540
 I concentrate well because I'm super 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.630
 regalism and good basically because 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.940
 Well, as you can see, we share pieces and 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.040
 we are pulling faster 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.900
 we were the part and then there are others 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.430
 that has this game is that from time to time 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.800
 when we get attacks 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.500
 special and others as you see this tab 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.810
 has as a kind of light in the 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.840
 center if we destroy health as if 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.850
 outside the normal tetris then we will have a 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.130
 super attack we can spend it and 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.500
 others recommended us to play with command to 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.120
 nothing but I'm with the command of the xbox 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.000
 and the crosshead sometimes plays me bad 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.020
 past is worth seeing if we get a 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.020
 super attack for you to see 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.719
 the game as I say there are not many people 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.759
 playing and I'm surprised if finally 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:06.430
 we have shit done me a dirty trick 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.289
 the fucking command 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.520
 as I say there were not many people 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.760
 playing but it's because this video 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.670
 so there is an important community 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.740
 we could say that you play a few 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.250
 I think it's enough for us 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.670
 have fun 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.410
 everyone and I really good I'm the same 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.060
 a mouthful equal and yet seen from another 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.480
 person or something I like to just see 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.330
 youtube I sincerely see competitions and 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.130
 little more then I already knew it is 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.100
 but I really did not know him and I 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.790
 called a pretty big surprise 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.110
 literally when I had nothing that 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.240
 do nothing to play and in addition to this 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.000
 game is perfect to throw yourself 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.690
 departure and others online 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.220
 we will not like it 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.830
 As you can see, it was so special 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.290
 accumulating we have up to four and with 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.080
 we accumulate more spectacular plots 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.390
 We were going to use it 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.800
 Let's see what I do today I do not know everyone 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.060
 the characters I have no fucking idea 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.060
 what makes you sincerely 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.780
 I literally do not know what does what 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.780
 have 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.700
 and now we're going to lose this script 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.700
 loudly 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.620
 this guy llosa lies 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:29.310
 we are not more finished than 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.310
 that the acabose maybe 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.159
 I'm going to use this to use but 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.159
 although good 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:42.770
 not host and what bad taken advantage of by 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.770
 please what idiot idiot 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.280
 from my mother test 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.390
 as you see the poor these he puts it 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.940
 more interesting one against more pieces 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.830
 break more we send the rival that 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.620
 I also imagine I'll know about super 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:03.800
 logic this games online from 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:07.680
 trees online and so on that is so shit 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:10.290
 grass pasture 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.629
 let's use this again 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.769
 this character is very good as I 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.769
 touch a fucking stick 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.610
 I'm going to use anything to 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.610
 fuck him 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.120
 Amen 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.670
 we have won I think yes 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.540
 dwells quite as you see the game is a 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.660
 it's an authentic past we're going up 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:41.000
 of levels and so on and now is that the 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.280
 shot is a point biz I honestly what 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.390
 I mean very seriously against game 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.340
 pretty fast it seems that it is 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.990
 pretty people playing also good 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.490
 but we're going to leave it here I hope 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.770
 what you really liked and you 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.240
 like the game 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.820
 tell you also that I am not 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:01.430
 4 that the overwhelm many people then 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.960
 I do not really want anything because I wanted to 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.630
 I wanted to bring it to the channel and 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.449
 I really saw it two days ago and I 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.479
 He wanted and 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:16.689
 see it to the channel I think that what is not 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:18.999
 you can add that I do not have then the 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:21.729
 things usually seems like a great 

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:23.559
 Tivo is also free 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.930
 I believe that there is not my publicity inside the 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:28.180
 game or nothing I think they do not win anything not 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.339
 I know the same I'm wrong to forgive me like this 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.529
 I'm wrong, but as I say, I think that 

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:34.240
 I do not even know but they do not earn anything 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:37.150
 develop it the same as when on the 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.159
 whole game as it is a beta as well 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.139
 it's worth money and it does not seem to me to call 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:44.259
 this should cost money is a great game I 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:46.270
 I would buy it for 10 euros 20 euros me 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.499
 I really would spend them 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.870
 it seems a pretty cool game 

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:53.379
 honestly, we are not going to stop 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.210
 here I'm going to continue vitiating and nothing 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:56.919
 we see in the next video until the super 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.599
 next I do not by the way if you want 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:01.180
 writing this game when I 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:03.310
 download as we can do to see if 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.780
 we are and other subscribers and 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.400
 we play 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.740
 I had them I'm going to do this is tremendous 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.950
 I'm not thinking, I would immolate 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.950
 Boys
