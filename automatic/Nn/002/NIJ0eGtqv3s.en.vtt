00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
increase in the count of the viruses and

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.340 
increase in the count of the viruses and
almost<00:02:36.310> kills<00:02:36.610> them<00:02:36.930> therefore<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.080> is<00:02:38.200> the

almost kills them therefore it is the

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.170 
almost kills them therefore it is the

only drug which you know it is much

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.900 
only drug which you know it is much

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
useful for kidney also so being a

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.500 
useful for kidney also so being a
diuretic<00:03:07.209> being<00:03:07.959> antibacterial<00:03:08.800> and<00:03:09.269> also<00:03:10.269> it

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
diuretic being antibacterial and also it

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.170 
diuretic being antibacterial and also it
can<00:03:10.720> produce<00:03:11.280> induce<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.519> formation<00:03:12.670> of

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
can produce induce the formation of

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.600 
can produce induce the formation of
nephrons<00:03:13.750> which<00:03:14.110> you<00:03:14.260> have<00:03:14.410> seen<00:03:15.280> in<00:03:15.459> the

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
nephrons which you have seen in the

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.210 
nephrons which you have seen in the
electron<00:03:16.000> micrograph<00:03:16.810> II<00:03:17.170> that<00:03:17.829> there<00:03:18.040> is<00:03:18.190> a

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
electron micrograph II that there is a

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.789 
electron micrograph II that there is a
development<00:03:18.670> of<00:03:18.940> nephron<00:03:19.450> which<00:03:20.260> comes<00:03:20.590> out

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
development of nephron which comes out

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.789 
development of nephron which comes out
after<00:03:21.040> giving<00:03:21.549> these<00:03:21.730> combinations

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
after giving these combinations

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.770 
after giving these combinations
therefore<00:03:23.799> we<00:03:23.980> suggest<00:03:24.190> that<00:03:24.640> and<00:03:24.910> give<00:03:25.480> it<00:03:25.510> in

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
therefore we suggest that and give it in

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.350 
therefore we suggest that and give it in
our<00:03:25.930> patients<00:03:26.560> of<00:03:26.709> chronic<00:03:27.610> renal<00:03:27.850> failure

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
our patients of chronic renal failure

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.890 
our patients of chronic renal failure
since<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.500> last<00:03:29.760> 20<00:03:30.760> years<00:03:30.790> we<00:03:31.269> have<00:03:31.299> hundreds

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
since the last 20 years we have hundreds

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.449 
since the last 20 years we have hundreds
of<00:03:32.049> patients<00:03:32.230> of<00:03:32.709> chronic<00:03:33.100> renal<00:03:33.280> failure

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
of patients of chronic renal failure

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.430 
of patients of chronic renal failure
which<00:03:34.329> we<00:03:34.510> are<00:03:34.660> treating<00:03:35.110> with<00:03:35.140> this

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
which we are treating with this

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.160 
which we are treating with this
combination<00:03:36.130> but<00:03:36.790> when<00:03:37.120> this<00:03:37.329> combination<00:03:37.720> of

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
combination but when this combination of

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.900 
combination but when this combination of
liver<00:03:39.100> kidney<00:03:39.489> care<00:03:39.700> is<00:03:40.030> combined<00:03:40.840> with<00:03:41.170> your

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
liver kidney care is combined with your

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.110 
liver kidney care is combined with your
immunity<00:03:43.110> it<00:03:44.110> becomes<00:03:44.500> far<00:03:44.829> superior<00:03:45.120> because

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
immunity it becomes far superior because

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.080 
immunity it becomes far superior because
in<00:03:46.480> every<00:03:46.870> condition<00:03:47.290> if<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.340> immunity<00:03:48.730> goes

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
in every condition if the immunity goes

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.440 
in every condition if the immunity goes
down<00:03:49.390> then<00:03:50.170> only<00:03:50.380> hepatitis<00:03:51.070> B<00:03:51.280> virus<00:03:51.549> kills

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
down then only hepatitis B virus kills

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.620 
down then only hepatitis B virus kills
the<00:03:52.750> hepatocyte<00:03:53.470> means<00:03:53.950> liver<00:03:54.700> cells<00:03:55.000> or<00:03:55.390> the

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
the hepatocyte means liver cells or the

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.810 
the hepatocyte means liver cells or the
kidney<00:03:55.989> cells<00:03:56.230> are<00:03:56.440> killed<00:03:56.709> with<00:03:57.100> CRF

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
kidney cells are killed with CRF

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.870 
kidney cells are killed with CRF
therefore<00:03:58.810> to<00:03:58.959> protect<00:03:59.170> that<00:03:59.880> immunity

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
therefore to protect that immunity

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.509 
therefore to protect that immunity
addition<00:04:01.750> of<00:04:01.870> immunity<00:04:02.320> is<00:04:02.560> very<00:04:02.799> helpful<00:04:03.100> and

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
addition of immunity is very helpful and

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.180 
addition of immunity is very helpful and
once<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.269> body's<00:04:04.570> immunity<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:05.200> good<00:04:05.440> the

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
once the body's immunity is good the

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.530 
once the body's immunity is good the
killing<00:04:06.489> effective<00:04:06.970> no<00:04:07.090> iris<00:04:07.359> is

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
killing effective no iris is

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.650 
killing effective no iris is
automatically<00:04:08.140> reduce<00:04:08.620> and<00:04:09.340> adding<00:04:10.329> liver

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
automatically reduce and adding liver

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.000 
automatically reduce and adding liver
kidney<00:04:11.049> care<00:04:11.290> is

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
kidney care is

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.280 
kidney care is
useful<00:04:12.280> therefore<00:04:13.239> Henry<00:04:13.780> will<00:04:13.870> combine

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
useful therefore Henry will combine

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.740 
useful therefore Henry will combine
these<00:04:14.590> two<00:04:14.920> we<00:04:15.640> treat<00:04:15.939> all<00:04:16.239> kinds<00:04:16.269> of
