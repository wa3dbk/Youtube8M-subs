00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.930
 Y 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:31.050
 man is erasmo malacara eri 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.050
 founder of ere aviation daily 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.410
 so that also friends welcome to 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.300
 another video of eri aviation today I'm going to 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.130
 have the opportunity to explain the 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.310
 make me question you about 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.890
 what are the streams the tri level 30 and in 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.330
 actually the 30 are certain systems in 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.280
 certain planes that help us 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.810
 keep the plane under control 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.030
 especially this video that is an airplane 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.740
 high performance among more advanced the 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.870
 heavier plane towards the plane is more 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.940
 heavy in the controls are one is going to 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.820
 go fighting a lot with the plane in the 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.310
 controls by the weight of the plane between 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.680
 bigger heavy heavy fast the 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.390
 edited plane one helps I'm not 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.090
 referring to the autopilot I'm 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.490
 referring to the thirty waves 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.650
 controls that allow us to alleviate a 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.630
 little attention the pressures that 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.550
 we have in the controls that is fine 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.890
 It gets really heavy when it's not flying 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.170
 because it 's a very big plane but with 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.570
 the streams we can others alleviate those 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.250
 pressures 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.930
 imagine what the system is 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.340
 hydraulic we use in the car if not 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.310
 we were the hydraulic system in the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.900
 car the car would be very heavy to give 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.180
 the returns but with a system 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.040
 hydraulic in the car becomes very 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.590
 easy and simple to be able to go around 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.240
 in the car this in a way would be 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.890
 the hydraulic system although we 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.050
 we use the same air to be able 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.180
 help us control the plane in this 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.729
 particular case we have three strings 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.890
 in basic training aircraft 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.259
 we usually have one that is the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.539
 elevator in this well that skyper forms 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.030
 we have two that of the elevator and the werder 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.920
 and more sophisticated aircraft especially 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.430
 two engine aircraft you have three 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.800
 streams the elevator the router and 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.930
 another one that is the one that controls the 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.670
 ailerons only when others go 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.950
 going up we raise the control and if the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.320
 we feel very heavy when pulling control 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.410
 all we do is move this tri 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.750
 up and the plane will feel 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.580
 smoother on the rise or if we're going to 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.130
 descend we feel very heavy in the 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.140
 descent we can move this train towards 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.330
 up and the only thing we're going to do is 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.280
 relieve the pressure for the plane 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.930
 can lower 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.400
 the same thing happens with the router if the 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.890
 plane band is balanced is going to create 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.380
 many drive a lot of weight will go very 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.060
 we can slowly help with this train 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.370
 left to right to relieve 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.020
 the tensions like this plane is a high 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.780
 performance has a lot of power when 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.459
 you accelerate the engine the plane has the 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.470
 trend of the left in a way 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.239
 very heavy very strong which is what 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.069
 we call the beat factor or the trend 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.540
 normal plane to go left 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.709
 because the property has returned is to the 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.600
 right of the plane reaction to the 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.550
 left when they will all look a lot 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.200
 lip you can go to the left if 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.090
 you do not have the right pedal properly 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.760
 just that we give a little bit to 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.590
 router to the right pedal to help us 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.300
 in the takeoff that when we go up 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.519
 we take it off when we go to cruise what 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.160
 we adjust inside we have an indicator 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.650
 that tells us how much we should give or 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.510
 to remove the tri because you are going to 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.230
 have the opportunity from outside how is it 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.390
 that the trip works on the outside 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.430
 and this my friends that you see here 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.549
 this is the control that we do not see 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.620
 when we speak control of the subject 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.599
 down up all that 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.420
 we do is move this surface that is 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.099
 part of the spoiler we move this 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.590
 surface up or this 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:52.930
 surface down and the same air 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.060
 the same impulse of the air makes the 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.910
 elevator the voice control becomes 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.280
 softer the idea is there are no ones 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.069
 fighting with the plane all the time 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.019
 because it becomes very tired what 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.299
 wants this to say relaxed flying the 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.890
 plane and for this you do the train well 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.049
 that in the different stages of flight 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.730
 for example when you go up wings on 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.950
 control and when you go up if you 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.320
 feels very heavy you help with the train 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.900
 and this surface this bit that is 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.639
 here is what helps you move towards 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.460
 up or down to alleviate those 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.289
 pressures the same when you go down the 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.449
 elevator goes down you have to lower the 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:31.270
 nose and you feel a lot of weight you use the 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:33.610
 train and you will see how this peace moves 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.860
 up and moves down 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.830
 we control the plane and we 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.810
 we help with control and that's how my 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.669
 friends like us we use the train 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.229
 we have the elevator train that 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.990
 just showed inside that controls 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:49.599
 this surface basically we do that 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.069
 move this tab this small part of 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:54.009
 here up or down to 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:56.139
 control the elevator and you do not see in this 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:58.150
 plane in particular but on the train the 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.520
 router that I showed you is here in 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.610
 hidden I can only show them but 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.279
 they are usually small surfaces in 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.800
 the ailerons or in the elevator or in the 

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:10.689
 router that help us alleviate the 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.629
 tension the pressure we feel in the 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:15.969
 controls is what we call 30 what 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:17.919
 allows us to make fine adjustments to not 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:19.810
 go fighting with the plane becomes 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.159
 tired this is all I have for 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.360
 you my friends meanwhile for 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:24.310
 please keep the heavens safe 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.990
 fun place in the sky safe anfac 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.229
 in action are we see them next 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.229
 chance 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.900
 and
