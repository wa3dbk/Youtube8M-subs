00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.769
 so good afternoon we are here in 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.900
 fantasyland and one of the places of 

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:11.000
 favorite entertainment for children 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.430
 for young people in these summers where 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.500
 more than 35 degrees of heat in the capital 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.539
 but get close to 5000 people who 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.550
 they come daily to this popular park 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.810
 last night they witnessed one of the few 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.730
 polemics perhaps that have been seen 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.320
 wrapped due to failure in one of the 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.119
 games we are talking about the boomerang 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.499
 that where two cars were scared 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.939
 yesterday about nine o'clock of the night 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:31.519
 that activated a security protocol 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.930
 but better for more details for the 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.730
 people who do not know what happened 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.470
 last night he invited us to see what he said 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.780
 operations manager francisco cabrera 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.480
 about the episode that happened last night here 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.490
 in fantasyland approximately yesterday to 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.100
 the 20 50 hours in our game 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.740
 boomerang that is made up of six 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.830
 cars the sixth car came off 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.720
 this alerted and activated everything that is the 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.110
 security systems with which it 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.110
 produced a safety brake in the 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:04.550
 critical points true and is braking 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:07.380
 it caused people to have an impact 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.820
 this grief that it produces in the background 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.650
 a cervical injury to a group of people 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.450
 we were 22 people 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.070
 about which we say the 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.000
 health centers which all 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.770
 They were discharged at 20 from 24 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.870
 24 in the morning all like 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.460
 considered as minor injuries our 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.490
 game you will see at this moment you are 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.050
 in the process of reviewing this a game 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.000
 which is certified by the standard 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.950
 Chilean maintenance 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.020
 good as we listen to francisco there 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.030
 a minor incident has never 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.240
 happened in a game that is a company 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.740
 Dutch bought it in 1996 and it 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.810
 Over nearly 20 years he never had 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.910
 presented a flaw like this so 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.590
 who wait to see the skills to see 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.450
 what happens with this game we also 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.710
 He informed that people from this company are coming 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.450
 Dutch of which they built 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.940
 this game to see what happened 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.890
 really but it's also close to the 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.450
 noon the health seremi came to 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.280
 review the game to see the protocols 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.600
 of security which is what happened like that 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.990
 who invited us to see what he said 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.790
 the seremi regarding this fact 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.630
 all the people came out for their 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.620
 own media with accompaniment wants 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.400
 say that they are not in 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.230
 severity conditions 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.099
 once they were transferred in that 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.260
 urgency the information we have is 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.780
 that from the medical point of view they 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.269
 they were all discharged and treated 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.410
 rather of a major panic crisis 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:34.190
 of anguish and uncertainty 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:37.820
 in all cases I hugo the pains 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.800
 cervicals in one of them became a 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.550
 scanner to verify if there was any 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.830
 complication 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.440
 the scanner was negative and the person 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.990
 he was able to move to his home so 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.600
 we are both inspecting that the 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.890
 security measure that yesterday 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.710
 they actually happened 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.450
 all the protocols and 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.860
 we are verifying that 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.709
 effectively so this one has 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.750
 demonstration and evidence and take advantage of 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.450
 verify that the rest of the campus is 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.860
 find in good operating condition 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.180
 we remember the people who want to come to 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.830
 fantasyland since the doors are 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.720
 open but that the boomerang that is the 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.840
 game in question is being tested 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.520
 so much for the series vi of health and also 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.020
 for fantasilandia so the people that 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.820
 I want to enjoy it as you can see my 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.640
 back about 5000 people 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.050
 they continue to live in the park follows their 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.810
 total capacity and works all 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.640
 days except for the game that the 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.320
 result of the weeks maybe that 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.480
 happen to him and there will be sanctions 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.250
 so he hit us here in the environment 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.690
 with the screams in the background and with the people 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.950
 who continues to enjoy the holidays 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.950
 summer here in fantasy long
