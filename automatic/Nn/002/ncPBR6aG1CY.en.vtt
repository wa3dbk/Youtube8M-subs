the<00:04:14.830> last<00:04:15.100> tip<00:04:15.430> you<00:04:15.940> do<00:04:16.150> do<00:04:16.630> you<00:04:16.690> got<00:04:16.840> to<00:04:16.959> keep

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.110 
the last tip you do do you got to keep

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.420 
the last tip you do do you got to keep
twisting<00:04:17.770> the<00:04:17.950> board<00:04:18.190> um<00:04:19.830> just<00:04:20.830> like<00:04:21.010> you

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
twisting the board um just like you

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.630 
twisting the board um just like you
normally<00:04:21.700> would<00:04:22.450> do<00:04:22.570> when<00:04:22.690> you're<00:04:22.840> on<00:04:23.050> it<00:04:26.640> just

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
normally would do when you're on it just

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.550 
normally would do when you're on it just
twist<00:04:27.910> it<00:04:28.060> a<00:04:28.210> little<00:04:28.240> bit<00:04:28.660> for<00:04:28.810> like<00:04:28.930> five

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
twist it a little bit for like five

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.980 
twist it a little bit for like five
minutes<00:04:30.030> and<00:04:31.030> then<00:04:31.180> you<00:04:31.240> just<00:04:31.450> write<00:04:31.600> it<00:04:31.840> and

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
minutes and then you just write it and

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:38.010 
minutes and then you just write it and
it's<00:04:32.710> a<00:04:33.300> tiny<00:04:34.300> bit<00:04:34.450> faster<00:04:35.580> so<00:04:36.580> that's<00:04:37.510> my

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
it's a tiny bit faster so that's my

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.070 
it's a tiny bit faster so that's my
video<00:04:38.320> bye
