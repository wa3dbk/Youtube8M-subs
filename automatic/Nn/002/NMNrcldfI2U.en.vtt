00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
home much faster than if we were to just

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.330 
home much faster than if we were to just

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
do a normal you know and I just let it

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.610 
do a normal you know and I just let it
orient<00:03:10.760> itself<00:03:10.880> properly<00:03:11.330> just<00:03:12.170> like<00:03:12.350> every

home<00:03:19.100> I<00:03:20.170> was<00:03:21.170> actually<00:03:21.350> recording<00:03:21.980> this

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
home I was actually recording this

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.180 
home I was actually recording this
earlier<00:03:22.550> and<00:03:22.960> when<00:03:23.960> I<00:03:24.050> first<00:03:24.260> try<00:03:24.560> during<00:03:25.070> the

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
earlier and when I first try during the

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.940 
earlier and when I first try during the
burn<00:03:25.370> my<00:03:25.610> moon<00:03:26.270> failed<00:03:26.600> or<00:03:26.870> partially<00:03:27.710> failed

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
burn my moon failed or partially failed

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.800 
burn my moon failed or partially failed
and<00:03:28.160> I<00:03:28.520> lost<00:03:28.730> twenty<00:03:29.090> percent<00:03:29.330> of<00:03:29.450> my<00:03:29.510> thrust

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
and I lost twenty percent of my thrust

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.780 
and I lost twenty percent of my thrust
power<00:03:30.020> and<00:03:30.740> I<00:03:30.770> was<00:03:30.890> going<00:03:31.040> to<00:03:31.100> keep<00:03:31.250> going<00:03:31.490> but

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
power and I was going to keep going but

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.180 
power and I was going to keep going but
I<00:03:31.850> just<00:03:32.090> thought<00:03:32.210> you<00:03:32.330> know<00:03:32.480> why<00:03:33.230> not<00:03:33.260> why

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
I just thought you know why not why

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.760 
I just thought you know why not why
throw<00:03:34.640> an<00:03:34.910> extra<00:03:35.060> problem<00:03:35.660> to<00:03:35.870> a<00:03:35.900> mission<00:03:36.230> so

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
throw an extra problem to a mission so

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:44.330 
throw an extra problem to a mission so
full<00:03:37.010> of<00:03:37.130> problems<00:03:38.440> so<00:03:39.440> here<00:03:39.650> we<00:03:39.830> go

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.440 

it's<00:03:44.910> not<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.180> burn<00:03:45.330> beginning<00:03:45.690> on<00:03:45.780> its<00:03:45.959> own

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
it's not the burn beginning on its own

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.430 
it's not the burn beginning on its own
under<00:03:48.450> burning

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:03.200 

ours<00:03:54.340> there

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
alright and i'm going to fast forward

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.260 
alright and i'm going to fast forward
without<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:06.090> bit<00:04:06.500> ly<00:04:07.550> shifts<00:04:08.550> the<00:04:08.970> ship<00:04:09.180> is

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
without a bit ly shifts the ship is

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.500 
without a bit ly shifts the ship is
drifting<00:04:09.390> a<00:04:09.690> lot<00:04:10.340> that's<00:04:11.340> no<00:04:11.640> good<00:04:11.820> all<00:04:12.030> right

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
drifting a lot that's no good all right

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.670 
drifting a lot that's no good all right
I'm<00:04:12.600> going<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:12.780> let<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:12.990> burn<00:04:13.170> go<00:04:13.380> in<00:04:13.500> real

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
I'm going to let the burn go in real

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.590 
I'm going to let the burn go in real
time<00:04:13.980> and<00:04:14.610> I'll<00:04:14.790> just<00:04:14.940> come<00:04:15.090> back<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.420> you<00:04:15.480> guys

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
when it's done because the ship suddenly

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.800 
when it's done because the ship suddenly
drifted<00:04:19.440> downwards<00:04:19.970> oddly<00:04:20.970> so<00:04:21.510> i'll<00:04:21.600> see<00:04:21.750> you

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
drifted downwards oddly so i'll see you

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.990 
drifted downwards oddly so i'll see you
on<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:21.989> birds<00:04:22.200> done<00:04:22.440> in<00:04:22.650> 150<00:04:23.310> seconds<00:04:26.000> alright

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
on the birds done in 150 seconds alright

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.660 
on the birds done in 150 seconds alright
guys<00:04:27.210> the<00:04:27.450> burn<00:04:27.600> is<00:04:27.720> complete<00:04:28.110> and<00:04:28.550> it<00:04:29.550> looks

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
guys the burn is complete and it looks

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.430 
guys the burn is complete and it looks
like<00:04:29.820> we<00:04:30.060> consumed<00:04:30.510> about<00:04:30.630> thirty<00:04:31.020> percent<00:04:31.110> of

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
like we consumed about thirty percent of

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.000 
like we consumed about thirty percent of
her<00:04:31.560> fuel<00:04:31.980> with<00:04:32.400> it<00:04:32.580> but<00:04:33.150> that's<00:04:33.360> okay<00:04:33.720> because

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
her fuel with it but that's okay because

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.560 
her fuel with it but that's okay because
well<00:04:35.010> that's<00:04:35.250> we<00:04:35.640> won't<00:04:35.760> be<00:04:35.880> needing<00:04:36.240> too<00:04:36.420> much

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
well that's we won't be needing too much

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.170 
well that's we won't be needing too much
fuel<00:04:36.780> Apollo<00:04:37.380> 13<00:04:37.740> issue<00:04:38.010> wasn't<00:04:38.310> exactly<00:04:38.700> fuel

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
fuel Apollo 13 issue wasn't exactly fuel

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.640 
fuel Apollo 13 issue wasn't exactly fuel
it<00:04:40.020> was<00:04:40.140> more<00:04:40.410> just<00:04:40.460> oxygen<00:04:41.460> and<00:04:42.000> electricity

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
it was more just oxygen and electricity

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.130 
it was more just oxygen and electricity
so<00:04:43.650> I<00:04:43.980> don't<00:04:44.640> like<00:04:45.180> if<00:04:45.480> you<00:04:45.630> noticed<00:04:45.960> when<00:04:46.020> I

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
so I don't like if you noticed when I

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.960 
so I don't like if you noticed when I
was<00:04:46.350> burning<00:04:46.710> or<00:04:47.340> when<00:04:47.460> I<00:04:47.520> started<00:04:47.790> to<00:04:47.880> burn

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
was burning or when I started to burn

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.880 
was burning or when I started to burn
the<00:04:48.510> crosshair<00:04:49.200> began<00:04:49.440> to<00:04:49.560> drift<00:04:49.740> a<00:04:49.860> little

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
the crosshair began to drift a little

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.710 
the crosshair began to drift a little
bit<00:04:50.190> I<00:04:50.400> just<00:04:50.910> means<00:04:51.090> the<00:04:51.240> burn<00:04:51.390> wasn't

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
bit I just means the burn wasn't

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.830 
bit I just means the burn wasn't
perfectly<00:04:52.260> accurate<00:04:52.500> and<00:04:53.030> all<00:04:54.030> that<00:04:54.450> means<00:04:54.630> is

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
perfectly accurate and all that means is

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.490 
perfectly accurate and all that means is
that<00:04:54.900> uh<00:04:55.610> we'll<00:04:56.610> have<00:04:56.790> to<00:04:56.970> do<00:04:57.150> a<00:04:57.480> bit<00:04:58.320> of<00:04:58.350> a

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
that uh we'll have to do a bit of a

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.170 
that uh we'll have to do a bit of a
longer<00:04:58.770> of<00:04:58.980> course<00:04:59.100> correction<00:04:59.610> next<00:05:00.030> or

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
longer of course correction next or

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.390 
longer of course correction next or
least<00:05:00.420> I<00:05:00.570> hope<00:05:00.780> so<00:05:01.020> that's<00:05:01.740> it<00:05:01.890> for<00:05:01.920> this<00:05:02.130> part

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
least I hope so that's it for this part

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.420 
least I hope so that's it for this part
