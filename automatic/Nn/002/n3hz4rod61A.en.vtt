00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
it's definitely gonna come down to

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.850 
it's definitely gonna come down to
consistency<00:01:04.729> I<00:01:05.350> feel<00:01:06.350> that<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.740> ability<00:01:07.159> to

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
consistency I feel that the ability to

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.200 
consistency I feel that the ability to
control<00:01:09.860> myself<00:01:10.039> and<00:01:10.430> just<00:01:10.610> hit<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.000> check

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
control myself and just hit the check

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.789 
control myself and just hit the check
down<00:01:11.390> instead<00:01:11.869> of<00:01:11.930> stead<00:01:12.320> of<00:01:12.409> trying<00:01:12.619> to<00:01:12.710> go

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
down instead of stead of trying to go

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.529 
down instead of stead of trying to go
for<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.039> deep<00:01:13.219> play<00:01:13.520> and<00:01:13.729> not<00:01:14.210> feeling<00:01:14.479> like

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
for the deep play and not feeling like

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:17.170

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
you have to make deep play to make it

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.209

got to work out with those guys I mean I

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.100 
got to work out with those guys I mean I
think<00:01:39.240> they're<00:01:39.479> tremendous<00:01:39.960> players<00:01:40.259> but<00:01:41.159> um

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
think they're tremendous players but um

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.719 
think they're tremendous players but um
honestly<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.350> think<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.619> my<00:01:43.770> ability<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.189> make

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
honestly I think it's my ability to make

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.840 
honestly I think it's my ability to make
play<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.149> mean<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:46.049> only<00:01:46.619> got<00:01:46.799> sacked<00:01:47.100> 13<00:01:47.520> times

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
play I mean I only got sacked 13 times

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.870 
play I mean I only got sacked 13 times
last<00:01:48.119> season<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.810> think<00:01:49.020> it's<00:01:49.219> due<00:01:50.219> to<00:01:50.429> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
last season and I think it's due to the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.760 
last season and I think it's due to the
