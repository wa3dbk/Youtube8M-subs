00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.410

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.870
 There will be in the folder that is called 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:10.040
 roaming and if they have windows xp 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:13.940
 and press the start button more r 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:18.860
 here it will seem to start running 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:21.260
 good here they put percent app data by 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.900
 cent and it's going to take us to it 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.880
 roaming folder we open the folder 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.750
 that says it has the point name 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.690
 minecraft then came and here in the 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:37.190
 minecraft jar file we give you 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:40.700
 Right click open with weaver 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.060
 and this good here we will have everything 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.240
 what is the game 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.920
 let's put here on this shore and to 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.380
 start we have to delete the folder 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.060
 which is called goal 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.799
 because if we are not going to have one 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.070
 black screen but we erase it and 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:02.430
 we put the modes so they eliminate it and 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:05.390
 let's open this the mod loader 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.390
 double click 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.900
 and we are going to copy everything that comes in the 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.640
 rare background file and let's move on 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.250
 to 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.620
 for the minecraft folder 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.680
 they give him the accept 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.160
 and well we have this installed 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.970
 we close 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.560
 now we open the next the games 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.560
 of hunger minecraft fort 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.990
 I put it that again and we're going to go back to 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.060
 copy all 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.480
 they pass it again to the file here 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.459
 ideal in accepting 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.459
 we would have installed already they are well 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:55.069
 now let's install his little hand 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:59.319
 we opened it anyway 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:01.890
 we copy everything that comes in 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.890
 here 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.730
 we eat everything we had here 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.959
 we close this and finally we open the 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.959
 mod of the hunger games ' 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.390
 and we copy everything 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.019
 and we passed it to zero 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.129
 and well, we have installed the 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.920
 mold of the hunger games ' and now 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:37.340
 I'm going to open minecraft to tell you 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.300
 how to start the mod 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.300
 and good and see you 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.319
 Well, I'm already here in main craft 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.340
 I'm going to create a new world 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.860
 can you create the world that you 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.590
 want this 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.440
 I do not recommend that you do it in a 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.170
 world that have important things 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.599
 because maybe I can erase this 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.020
 the structures that they have and all that 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:09.660
 so it will create a super flat as 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.360
 you can create normal trump to me 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.640
 with which in normal worlds well 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.750
 that will create it flat I will put the 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.750
 name of hunger games' 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.210
 after the hunger of the world 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:35.210

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:43.129

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:43.129
 what that gene hunger games says and 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.110
 Now what you are going to do if you do not 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.440

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.449
 they open the inventory and well here they have 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.169

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:04.790

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:07.070

 things of the mod 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.390
 now we close it, we click on it 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:23.360
 right on the ball and good here 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:26.490
 we have the size of the sand of the 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:30.090
 cornucopia that is where they are 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:35.790
