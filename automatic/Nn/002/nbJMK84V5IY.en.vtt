00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.570
 well 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.729
 serious cases of words of which we know 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.439
 exactly the date of birth and a 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.409
 the word inventor was indeed 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:41.539
 introduced by karel capek a playwright 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:43.670
 Czech who in 1920 used it in his own 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.000
 work in which he described how 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.240
 protagonists of human beings 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.240
 artificial assembled from parts of bodies 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.490
 humans therefore something more 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.009
 similar to the frankenstein by mary shelley 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.799
 than modern robots but I use this 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.560
 word deriving it by inventing the dal 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.959
 Czech word robot indicating the jobs 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.640
 word quickly forced 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:09.110
 in the collective imagination, step a 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.500
 indicate any human being 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.100
 artificial in some way replacing 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.250
 the word much older than used automaton 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.130
 since ancient Greece over the years 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.080
 forty of the twentieth century the great 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.090
 science fiction writer isaac asimov 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.700
 he took that word and used it for 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.190
 invent another robotics or the 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.400
 discipline that deals with robots 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.680
 also introducing in a famous story 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.470
 the three laws of robotics or three 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.359
 moral laws that should regulate the 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.820
 robot behavior towards beings 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:45.200
 human up to this point though and we are 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.640
 more or less to the sixties 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.370
 of the last century 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.690
 the word robot exists but does not exist 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:56.180
 still an object to which actually 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.840
 refer is in fact only with 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:03.560
 the 60s that appear the first true e 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.390
 their own industrial robots 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.280
 reproductions 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.709
 of some parts of the human body in 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.870
 detail of the arm of the arms 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.480
 mechanical and able to move 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.360
 autonomously and progressively from 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.760
 60s onwards are spreading 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.090
 in large assembly lines 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.830
 companies and are still an element 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.530
 fundamental to production 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.620
 industrial over the years many appear 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.360
 different types of robots to the point that today 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.750
 it is extremely difficult to give one 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.820
 unambiguous definition of the word there are 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.970
 precisely the industrial robots 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.820
 there are the humanoid robots those who 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.239
 try to reproduce the form ei 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.280
 human body movements what 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.550
 extremely difficult and that I am in 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.640
 reality above all of the tools of 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.709
 research and experimentation used by 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.190
 scientists often just to investigate 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:04.870
 some features of the same 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.580
 cognition of the same human movement 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.380
 there are robots that reproduce others 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.980
 robot life forms that reproduce 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.870
 animals like lizards the octopuses i 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.729
 insects or anything else proper for 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:22.790
 investigate them in particular 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:25.250
 locomotion strategies from the word 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.229
 robot is also derived in the language 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.620
 English in particular one more word 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:33.430
 short bot that indicates is used 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.840
 especially to indicate agents 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.290
 artificial made solely at 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.930
 computer robot software informed if 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.900
 for example we want some viruses in 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.210
 able to self replicate and spread 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.340
 on computer networks but the word 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.020
 robot is now also used to indicate 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.770
 some things that 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:58.430
 at first glance its robots do not seem to 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:00.740
 like the unmanned cars now in 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.330
 very advanced testing phase 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.909
 especially in the united states 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.750
 of America and unmanned aircraft i 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:11.030
 so-called drones that are used by 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.370
 some of the armies of most countries 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.169
 industrialized in particular still 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.379
 once the united states and yet 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:20.180
 being very aesthetically distant from 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:22.940
 that idea of ​​an artificial human being 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.099
 from which chupack had started with 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.039
 the invention of the word I am at all 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:31.539
 the effects of autonomous robots ed 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:31.539
 extremely powerful
