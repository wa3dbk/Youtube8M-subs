00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.840
 hello boys welcome again to 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.430
 my face my name is andres de android 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.500
 Latin and I hope today is 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.810
 find very well today 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.120
 I'm going to show how to root our 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:16.150
 samsung galaxy 3 with the version of 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.820
 android 5.0 lollipop released by 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.300
 samsung officially in a very 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.230
 simple and fast which would not have 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.869
 practically no risk if you 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:30.070
 we correctly so let 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.990
 to see what this procedure would be like 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.000
 Well the first thing we should do is 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.489
 enter the description of this video 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.470
 since there I will be leaving you first 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.590
 the file that we need to raise 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.690
 using recovery that is the file 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.120
 root and I would also be giving them the 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.610
 link how to install a tour 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.370
 advanced since this process would not occupy 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.650
 today but they would occupy a recovery 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.160
 advanced of that file is very light 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:00.010
 only weighs 3.83 megabytes, not what 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.829
 we can see then at this time 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.080
 now simply then already having 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.759
 the file on our phone what 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.229
 we can save either in memory 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.590
 internal or external memory does not 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.149
 there would be no problem then 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.289
 Now we just have to turn on 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:18.490
 our device in recovery mode 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.470
 in that way remember that it is 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.600
 pressing the up key the 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.409
 home key and the power key to the 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.140
 same time 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.850
 let's wait then for it to appear 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.850
 this recovery mode 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.510
 once we are in the recovery 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.870
 just then let's give it 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.720
 install and we will search our file 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:46.490
 that I have shown you previously in 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:49.040
 this case of version 2.46 and what 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.950
 we plan in this way as they see it is 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.170
 very fast is a procedure I do not 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.840
 tired of repeating it very simple 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.800
 now we are simply going to restart the 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.500
 system 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.930
 now let's give it a time so that 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.240
 turn on and I come back with you to 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.570
 and verify that indeed is 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.770
 ironing this auto root and that already everything 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.770
 work correctly 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.540
 good at this moment our 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.130
 device I just turned on let's go to 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.710
 verify then that this application 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.870
 of superuser is already in the 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.260
 application drawer as we see it here 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.620
 this app is already found 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.870
 of superuser 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.670
 we can not see it already has this 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.700
 material design 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.620
 after these updates we are going to 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.290
 verify with ruth checker that 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.110
 effectively we have permits 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.690
 Super user 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.960
 let's then check the access 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.960
 root 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.770
 at that time we just requested 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.220
 permission your rut and as we can see we 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:10.430
 says congratulations has root access 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.700
 so that would be the whole procedure 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.680
 I would then wait for the 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.220
 ejector installer function properly 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.170
 correct on our devices 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.050
 sampson and no longer being remember 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.310
 so it's a pleasure for me 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.310
 show you all these 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.590
 processes of this great android universe 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.700
 so I wish you good luck and even 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.700
 next time
