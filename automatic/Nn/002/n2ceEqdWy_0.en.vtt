you know anything that you don't need
any<00:01:22.950> way<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.630> what<00:01:24.630> I'd<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.990> do<00:01:25.350> here

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
any way so what I'd like to do here

any way so what I'd like to do here
that's<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.030> one<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.150> wanted<00:01:27.590> check<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.740> make

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
that's the one I wanted check and make

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.149 
that's the one I wanted check and make
sure<00:01:28.890> now<00:01:29.729> it's<00:01:30.090> got<00:01:30.299> average<00:01:30.689> bit<00:01:31.020> rate<00:01:31.159> set

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
sure now it's got average bit rate set

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.480 
sure now it's got average bit rate set
here<00:01:32.490> at<00:01:32.810> 1,500<00:01:33.810> now<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.770> don't<00:01:35.070> know<00:01:35.280> much

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
here at 1,500 now I don't know much

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.030 
here at 1,500 now I don't know much
about<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.880> bit<00:01:36.119> rate<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.710> doesn't

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
about the bit rate but that doesn't

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.649 
about the bit rate but that doesn't
sound<00:01:38.159> like<00:01:38.280> what<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.579> want<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.180> sounds<00:01:39.540> like

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
sound like what I want that sounds like

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.590 
sound like what I want that sounds like
a<00:01:39.689> awfully<00:01:40.619> big<00:01:40.979> big<00:01:41.490> file<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.390> I'm<00:01:42.450> going<00:01:42.570> to

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
a awfully big big file so I'm going to

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.679 
a awfully big big file so I'm going to
go<00:01:42.689> ahead<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.840> target<00:01:43.560> size<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.460> I'd<00:01:45.450> say

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
go ahead and target size and I'd say

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.310 
go ahead and target size and I'd say
about<00:01:46.280> 700<00:01:47.280> should<00:01:47.549> be<00:01:47.700> fine<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:49.170> looks

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
about 700 should be fine and it looks

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.450 
about 700 should be fine and it looks
like<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.560> auto<00:01:49.710> sets<00:01:50.130> my<00:01:50.340> bitrate<00:01:50.850> 28<00:01:51.180> 36

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
like it auto sets my bitrate 28 36

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.060 
like it auto sets my bitrate 28 36
