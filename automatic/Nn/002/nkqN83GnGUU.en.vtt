with the bass envelope filter to get a

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.870 
with the bass envelope filter to get a
Cynthia<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.779> tone<00:00:28.050> as<00:00:28.289> possible<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.670> here's

filter you can think of from mxr to a

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.999 
filter you can think of from mxr to a
groove<00:01:33.270> regulator<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> bass<00:01:34.290> balls<00:01:34.650> and

here in the middle you can choose

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.270 
here in the middle you can choose
between<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.170> positive<00:01:43.380> filter<00:01:43.920> sweep<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.250> a

between a positive filter sweep and a
negative<00:01:44.670> filter<00:01:44.939> sweep<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
combination of that and all the sounds

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.700 
combination of that and all the sounds
on<00:01:47.820> there<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.210> let<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.479> just<00:01:48.710> basically

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
on there it can let you just basically

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.200 
on there it can let you just basically
replace<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> keyboard<00:01:50.759> rather<00:01:51.000> than

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
replace a keyboard rather than

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.429 
replace a keyboard rather than
traditionally<00:01:51.750> where<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.049> keyboard

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
traditionally where the keyboard

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.740 
traditionally where the keyboard
replaces<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.130> bass<00:01:53.340> now<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.329> course<00:01:54.509> in

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
replaces the bass now of course in

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.390 
replaces the bass now of course in
addition<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.200> bass

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
addition to the bass

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.880 
addition to the bass
there's<00:01:56.880> also<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.180> guitar<00:01:57.480> one<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.350> it's<00:01:58.680> pretty

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
there's also a guitar one so it's pretty

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.560 
there's also a guitar one so it's pretty
much<00:01:58.980> the<00:01:59.100> same<00:01:59.280> thing<00:01:59.610> except<00:02:00.150> for<00:02:00.300> guitar

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
much the same thing except for guitar

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.360 
much the same thing except for guitar
right<00:02:00.780> that's<00:02:01.380> right<00:02:01.560> there's<00:02:01.770> actually<00:02:02.160> one

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
right that's right there's actually one

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.820 
right that's right there's actually one
key<00:02:02.700> difference<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.990> guitar<00:02:04.350> pedal<00:02:04.650> looks

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
key difference so the guitar pedal looks

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.130 
key difference so the guitar pedal looks
just<00:02:05.100> like<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.460> bass<00:02:05.610> pedal<00:02:05.970> and<00:02:06.240> they<00:02:06.990> have

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
just like the bass pedal and they have

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.990 
just like the bass pedal and they have
mostly<00:02:07.440> the<00:02:07.650> same<00:02:07.830> sounds<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.400> them<00:02:08.580> but<00:02:08.760> in

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
mostly the same sounds in them but in

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.160 
mostly the same sounds in them but in
the<00:02:09.150> bass<00:02:09.300> pedal<00:02:09.630> there's<00:02:09.810> one<00:02:09.930> key

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
the bass pedal there's one key

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.710 
the bass pedal there's one key
difference<00:02:10.400> the<00:02:11.400> bass<00:02:11.610> pedal<00:02:11.970> has<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.180> wet<00:02:12.450> dry

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
difference the bass pedal has a wet dry

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.200 
difference the bass pedal has a wet dry
mix<00:02:12.990> so<00:02:13.560> some<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.100> unprocessed<00:02:14.970> bass

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
mix so some of that unprocessed bass

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.180 
mix so some of that unprocessed bass
signal<00:02:15.600> gets<00:02:15.840> through<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.800> preserve

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
signal gets through so that you preserve

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.240 
signal gets through so that you preserve
the<00:02:17.250> low-end<00:02:17.810> in<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.990> guitar<00:02:19.260> pedal<00:02:19.560> there's

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
the low-end in the guitar pedal there's

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.550 
the low-end in the guitar pedal there's
no<00:02:20.790> dry<00:02:21.510> signal<00:02:21.720> going<00:02:21.990> through<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:22.410> it's

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
no dry signal going through so it's

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.490 
no dry signal going through so it's
purely<00:02:22.950> wet<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:24.360> you're<00:02:24.870> basically<00:02:25.170> getting<00:02:25.320> a

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
purely wet so you're basically getting a

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.230 
purely wet so you're basically getting a
fully<00:02:25.710> processed<00:02:26.190> signal<00:02:26.250> all<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.610> time<00:02:26.910> and

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
fully processed signal all the time and

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.270 
fully processed signal all the time and
because<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.260> it's<00:02:28.560> actually<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.040> little

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
because of that it's actually a little

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.820 
because of that it's actually a little
bit<00:02:29.400> more<00:02:29.990> the<00:02:30.990> effect<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.410> little<00:02:31.500> bit<00:02:31.710> more

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
bit more the effect is a little bit more

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.800 
bit more the effect is a little bit more
in-your-face<00:02:32.040> it's<00:02:32.910> not<00:02:33.090> as<00:02:33.240> subtle<00:02:33.450> as<00:02:33.600> with

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
in-your-face it's not as subtle as with

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.050 
in-your-face it's not as subtle as with
the<00:02:33.900> bass<00:02:34.080> effect<00:02:34.440> that's<00:02:35.430> not<00:02:35.580> really<00:02:35.760> subtle

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
the bass effect that's not really subtle

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:53.860 
the bass effect that's not really subtle
to<00:02:36.150> begin<00:02:36.420> with<00:02:36.570> anyway

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.970 

now<00:02:54.870> just<00:02:55.080> switch<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.410> direction<00:02:55.560> on<00:02:55.950> that

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
now just switch the direction on that

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.250 
now just switch the direction on that
actually<00:02:56.820> I<00:02:56.850> was<00:02:57.060> going<00:02:57.210> from<00:02:57.510> down<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.900> up<00:02:57.930> on

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
actually I was going from down to up on

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.590 
actually I was going from down to up on
the<00:02:58.470> filter<00:02:58.800> there<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.250> if<00:02:59.940> you<00:03:00.120> go<00:03:00.270> from<00:03:00.390> up

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
the filter there and if you go from up

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.180 
the filter there and if you go from up
to<00:03:00.750> down<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:00.959> can<00:03:01.200> use<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.500> same<00:03:01.680> filter<00:03:02.040> the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
to down you can use the same filter the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.740 
to down you can use the same filter the
same<00:03:02.400> setting<00:03:02.730> so<00:03:02.850> you<00:03:02.880> can<00:03:03.060> get<00:03:03.209> a<00:03:03.239> completely

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
same setting so you can get a completely

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:21.690 
same setting so you can get a completely
different<00:03:03.930> kind<00:03:04.230> of<00:03:04.350> sound

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.860 

great<00:03:22.700> thank<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.120> if<00:03:23.360> people<00:03:23.599> want<00:03:23.720> to
