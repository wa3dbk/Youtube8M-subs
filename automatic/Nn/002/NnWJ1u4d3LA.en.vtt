00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
up and down this is option 2 this is I

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.859 
up and down this is option 2 this is I
think<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.860> coolest<00:01:47.189> option<00:01:47.790> 3<00:01:48.090> when<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.720> have

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
think the coolest option 3 when you have

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.810 
think the coolest option 3 when you have
both<00:01:49.079> strings<00:01:49.530> going<00:01:49.890> through<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.430> offending

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
both strings going through the offending

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.039 
both strings going through the offending
line<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.299> as<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.380> move<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:54.240> two<00:01:54.689> points

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
line and as you move the the two points

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.330 
line and as you move the the two points
apart<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:57.500> repelling<00:01:58.500> accessory<00:01:59.130> goes

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
apart the the repelling accessory goes

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.929 
apart the the repelling accessory goes
forward<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.060> backward<00:02:00.420> or<00:02:00.509> up<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.869> down<00:02:00.930> so

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
forward and backward or up and down so

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.389 
forward and backward or up and down so
interesting<00:02:03.290> but<00:02:04.290> not<00:02:04.350> interesting<00:02:05.159> enough

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
interesting but not interesting enough

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.429 
interesting but not interesting enough
for<00:02:05.430> me<00:02:05.820> because<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.689> do<00:02:06.750> I'm<00:02:06.990> just<00:02:07.020> really

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
for me because I do I'm just really

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.279 
for me because I do I'm just really
after<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.890> figure<00:02:08.190> now<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:09.390> figure<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.899> short

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
after the figure now the figure is short

there's<00:02:14.040> one<00:02:14.250> in<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.430> case<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:15.060> that's

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
there's one in a case and that's

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.870 
there's one in a case and that's
probably<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.440> reason<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:17.130> this<00:02:17.370> figure<00:02:17.550> is

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
probably the reason that this figure is

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.710 
probably the reason that this figure is
very<00:02:18.350> difficult<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:20.400> find<00:02:20.670> on<00:02:20.940> retail<00:02:21.450> and

hobby shops and scalpers are selling him

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.200 
hobby shops and scalpers are selling him
at<00:02:24.480> ridiculous<00:02:25.020> prices<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:26.670> other<00:02:26.820> reason

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
at ridiculous prices the other reason

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.330 
at ridiculous prices the other reason
being<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:28.380> lot<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.920> GI<00:02:29.190> Joe

see if we can focus on that yep

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:36.020 
see if we can focus on that yep
nice<00:04:32.810> he's<00:04:33.810> he<00:04:34.200> doesn't<00:04:34.470> hold<00:04:34.920> it<00:04:35.220> super<00:04:36.000> well

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
nice he's he doesn't hold it super well

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.710 
nice he's he doesn't hold it super well
I<00:04:36.420> mean<00:04:36.600> it's<00:04:37.530> okay<00:04:38.040> it'll<00:04:38.310> stay<00:04:38.640> there<00:04:38.940> but<00:04:39.390> if

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
I mean it's okay it'll stay there but if

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.710 
I mean it's okay it'll stay there but if
you<00:04:39.990> flick<00:04:40.800> it<00:04:40.950> a<00:04:41.010> bit<00:04:41.190> it<00:04:41.790> tends<00:04:42.030> to<00:04:42.150> pop<00:04:42.450> off

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
you flick it a bit it tends to pop off

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.300 
you flick it a bit it tends to pop off
that's<00:04:43.140> fine<00:04:43.320> and<00:04:43.620> it's<00:04:43.800> part<00:04:44.040> of<00:04:44.070> the<00:04:44.160> reason

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
that's fine and it's part of the reason

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.640 
that's fine and it's part of the reason
is<00:04:44.520> because<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.790> handle<00:04:45.120> is<00:04:45.180> very<00:04:45.210> big<00:04:45.750> very

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
is because the handle is very big very

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.940 
is because the handle is very big very
thick<00:04:47.990> articulation<00:04:48.990> on<00:04:49.140> this<00:04:49.320> figure<00:04:49.620> again
