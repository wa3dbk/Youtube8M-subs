00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.610
 very good tied of children and 

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.070
 welcome to a new video welcome 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.510
 to the new lords of demon's souls 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.100
 we face the final straight with the 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.320
 most important stories with 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.730
 most relevant characters within the 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.370
 history within the batch of the own 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.710
 game we should then talk about the 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.630
 royal family of volunteer pillars 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.880
 fundamental to understanding the story 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.070
 global as I said those who make up 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.109
 this royal family of voluntary because 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.960
 one side would be king alan as if 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:31.720
 On the other hand, the old king prayed for 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.629
 other side the kings and finally it would be 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.569
 arion to alan also known as 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:40.239
 voluntary ostrava these characters 

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:42.609
 are the most important and we would say that 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.469
 which with which we are going to 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:46.329
 understand all the other history of 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.760
 all the characters that we have left 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.889
 little to know but as also in the 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.889
 title of the video today I would talk about 

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:55.539
 lords of the old man why then because 

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:57.489
 without him lords of the old man not 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.649
 we would also understand the history of 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.499
 royal family of volunteer the Lord the 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.030
 elder is the basis for understanding all 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:06.400
 the other stories 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.530
 but with the elder's gold they also go 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.200
 bound on one side the ladies in black and 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.729
 on the other hand the monumental and with 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.190
 all these characters that I just 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.820
 name we would end the full batch 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.800
 of demon's souls is true for many 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.080
 they ask him what are the 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.580
 stories of some bosses in the 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.759
 story of almost every boss let's say 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:31.149
 better many of them barely have anything 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:33.399
 that count many others yes but I'm 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.320
 apart and really would be nuances in 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.420
 as to real history in how much 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.670
 global history so leaving is a 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.590
 little side of the story of lemon sun the 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.720
 lemon parrot sun would be completed with the 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.039
 characters that I just named if it's left 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.270
 one in the inkwell or has been 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.970
 some in the pipeline that there is not 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.830
 named until today really 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.210
 because it's not important you can do 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.789
 story may not but it is no longer 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.830
 important does not have any relevance 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.130
 that said we started then with the 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.070
 lords of the elder the final boss so 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.320
 put it in quotation marks the final boss 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.830
 an old man that everyone has for 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.320
 the god of voluntary all we know 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.750
 that god that if we remember was the one 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.130
 urban san and his followers were still 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.870
 his doctrine worshiped him they revered 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.630
 that god that the wise freak said 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.790
 also that he was a false god and that 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.640
 they are urban, they were wrong 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.190
 give your faith to him that god 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.740
 it really was not so good a god that 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.530
 really wanted prosperity or that 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.660
 you brought good things was not a 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.610
 evil god as we know the 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.830
 old man and for us it is also like that 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.100
 if we see it not like that from the first sight 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.380
 the old man is that being who brought the 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.590
 mist with her the demons and with her 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.690
 everything we've seen from people 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.370
 killing people to harvest the same as 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.530
 the demons to harvest souls for 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.670
 take them to the old man but this had 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.410
 been always like this 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.180
 the old man had always been that 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.880
 spawn that we know inside 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.100
 of the game itself 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.250
 and if we go to the intro of the game 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.850
 we discover the essence of its smell in the 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.130
 real story of this old man in the 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.740
 introduction to the elder is represented 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.350
 in the beginning as a tree but a 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.450
 different tree a green tree full of 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.160
 life a tree of light we could say 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.470
 while what we 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.770
 we find everything in the game 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.260
 opposite that monstrous tree full of 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.780
 darkness that happened then where 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.810
 was that change so to explain it 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.360
 we could say that the old man really 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.810
 what is is the representation of the god 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.150
 of voluntary in the kingdom itself is 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.940
 say the representation of god in the 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.100
 land making a simile would be the 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.960
 Jesus Christ of Christianity that the 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.510
 representation of the god that came down to the 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.659
 land 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:00.349
 then your story what really does not 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:02.390
 matter is for what is on earth the 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:05.000
 God put it so that the human having 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.540
 those souls that prosperity that is 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.269
 I sought above all else to have the 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.150
 knowledge of the art of souls to know 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:17.660
 manipulate it to on the one hand bring more 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:21.560
 prosperity and continue its evolution and 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.990
 on the other hand do not carry that knowledge 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.880
 of having the souls not take her to a 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.880
 the dark path so to speak 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.419
 there is balanced then to find 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:36.030
 a little bit to man but man like 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:39.719
 we all know was greedy was 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:42.629
 greedy I wanted more and more and more that 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:45.599
 greed and that greed was such came to 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:47.600
 such the limit that ended up poisoning 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:51.740
 the old man 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:55.010
 the old man also full of greed for 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.900
 greed was not the same as man the 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.690
 man just wanted and killed another 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.960
 man to get their souls for 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.240
 quench his thirst but the old man was going 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.400
 step beyond or I was not going to many steps 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.280
 beyond because the thirst for the soul of 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.890
 elder did not know limits was limited 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.230
 he was insatiable hence he extended his 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.060
 fog and also want to extend it 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.160
 beyond the limits of voluntary 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.200
 so that it would emerge in its demons that 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.270
 they acted as collectors 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.000
 charge of killing the man take 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.639
 the souls and take it back to the 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.009
 old man 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.919
 but if we remember the old man once 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.599
 he was asleep and again awakened here 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.069
 would then enter the game of lords of 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.560
 the monumental the history of the 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:41.999
 monumental and as I said again 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:45.969
 was awakened would enter lords of 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:49.330
 rolled up as if not with it they start from 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:51.430
 new to intertwine history as if not 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.949
 could be otherwise being the 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.909
 final lords of the game would also have to 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:06:01.779
 remember the old reido considered 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:04.000
 a demigod for the people of voluntary and 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:06.279
 you'll see what happened to him either 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.189
 we could leave the well- known ri 

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:11.379
 also like being the little one to the little one 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:14.259
 balance or it was also family 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:17.919
 king alan and as if we could not stop 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:19.449
 side to ariana arion to alan known as 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.460
 ostrava of volunteers I think that the 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:24.540
 Most charismatic character in the game 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.550
 soul air the demon's souls 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.650
 as you see already from here little 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.540
 we could count more of the old man without 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.490
 speak or without getting into another's parrot 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.710
 character so let's let those be 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.830
 characters who complete the story 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:40.590
 of the old man and left me for the end the 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.750
 talk about the black lady the most 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:45.030
 mysterious and with difference of all the 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.710
 game we do not know anything about her if 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.710
 really is on our side or not 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:51.840
 although the in the end of the game seems 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.700
 that everything becomes clear and we see everything 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.580
 pretty clear in regards to its 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.860
 final to everything that surrounds it already 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:03.580
 you will see how in the end everything is bundled 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:06.150
 more this character can really 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:08.770
 separate a lot the theories of many people 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:11.560
 and that's fine between the serious is 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:14.650
 well so with nothing more as we 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:17.560
 I say we already know the essentials 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.230
 of the old man who he was and what he 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.150
 did man be 

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.950
 and what we have left will be completed 

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.750
 the other characters that we will see 

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.100
 then so I hope there's 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:29.660
 liked this video and we'll see you in 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.660
 following until another
