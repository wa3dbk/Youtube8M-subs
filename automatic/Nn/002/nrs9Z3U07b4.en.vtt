megabits<00:00:40.640> stream<00:00:41.640> bitrate<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.210> it's<00:00:42.329> gonna

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
megabits stream bitrate so it's gonna

much got so many sort of menu system on

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.470 
much got so many sort of menu system on
there<00:01:28.280> they'd<00:01:28.370> be<00:01:28.430> find<00:01:28.760> it<00:01:28.910> over<00:01:29.120> the<00:01:29.240> over

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
there they'd be find it over the over

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.910 
there they'd be find it over the over
time<00:01:29.690> so<00:01:29.870> a<00:01:29.900> little<00:01:30.020> bit<00:01:30.200> easier<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:30.800> navigate

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
time so a little bit easier to navigate

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.530 
time so a little bit easier to navigate
around<00:01:31.280> especially<00:01:31.730> for<00:01:31.970> those<00:01:32.030> I'd<00:01:32.210> be<00:01:32.300> using

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
around especially for those I'd be using

Sony<00:01:32.720> for<00:01:33.020> a<00:01:33.050> while<00:01:33.230> kind<00:01:33.740> of<00:01:33.860> know<00:01:33.950> their<00:01:34.130> menu

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
Sony for a while kind of know their menu

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.920 
Sony for a while kind of know their menu
seems<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.790> be<00:01:34.910> a<00:01:34.940> little<00:01:35.120> rough<00:01:35.360> to<00:01:35.720> kind<00:01:35.900> of

seems to be a little rough to kind of

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.510 
seems to be a little rough to kind of
get<00:01:36.050> around<00:01:36.320> now<00:01:36.500> coming<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:37.340> little<00:01:37.400> bit

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
get around now coming a little bit

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.060 
get around now coming a little bit
better<00:01:37.730> here<00:01:37.970> don't<00:01:38.780> think<00:01:38.960> this<00:01:39.590> rotates<00:01:39.920> all

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
better here don't think this rotates all

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.220

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
take a SD card now do you recommend

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.230 
take a SD card now do you recommend

so<00:02:09.230> there's<00:02:09.619> kind<00:02:09.830> of<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:09.980> thing<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:10.369> can<00:02:10.490> kind

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
so there's kind of a thing that can kind

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.850 
so there's kind of a thing that can kind
of<00:02:10.700> keep<00:02:10.760> the<00:02:10.880> cost<00:02:11.090> down<00:02:11.210> so<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.500> you<00:02:12.590> figure

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
of keep the cost down so and you figure

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.260 
of keep the cost down so and you figure
pretty<00:02:13.100> much<00:02:13.280> you're<00:02:13.490> gonna<00:02:13.550> want<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.180> use

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
pretty much you're gonna want to use

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.580 
pretty much you're gonna want to use
your<00:02:14.390> own<00:02:14.480> cards<00:02:14.840> anyways<00:02:15.140> with<00:02:15.290> this<00:02:15.410> so

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
your own cards anyways with this so

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.450 
your own cards anyways with this so
you're<00:02:15.740> gonna<00:02:15.830> want<00:02:16.070> to<00:02:16.130> get<00:02:16.250> something

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
you're gonna want to get something

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.690

with an LED viewfinder as well - it's
pretty<00:02:37.390> cool<00:02:37.569> so<00:02:37.750> you're<00:02:37.870> gonna<00:02:37.959> get<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.200> really

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
pretty cool so you're gonna get a really

the<00:03:28.329> phone<00:03:28.569> it's<00:03:29.110> actually<00:03:29.380> gonna<00:03:29.470> save<00:03:29.650> like

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
the phone it's actually gonna save like

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.050 
the phone it's actually gonna save like
a<00:03:29.829> much<00:03:30.010> smaller<00:03:30.310> resolution<00:03:30.610> uh<00:03:30.849> because

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
a much smaller resolution uh because

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.069 
a much smaller resolution uh because
they<00:03:31.120> can't<00:03:31.299> channel<00:03:31.630> that<00:03:31.750> much<00:03:31.870> speed

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
they can't channel that much speed

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.170 
they can't channel that much speed
