00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.690 
it is it's messy and oil-based primer
which<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.569> very<00:02:30.930> good<00:02:31.250> once<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.400> gets<00:02:32.579> on

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
which is very good once it gets on

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.899 
which is very good once it gets on
something<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.150> doesn't<00:02:33.450> come<00:02:33.569> off<00:02:34.730> like<00:02:35.730> your

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
something it doesn't come off like your

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.649 
something it doesn't come off like your
clothes<00:02:36.180> like<00:02:36.659> your<00:02:36.810> car<00:02:37.049> like<00:02:37.469> your<00:02:37.650> cat<00:02:38.659> and

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
clothes like your car like your cat and

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.739 
clothes like your car like your cat and
it's<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.650> is<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:40.980> best<00:02:41.189> primer<00:02:41.459> but<00:02:42.419> I<00:02:42.450> only

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:42.749 
it's it is the best primer but I only

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:47.270 
it's it is the best primer but I only
use<00:02:42.870> oil-based<00:02:43.500> or<00:02:45.200> bare<00:02:46.200> wood<00:02:46.409> anything

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
use oil-based or bare wood anything

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.119 
use oil-based or bare wood anything
that's<00:02:47.430> bare<00:02:47.639> wood<00:02:48.650> that's<00:02:49.650> what<00:02:49.829> I<00:02:49.859> use<00:02:50.010> it

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
that's bare wood that's what I use it

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.490 
that's bare wood that's what I use it
for<00:02:50.159> so<00:02:50.939> now<00:02:51.120> what<00:02:51.299> I'm<00:02:51.419> gonna<00:02:51.750> do<00:02:51.959> is<00:02:52.049> we<00:02:52.169> we

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
for so now what I'm gonna do is we we

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.689 
for so now what I'm gonna do is we we
let<00:02:52.739> this<00:02:52.889> this<00:02:53.659> this<00:02:54.659> is<00:02:54.719> where<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.549> you<00:02:56.549> can

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:56.699 
let this this this is where the you can

00:02:56.699 --> 00:03:03.020 
let this this this is where the you can
see<00:02:56.939> the<00:02:59.599> the<00:03:00.599> wood<00:03:00.810> filler<00:03:01.049> has<00:03:01.319> dried<00:03:02.030> here

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
see the the wood filler has dried here

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.479 
see the the wood filler has dried here
you<00:03:03.959> can<00:03:04.109> tell<00:03:04.290> because<00:03:04.439> it<00:03:04.680> turns<00:03:05.159> kind<00:03:05.340> of<00:03:05.459> a

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
you can tell because it turns kind of a

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.729 
you can tell because it turns kind of a
chalky<00:03:05.879> white<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.900> then<00:03:07.199> what<00:03:07.439> I'll<00:03:07.530> do<00:03:07.709> is

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
chalky white and then what I'll do is

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.369 
chalky white and then what I'll do is
I'll<00:03:08.040> I'll<00:03:08.280> start<00:03:08.819> sanding<00:03:09.120> on<00:03:09.419> it<00:03:09.599> if<00:03:10.019> the

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
I'll I'll start sanding on it if the

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.119 
I'll I'll start sanding on it if the
wood<00:03:10.829> filler<00:03:11.069> is<00:03:11.250> too<00:03:11.430> low<00:03:12.650> like<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:13.799> can<00:03:13.949> see

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
wood filler is too low like you can see

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.039 
wood filler is too low like you can see
here<00:03:14.310> where<00:03:14.549> it's<00:03:14.699> sunk<00:03:15.509> into<00:03:15.689> the<00:03:15.840> hole<00:03:16.019> right

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
here where it's sunk into the hole right

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.679 
here where it's sunk into the hole right
here<00:03:16.319> I<00:03:16.709> put<00:03:17.459> it<00:03:17.549> on<00:03:17.639> flat<00:03:17.939> and<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.180> sunk<00:03:18.419> in

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:18.689 
here I put it on flat and it sunk in

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:22.249 
here I put it on flat and it sunk in
like<00:03:18.900> I<00:03:19.620> said<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.889> water<00:03:20.099> evaporates<00:03:20.669> out<00:03:21.259> if

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:22.259 
like I said the water evaporates out if

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:24.379 
like I said the water evaporates out if
it's<00:03:22.439> too<00:03:22.590> low<00:03:22.769> I<00:03:22.979> add<00:03:23.189> another<00:03:23.489> little<00:03:23.669> patch

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389
