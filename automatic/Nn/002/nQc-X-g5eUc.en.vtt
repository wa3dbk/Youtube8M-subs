the point

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.420 
the point
hope<00:02:48.600> that's<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.750> point<00:02:50.020> as<00:02:50.830> long<00:02:51.100> as<00:02:51.250> we're

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
hope that's the point as long as we're

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.100 
hope that's the point as long as we're
still<00:02:51.459> here<00:02:51.910> we<00:02:52.060> still<00:02:52.330> have<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.480> chance<00:02:52.810> and

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
still here we still have a chance and

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.720 
still here we still have a chance and
that's<00:02:53.560> why<00:02:53.769> we're<00:02:53.980> going<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.220> keep<00:02:54.489> fighting

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
that's why we're going to keep fighting

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.490 
that's why we're going to keep fighting
I<00:02:55.060> think<00:02:55.360> even<00:02:55.570> with<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.170> Teen<00:02:56.470> Titans

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
I think even with the Teen Titans

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.040 
I think even with the Teen Titans
fighting<00:02:57.310> an<00:02:57.430> impossible<00:02:57.730> foe<00:02:58.180> who<00:02:58.660> by<00:02:58.870> all

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
fighting an impossible foe who by all

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.350 
fighting an impossible foe who by all
accounts<00:02:59.170> can't<00:02:59.680> be<00:02:59.860> beat<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.970> great<00:03:01.209> thing

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
accounts can't be beat the great thing

accounts can't be beat the great thing
about<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.660> Teen<00:03:01.810> Titans<00:03:01.840> is<00:03:02.350> they<00:03:03.010> still

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
about the Teen Titans is they still

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.190 
about the Teen Titans is they still
believe<00:03:03.760> that<00:03:03.790> they<00:03:04.030> can<00:03:04.330> and<00:03:04.630> they're<00:03:05.050> gonna

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
believe that they can and they're gonna

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.990 
believe that they can and they're gonna
try<00:03:05.470> they<00:03:05.950> have<00:03:06.100> proven<00:03:06.459> time<00:03:06.700> and<00:03:06.730> time<00:03:06.880> again

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
try they have proven time and time again

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.210 
try they have proven time and time again
that<00:03:07.750> when<00:03:07.870> faced<00:03:08.140> with<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.440> impossible<00:03:09.040> they

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
that when faced with the impossible they

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.840 
that when faced with the impossible they
can<00:03:09.400> make<00:03:09.519> it<00:03:09.670> happen<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:10.739> they<00:03:11.739> do<00:03:11.800> Trigon<00:03:12.700> is

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
can make it happen and they do Trigon is

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.259 
can make it happen and they do Trigon is
defeated<00:03:13.480> what<00:03:13.870> ultimately<00:03:14.700> defeats<00:03:15.700> Trigon

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
defeated what ultimately defeats Trigon

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.870 
defeated what ultimately defeats Trigon
is<00:03:16.570> I<00:03:17.380> think<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.769> Achilles<00:03:18.220> heel<00:03:18.400> of<00:03:18.579> someone

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
is I think the Achilles heel of someone

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.340 
is I think the Achilles heel of someone
who<00:03:19.030> was<00:03:19.150> all-powerful<00:03:19.570> and<00:03:20.200> all-knowing

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
who was all-powerful and all-knowing

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.880 
who was all-powerful and all-knowing
which<00:03:20.709> is<00:03:20.859> arrogance<00:03:21.310> it's

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
which is arrogance it's

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.410 
which is arrogance it's
that<00:03:22.040> he<00:03:22.130> doesn't<00:03:22.490> see<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.850> threat<00:03:23.060> coming

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
that he doesn't see the threat coming

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.210 
that he doesn't see the threat coming
it's<00:03:23.630> that<00:03:23.840> he<00:03:24.050> doesn't<00:03:24.710> think<00:03:24.890> it<00:03:25.069> could

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
it's that he doesn't think it could

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.309 
it's that he doesn't think it could
possibly<00:03:25.610> harm<00:03:25.850> him<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.270> why<00:03:26.600> wouldn't<00:03:26.900> but

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
possibly harm him and why wouldn't but

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:28.780 
possibly harm him and why wouldn't but
ultimately<00:03:27.709> it's<00:03:27.950> just<00:03:28.069> his<00:03:28.550> daughter

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
ultimately it's just his daughter

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:40.150 
ultimately it's just his daughter
standing<00:03:29.240> up<00:03:29.360> to<00:03:29.480> him<00:03:33.640> metrion<00:03:34.640> zinthos
