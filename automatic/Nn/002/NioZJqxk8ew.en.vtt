00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 This video is about how to distinguish 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:07.230
 original coolant tank 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.660
 from original on replacement 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.790
 he put a non-original tank 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:18.810
 which is literally a few thousand 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:21.380
 already started to crack here video here 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.600
 already take white and white 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:32.029
 literally this through later thousands 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.029
 especially in the summer completely blown away and burst 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.399
 will be visible on the market a lot 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.500
 stores bought another flank 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.500
 here you can see even the color of something white 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:52.020
 new tank white old yellowing here 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:57.300
 but the most important thing is marking here 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.899
 here the factory marking is very good 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:05.100
 it is seen 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:09.350
 5 nc and, accordingly, the numbers and such 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:15.020
 circle with the release date that is 4 month 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:18.600
 14 years on a straw that was on 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.080
 put to replace us by masters in 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.590
 service 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.100
 this is not at all so I decided 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.729
 change 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.860
 tank not only decided to change a thing 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.710
 the fact that this cork is very bad 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.579
 curled up coming to work saw 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.579
 what is on the pump here was the ambassador came out 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.780
 through through this plug he just poured 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.780
 Everybody is here 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:52.070
 so when buying an expansion 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.820
 tank when replacing do not fall for 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.200
 fakes because there is not even more expensive 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.220
 by the way here the previous owner was 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:06.140
 antifreeze filled 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:06.799
 I'm here about this, he is technically not 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.250
 advertising 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:15.340
 but just recommended antifreeze 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:20.180
 eye maker 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.100
 Now we will show the book list of cooling 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.239
 liquids 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:29.650
 recommended for you 2014 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:33.680
 need a strip of operation 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.750
 I read quite a good Lukoil 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.750
 antichrist but began to look in the market 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.799
 something somewhere its not been in principle yet 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.459
 review would not be a stream standard 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.440
 premium 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:49.090
 but the market also could not find bought 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.400
 centek 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:03:00.459
 Tank Lashko out somewhere around 800 rubles 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:00.459
 ten-liter we have red 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.000
 Here is such a little egg 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.870
 I will try to fill it there 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.360
 I will definitely tell you about the bracket when 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.570
 will buy look to be 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:22.480
 specifically white with such a pretty 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:25.300
 hard plastic and labeled 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:31.510
 here without marking do not take shit 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:36.660
 full here is accused of pretty 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:40.540
 just this yoke need to twist and 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:44.650
 Here is the top well, and accordingly merge 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:47.230
 Ignorance of how many liters of antifreeze 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.790
 or antifreeze what about you so but I will 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.220
 I am now completely all liquid 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.020
 system 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.130
 here I will need to unscrew 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:02.610
 ignition 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:07.060
 here here here here this screw this fact and 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.680
 one screw engine support there such here 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.710
 the fork that comes in will need it 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.710
 loosen and pull out the ignition system 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.489
 drink vodka 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:34.130
 unscrew the screw plugs is about to 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:36.860
 visible and you release fluid from the sleeve 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:40.880
 the engine will need to go on like this 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.310
 unscrew this plug here this 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:48.760
 and let the fluid out of the radiator and not 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:52.070
 forget also open this cork here and 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:56.390
 open the faucet stove then respectively 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:05:03.820
 all close and fill the liquid slightly 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:07.730
 above the maximum continue to warm up the engine 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:10.690
 wait until it cools and pour between 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.690
 high and low 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:19.480
 all let's have luck don't overheat
