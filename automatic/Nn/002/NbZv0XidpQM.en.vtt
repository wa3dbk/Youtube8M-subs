00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.589
 good day today we are going to restore 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:09.769
 a tablet brand bausch in which 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:13.519
 presents problems by start by 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:17.450
 screen is blocked or in this case for 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:22.270
 we our problem is the employer 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.270
 of security that does not know 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.910
 and the first thing we must identify 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.950
 in our case 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.900
 is the 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.360
 the problem and the packages that we have to 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.010
 download to be able to restore first 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.530
 recommendation is to turn off the tablet 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.530
 pressing the power button 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.290
 pressed and will not request 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.420
 turn off the tablet 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.490
 it's already turning off while it's going 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.280
 turning off explained the following 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.940
 process 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.910
 we must download 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.720
 in the leader or is the description the 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.560
 Image and application files 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.950
 which 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.790
 will allow us 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:17.100
 from both 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.730
 not allow the use of material for 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.730
 restoration 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:34.290
 as we can see the image file 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.290
 is 326 megabytes and the application 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:41.290
 Top version 6 6 is recommended 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.650
 or lower presents other problems 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.500
 recommendation is that the computer 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.570
 only the port has only one port 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.760
 usb enabled others must be 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.640
 disconnected to be able to do the 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:57.600
 restoration in this case I direct myself 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.900
 in the first step is to the application 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.409
 I'm going to show a file called 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.500
 live set to create that must be 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.470
 download and decompress these others to 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.010
 double click decompress all these 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.430
 other files from there we look for 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.650
 the executable that calls live suites and what 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.989
 we execute it is recommended to execute it as 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.459
 administrator so that it does not present 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.459
 problems of administrative permits 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.880
 from which it runs as 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.030
 administrator shows us an assistant 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.580
 in which we are going to give continue 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.830
 it's welcome the kind of format that 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.700
 it's formatting and the buttons that we're going to 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.819
 press 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.709
 start the restoration last the 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.200
 image file that will ask us to 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.410
 we download we select it and we give it 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.330
 the option to open at the end 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.130
 we have the program ready and prepared 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.670
 to do the restoration 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.390
 our next step is to have 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.860
 connected the usb cable 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.660
 to the computer 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.270
 and the tablets paid completely 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.210
 within the application within the 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.700
 Man application and against a folder 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:25.070
 drivers in which he 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.060
 install systems 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.700
 automatically for windows version 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.360
 7 it is recommended to have a version of 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.940
 windows 7 professional or higher with 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.440
 administrative permissions that what 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.180
 let's do is the next step to 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.450
 step the first step is to press the 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.690
 home button leaving it pressed without 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.870
 drop then we connect in the usb port 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.480
 the cable and finally we press 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.950
 ten times the power button or 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.450
 periodically I'm going to do it pressed and 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.790
 they will notice on the screen that we will 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.790
 change pressed and connected the usb cable 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.700
 press the power button 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.780
 several times and they will observe 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.070
 this new window 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.070
 which appears 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.389
 which appears to us will indicate the 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.450
 window that is going to do a formatting it 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.520
 we give the option yes 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.330
 that we want to force the formatting 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.490
 we say yes and start formatting in 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.900
 this moment is preparing 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.710
 the files 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.140
 direct to the tablet 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.260
 It can not be disconnected and it is recommended 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.610
 have the tablet 100% 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.870
 charged 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.870
 and with the archives 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.930
 it is likely that 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.180
 you use another different image and 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.479
 instead of repairing your tablet they can 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.479
 to damage 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:22.389
 we have finished the update 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.410
 at this moment we can see 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:27.470
 ensure that the tablet is 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:30.020
 restored let's verify by effect 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.319
 of time overtake a little 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.849
 the procedure that takes two minutes 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:39.069
 but it will work 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:39.069
 let's observe then on the tablet 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.479
 let's light it 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.039
 we pressured for us to 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.039
 turn on 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.560
 and her 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:59.780
 will begin to request 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.780
 initiation information 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:16.320
 in the loading process it took a little 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:20.280
 between 2 to 6 minutes depending on the 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:22.910
 memory and the and the capacity of it 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.910
 Tablet 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.800
 as you can observe 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:36.290
 we just started the tablet and we 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.290
 allows you to customize it 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:44.240
 and we found the tablet restored 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.520
 It's all for today I hope you liked it
