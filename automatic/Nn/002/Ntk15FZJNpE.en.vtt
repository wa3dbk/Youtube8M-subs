00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello everybody it's me 90.8 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.870
 this one is today it was a 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.770
 very special day for me because 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.080
 I did not have class 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.599
 so I took the opportunity to go to the lego 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.429
 store and at the show star wars identities 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.369
 so it's talking to me maybe it's a 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.680
 expo that is pretty common right now 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.180
 we speak a lot and I'll tell you 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.580
 talk because it's really worth the 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.769
 we know if you have the opportunity 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.720
 go ahead so we talk about it a little bit more 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.689
 late so I went to the lego star and 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.059
 I made small purchases have a lot 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.550
 of purchases so for example 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.950
 in fact I went because I had 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.590
 this box to fill that I had before 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.020
 christmas a free box that matches 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.239
 about half a watts so at 9 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.980
 euros is always that's good so 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.360
 me today there were no 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.920
 masses of two pieces very cool but 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.559
 but there were still some 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.500
 basic parts so for example the one 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.399
 once a thrush they have left them and I 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.860
 the authorities then luc grillet then from 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.750
 beige always small additions 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.290
 I took what they had and then I 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.580
 also took my first sets 2014 because 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.380
 that I still had not bought 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.509
 I'm always a little late for 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.280
 to buy a bear is like you 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.330
 can see I bought 2 battle pope 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:27.630
 single cash and a battle pack of 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.470
 hood and a ring so I had wings 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.630
 not the old version 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.030
 so that's good he looks really 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.380
 cool I resisted the envy of opening 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.049
 all his boxes for power wanted 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.049
 show intact and no you can you 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.290
 imagine why I bought these boxes 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.290
 of lego 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:49.130
 I will not make you the topo you 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.439
 understand it alone announcement maybe 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:56.409
 the next mocks 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:59.509
 that's it and then no place these 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.259
 martian manhunter so I do not care 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.319
 completely 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.939
 I have no use but it is not 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:07.069
 so I had that I would have preferred our 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.539
 political but hey I'm not going to 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:12.170
 complain 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:16.040
 so that's the afternoon I went to 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.489
 the star wars identities expo so i'm going 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.410
 introduce you a little the princeps 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:25.120
 then I bought three books from the hand 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.220
 so the official guide if I can say 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.060
 with the illustrations all the pictures 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.340
 all you need to know about the exhibition 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.650
 touch that can be seen there is in 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.349
 this book 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:43.329
 so for those who do not know eh 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:47.239
 well there are a lot of models of 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:52.370
 dhabi do you pass me pardo film so 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:54.410
 who brought back from america 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.290
 here are some illustrations of ralph 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:03.139
 mcquarrie and preliminary drawings 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:05.780
 concept art so very complete that 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.739
 this is the preliminary drawing of yoda yes 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.310
 it does not look like much 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:14.239
 so here is after these there is a 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.319
 another book is called the best of 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.889
 star wars comics 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:22.639
 so this is a little collector's book that 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:25.090
 traces the history of many comics 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:27.910
 so there are a lot of black drawings 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:45.310
 white, but also unpublished drawings of 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:48.610
 illustrations week illustrations 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:53.190
 like this here I bought a 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.190
 third book i will show you 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.730
 is called the site book then the 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.650
 cover was telling me something but 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.579
 in fact I had never seen it in real life 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.720
 know where is what I saw 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:09.280
 on websites 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.280
 you probably know him and I knew 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.480
 not even what it was talking about so it's 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.140
 the history of the sites since the 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.150
 beginning 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:22.960
 by dart bay do not know you well 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:27.270
 to clone wars modert in lÃ©zinnes 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:30.130
 convoy towards the end and then the emperor 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.039
 so these are notes came up 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.229
 as if it were notes found 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:38.500
 so here are the sisters of the night by the 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:41.229
 rebels so after star wars 6 so 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:45.070
 with notes of annotations almost to 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:47.020
 every page of the emperor so here I 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.169
 am the secrets of the sites are very 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.419
 cool so here at the star wars show 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.669
 identities one sees all his costumes 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.430
 his models and everything but the theme 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.710
 the main thing is to create an identity 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.110
 star wars a character so there are ten 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:05.110
 steps have built the story of his 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:09.570
 character in the star wars universe and 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:15.610
 in parallel with luc's evolution and 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:17.380
 luc and anakin excuse me so there are some 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.660
 videos go by and then it's fine 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.000
 because it's not only about knowing it's 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.400
 very complete it's star wars is called 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.310
 parallel with earthly earth 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.320
 our world to us that's between 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.000
 quotes not so different 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.660

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.360
 so here I am I will introduce you the 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:41.410

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:47.170
