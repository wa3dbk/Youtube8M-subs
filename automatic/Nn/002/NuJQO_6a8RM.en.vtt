00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.240 
cannot think of any divas that's how
much<00:02:44.630> I<00:02:44.870> i<00:02:45.550> watch<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.730> Divas<00:02:47.000> matches<00:02:48.250> like

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250

two and a half minutes which isn't the

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.460 
two and a half minutes which isn't the
