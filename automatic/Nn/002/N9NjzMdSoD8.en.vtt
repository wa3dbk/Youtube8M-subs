00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.540
 it is necessary to name oneself also fall to the 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.250
 basis was designed to be operated in 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.580
 crew and in the case of the road the 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.890
 rum 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.760
 iliad is going to have to win only name which he 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.829
 will have a lot more effort to provide 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.940
 and suddenly the idea is more 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.710
 used the strength of the arms 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.789
 it is to use the strength of the legs 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.470
 what happens is that yann did not he 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:40.030
 deaths in the room so the idea was 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.470
 measure performance on the one hand 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.550
 and see the ergonomic side of 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.680
 the other final parent we visited 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.690
 account that the right frame bikes was 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.829
 more interesting and recumbent bike so the 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.360
 bike works for a system of 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.700
 classic column ie it is 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.290
 connected to the winch in more detail it equipped 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.450
 of a pedal that connects to a box of 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.950
 speeds which is connected to the winch so 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.750
 the idea is actually to be able to edit 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.220
 the following transmission ratio 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.899
 the effort that has developed for example if 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.850
 we also think about it in the name of the crazy 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.110
 the effort is not the same step of the group 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.329
 modified the drive shaft 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.710
 as a result we started from a 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:09.430
 classic bike frame that we have 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.620
 adapted to our needs 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.299
 so on the one hand they adapted by pro 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.890
 practical side including removing a 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.049
 bar that exists there just for 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.210
 to be able to use the hac removed without 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.369
 must jen and when in legs after 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.690
 also the fixing side we bought 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.729
 feet on either side for the 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.930
 set the bottom of the pedal a little bit 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.430
 modified compared to others 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.270
 applications and we spent a lot of 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.700
 time all that is beautiful to two 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.470
 speeds transmission an assembly of 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.990
 trade coins but that we have 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.030
 a little bit modified for that 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.930
 match our needs 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.700
 the idea is actually to ternay the effort 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.110
 between the arms and the people because at 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.520
 maneuvers that is long enough 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.340
 including hoisting sail 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.079
 sailing enlistment 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.640
 laughing and you are very long 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.140
 the idea of starting with a crank 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.350
 classic except that once they 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.119
 earn m 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.590
 tired he can take over with 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.950
 the pedals and at questions time 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.950
 oral
