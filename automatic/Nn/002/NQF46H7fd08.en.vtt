main differences we have a active patent

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.709 
main differences we have a active patent
on<00:00:46.200> an<00:00:46.320> active<00:00:46.680> active<00:00:47.100> permanent<00:00:47.579> casing<00:00:48.059> it

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
on an active active permanent casing it

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.310 
on an active active permanent casing it
essentially<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:50.309> 100%<00:00:51.180> recycled<00:00:51.899> plastic

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
essentially is a 100% recycled plastic

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.189 
essentially is a 100% recycled plastic
casing<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.949> houses<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.969> concrete<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
casing that houses the concrete in the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.319 
casing that houses the concrete in the
ground<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:56.129> what<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.399> does<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.940> concrete

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
ground so what that does is concrete

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.110 
ground so what that does is concrete
cracks<00:00:57.629> gunite<00:00:58.050> cracks<00:00:58.430> it<00:00:59.430> protects<00:00:59.940> the
