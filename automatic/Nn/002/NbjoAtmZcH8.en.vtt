00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.280 
the Premier to do that this it's
incredible<00:01:15.299> fantastic<00:01:15.930> result<00:01:16.470> but<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:18.299> had

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
incredible fantastic result but I had

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.719 
incredible fantastic result but I had
some<00:01:19.470> thoughts<00:01:19.650> because<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.070> say<00:01:20.280> oh<00:01:20.310> well<00:01:20.700> that

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
some thoughts because I say oh well that

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.109 
some thoughts because I say oh well that
would<00:01:20.970> be<00:01:21.119> very<00:01:21.630> difficult<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.880> remain<00:01:23.880> there

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
would be very difficult to remain there

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.940 
would be very difficult to remain there
to<00:01:24.240> maintain<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.780> but<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.439> think<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
to maintain that but I think the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.950 
to maintain that but I think the
philosophy<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.670> talked<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.299> people<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.750> said

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
philosophy I talked to the people I said

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.960 
philosophy I talked to the people I said
well<00:01:28.170> what<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.860> important<00:01:29.340> for<00:01:29.490> us<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.729> what<00:01:29.939> we

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
well what is important for us is what we

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.660 
well what is important for us is what we
continue<00:01:30.570> building<00:01:31.200> us<00:01:31.560> on<00:01:32.070> top<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.490> what<00:01:32.640> we

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
continue building us on top of what we

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.210 
continue building us on top of what we
have<00:01:32.850> done<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.180> last<00:01:33.210> year<00:01:33.630> we<00:01:34.619> know<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.100> it

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
have done the last year we know that it

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.069 
have done the last year we know that it
will<00:01:35.340> be<00:01:35.400> difficult<00:01:35.700> next<00:01:36.240> year<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.930> maintain

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
will be difficult next year to maintain

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.380 
will be difficult next year to maintain
same<00:01:37.860> low<00:01:38.100> because<00:01:38.430> there's<00:01:38.790> some<00:01:39.030> come<00:01:39.210> some

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
same low because there's some come some

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.749 
same low because there's some come some
good<00:01:39.630> teams<00:01:39.840> up<00:01:40.079> from<00:01:40.619> championship<00:01:41.610> this

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
good teams up from championship this

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.440 
good teams up from championship this
year<00:01:41.820> but<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.020> think<00:01:43.380> when<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.070> work<00:01:44.310> like<00:01:45.090> they

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
year but I think when you work like they

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.450 
year but I think when you work like they
have<00:01:45.570> done<00:01:45.630> here<00:01:46.020> for<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.950> last<00:01:47.100> years

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
have done here for the last years

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.569 
have done here for the last years
everything<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.000> possible<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.720> then<00:01:49.280> all<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
everything is possible and then all the

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.510 
everything is possible and then all the
thing<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.909> just<00:01:50.939> saying<00:01:51.299> over<00:01:51.540> there<00:01:52.520> together

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
thing I just saying over there together

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.330 
thing I just saying over there together
they<00:01:53.759> have<00:01:53.939> made<00:01:54.479> me<00:01:54.659> make<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.649> decision<00:01:55.710> to

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.550 
heard it as of course it's a special
case<00:03:06.980> because<00:03:07.300> he<00:03:08.300> was<00:03:08.450> here<00:03:08.630> on<00:03:08.780> loan<00:03:09.320> from

case because he was here on loan from

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.550 
case because he was here on loan from
from<00:03:09.860> home<00:03:10.010> tonight<00:03:10.280> but<00:03:11.060> yeah<00:03:11.600> he<00:03:11.840> did<00:03:12.410> very

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
well and that's sometimes the problem

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.640 
well and that's sometimes the problem
when<00:03:14.150> you<00:03:14.239> have<00:03:14.269> players<00:03:14.540> on<00:03:14.780> low<00:03:14.959> they're

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
when you have players on low they're

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.979 
when you have players on low they're
doing<00:03:15.920> good<00:03:16.100> they<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.580> world<00:03:16.880> they<00:03:17.060> you<00:03:17.870> have

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
doing good they the world they you have

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.780 
doing good they the world they you have
to<00:03:18.110> buy<00:03:18.260> them<00:03:18.530> if<00:03:18.709> you<00:03:18.830> can't<00:03:19.190> buy<00:03:19.370> them<00:03:19.580> all

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
to buy them if you can't buy them all

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.680 
to buy them if you can't buy them all
the<00:03:20.660> clubs<00:03:21.019> come<00:03:21.290> with<00:03:21.530> with<00:03:22.489> bigger<00:03:23.420> money

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
the clubs come with with bigger money

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.590 
the clubs come with with bigger money
that<00:03:23.900> is<00:03:24.019> very<00:03:24.260> difficult<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:25.209> keep<00:03:26.209> them<00:03:26.390> here

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
that is very difficult to keep them here

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.970 
that is very difficult to keep them here
so<00:03:27.260> maybe<00:03:27.560> he<00:03:28.519> will<00:03:28.670> leave<00:03:28.880> but<00:03:29.810> I<00:03:30.260> think<00:03:30.650> we

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
so maybe he will leave but I think we

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.490 
so maybe he will leave but I think we
have<00:03:31.100> to<00:03:31.220> try<00:03:31.400> to<00:03:31.459> find<00:03:31.840> replacements<00:03:32.840> people

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
have to try to find replacements people

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.670 
have to try to find replacements people
with<00:03:34.630> who<00:03:35.630> wants<00:03:35.780> to<00:03:35.959> come<00:03:36.140> here<00:03:36.350> and<00:03:36.440> show<00:03:36.620> to

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
with who wants to come here and show to

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.850 
with who wants to come here and show to
play<00:03:37.130> in<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.340> Premier<00:03:37.519> and<00:03:37.989> maybe<00:03:38.989> for<00:03:39.350> less

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
play in the Premier and maybe for less

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.590 
play in the Premier and maybe for less
money<00:03:40.040> because<00:03:40.610> you<00:03:40.790> actually<00:03:40.940> have<00:03:41.330> to<00:03:41.570> think

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
money because you actually have to think

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.860 
money because you actually have to think
about<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:42.140> economy<00:03:42.500> as<00:03:42.560> well<00:03:43.150> Michael<00:03:44.150> you<00:03:44.269> we

the most important thing is to win but
we<00:04:22.930> also<00:04:23.200> have<00:04:23.470> to<00:04:23.620> do<00:04:23.740> it<00:04:23.860> in<00:04:23.950> a<00:04:24.040> way<00:04:24.160> that<00:04:24.190> we

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
we also have to do it in a way that we

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.240 
we also have to do it in a way that we
we<00:04:24.910> believe<00:04:25.090> in<00:04:25.450> and<00:04:25.720> I<00:04:26.050> always<00:04:26.440> done<00:04:26.650> it<00:04:26.770> in<00:04:26.950> in

we believe in and I always done it in in
in<00:04:27.550> my<00:04:27.760> way<00:04:27.970> and<00:04:28.210> I<00:04:28.480> see<00:04:28.720> that's<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.080> reason

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
in my way and I see that's the reason

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.620 
in my way and I see that's the reason
why<00:04:29.440> I'm<00:04:29.560> here<00:04:29.770> because<00:04:29.920> I<00:04:30.250> think<00:04:30.520> so<00:04:31.330> what<00:04:31.420> she

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
why I'm here because I think so what she

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.400 
why I'm here because I think so what she
chose<00:04:31.870> me

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
chose me

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.740 
chose me
it's<00:04:32.860> chose<00:04:33.010> me<00:04:33.310> because<00:04:33.700> they<00:04:34.000> believe<00:04:34.330> I<00:04:34.540> can

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
it's chose me because they believe I can

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.900 
it's chose me because they believe I can
I<00:04:34.930> can<00:04:35.230> I<00:04:35.470> can<00:04:35.530> do<00:04:35.770> that<00:04:35.950> because<00:04:36.190> they<00:04:36.430> know<00:04:36.460> my

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
I can I can do that because they know my

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.700 
I can I can do that because they know my
philosophy<00:04:37.090> will<00:04:37.630> go<00:04:37.870> along<00:04:38.110> with<00:04:38.260> this<00:04:38.440> and

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
philosophy will go along with this and

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.460 
philosophy will go along with this and
and<00:04:39.670> I<00:04:40.030> made<00:04:40.360> the<00:04:40.450> same<00:04:40.660> decision<00:04:41.140> so<00:04:43.470> that's

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
and I made the same decision so that's

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.930 
and I made the same decision so that's
the<00:04:44.560> only<00:04:44.680> thing<00:04:44.920> I<00:04:45.010> can<00:04:45.190> say<00:04:45.340> but<00:04:45.550> we<00:04:45.700> have<00:04:45.820> to

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
the only thing I can say but we have to

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.290 
the only thing I can say but we have to

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
remember there when to win games it's

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.580 
remember there when to win games it's
it's<00:04:49.630> not<00:04:49.780> only<00:04:50.050> of<00:04:50.320> doing<00:04:51.310> playing<00:04:52.270> nicely<00:04:52.780> we

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.590 
first
well<00:05:15.070> I<00:05:15.100> think<00:05:15.220> that<00:05:15.430> England<00:05:16.000> we<00:05:16.390> need<00:05:16.510> a

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
well I think that England we need a

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.100 
well I think that England we need a
group<00:05:16.810> with<00:05:16.990> a<00:05:17.140> great<00:05:18.070> result<00:05:18.400> and<00:05:18.690> I<00:05:19.690> think

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
group with a great result and I think

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.320 
group with a great result and I think
they<00:05:20.200> have<00:05:20.350> there<00:05:21.250> more<00:05:21.550> possibilities<00:05:22.120> to<00:05:22.210> go

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
they have there more possibilities to go

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.030 
they have there more possibilities to go
until<00:05:22.480> the<00:05:22.660> semi<00:05:22.870> final<00:05:23.260> against<00:05:23.560> Italy<00:05:23.680> then

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
until the semi final against Italy then

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.830 
until the semi final against Italy then
they<00:05:24.250> would<00:05:24.430> have<00:05:24.520> had<00:05:24.670> against<00:05:24.910> Spain<00:05:25.150> but<00:05:25.810> I

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
they would have had against Spain but I

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.480 
they would have had against Spain but I
have<00:05:25.990> to<00:05:26.080> say<00:05:26.230> still<00:05:26.470> my<00:05:26.680> two<00:05:26.740> favorites<00:05:27.310> for

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
have to say still my two favorites for

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.790 
have to say still my two favorites for
the<00:05:27.610> title<00:05:27.970> are<00:05:28.090> still<00:05:28.300> Spain<00:05:28.900> and<00:05:29.170> Germany

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:37.089
