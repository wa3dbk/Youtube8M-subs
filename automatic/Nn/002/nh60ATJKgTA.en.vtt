00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
let's look at the other contents we have

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.940

take<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.439> little<00:01:58.649> loop<00:01:58.920> there<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.820> kind

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
take that little loop there and you kind

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.170 
take that little loop there and you kind
of<00:02:00.090> slide<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.719> through<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.579> side<00:02:02.850> here

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
of slide it through the to the side here

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.780 
of slide it through the to the side here
and<00:02:03.360> if<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.439> had<00:02:04.740> my<00:02:04.920> hands<00:02:05.219> are<00:02:05.310> good<00:02:05.520> i<00:02:05.549> can

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
and if I had my hands are good i can

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.249 
and if I had my hands are good i can
actually<00:02:05.939> push<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.509> through<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.170> it

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
actually push that through and it

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.529 
actually push that through and it
actually<00:02:07.380> does<00:02:07.680> loop<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.129> for<00:02:08.340> me<00:02:08.489> i<00:02:08.670> think<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
actually does loop in for me i think the

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.800 
actually does loop in for me i think the
other<00:02:09.720> end<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.560> slide<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.370> through<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.599> as

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
other end and slide that through and as

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.370 
other end and slide that through and as
i<00:02:12.930> pull<00:02:13.200> through<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.530> should

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
i pull through it should

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.020 
i pull through it should
allow<00:02:14.560> me<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.800> tighten<00:02:15.220> that<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.640> again<00:02:15.850> that

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
allow me to tighten that and again that
