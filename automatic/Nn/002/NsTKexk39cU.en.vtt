00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:08.230
 Continue to talk you about Yes Monja is the mechanism of it is this time Potchinko can 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.160
 I will 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.990
 It seems to be a mechanism though this patin's works, but I don't know you guys, it's a pachinko 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:20.410
 Because there are very many people hitting 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:22.330
 We will teach you from now on as long as you know the mechanism of the later pachinko 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.670
 Attached to the pachinko 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.240
 Easy to understand 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.420
 As you think that you can understand, please be sure to grasp here firmly 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.110
 Well then I will explain 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:39.270
 Yes Well then I will go through each time 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:43.770
 I will talk from the fact that pachinko and so I know that it is included in patchon 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:47.810
 I think many people say that but I think a little place 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:53.390
 I will only touch at the beginning is it Pachinko 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:59.160
 You borrowed from Tama shop and hit that ball . 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.579
 Hey if the ball is in the start chucker, the digital movement is that it makes one turn 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.930
 Ne 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.750
 Yes , I think it's a big hit if everyone has a pattern, but I think everyone knows 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.200
 I had in high-key as a recap 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.450
 Yes next 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:17.820
 When is the moment when the jackpot is decided ? 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:23.850
 Is it time for a play or forerunner to come when reach is reached ? 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:27.100
 It is a pottery that has already reached the rotational speed, but these are all wrong 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:32.480
 Is this all wrong? 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:38.220
 Kedomo it the moment the jackpot is determined is in is I think it's a story I always tell when that's 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:43.260
 The jackpot has already been decided the moment the ball enters the start chucker 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:49.350
 That's why it's fun to produce during digital reach 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:52.360
 So the jackpot drawing has already ended just because any hot vinegar has come 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:57.820
 All things that whether a per or out of the in the 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:02.880
 But please keep in mind do not forget that in the fixed state 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:09.569
 Pachinko is made of things that completely probability in 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:11.069
 What is the perfect probability? A Each time you follow the same rule, you are drawing lots 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.720
 Yes 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:19.080
 Let's take a brief explanation of perfect probability in 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:23.190
 I will explain in the egg area 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:28.680
 There is one big hit in 10 lots 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:33.709
 If there is a lot, there is a rule and if it is 10,000, then this is the rule. 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:40.620
 In Nde This probability is only one example It is 1 of the 10 minutes that contains the shy 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:49.290
 In a perfect probability though the number of trials is quite important though 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:54.629
 It won't be foggy if you hit it 10 times, even if you try to hit 1/10 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:58.470
 Pull once Nde complete probability Pull understand you or I lottery 10 times 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:00.610
 Even if you repeat it 10 times 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:07.090
 Hit 1/10 Dema once 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:08.290
 Hit and a certain probability was also thought that Win say whether always Kedomo there I hit 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.700
 Is not it 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.660
 In I think that there is often My God you do not hit even pull 20 times 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.870
 so 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:22.010
 But if you could try this many times instead of 10 times 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.660
 What will happen ? Not ten times but 10,000 people 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:30.200
 Oh is a turning 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:38.450
 Repeatedly go and Well probability of the jackpot is distinguished service close to enough of first place 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:45.410
 So this is what is called perfect probability, so it's a mechanism of perfect probability of pachinko 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:48.709
 There is a ball at the start, but it is to draw a lot if you compare it with a lot. 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:54.860
 I think you digital to move from there in 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:56.300
 It's just repeating it back to the box to see if it's a jackpot or a miss 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.440
 What 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.730
 I understand you Kana of a co-ON 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.680
 Controversy 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:10.510
 Pachinko is not supposed to pass at all if there is a 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:16.870
 Are you all trying to prove this? 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:18.430
 Result was thinking I'd think very hard very hard with the occult and wave theory market 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.240
 That's why I 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:27.039
 Why is it that pachinko is a perfect probability? 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:29.740
 To start chucker contains the ball such thing as wave theory Nde not have decided to hit the jackpot 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.529
 Gonna be there is not supposed to exist 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:36.969
 Is that okay 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:42.429
 Eh it will be reason this advance to the Well the next step if can know 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:47.870
 The perfect probability can not be won by Junko unless it is completely understood 

00:04:42.429 --> 00:04:52.010
 Please Yes last made to be able to grasp 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:54.930
 But I think that was found in the not Mora look Thank you for visiting 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:59.639
 It is pachinko Works Well Aiu feeling 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:02.460
 I guess some people say that they did not know, but if they knew this 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:09.090
 Yeah It is another capture method 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:17.090
 For example, Oka Let lesbian misled by those things something What do Toka Oh was the wave theory properly 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:22.849
 I think I understood that it was very important to learn with Border Theory Expectation 14 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:28.009
 If you do not understand your grandchildren well, how far in the future are manners 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:31.129
 I can't understand myself properly, so I can watch this many times 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:35.800
 Please take a look and learn to see high 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:35.800
 Well then this time it will be more tired car 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.169
 tan
