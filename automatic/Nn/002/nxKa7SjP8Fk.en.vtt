00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 that cats would have to purr everyone 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.549
 be known but why and how to give 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:14.610
 she this strange noise of 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:16.500
 already from birth to lace cat 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.359
 in the area rum for example if a 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.199
 little kitten with his mother says 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.000
 Schmedeswurth 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.400
 it shows the mother that everything in 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.710
 order is purring during the blessing 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.090
 the mother also possibly around 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.560
 and calm the boys 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.449
 even if you have your cat on the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.050
 right place krault starts it 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.579
 purr 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.040
 So it's a sign of 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.050
 Satisfaction and security but also 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.059
 in stressful situations or in pain 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.520
 cats can purr there are 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.110
 several possible reasons maybe want 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.480
 I calm the cat with it myself 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.120
 According to researcher Dr Mirka 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.770
 Pfleiderer could be the cat with the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.960
 other metals purr that they 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.610
 peacefully is the motto I do 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.739
 you do not hurt me then either 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.539
 which I ask for clarification is the 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.910
 but do not ask too unclear 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.500
 is how the cats ever purr 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.690
 that is not completely scientific yet 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.820
 clarified some claim that at one 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.590
 and exhale the vocal cords in 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.420
 swinging cats 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.640
 have an extra 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.530
 Vocabulary couple and the above 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.369
 flowing air could be the reason for that 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.409
 be purring 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.450
 another theory states that the 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.729
 friction of the air on the hyoid bone 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.500
 The hyoid bone triggers it to purr 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.689
 bone the tongue with the skull 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.830
 but also connects this hypothesis is 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.080
 not proven yet 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.150
 it can also be that purring 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.280
 by a rapid twitch of the larynx 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.979
 muscles and the forearm caused 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.049
 becomes the alternating contractions and 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.079
 the contractions of the laryngeal muscles 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.090
 constricted and consecrated the strangling so 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.710
 it comes to the vibrations we as 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.509
 Purring had to perceive animal 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.220
 Purring promotes bone growth 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.140
 scientific studies have shown 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.990
 that bone growth is through 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.090
 switching frequencies about 25 yards ago 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.119
 the purr is better 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.950
 pretty much in this frequency range 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.079
 according to leo brunnberg director of 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.299
 Polyclinic for small pets 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.820
 free university berlin is through the 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.590
 Vibration the bone density increases this 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.899
 statement is supported by that 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.770
 Bone fractures when bursting faster than 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.990
 in dogs 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.550
 So it seems to be something or something 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.930
 what do you think about the topic write yours 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.130
 Opinion in the comments 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.870
 Now you know how cats purr 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.670
 but do you know why water is running ? 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.440
 can easily walk on the water 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.160
 if not by necessarily this 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.450
 video here 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.860
 we hope that again clearly fallen 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.810
 if yes, give us a thumbs up 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.680
 and subscribe to the channel so he has one 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.550
 couple the bible 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.550
 see you soon and ciao
