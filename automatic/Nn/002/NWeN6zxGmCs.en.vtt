all<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.460> zombies<00:00:21.230> let's<00:00:22.230> see<00:00:22.529> who<00:00:22.680> can<00:00:22.859> win<00:00:23.100> it

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
all the zombies let's see who can win it

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.759 
all the zombies let's see who can win it
so<00:00:23.340> toxic<00:00:23.820> P<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.359> one<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.140> stronger<00:00:25.470> peas

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
so toxic P is one of the stronger peas

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.009 
so toxic P is one of the stronger peas
in<00:00:25.949> my<00:00:25.980> opinion<00:00:26.400> he<00:00:26.460> does<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:27.000> mean<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.840> guess

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
in my opinion he does I mean I guess

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.179 
in my opinion he does I mean I guess
they're<00:00:28.170> all<00:00:28.199> pretty<00:00:28.529> strong<00:00:28.830> honestly<00:00:31.189> well

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
they're all pretty strong honestly well

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.680 
they're all pretty strong honestly well
I'll<00:00:32.279> go<00:00:32.369> back<00:00:32.399> there<00:00:32.579> would<00:00:33.420> have<00:00:33.510> had<00:00:33.600> that

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
I'll go back there would have had that

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.139 
I'll go back there would have had that
exploding<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.200> lot<00:00:34.320> earlier<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:38.059> find<00:00:39.059> his

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
exploding a lot earlier I find his

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.030 
exploding a lot earlier I find his
damage<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.600> pretty<00:00:39.780> good<00:00:40.110> she<00:00:40.739> was<00:00:40.829> straight

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
damage is pretty good she was straight

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.410 
damage is pretty good she was straight
out<00:00:41.100> I'm<00:00:41.340> really<00:00:41.670> just<00:00:41.760> point<00:00:41.969> about<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.270> lag

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
out I'm really just point about that lag

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.500 
out I'm really just point about that lag
because<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.660> actually<00:00:42.809> pushed<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.860> shot<00:00:44.160> down

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
because I actually pushed the shot down

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.690 
because I actually pushed the shot down
the<00:00:45.510> chili<00:00:46.110> bean<00:00:46.320> bomb<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.039> never<00:00:47.280> went

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
the chili bean bomb and it never went

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.450 
the chili bean bomb and it never went
off<00:00:48.200> and<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.350> then<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.559> next<00:00:49.860> time<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.010> used<00:00:50.280> it

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
off and so then the next time I used it

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.459 
off and so then the next time I used it
it<00:00:50.579> was<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.730> lot<00:00:51.000> not<00:00:51.539> not<00:00:51.809> what<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:51.989> wanted<00:00:52.289> it
