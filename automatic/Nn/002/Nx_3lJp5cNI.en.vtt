00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.080
 it is rich in flavors one very good 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.580
 wild strawberry taste are really 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.200
 very sweet his ranks like a moment 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.029
 better than a candy since it is 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.949
 natural French strawberry does not have 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.759
 need whipped cream or sugar for 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.770
 to be tasted 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:26.779
 this is the case of la charlotte 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.640
 garriguette the ciflorette and the round 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.649
 strawberries that holds many 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.300
 massive production secrets and I on 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.440
 going to go in a strawberry ray i'm going 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.660
 tell you a story about the strawberry 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.210
 producers like patrick there are some 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.680
 500 within the strawberry they are 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.839
 located throughout the territory 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.390
 French is here in the South West 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:46.820
 everything starts here on the mothers feet of 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.100
 strawberries we have stolons that 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.789
 it picks up and costs like these 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.920
 and this for the graded plan little bit of 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.960
 potting soil that have struggled for 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.370
 roots and a few months later it is 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.809
 puts in cultivation in our plots of 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.159
 production to get strawberries from 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.170
 quality french producers 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.089
 use two modes of production the 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.000
 production in soil and production out 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.590
 garden floor hanging like this or 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.020
 strawberry planted in bags of 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.600
 potting all our strawberries are sheltered 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.060
 through tunnels to protect them from 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.260
 bad weather from the sun and rain 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.840
 strawberries are then grown with 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.820
 passion and in the rules of art it 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.810
 Note that the credit plan of 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.990
 ways to reproduce 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.360
 the fruit is the only one if we let them 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.680
 stolons he's getting fewer flowers so 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.180
 less fruit picked up so 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.600
 regularly you have to go through certain 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.040
 cash 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.690
 producers use means 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.940
 natural to protect strawberries 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.350
 like here for example with these insects 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.050
 which eliminates parasites 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.430
 all these natural products are used to 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.200
 avoid using chemicals 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.110
 we must know that in our society 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.500
 all producers are in agriculture 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.990
 reasoned 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.950
 next is the harvest of the month of March 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.690
 in november 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.340
 the strawberries are picked up by hand a 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.650
 delicate work because the sentence is 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.930
 fragile I pick up strawberries that smells 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.340
 really good red 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.470
 when they are well red this 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.380
 means that the strawberry and arrived his 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.289
 optimal ripening which guarantees the 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.600
 consumer a fruit a price 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.640
 of excellence melting in the mouth is also 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.380
 very fragrant opn strawberries works 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.190
 for several years to get these 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.810
 beautiful red fruits 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.670
 our main secret is 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.800
 actually all the work that we 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.570
 lead upstream of varietal creation and 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.220
 of experimentation since we our 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.230
 main objective is obviously 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.700
 to differentiate ourselves from products 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.030
 import by the end of our poles 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.060
 to obtain a variety like charlotte 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.340
 7 10 years of work for completion 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.870
 actually work and a product 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.459
 quality and to taste the best 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.930
 strawberries grown by the producers of 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.620
 with us here are the tips of a 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.420
 professional 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.190
 the first criterion for choosing a good 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.489
 strawberry the one stopped according to the 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.989
 season 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.540
 the first strawberries that announces the 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.550
 spring it is first the garriguette 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.440
 and the ciflorette then you have some 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.940
 seasonal varieties 10 or more season 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.100
 on the month of April may and then the 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.540
 rising phases of charlotte type that 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.190
 there you will find 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.470
 spring and throughout the summer until 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.060
 first relay once chosen 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.500
 strawberries can be kept at maximum two 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.480
 days in the crisper of the fridge 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.910
 then we can pass them under a light 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.650
 fillet of water remove the peduncle and 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.070
 finally we savor them at temperature 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.989
 ambient 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.250
 the strawberry in addition to being a very product 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.900
 greedy it's also a product with 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.070
 many nutritional qualities this 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.720
 both a product contains a lot 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.950
 of vitamin C that contains 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.269
 antioxidants to make work the 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.549
 memory and to help conserve it 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.720
 it is also a product that contains very 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.920
 few calories from the conflent eat 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.140
 a lot while keeping the line
