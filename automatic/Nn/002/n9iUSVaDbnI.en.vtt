00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.280 
example let's take a look at this
picture<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.219> cat<00:00:11.429> preview<00:00:12.240> will<00:00:12.870> let<00:00:13.110> you

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290

I'll<00:00:17.910> show<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.210> few<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.570> those<00:00:19.850> first<00:00:20.850> let's

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
I'll show you a few of those first let's

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.509 
I'll show you a few of those first let's
look<00:00:21.270> at<00:00:21.420> adjusting<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.960> color<00:00:22.250> under<00:00:23.250> tools

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
look at adjusting the color under tools

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.580 
look at adjusting the color under tools
you<00:00:24.180> can<00:00:24.330> choose<00:00:24.510> adjust<00:00:24.869> color<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.439> can

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
you can choose adjust color and you can

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.679 
you can choose adjust color and you can
see<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.859> shortcut<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.310> option<00:00:26.699> command<00:00:27.029> C<00:00:27.420> so

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
see the shortcut is option command C so

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:28.939 
see the shortcut is option command C so
if<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.869> need<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.080> do<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.380> lot<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.800> might

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
if you need to do this a lot you might

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.540 
if you need to do this a lot you might
want<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.130> memorize<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.580> shortcut<00:00:31.219> here<00:00:32.219> this

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
want to memorize that shortcut here this

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.330 
want to memorize that shortcut here this
is<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.850> standard<00:00:33.300> Apple<00:00:33.780> color<00:00:34.710> adjustment

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
is the standard Apple color adjustment

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:43.040 
is the standard Apple color adjustment
so<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.059> can<00:00:36.180> adjust<00:00:36.270> exposure<00:00:42.050> contrast

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
so we can adjust exposure contrast

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.580 
so we can adjust exposure contrast
saturation<00:00:43.620> which<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.640> amount<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.910> color

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
saturation which is the amount of color

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.930 
saturation which is the amount of color
you<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.739> turn<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.950> photo<00:00:47.219> black<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.670> white<00:00:47.760> by

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
you can turn a photo black and white by

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.720 
you can turn a photo black and white by
moving<00:00:48.149> saturation<00:00:48.719> all<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> way<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.050> minimum

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
moving saturation all the way to minimum

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.100 
moving saturation all the way to minimum
you<00:00:50.730> can<00:00:50.760> change<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.480> tint<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.930> color

can also make the photo sepia toned for
an<00:01:00.840> old-time<00:01:01.379> look<00:01:01.649> I'm<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.430> going<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.699> reset

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
an old-time look I'm just going to reset

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:03.349 
an old-time look I'm just going to reset
this

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
this

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.329 
this
you<00:01:03.629> can<00:01:03.750> also<00:01:03.899> blur<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.470> picture<00:01:04.860> slightly

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
you can also blur the picture slightly

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.700 
you can also blur the picture slightly
or<00:01:05.600> sharpen<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:08.840> so<00:01:09.840> there's<00:01:10.020> one<00:01:10.229> there<00:01:10.590> are

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
really well done so it doesn't really

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.969 
really well done so it doesn't really
need<00:01:14.369> any<00:01:14.580> color<00:01:14.790> adjustment<00:01:15.740> another<00:01:16.740> thing

you can do is you can crop the image

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.570 
you can do is you can crop the image
you'll<00:01:19.259> notice<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.890> gives<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.369> an

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
you'll notice that it gives you an

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.359 
you'll notice that it gives you an
actual<00:01:21.470> indication<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> resolution<00:01:23.280> of

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
actual indication of the resolution of

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.170 
actual indication of the resolution of
the<00:01:23.520> pixel<00:01:24.210> size<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.720> your<00:01:25.110> crop<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.909> if<00:01:26.909> you

need a particular size in pixels for a
website<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:31.710> do<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:32.939> draw<00:01:33.119> a

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
website you can do that you can draw a

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.789 
website you can do that you can draw a
box<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.720> then<00:01:33.780> move<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.380> choose<00:01:34.590> exactly

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
box and then move it to choose exactly

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.480 
box and then move it to choose exactly
what<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.520> want<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.880> crop<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:37.340> then<00:01:38.340> all

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
what you want to crop to and then all

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.190 
what you want to crop to and then all
you<00:01:38.579> need<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.820> do<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.030> go<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.299> tools<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.930> choose

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
you need to do is go to tools and choose

you need to do is go to tools and choose
crop<00:01:40.500> or<00:01:40.799> command<00:01:41.520> k<00:01:42.799> then<00:01:43.799> if<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.490> want<00:01:44.700> to

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.550 
resize the photo up or down you can
choose<00:01:47.490> adjust<00:01:47.909> size<00:01:48.270> under<00:01:48.720> tools<00:01:51.110> or<00:01:52.110> pixels

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
choose adjust size under tools or pixels

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.190 
choose adjust size under tools or pixels
for<00:01:52.770> web<00:01:52.950> stuff<00:01:53.159> let's<00:01:53.970> say<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:54.270> do<00:01:54.390> 800<00:01:55.020> pixels

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
for web stuff let's say we do 800 pixels

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.179 
for web stuff let's say we do 800 pixels
and<00:01:58.200> there<00:01:58.350> we<00:01:58.439> have<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.799> does<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> pretty

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
and there we have it it does a pretty

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.929 
and there we have it it does a pretty
good<00:01:59.340> job<00:01:59.490> obviously<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.890> you<00:02:01.890> can't<00:02:02.159> keep<00:02:02.340> up

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
good job obviously you you can't keep up

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.670
