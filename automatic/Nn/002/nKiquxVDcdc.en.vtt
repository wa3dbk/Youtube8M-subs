00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 is sanitary that can be generated in that 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.020
 place even américo today the 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.300
 national singer jumped into the debate 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.190
 also doing harsh criticism against 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.110
 the government mainly because it says 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.330
 that the localities here that have been 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.070
 affected by this flood have been 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.770
 abandoned of all this in the context 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.500
 of a delivery of help that the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.869
 singer in the city ​​of paipote we are going to 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.340

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.650
 castle who has a complete report 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.650
 with respect to this situation 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.650
 odierno 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.500
 they are not sitting with a tie 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.230
 I sack America's applause as if 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:45.039
 sung his best song that yes a 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.039
 full of protests 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.110
 direct criticism it seems that america 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.820
 he was really angry that he hit hard 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.019
 government when it arrived on Monday to paipote 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.019
 to deliver aid to the victims 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.080
 with all the regulations and do not give 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.190
 space to none 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.380
 therefore he was outraged to see the state 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.210
 of the victims who ranted as 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.020
 he wanted it clear because the mood of paipote 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.020
 It is not the best 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.579
 the neighbors are fed up today in the canal 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.259
 which is right in front of their houses the 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.420
 trucks are cleaned open pits the 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.579
 waste from sewage that comes from 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.939
 the pipelines covered with mud waters of the 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:30.939
 Valley 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.229
 walking their trucks 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.820
 as they do not realize the tremendous damage 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.650
 that are causing there are children there 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.900
 elderly people are still sleeping in the 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.670
 hill and this smell is split for all 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.550
 sides you have been able to notice and 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.320
 Of course it shows human waste 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.900
 kaka and maybe that another substance that 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.119
 they form a putrid smell a delight 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.280
 for the flies we are full of shit 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.550
 and they keep throwing a shit I think 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.110
 that does not match any mosquerío 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.130
 there now imagine that with this that is 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.080
 there and the authority did not send it to 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.989
 change them to vote there is not authority 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.979
 I think it wants to order the defense and 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:15.540
 they're throwing everything in there 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:19.940
 the problem here is a poor machine 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.940
 worker I already do in reaching the 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.290
 the plague of mice are surely going to 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.390
 start to leave 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.730
 finally the water will run but it is not 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.820
 stagnant and it continues to accumulate and goes 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.980
 going around what I had is true 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.930
 and is almost reaching the junction of the tailings 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.900
 that the people of paipote have to go 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.820
 towards copying other sectors before the 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.710
 emergency the place was intended by the 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.780
 authority but the idea was that the water 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.400
 run not that it will stagnate or we will 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.140
 look for a way to treat so that 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.600
 the noise will arrive as much as possible 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.580
 establish a channel in that area 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.680
 at least there is a deadline that was set 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.540
 to clear paipote and have operative 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.760
 the sewage system 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.150
 next 20 days we will have to 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.790
 have also cleared the system 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.250
 water treatment and system that have 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.410
 had in all this area that is the area 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.180
 report was one of the most 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.160
 affected in copiapó why their 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.010
 inhabitants want the solution to flow 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.480
 and it does not stay stagnant the authority says 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.760
 that is advancing but the neighbors over 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.530
 everything in paipote have another idea about 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.200
 all because they have to live with water 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.640
 served and with the nauseating smell from 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.560
