requests to make an updated tutorial so
I<00:00:14.309> use<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.790> blanket<00:00:15.179> stitch<00:00:15.330> on<00:00:15.780> my<00:00:16.170> flat

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
I use the blanket stitch on my flat

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.040 
I use the blanket stitch on my flat
plushies<00:00:16.980> like<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:18.359> can<00:00:18.539> see<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.720> use<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
plushies like this you can see I use the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.570 
plushies like this you can see I use the
blanket<00:00:19.380> stitch<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.859> sew<00:00:20.070> all<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.340> way<00:00:20.460> around

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.290 
blanket stitch to sew all the way around
here<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.380> I<00:00:22.380> also<00:00:22.560> use<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:22.949> on<00:00:23.220> my<00:00:23.400> 3d<00:00:23.850> plushies

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
here and I also use it on my 3d plushies

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.259 
here and I also use it on my 3d plushies
as<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:25.320> can<00:00:25.500> see<00:00:25.740> by<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.220> traffic<00:00:26.640> code<00:00:27.029> I

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
as you can see by this traffic code I

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.599 
as you can see by this traffic code I
used<00:00:27.779> blanket<00:00:28.260> stitch<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.680> these<00:00:28.859> edges<00:00:29.400> and

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
used blanket stitch on these edges and

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.730 
used blanket stitch on these edges and
I've<00:00:30.359> also<00:00:30.539> used<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.929> blanket<00:00:31.289> stitch<00:00:31.380> on

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
I've also used the blanket stitch on

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.830 
I've also used the blanket stitch on
this<00:00:31.890> edge<00:00:32.099> but<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.489> turned<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:33.059> inside<00:00:33.360> out<00:00:33.390> so

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
this edge but I turned it inside out so

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.700 
this edge but I turned it inside out so
it's<00:00:33.989> not<00:00:34.140> as<00:00:34.320> obvious<00:00:35.960> ok<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.290> have<00:00:37.649> my

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
it's not as obvious ok so I have my

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.590 
it's not as obvious ok so I have my
fabric<00:00:38.280> right<00:00:38.489> here<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.030> as<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.390> can<00:00:39.540> see

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
fabric right here and as you can see

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.600 
fabric right here and as you can see
I've<00:00:39.989> lined<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.500> up<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.190> two<00:00:41.370> edges

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
I've lined it up so that the two edges

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.389 
I've lined it up so that the two edges
are<00:00:41.940> together<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:43.469> also<00:00:43.649> have<00:00:43.950> my<00:00:44.129> needle

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
are together and I also have my needle

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.970 
are together and I also have my needle
and<00:00:44.610> thread<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.570> knotted<00:00:46.140> my<00:00:46.320> sled<00:00:46.590> at<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
and thread so I knotted my sled at the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.869 
and thread so I knotted my sled at the
end<00:00:47.129> as<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:48.559> see<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.860> that's<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.760> to

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
end as you can see and that's just to

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.729 
end as you can see and that's just to
stop<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.210> unraveling<00:00:51.690> normally<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.620> would

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
stop it unraveling normally you would

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.260 
stop it unraveling normally you would
use<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> matching<00:00:53.309> thread<00:00:53.520> color<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.180> your

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
use a matching thread color to your

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.180 
use a matching thread color to your
fabric<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:54.899> I'm<00:00:55.020> using<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.379> contrasting<00:00:55.770> color

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
fabric but I'm using a contrasting color

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.520

your<00:01:48.030> first<00:01:48.390> stitch<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.960> don't<00:01:49.229> need<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.530> go

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
your first stitch you don't need to go

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.130 
your first stitch you don't need to go
back<00:01:49.680> into<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.460> first<00:01:50.700> layer<00:01:50.970> I'm<00:01:51.479> just<00:01:51.689> going

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
back into the first layer I'm just going

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.810 
back into the first layer I'm just going
to<00:01:52.200> continue<00:01:52.470> going<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.189> second<00:01:53.549> way<00:01:53.640> so

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
going to move a little bit along my

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.179 
going to move a little bit along my
fabric<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:58.229> then<00:01:58.350> I'm<00:01:58.469> going<00:01:58.680> into<00:01:59.040> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
fabric and then I'm going into the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.310 
fabric and then I'm going into the
second<00:01:59.579> layer<00:01:59.759> going<00:02:00.719> through<00:02:00.899> both<00:02:01.079> layers

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
second layer going through both layers

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.030 
second layer going through both layers
this<00:02:01.560> time<00:02:02.119> I'm<00:02:03.119> gonna<00:02:03.270> pull<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.770> nearly<00:02:04.770> all

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
this time I'm gonna pull it nearly all

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.410 
this time I'm gonna pull it nearly all
the<00:02:05.130> way<00:02:05.159> through<00:02:05.460> leaving<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.880> loop<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.090> like

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
the way through leaving a loop just like

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.300 
the way through leaving a loop just like
before<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.229> then<00:02:07.649> I'm<00:02:07.770> going<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.039> put<00:02:08.190> my

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
I'm just gonna keep doing this a couple

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.600 
I'm just gonna keep doing this a couple
more<00:02:16.030> times<00:02:16.090> for<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.599> guys<00:02:17.400> through<00:02:18.400> both

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
more times for you guys through both

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.979 
more times for you guys through both
layers<00:02:20.250> leave<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.280> loop<00:02:21.580> put<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.540> through<00:02:22.750> the

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
layers leave a loop put it through the

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:29.420 
layers leave a loop put it through the
loop<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:24.340> pull<00:02:24.540> tight<00:02:26.610> through<00:02:27.610> both<00:02:27.819> layers

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
loop and pull tight through both layers

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.170 
loop and pull tight through both layers
leave<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.459> loop<00:02:31.110> put<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.230> through<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.620> loop<00:02:33.180> and

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
leave a loop put it through the loop and

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.100 
leave a loop put it through the loop and
pull<00:02:34.530> tight

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.930 

once<00:02:40.740> you<00:02:40.890> get<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.130> hang<00:02:41.160> of<00:02:41.310> doing<00:02:41.610> this<00:02:41.760> you

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
once you get the hang of doing this you

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.640 
once you get the hang of doing this you
can<00:02:42.120> do<00:02:42.270> it<00:02:42.360> faster<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:42.870> faster<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.530> then

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
can do it faster and faster and then

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.880 
can do it faster and faster and then
it's<00:02:43.830> really<00:02:44.100> simple<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:45.410> this<00:02:46.410> method<00:02:46.770> is

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
it's really simple and this method is

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.370 
it's really simple and this method is
actually<00:02:47.040> slightly<00:02:47.550> quicker<00:02:47.910> than<00:02:48.840> if<00:02:49.230> you

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
actually slightly quicker than if you

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.270 
actually slightly quicker than if you
guys<00:02:49.530> watched<00:02:49.800> my<00:02:50.040> original<00:02:50.520> video<00:02:50.820> I<00:02:52.280> just

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
guys watched my original video I just

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.700 
guys watched my original video I just
kind<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.820> gradually<00:02:54.330> realized<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:55.110> one<00:02:55.680> of

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
kind of gradually realized that one of

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.320 
kind of gradually realized that one of
the<00:02:55.950> steps<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.490> did<00:02:56.520> in<00:02:56.760> my<00:02:56.910> first<00:02:56.940> video

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
the steps that I did in my first video

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.720 
the steps that I did in my first video
isn't<00:02:57.750> really<00:02:57.780> necessary<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.340> started

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
isn't really necessary and I started

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.980 
isn't really necessary and I started
doing<00:02:59.910> my<00:03:00.030> blanket<00:03:00.390> stitch<00:03:00.570> like<00:03:00.780> this

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
doing my blanket stitch like this

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.740 
doing my blanket stitch like this
instead<00:03:01.490> it<00:03:02.490> looks<00:03:02.700> just<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.060> same<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.600> it's

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
instead it looks just the same and it's

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.230 
instead it looks just the same and it's
just<00:03:04.050> as<00:03:04.200> secure<00:03:04.500> as<00:03:04.590> my<00:03:04.770> other<00:03:04.920> one<00:03:05.100> now<00:03:06.030> can

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
just as secure as my other one now can

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.360 
just as secure as my other one now can
you<00:03:06.360> guys<00:03:06.480> see<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.810> how<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.740> pulled<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.160> tight

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
you guys see that how I pulled it tight

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.070 
you guys see that how I pulled it tight
but<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.850> two<00:03:09.030> threads<00:03:09.390> right<00:03:09.570> here<00:03:09.780> still

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
but the two threads right here still

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.920 
but the two threads right here still
separated<00:03:10.790> now<00:03:11.790> if<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.150> happens<00:03:12.540> all<00:03:12.840> you

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
separated now if that happens all you

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.130 
separated now if that happens all you
need<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.200> do<00:03:13.350> is<00:03:13.560> take<00:03:14.070> one<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:14.370> your<00:03:14.550> threads

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
need to do is take one of your threads

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.210 
need to do is take one of your threads
because<00:03:16.140> I'm<00:03:16.260> sewing<00:03:16.530> with<00:03:16.680> a<00:03:16.710> double<00:03:17.010> thread

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
because I'm sewing with a double thread

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.770 
because I'm sewing with a double thread
here<00:03:17.460> and<00:03:17.750> I'm<00:03:18.750> just<00:03:18.780> going<00:03:19.080> to<00:03:19.140> pull<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.590> until

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
here and I'm just going to pull it until

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.150 
here and I'm just going to pull it until
as<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:21.990> can<00:03:22.170> see<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.500> two<00:03:22.650> threads<00:03:22.950> are

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
as you can see the two threads are

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.150 
as you can see the two threads are
together<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.670> bead<00:03:24.530> so<00:03:25.530> I'll<00:03:25.740> just<00:03:25.920> continue

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
together the bead so I'll just continue

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:55.110 
together the bead so I'll just continue
sewing<00:03:26.670> all<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.000> way<00:03:27.090> down<00:03:27.330> here

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
and then once you're finished with your

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.680 
and then once you're finished with your
blanket<00:03:57.459> stitch<00:03:57.700> at<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:57.940> end<00:03:58.150> of<00:03:58.360> the<00:03:58.450> plush

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
blanket stitch at the end of the plush

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.050 
blanket stitch at the end of the plush
I'm<00:03:59.500> going<00:03:59.739> to<00:03:59.860> make<00:04:00.010> another<00:04:00.250> stitch<00:04:00.580> over

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
I'm going to make another stitch over

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.670 
I'm going to make another stitch over
the<00:04:01.150> top<00:04:01.390> of<00:04:01.569> the<00:04:01.690> last<00:04:01.900> stitch<00:04:02.110> that<00:04:02.170> I<00:04:02.380> did

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
the top of the last stitch that I did

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.440 
the top of the last stitch that I did
that's<00:04:03.370> just<00:04:03.670> going<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:03.880> make<00:04:03.970> it<00:04:04.120> slightly

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
that's just going to make it slightly

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.479 
that's just going to make it slightly
more<00:04:04.599> secure<00:04:05.910> call<00:04:06.910> that<00:04:07.090> tight<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:09.010> now<00:04:09.310> what

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
more secure call that tight and now what

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.130 
more secure call that tight and now what
I'm<00:04:09.640> going<00:04:09.880> to<00:04:09.940> do<00:04:10.120> is<00:04:10.330> I'm<00:04:10.510> going<00:04:10.660> to<00:04:10.750> put<00:04:10.989> my
