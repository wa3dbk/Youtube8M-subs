00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
team with five goals every night but

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.210 
team with five goals every night but
right<00:02:28.780> now<00:02:28.930> we<00:02:28.989> feel<00:02:29.140> very<00:02:29.319> comfortable<00:02:29.709> was

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
right now we feel very comfortable was

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.610 
right now we feel very comfortable was
where<00:02:30.400> we're<00:02:30.580> at<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.900> games<00:02:32.140> that<00:02:32.260> were<00:02:32.440> in<00:02:32.590> ER

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
where we're at the games that were in ER

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.589 
where we're at the games that were in ER
one-goal<00:02:33.099> games<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.730> we<00:02:33.819> seem<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.239> find<00:02:34.420> a

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
one-goal games and we seem to find a

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:35.880 
one-goal games and we seem to find a
goal<00:02:34.810> at<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.019> right<00:02:35.170> time<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.590> come<00:02:35.739> out<00:02:35.860> on

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
goal at the right time and come out on

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.460 
goal at the right time and come out on
top<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:36.489> I<00:02:37.299> think<00:02:37.660> we're<00:02:37.930> playing<00:02:38.049> the<00:02:38.320> right

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
top so I think we're playing the right

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.229 
top so I think we're playing the right
way<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:38.920> think<00:02:39.340> we<00:02:39.459> still<00:02:39.670> could<00:02:40.060> get

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
way and I think we still could get

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.300 
way and I think we still could get
better<00:02:40.390> but<00:02:40.690> we<00:02:41.350> got<00:02:41.470> 12<00:02:41.650> years<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:42.010> work<00:02:42.160> on

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
better but we got 12 years to work on

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.340 
better but we got 12 years to work on
