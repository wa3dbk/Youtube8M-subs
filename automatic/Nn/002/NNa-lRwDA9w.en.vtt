00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
the same pH same temperature so you

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.289 
the same pH same temperature so you
don't<00:01:55.590> shock<00:01:55.829> your<00:01:56.009> system<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.880> same<00:01:57.090> rules

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
like you would the gravel but you want

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.350 
like you would the gravel but you want
to<00:02:12.060> use<00:02:12.150> a

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
to use a

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.050 
to use a

through<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.390> siphon<00:02:15.750> otherwise<00:02:16.020> you'll<00:02:16.200> suck

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
through the siphon otherwise you'll suck

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.220 
through the siphon otherwise you'll suck
all<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.770> sand<00:02:17.040> out
