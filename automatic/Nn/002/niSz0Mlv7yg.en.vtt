probably<00:03:37.650> get<00:03:37.860> more<00:03:38.010> efficiency<00:03:38.489> out<00:03:38.670> of<00:03:38.820> it

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
probably get more efficiency out of it

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.550 
probably get more efficiency out of it
certainly<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.720> other<00:03:39.750> automakers<00:03:40.200> are

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
certainly the other automakers are

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.290 
certainly the other automakers are
getting<00:03:40.800> more<00:03:40.980> power<00:03:41.250> out<00:03:41.489> of<00:03:41.519> similarly

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
getting more power out of similarly

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.320 
getting more power out of similarly
constructed<00:03:42.800> engines<00:03:43.800> but<00:03:44.580> this<00:03:44.790> does<00:03:45.000> give

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
constructed engines but this does give

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.509 
constructed engines but this does give
this<00:03:45.540> car<00:03:45.840> an<00:03:46.080> average<00:03:46.530> of<00:03:46.620> about<00:03:46.769> 25<00:03:47.280> miles

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
this car an average of about 25 miles

this car an average of about 25 miles
per<00:03:47.640> gallon<00:03:48.060> which<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:48.300> not<00:03:48.480> bad<00:03:48.720> even<00:03:49.140> better

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
per gallon which is not bad even better

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.259 
per gallon which is not bad even better
it<00:03:49.650> gets<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:49.950> card<00:03:50.130> at<00:03:50.250> 60<00:03:50.550> miles<00:03:50.730> per<00:03:50.910> hour<00:03:51.060> in

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
it gets the card at 60 miles per hour in

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.020 
it gets the card at 60 miles per hour in
5.5<00:03:52.019> seconds<00:03:52.530> which<00:03:52.709> for<00:03:53.489> a<00:03:53.550> car<00:03:53.700> like<00:03:53.850> this

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
5.5 seconds which for a car like this

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.920 
5.5 seconds which for a car like this
it's<00:03:54.540> impressive

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.920

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
like a normal automatic transmission I'm

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.120 
like a normal automatic transmission I'm
gonna<00:04:06.780> put<00:04:06.989> it<00:04:07.080> in<00:04:07.200> Drive<00:04:07.470> it<00:04:07.680> doesn't<00:04:07.890> want<00:04:08.010> to

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
gonna put it in Drive it doesn't want to

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.490 
gonna put it in Drive it doesn't want to
creep<00:04:08.760> forward<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:09.420> actually<00:04:09.510> have<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.900> give<00:04:10.410> it

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
creep forward I actually have to give it

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
creep forward I actually have to give it
a<00:04:10.530> little<00:04:10.620> gas<00:04:10.860> to<00:04:11.190> make<00:04:11.340> it<00:04:11.459> move

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
a little gas to make it move

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.060 
a little gas to make it move
also<00:04:14.270> it<00:04:14.420> has<00:04:14.630> electric<00:04:15.200> power<00:04:15.440> steering<00:04:15.860> and

also it has electric power steering and

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.880 
also it has electric power steering and
you<00:04:16.130> can<00:04:16.220> really<00:04:16.400> feel<00:04:16.700> that<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:17.300> way<00:04:17.630> this

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
you can really feel that the way this

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
ride all the way up to redline let's put

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.080 
ride all the way up to redline let's put
it<00:04:39.200> in<00:04:39.320> this<00:04:39.500> manual<00:04:40.250> mode<00:04:40.460> by<00:04:40.670> shifting<00:04:40.970> the

it in this manual mode by shifting the

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.350 
it in this manual mode by shifting the
gate<00:04:41.270> over<00:04:41.510> one<00:04:41.720> and<00:04:42.140> there<00:04:42.980> you<00:04:43.130> can<00:04:43.360> push

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
gate over one and there you can push

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.600 
gate over one and there you can push
forward<00:04:44.840> to<00:04:44.990> upshift<00:04:45.220> pull<00:04:46.220> back<00:04:46.430> to

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
forward to upshift pull back to

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.450 
forward to upshift pull back to
downshift<00:04:46.850> and<00:04:47.480> because<00:04:48.380> of<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.650> DSG<00:04:48.950> it

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
downshift and because of the DSG it

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.220 
downshift and because of the DSG it
really<00:04:49.670> grabs<00:04:49.970> those<00:04:50.210> gears<00:04:50.450> pretty<00:04:50.780> well<00:04:50.960> you

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
really grabs those gears pretty well you

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.140 
really grabs those gears pretty well you
don't<00:04:51.320> get<00:04:51.500> the<00:04:51.590> kind<00:04:51.680> of<00:04:51.830> lag<00:04:52.040> you<00:04:52.340> get<00:04:52.550> with<00:04:52.760> a

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
don't get the kind of lag you get with a

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.240 
don't get the kind of lag you get with a
torque<00:04:53.600> converter<00:04:53.630> transmission<00:04:54.410> you<00:04:55.100> also

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
torque converter transmission you also

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.010 
torque converter transmission you also
get<00:04:55.460> better<00:04:55.580> fuel<00:04:55.850> efficiency<00:04:56.030> -<00:04:56.690> which<00:04:56.720> is

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
get better fuel efficiency - which is

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.900 
get better fuel efficiency - which is
why<00:04:57.200> bucks<00:04:57.500> wagon<00:04:57.830> went<00:04:58.010> with<00:04:58.130> the<00:04:58.190> DSG<00:04:58.490> in

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
why bucks wagon went with the DSG in

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.960 
why bucks wagon went with the DSG in
this<00:04:59.210> car<00:04:59.480> I<00:04:59.840> do<00:05:00.140> like<00:05:00.410> the<00:05:00.530> ride<00:05:00.800> feel<00:05:01.220> in<00:05:01.550> the

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
this car I do like the ride feel in the

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.990 
this car I do like the ride feel in the
CC<00:05:02.360> it's<00:05:02.960> pretty<00:05:03.260> comfortable<00:05:03.590> although<00:05:04.520> I

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
CC it's pretty comfortable although I

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.310 
CC it's pretty comfortable although I
don't<00:05:05.150> know<00:05:05.330> if<00:05:05.450> a<00:05:05.540> lot<00:05:05.720> of<00:05:05.750> people<00:05:05.930> would

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
don't know if a lot of people would

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.870 
don't know if a lot of people would
really<00:05:06.530> think<00:05:06.830> it's<00:05:07.040> much<00:05:07.430> different<00:05:07.670> than

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
really think it's much different than

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.060 
really think it's much different than
say<00:05:08.180> a<00:05:08.210> Ford<00:05:08.600> Fusion<00:05:08.840> or<00:05:09.110> a<00:05:09.170> Hyundai<00:05:09.500> Sonata

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
it feels pretty stable in the turns and

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.670 
it feels pretty stable in the turns and
it<00:05:13.580> handles<00:05:13.790> the<00:05:14.090> bumps<00:05:14.450> pretty<00:05:14.720> well<00:05:17.680> 2013

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680
