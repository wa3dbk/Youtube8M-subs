00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
you have to kind of like repeat the same

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.559 
you have to kind of like repeat the same
levels<00:02:33.340> over<00:02:33.490> and<00:02:33.580> over<00:02:33.730> again<00:02:33.819> is<00:02:34.150> kind

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
levels over and over again is kind

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.720 
levels over and over again is kind
tedious<00:02:35.019> and<00:02:35.590> also<00:02:36.010> if<00:02:36.219> you<00:02:36.340> walk<00:02:36.489> in<00:02:36.640> the

tedious and also if you walk in the

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.009 
tedious and also if you walk in the
wrong<00:02:36.849> levels<00:02:37.209> of<00:02:37.299> the<00:02:37.360> area<00:02:37.599> it'll<00:02:37.810> suck<00:02:37.989> the

touchscreen controls is really

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.089 
touchscreen controls is really
interesting<00:02:59.049> for<00:02:59.349> instance<00:02:59.890> with<00:03:00.010> the

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
interesting for instance with the

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.399 
interesting for instance with the
boomerang<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:01.120> can<00:03:01.269> actually<00:03:01.450> plot<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.139> path

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
boomerang you can actually plot the path

boomerang you can actually plot the path
of<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:02.829> boomerang<00:03:03.220> just<00:03:03.430> by<00:03:03.519> drawing<00:03:03.819> a

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
of the boomerang just by drawing a

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.789 
of the boomerang just by drawing a
little<00:03:04.209> path<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.900> it'll<00:03:05.079> go<00:03:05.349> exactly<00:03:05.620> where

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
little path and it'll go exactly where

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.770 
little path and it'll go exactly where
you<00:03:05.980> tell<00:03:06.159> it<00:03:06.189> to<00:03:06.310> go<00:03:06.519> figuring<00:03:07.510> out<00:03:07.569> all<00:03:07.629> the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
you tell it to go figuring out all the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.000 
you tell it to go figuring out all the
different<00:03:07.870> little<00:03:08.170> mechanics<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:08.709> can<00:03:08.859> use

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
different little mechanics you can use

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.259 
different little mechanics you can use
with<00:03:09.280> some<00:03:09.370> items<00:03:09.549> is<00:03:09.760> probably<00:03:09.970> one<00:03:10.150> of<00:03:10.180> the

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
with some items is probably one of the

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.720 
with some items is probably one of the
best<00:03:10.420> parts<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.840> entire<00:03:11.079> game<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:12.519> other

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
on maps and well that sounds like a

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.720 
on maps and well that sounds like a
really<00:03:17.169> small<00:03:17.439> addition<00:03:17.889> at<00:03:17.980> first<00:03:18.280> once<00:03:18.639> you

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.899 
it's a neat little addition to the game
what<00:04:14.769> makes<00:04:14.979> Phantom<00:04:15.340> Hourglass<00:04:15.729> so

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:15.909

what makes Phantom Hourglass so
impressive<00:04:16.389> as<00:04:16.510> a<00:04:16.539> TS<00:04:16.780> game<00:04:16.959> isn't

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
impressive as a TS game isn't

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.930 
impressive as a TS game isn't
necessarily<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.859> fact<00:04:18.099> that<00:04:18.190> like<00:04:18.489> it's<00:04:18.789> a

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
necessarily the fact that like it's a

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.849 
necessarily the fact that like it's a
Zelda<00:04:19.269> game<00:04:19.299> because<00:04:19.840> as<00:04:20.049> far<00:04:20.440> as<00:04:20.560> being<00:04:20.709> a

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
Zelda game because as far as being a

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.439 
Zelda game because as far as being a
Zelda<00:04:21.159> game<00:04:21.190> is<00:04:21.430> concerned<00:04:21.729> it's<00:04:22.210> really

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
Zelda game is concerned it's really

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:23.640 
Zelda game is concerned it's really
really<00:04:22.659> good<00:04:22.870> but<00:04:23.229> it's<00:04:23.320> not<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.530> most

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
really good but it's not the most

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.529 
really good but it's not the most
impressive<00:04:23.889> one<00:04:24.190> you'll<00:04:24.370> ever<00:04:24.430> play<00:04:24.669> what

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
impressive one you'll ever play what

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.060 
impressive one you'll ever play what
makes<00:04:25.750> it<00:04:25.900> so<00:04:25.990> impressive<00:04:26.530> is<00:04:26.740> just<00:04:26.979> the

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
makes it so impressive is just the

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.589 
makes it so impressive is just the
technology<00:04:27.430> behind<00:04:27.849> it<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:28.240> fact<00:04:28.419> that<00:04:28.539> the

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599 
technology behind it the fact that the

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:31.050 
technology behind it the fact that the
control<00:04:28.930> scheme<00:04:29.169> works<00:04:29.470> so<00:04:29.740> so<00:04:30.010> well<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:30.880> fact

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
control scheme works so so well the fact

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.610 
control scheme works so so well the fact
that<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.240> graphics<00:04:31.810> are<00:04:32.020> just<00:04:32.050> as<00:04:32.320> impressive

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
that the graphics are just as impressive

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.499 
that the graphics are just as impressive
as<00:04:32.860> they<00:04:33.009> are<00:04:33.159> and<00:04:33.580> that<00:04:33.909> so<00:04:34.060> much<00:04:34.180> of<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.360> game

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:34.509 
as they are and that so much of the game

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:36.060 
as they are and that so much of the game
is<00:04:34.659> just<00:04:34.690> so<00:04:34.840> beautifully<00:04:35.380> crafted<00:04:35.680> around

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
is just so beautifully crafted around
