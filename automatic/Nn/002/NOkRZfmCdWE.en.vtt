00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.910
 do not get confused an eraser is a student's best friend 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.240
 and until they arrived the drafting and accounting computers depended on 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.760
 this simple contraption to make your work presentable 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.299
 but even if they look old fashioned 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.780
 if there is a pencil near 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.780
 your little rubber buddy will not walk very far 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.649
 news 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:29.660
 in 1736 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.890
 A French explorer observed that the South American natives used resin from 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.580
 the trees to make balls that voted 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.240
 He took the resin home and shortly after the Europeans discovered that he could 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.340
 erase pencil marks from there the term in eraser 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.730
 but there was a problem 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.630
 over time the rubber rotted 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.670
 that dilemma solved it a century later an old Suzuki court 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.900
 that developed a process to prevent the rubber from rotting 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.320
 To make a simple eraser to erase pink, you need enough 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.370
 ingredient 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.020
 putties carefully measures accelerators jury agents oils 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.829
 dyes 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.829
 and the main ingredient synthetic gum 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.630
 the first step is to joke a laminator 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.820
 the comapa sa repeatedly among some huge hot reds 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.610
 Defective tires from other lots are also recycled 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.760
 then sulfur is added as a curing agent 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.450
 Accelerators for the sulfur to do its job and a red dye 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.450
 Mix everything for 5 to 10 minutes until the mixture reaches the consistency of 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.450
 a mass kroes 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.140
 next comes the vulcanized vegetable oil 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.450
 the vegetable oil has been treated with sulfur and calcium carbonate 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:18.599
 When the color and thickness are adequate, the workers remove the rubber 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.639
 that at this point is hot implants due to the laminate 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:26.279
 it is allowed to cool and harden midday at room temperature 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:37.260
 when the pump is ready, large squares between 5 and 8 kilos are cut 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:40.639
 of weight depending on the thickness of rubber that the customer has requested 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:53.599
 the squares pass to a steam press to heal for 20 minutes at 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.619
 163 degrees Celsius 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:03:00.519
 the compact pressure the rubber while the intense heat the doubt 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:08.529
 the excess is cut 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:12.289
 and the squares of hot rubber are submerged in cold water to stop the 

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:15.289
 curing process 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.159
 to make bombs that run pencil and ink are cut frosted bis strips of two 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.159
 batches of rubber a rose and an adult 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.699
 the blue contains pumice 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:38.209
 which gives the rubber the extra point of abrasion to erase ink 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:50.449
 then passed the steam press 

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:58.949
 after twelve minutes 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:02.160
 the operators are the trays cut the leftovers 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.980
 and submerge in the strips in cold water to interrupt the curing process 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:18.269
 an automatic machine cuts the strips you start the size of the rubber 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.269
 delete 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.289
 we go back to the gums only roses 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:30.279
 the rubber squares leave the bathroom in cold water and go through a machine that 

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:32.529
 cut strips with beveled edges 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:35.529
 and then cut aspire erasers 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.080
 from there the gums fall into a giant container 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.250
 the workers sprinkle talcum powder to prevent sticking and put the drum 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.689
 spin for five hours 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:55.619
 the rubbers collide with each other and the abrasion rounds their edges 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.800
 the next step is printing 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.360
 a machine seals each comma with the name of the company and the number of 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.360
 model 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.380
 it is not the comma that gives it its ability to erase if not vegetable oil 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:24.360
 vulcanized 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.240
 that's why the rubber breaks loose when the fleet moss against the paper and takes 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.610
 the pencil marks 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.860
 I wish we could invent a comma to erase the mistakes we make in the 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.110
 lifetime
