so I would always hand wash my felt
there's<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.300> certain<00:00:39.690> school<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.350> thought<00:00:40.590> that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
there's a certain school of thought that

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.190 
there's a certain school of thought that
you<00:00:41.070> can<00:00:41.489> pop<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.360> gentle<00:00:42.750> cycle<00:00:42.960> and

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
you can pop it in a gentle cycle and

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.369 
you can pop it in a gentle cycle and
that<00:00:43.950> may<00:00:44.129> work<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.730> might<00:00:44.940> be<00:00:45.090> fine<00:00:45.329> but<00:00:46.200> for

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
that may work it might be fine but for

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.330 
that may work it might be fine but for
my<00:00:46.469> money<00:00:46.710> I'd<00:00:47.489> hand<00:00:48.090> wash<00:00:48.239> my<00:00:48.450> felt<00:00:49.129> it's<00:00:50.129> sort
