employ them in a groove for example
we'll<00:01:09.570> work<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> minor<00:01:10.350> thirds<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.189> I'll

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
we'll work on the minor thirds and I'll

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.300 
we'll work on the minor thirds and I'll
show<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.729> how<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.180> create<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.990> very<00:01:13.530> hip<00:01:14.010> little

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
show you how to create a very hip little

ideas

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.580 

we'll<00:01:25.880> take<00:01:26.060> a<00:01:26.119> closer<00:01:26.479> look<00:01:26.659> at<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.110> perfect

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
we'll take a closer look at the perfect

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.649 
we'll take a closer look at the perfect
fifth<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:28.100> see<00:01:28.490> what<00:01:28.700> happens<00:01:29.090> when<00:01:29.270> we<00:01:29.420> play

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
fifth and see what happens when we play

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:39.279 
fifth and see what happens when we play
it<00:01:29.780> all<00:01:29.990> across<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.710> neck<00:01:36.789> and<00:01:38.020> we'll<00:01:39.020> look<00:01:39.110> at

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
it all across the neck and we'll look at

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.590 
it all across the neck and we'll look at
smaller<00:01:39.679> intervals<00:01:40.280> like<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.789> minor<00:01:41.000> second

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
smaller intervals like the minor second

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:52.419 
smaller intervals like the minor second
to<00:01:42.140> craft<00:01:42.470> great<00:01:42.829> chromatic<00:01:43.399> lines<00:01:51.069> now<00:01:52.069> for<00:01:52.399> a

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
to craft great chromatic lines now for a

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.029 
to craft great chromatic lines now for a
real<00:01:52.789> mysterious<00:01:53.360> interval<00:01:54.110> we'll<00:01:54.470> work<00:01:54.709> on

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
real mysterious interval we'll work on

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:57.490 
real mysterious interval we'll work on
the<00:01:55.340> try<00:01:55.640> tones<00:01:55.970> also<00:01:56.330> known<00:01:56.720> as<00:01:56.959> the<00:01:57.259> flat

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
the try tones also known as the flat

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:06.669 
the try tones also known as the flat
fifths<00:02:04.539> there<00:02:05.539> are<00:02:05.599> some<00:02:05.810> intervals<00:02:06.229> that<00:02:06.619> you

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
fifths there are some intervals that you

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.830 
fifths there are some intervals that you
might<00:02:07.069> not<00:02:07.250> necessarily<00:02:07.490> think<00:02:08.330> of<00:02:08.539> right

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
might not necessarily think of right

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.620 
might not necessarily think of right
away<00:02:09.140> like<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.590> flat<00:02:09.860> six<00:02:10.190> but<00:02:10.970> I'll<00:02:11.150> show<00:02:11.569> you

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
away like the flat six but I'll show you

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:20.520
