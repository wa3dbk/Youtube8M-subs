00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.899
 the last eight exercises since 101 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:11.320
 until 108 we will work with a 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:14.170
 nib and with ink a nib 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.029
 simple does not need to be a pen 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.880
 quite complex but a pen like that 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.230
 of wood with its metallic tip with 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.750
 lama with the pen that have a 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:27.190
 special care and that is that when 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.680
 load with ink ink tends 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.469
 to climb up the stick in the part 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.109
 back of the pen and then tend to 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.909
 stain the fingers of people who 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:38.710
 they are writing then to avoid that 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:40.629
 you have to take the pen or very long 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.949
 very long pen or because they are the 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.079
 problem with finger spots and it 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.339
 can catch a little more cut is very 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.719
 interesting the exercise with the pen 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:48.280
 especially for people who have 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.129
 the very heavy hand those people who 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.170
 they write with a lot of force because if 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.789
 they do so with the pen they damage it to 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.879
 write very few words then 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.980
 those people are going to see let's say like 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.080
 forced 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.480
 soften a lot more your stroke to 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.040
 avoid damaging the pen so 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.510
 those people who have a very 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.820
 very very very heavy I advise you 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.050
 buy at least two pens 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.540
 have a second per mile at hand 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.090
 just in case it damages the first nib 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.620
 but you should make the effort to write 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.630
 much softer for people who 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.100
 it has a smooth writing as it leaves 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.700
 to adapt very well 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.500
 to the pen as 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.600
 as data to start writing with 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.119
 the nib usually the nibs 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.799
 you should burn a little at the tip 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.829
 to heal them or to harden them 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.500
 Poquitico more should not burn too much 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.960
 the tip of the pen is placed apc 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.850
 the candle or the stove of the stove for a 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.649
 very very very short time 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.630
 you can barely see that the tip gets very 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.280
 hot red is removed 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.530
 immediately and already with that is 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.750
 enough already once it's cold then 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.240
 you can start writing later 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.000
 let's load we 're going to load our 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.330
 nib and you have to take away the excess 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.819
 ink to avoid dripping on the 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.380
 paper the phrase that we're going to work on 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.289
 today in fiscal year 101 is 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.410
 michael jordan and says of the following 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.410
 way 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.100
 I have failed 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.100
 plus 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.790
 yes 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.190
 9 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.360
 more than 9000 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.129
 more than 1000 shots 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.660
 in me 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.190
 in my career 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.190
 eat 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.390
 the average that we are telling the 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.950
 ink we should go loading removing the 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.159
 excess to avoid dripping on the 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.159
 paper 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.190
 I lost 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.010
 I have lost 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.390
 near 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.330
 d 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.400
 of 300 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.400
 games 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.670
 about 300 v2 command 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:07.349
 we reload the pen the pen 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.349
 we remove excess ink 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:21.139
 26 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.139
 6 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.409
 26 times 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.240
 mine 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.430
 trusted 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.750
 trusted 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.750
 the launch 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.130
 the winning launch 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.220
 and it's failed 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.610
 and there 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.530
 point 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.530
 we load if necessary 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.330
 Y 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.540
 they failed 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.680
 one 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.490
 Y 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.080
 other 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:05.649
 has failed again and again 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:08.669
 in 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.040
 my life 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.960
 and so 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:29.800
 we load if necessary 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.190
 and so 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.840
 I succeed 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:52.150
 curly you have left us all 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.150
 full 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.870
 26 that has a tilde 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.729
 and finally we ended up with the name of 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.810
 maicon 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:19.649
 michael jordan 

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:22.469
 this exercise should not be written in 60 

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:25.199
 seconds but if it is to be drawn up in the 

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:28.110
 class in the classroom in the shortest time 

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:31.249
 possible in the best possible way 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.249
 here we were missing 

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.500
 is 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.640
 and this is exercise number 101
