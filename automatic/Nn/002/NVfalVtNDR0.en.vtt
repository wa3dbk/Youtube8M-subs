 That classic can go by subway. 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.169
 it classifies bc it repeats whenever 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.569
 day you go jataí used already in 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.220
 subway that always happens or to your 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:32.980
 side of an enemy always 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.490
 this happens and the question that is in the 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.340
 air for a long time mw guys returned 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.500
 You're back in the new competition. 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.270
 will return to competitive these 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.670
 questions if the crew has already done it? 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.550
 A long time and I have responded 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.800
 in chat obviously we already had 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.960
 comments but obviously not all 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.660
 world view all comments and 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.880
 comments that are there then but then there 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.989
 the guys do not know about my answers 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.820
 that I about it 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.160
 Come on, let's talk about this. 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.909
 competitive subject of seeing the son of 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.429
 4mw came back the first question came back mw 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.929
 is back the jackal retreat online 

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:14.350
 They're with the cool players now. 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:16.240
 playing new players and i hope 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.259
 that you can do a good job there 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.030
 I want peace that is already training 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.639
 enough and has been giving good results 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.960
 during practice then we'll see 

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:25.329
 even more so now that the 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.700
 game that now chooses to have and kicked pro 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:30.789
 competitive number 24 no longer 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.579
 focused on the chan domain and who knows now 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.229
 We have people who know what's new there. 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.770
 new clans stand out and things of the 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.670
 But it 's about him but you have to 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.090
 to know w 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.600
 This is my position in the fight for I am 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.630
 reservation reservation reservation reservation 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.719
 case of some very large branch and someone 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.039
 can not play and why is it good 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:56.740
 first I think they have full 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.549
 great there they will not need me 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.479
 now 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.709
 I do not have the time, unfortunately. 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.420
 to train what leads to responding to 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:06.310
 second question already rafael you go 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.190
 back by competitive and returned to the 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.050
 I did not come back and I 'll explain 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.380
 for you because as much as I want 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.890
 to play the galley is there is that thing 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.630
 My time is very complicated my 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.380
 the games are a bit complicated 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.750
 Ah, I usually sleep more or less there 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.060
 for one hour or an hour they 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.890
 midnight presence you have a 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.780
 idea only in the last times when everything 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.690
 a lot of work that counted a little 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.150
 without early sleep but normal type during 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.120
 the week is, I was going to sleep more or less there 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.930
 by midnight and half power almost one 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.820
 morning hour 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.280
 and this is more or less the time when 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.110
 The guys are training guys there and there. 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.760
 It happens, I do not have time to train. 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.770
 With the guys I do not have time for me 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.720
 dedicate in the game also details of staying 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.460
 playing a lot to get each 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.670
 mother of guns the mother of everything 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.630
 do not have the time available at the moment 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.870
 for this 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.250
 Unfortunately, she does not have the means to 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.400
 More that I wanted 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.440
 we are going to assume that what is not 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.510
 case and say that I play better than one 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.730
 of the cars was there in mine not 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.680
 good thing I take the place of the guy who is 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.170
 training every day with this tactic if 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.370
 everything I want to enter is not from there 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.000
 to ask why do I have to 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.010
 do 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.640
 understood not worth it is not good for 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.920
 The team is not good for me either, so the 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.990
 The best thing I do at the moment is 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.420
 focus on what I play who is mine 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.610
 college course that those who do not know the 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.890
 computer science and is being very 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.860
 well bringing a type is a course that I 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.930
 I like to do it, that's what I play 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.480
 the competitive why it is true 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.550
 I played competed in the field to do 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.740
 computer science in the bbb is true 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.500
 yes same because she ended up not having 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.140
 however expensive I have or of late 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.180
 night typically at home there by 10 and 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.950
 bit of the night also what is another case 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.520
 personally but it's still going to be her 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.430
 brings the 96 of the eyes always arrived at 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.560
 home after a 15 for the 11 out there 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.360
 There you have dinner and then dinner. 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.890
 It's already more or less what it's already midnight. 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:15.400
 little and then it's already eleven little actually 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.600
 up to 11 little advantage 11 15 and 20 already 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.489
 does not give much time to train and then 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.410
 it's over if I stay like this 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.110
 end up talking about my team so it 's better 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.169
 nor do that she does not even try 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.140
 so this is my answer is clear if 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.730
 unit needs 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.680
 How I said how I was let's say 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.710
 booking fifth in the reservation area 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.320
 fifth but I put it as I was in reserve 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:42.100
 much as possible you have there I spoke 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.110
 next case you need to dropped player 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.730
 gave a very big problem there and did not 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.980
 have people going to play do not train any 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:51.100
 thing is missing to complete the training I 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.480
 I help the team, but I'm not one of the 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.380
 two must obtain obligation to be 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.090
 playing and I'm not going to be the 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.040
 players who are looking for a place to 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.690
 to play in a championship then 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.700
 thing only that guy who really 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.470
 needs to be a big shit in the 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.080
 time for a training match 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.270
 ie whatever I'm the guy who will 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.120
 Come in to the case to complete for the galley. 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.640
 I just hope it completes but in 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.740
 that in the middle of despair I can 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.720
 help the crew anyway 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.450
 so this is my position at the moment 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.520
 how much competing for the movie is cool 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:28.060
 It's great, it's growing and so 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.430
 but even so it is only those things that 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.930
 there are priorities my routine when 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.210
 she played competitive she would come home 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.890
 but at ten at night 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.090
 trained for about an hour from the 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.720
 morning with the guys 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.520
 an hour and a half and went to sleep already type 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.550
 it was already a point so we could not 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.320
 then unfortunately it is no longer much to 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.360
 I can do it now because we've already 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.590
 I was kind of quiet because the 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.200
 administration a little easier a 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:56.140
 little was not much easier either 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.390
 because I had thought it was easy to do 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.490
 the work is quiet the tests 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.320
 also and now really everything that 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.990
 flirting studying to get away 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.750
 good note or take average that is going to 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:11.020
 so it's not really easy and I do not 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.930
 I can screw and that's why I do not 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.510
 I intend to go back already competed at the end of 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:18.340
 four and probably just the day I 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.919
 you have time to actually play more 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.850
 It's not something I have an idea of what 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:23.740
 I'll have time to play 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:26.110
 competitive of some other game of the 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.330
 banfield no cs or whatever the game 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.419
 can show up there because there are people 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.280
 asked if I would play competitive dcs 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:36.789
 I would love to play, but I can not. 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.620
 Unfortunately there is not what I can do. 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:41.140
 To take time for this. 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.710
 is it guys you liked when 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.390
 she is 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:47.130
 I got there and the screams and that's not it 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.130
 a hug too and spoke ah
