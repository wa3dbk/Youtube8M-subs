though<00:01:47.689> senegalese<00:01:48.689> twist<00:01:49.250> just<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.399> sorry

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
though senegalese twist just like sorry

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.219 
though senegalese twist just like sorry
I'm<00:01:51.000> looking<00:01:51.119> behind<00:01:51.329> me<00:01:51.659> behind<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.200> camera

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
I'm looking behind me behind the camera

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.569 
I'm looking behind me behind the camera
because<00:01:52.530> there's<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.799> mirror<00:01:53.009> right<00:01:53.100> there<00:01:53.310> so

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
because there's a mirror right there so

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.910 
because there's a mirror right there so
that<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.360> where<00:01:54.540> my<00:01:54.689> attention<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.590> even

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
that is where my attention is even

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.200 
that is where my attention is even
though<00:01:55.979> it's<00:01:56.070> easy<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.369> could<00:01:56.640> do<00:01:56.729> without<00:01:56.850> one

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
though it's easy I could do without one

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.359 
though it's easy I could do without one
without<00:01:58.140> America<00:01:58.680> because<00:01:58.950> it's<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.280> simple

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
without America because it's so simple

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.380 
without America because it's so simple
but<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.490> just<00:02:02.610> helps<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.939> have<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.090> mirror<00:02:03.329> so

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
but it just helps to have a mirror so

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.600 
but it just helps to have a mirror so
you're<00:02:03.540> just<00:02:03.600> going<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.810> braid<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.079> down<00:02:04.610> keep

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
you're just going to braid it down keep

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.679 
you're just going to braid it down keep
it<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.030> front<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.329> your<00:02:06.390> head<00:02:06.540> though

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
it to the front of your head though

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.969 
it to the front of your head though
don't<00:02:06.869> bring<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.140> backwards<00:02:07.560> or<00:02:07.680> anything

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.580 

just<00:02:10.979> keep<00:02:11.129> bringing<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.489> front<00:02:11.849> half

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.280 

and<00:02:15.590> make<00:02:16.220> sure<00:02:16.340> get<00:02:16.520> smooth<00:02:17.360> it<00:02:17.510> out<00:02:17.569> ends<00:02:17.989> too

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
and make sure get smooth it out ends too

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.050 
and make sure get smooth it out ends too
so<00:02:18.470> that<00:02:18.620> it<00:02:18.770> doesn't<00:02:19.040> get<00:02:19.160> tangled<00:02:19.310> tangled

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
so that it doesn't get tangled tangled

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.130 
so that it doesn't get tangled tangled
because<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.569> can<00:02:20.720> happen<00:02:20.900> very<00:02:21.290> easily<00:02:23.140> so

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
because that can happen very easily so

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.650 
because that can happen very easily so
you're<00:02:24.260> just<00:02:24.319> going<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.530> keep<00:02:24.680> braiding<00:02:25.660> and

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
you're just going to keep braiding and

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.170 
you're just going to keep braiding and
now<00:02:26.840> once<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.170> get<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.470> your<00:02:27.590> ear<00:02:31.090> once<00:02:32.090> you

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
now once you get to your ear once you

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.100 
now once you get to your ear once you
get<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.360> your<00:02:32.450> ear<00:02:32.630> you're<00:02:32.780> going<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:32.959> start

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
get to your ear you're going to start

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.130 
get to your ear you're going to start
braiding<00:02:33.530> it<00:02:33.819> to<00:02:34.819> the<00:02:34.940> back<00:02:35.120> so<00:02:35.780> this<00:02:35.900> part<00:02:36.110> is

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
braiding it to the back so this part is

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.330 
braiding it to the back so this part is
still<00:02:36.319> going<00:02:36.470> backwards<00:02:37.010> where<00:02:37.130> you<00:02:37.220> just

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
still going backwards where you just

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.660 
still going backwards where you just
start<00:02:37.489> braiding<00:02:37.760> it<00:02:38.030> always<00:02:38.959> in<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.410> back<00:02:41.140> and

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
start braiding it always in the back and

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.449 
start braiding it always in the back and
then<00:02:43.670> once<00:02:43.819> you<00:02:43.940> get<00:02:44.060> halfway<00:02:44.600> so<00:02:45.019> I'm<00:02:45.170> I'm

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
then once you get halfway so I'm I'm

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.570 
then once you get halfway so I'm I'm
about<00:02:46.459> right<00:02:46.640> here<00:02:47.080> I'm<00:02:48.080> halfway<00:02:48.530> now<00:02:49.519> I'm

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
about right here I'm halfway now I'm

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.400 
about right here I'm halfway now I'm
going<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:49.850> take<00:02:49.970> it<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.600> braid<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.140> rest<00:02:51.290> of

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
going to take it and braid the rest of

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.390 
going to take it and braid the rest of
it<00:02:51.500> down<00:02:53.380> this<00:02:54.380> part<00:02:54.590> is<00:02:54.709> really<00:02:54.739> simple<00:02:55.310> it's

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
it down this part is really simple it's

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.600 
it down this part is really simple it's
just<00:02:55.430> a<00:02:55.670> regular<00:02:56.090> almost<00:02:56.540> like<00:02:56.630> a<00:02:56.660> regular<00:02:56.870> um

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
just a regular almost like a regular um

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.110 
just a regular almost like a regular um
French<00:02:58.610> braid<00:02:59.620> the<00:03:00.620> first<00:03:00.860> part<00:03:01.069> is<00:03:01.220> super

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
French braid the first part is super

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.220 
French braid the first part is super
easy<00:03:02.150> as<00:03:02.480> long<00:03:02.600> as<00:03:02.660> you<00:03:02.720> know<00:03:02.840> how<00:03:02.930> to<00:03:02.989> braid

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
easy as long as you know how to braid

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.190 
easy as long as you know how to braid
then<00:03:03.500> it's<00:03:03.739> super<00:03:04.220> super<00:03:04.489> easy<00:03:04.790> so<00:03:05.660> just<00:03:06.019> braid

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
then it's super super easy so just braid

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.539 
then it's super super easy so just braid
the<00:03:06.290> rest<00:03:06.319> you<00:03:06.650> braid<00:03:06.860> the<00:03:07.010> hair<00:03:07.040> all<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.370> way

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
the rest you braid the hair all the way

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.729 
the rest you braid the hair all the way
down<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.510> very<00:03:08.630> bottom<00:03:08.780> just<00:03:09.350> like<00:03:09.530> this

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
down to the very bottom just like this

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.289 
down to the very bottom just like this
you're<00:03:10.519> going<00:03:10.640> to<00:03:10.700> take<00:03:10.819> one<00:03:10.940> of<00:03:10.970> your<00:03:11.150> small

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
you're going to take one of your small

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:18.310 
you're going to take one of your small
elastics<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:12.200> tie<00:03:12.950> that<00:03:13.130> off<00:03:16.870> so<00:03:17.870> this<00:03:18.079> is<00:03:18.200> how

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
elastics and tie that off so this is how

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.560 
elastics and tie that off so this is how
the<00:03:18.380> first<00:03:18.590> part<00:03:18.890> should<00:03:18.980> look<00:03:19.329> braid<00:03:20.329> it<00:03:20.480> all

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
the first part should look braid it all

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.569 
the first part should look braid it all
the<00:03:20.630> way<00:03:20.780> down<00:03:20.810> ties<00:03:21.440> like<00:03:21.470> that<00:03:21.859> and<00:03:22.130> just

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
the way down ties like that and just

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.449 
the way down ties like that and just
braid<00:03:22.820> it<00:03:22.850> halfway<00:03:23.750> in<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.170> back<00:03:24.350> and<00:03:24.950> now

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
braid it halfway in the back and now

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:26.620 
braid it halfway in the back and now
you're<00:03:25.519> going<00:03:25.700> to<00:03:25.760> do<00:03:25.820> the<00:03:25.940> same<00:03:26.239> exact<00:03:26.600> thing

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
you're going to do the same exact thing

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.210 
you're going to do the same exact thing
to<00:03:26.900> this<00:03:27.019> side<00:03:27.260> so<00:03:27.530> you<00:03:27.560> have<00:03:27.769> all<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.040> hair

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
to this side so you have all the hair

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.830 
to this side so you have all the hair
going<00:03:28.489> back<00:03:28.700> I'm<00:03:28.850> just<00:03:28.880> going<00:03:29.090> to<00:03:29.150> do<00:03:29.299> anything

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
going back I'm just going to do anything

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.800 
going back I'm just going to do anything
start<00:03:30.650> off<00:03:30.829> on<00:03:31.130> this<00:03:31.820> side<00:03:32.030> with<00:03:32.239> a<00:03:32.269> braid

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.360 

let's<00:03:35.810> again<00:03:36.079> start<00:03:36.380> braiding<00:03:36.769> a<00:03:37.070> simple

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
let's again start braiding a simple

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.800 
let's again start braiding a simple
braid<00:03:37.609> and<00:03:37.850> they're<00:03:38.299> just<00:03:38.480> going<00:03:38.570> to<00:03:38.630> keep

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
braid and they're just going to keep

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.069 
braid and they're just going to keep
adding<00:03:39.440> more<00:03:39.470> hair<00:03:39.920> from<00:03:40.420> that<00:03:41.420> side

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
adding more hair from that side

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.080 
adding more hair from that side
this<00:03:42.560> side<00:03:43.040> is<00:03:43.160> a<00:03:43.190> lot<00:03:43.340> easier<00:03:43.640> because<00:03:43.730> it's<00:03:43.970> a

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
this side is a lot easier because it's a

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.180 
this side is a lot easier because it's a
lot<00:03:44.269> less<00:03:44.470> there's<00:03:45.470> a<00:03:45.530> lot<00:03:45.650> less<00:03:45.799> braids<00:03:46.070> over

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
lot less there's a lot less braids over

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.880 
lot less there's a lot less braids over
here<00:03:46.430> so<00:03:46.670> it's<00:03:47.480> a<00:03:47.570> lot<00:03:47.870> easier<00:03:48.410> on<00:03:48.470> this<00:03:48.680> side

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
here so it's a lot easier on this side

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.370 
here so it's a lot easier on this side
and<00:03:49.660> then<00:03:50.660> you're<00:03:50.780> going<00:03:50.870> to<00:03:50.959> do<00:03:51.019> same<00:03:51.200> thing

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
and then you're going to do same thing

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.930 
and then you're going to do same thing
on<00:03:51.500> so<00:03:51.590> you<00:03:51.650> get<00:03:51.709> to<00:03:51.829> the<00:03:51.920> ear<00:03:52.100> you<00:03:52.700> start

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
on so you get to the ear you start

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:53.770 
on so you get to the ear you start
braiding<00:03:53.060> backwards

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
braiding backwards

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.750 
braiding backwards
I'm<00:03:54.350> going<00:03:54.470> to<00:03:54.530> braid<00:03:54.709> backwards<00:03:55.250> just<00:03:55.670> like

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
like this you can also buy the pin that

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:39.420 
like this you can also buy the pin that
in<00:05:32.530> to<00:05:37.410> this<00:05:38.410> part<00:05:38.620> takes<00:05:38.740> a<00:05:38.890> lot<00:05:39.130> of<00:05:39.160> bobby

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
in to this part takes a lot of bobby

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.970 
in to this part takes a lot of bobby
pins<00:05:39.550> because<00:05:40.150> the<00:05:40.300> breeze<00:05:40.480> are<00:05:40.720> I'm<00:05:41.410> somewhat

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:41.980 
pins because the breeze are I'm somewhat

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.250 
pins because the breeze are I'm somewhat
heavy<00:05:42.160> so<00:05:42.580> it<00:05:43.240> takes<00:05:43.419> a<00:05:43.510> lot<00:05:43.600> of<00:05:43.660> bobby<00:05:43.870> pins<00:05:43.960> to

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
heavy so it takes a lot of bobby pins to

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.700 
heavy so it takes a lot of bobby pins to
keep<00:05:44.410> it<00:05:44.560> in<00:05:45.960> but<00:05:46.960> just<00:05:47.140> keep<00:05:47.290> pinning<00:05:47.500> and

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
keep it in but just keep pinning and

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.050 
keep it in but just keep pinning and
eventually<00:05:48.160> you'll<00:05:48.280> realize<00:05:48.580> it's<00:05:48.820> staying

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
eventually you'll realize it's staying

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.900 
eventually you'll realize it's staying
up<00:05:49.180> on<00:05:49.270> its<00:05:49.450> own

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.910 

like<00:05:54.540> I<00:05:54.660> said<00:05:54.720> wherever<00:05:55.200> your<00:05:55.350> fingers<00:05:55.740> were

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920 
like I said wherever your fingers were

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.430 
like I said wherever your fingers were
at<00:05:56.100> holding<00:05:57.000> the<00:05:57.540> twist<00:05:57.780> in<00:05:57.930> place<00:05:58.140> and<00:05:58.350> that's

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
at holding the twist in place and that's

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.200 
at holding the twist in place and that's
where<00:05:58.590> you<00:05:58.680> should<00:05:59.220> put<00:05:59.400> bobby<00:05:59.580> pins<00:05:59.880> and<00:06:00.120> see

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
where you should put bobby pins and see

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.170 
where you should put bobby pins and see
now<00:06:00.360> it's<00:06:00.660> a<00:06:00.780> point<00:06:01.200> working<00:06:01.730> stand<00:06:02.730> by<00:06:02.880> itself

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:48.450 
this one is a little bit easier because

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.580 
this one is a little bit easier because
it<00:06:48.660> kind<00:06:48.780> of<00:06:48.810> has<00:06:48.930> like<00:06:48.960> a<00:06:49.080> structure<00:06:49.560> that

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.590 
it kind of has like a structure that

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.190 
it kind of has like a structure that
it's<00:06:49.830> laying<00:06:50.040> on<00:06:50.250> so<00:06:50.600> seems<00:06:51.600> a<00:06:51.720> little<00:06:51.960> bit

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200 
it's laying on so seems a little bit

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.920 
it's laying on so seems a little bit
easier<00:06:52.850> see<00:06:53.850> as<00:06:53.940> you<00:06:54.030> can<00:06:54.150> see<00:06:54.270> it's<00:06:54.420> staying
