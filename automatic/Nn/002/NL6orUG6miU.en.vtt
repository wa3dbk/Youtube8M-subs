00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
the Hyundai i20 is a very popular car in

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.700 
the Hyundai i20 is a very popular car in
South<00:00:14.040> Africa<00:00:14.429> in<00:00:14.610> fact<00:00:14.910> since<00:00:15.089> 2009<00:00:15.929> we've

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
South Africa in fact since 2009 we've

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.580 
South Africa in fact since 2009 we've
bought<00:00:16.949> over<00:00:17.130> 68<00:00:17.940> thousand<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.810> them<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.109> I've

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
bought over 68 thousand of them and I've

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.160 
bought over 68 thousand of them and I've
always<00:00:19.920> wondered<00:00:20.340> why<00:00:20.730> because<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.720> was<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> bit

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
always wondered why because it was a bit

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.759 
always wondered why because it was a bit
dull<00:00:22.830> but<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:24.000> new<00:00:24.240> one<00:00:24.269> isn't<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:25.289> think<00:00:25.650> it's

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
dull but this new one isn't I think it's

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.980 
dull but this new one isn't I think it's
the<00:00:25.890> best<00:00:26.130> design<00:00:26.760> from<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.150> company<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.810> a

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
the best design from the company in a

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.380 
the best design from the company in a
long<00:00:28.260> time<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.800> love<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.429> black<00:00:29.760> c-pillar

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
long time I love this black c-pillar

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.120 
long time I love this black c-pillar
think<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.869> makes<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.230> whole<00:00:31.380> car<00:00:31.650> look<00:00:31.859> very

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
think it makes the whole car look very

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.680 
think it makes the whole car look very
sharp<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.790> if<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.180> go<00:00:33.360> for<00:00:33.600> this

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
sharp and if you go for this

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.930 
sharp and if you go for this
top-of-the-range<00:00:34.440> fluid<00:00:35.100> model<00:00:35.280> then<00:00:35.790> you

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
top-of-the-range fluid model then you

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.209 
top-of-the-range fluid model then you
get<00:00:36.090> these<00:00:36.270> 16<00:00:36.840> inch<00:00:37.020> wheels<00:00:37.590> which<00:00:38.040> look

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
get these 16 inch wheels which look

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.549 
get these 16 inch wheels which look
really<00:00:38.250> good<00:00:38.700> too<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.239> think<00:00:39.780> my<00:00:40.110> mom<00:00:40.379> would

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
really good too I think my mom would

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:50.170 
really good too I think my mom would
describe<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.190> as<00:00:41.340> snazzy

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.360 

welcome<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.899> Hyundai<00:00:52.530> i20<00:00:53.539> 1.4<00:00:54.539> motion

welcome to the Hyundai i20 1.4 motion
automatic

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.360 

oh<00:00:59.930> it's<00:01:00.930> quite<00:01:01.080> nice<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.380> see<00:01:01.710> an<00:01:01.830> auto<00:01:02.040> in

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
oh it's quite nice to see an auto in

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.670 
oh it's quite nice to see an auto in
this<00:01:02.580> segment<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.210> usually<00:01:03.690> cost<00:01:04.260> quite<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.559> bit

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
this segment it usually cost quite a bit

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.370 
this segment it usually cost quite a bit
more<00:01:05.160> but<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.550> the<00:01:05.640> case<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.210> i-20<00:01:06.390> it's

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
more but in the case of the i-20 it's

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.500 
more but in the case of the i-20 it's
only<00:01:07.530> ten<00:01:07.860> thousand<00:01:08.340> round<00:01:08.550> more<00:01:08.850> at<00:01:09.300> the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
only ten thousand round more at the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.700 
only ten thousand round more at the
manual<00:01:09.930> version<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:11.340> automatic<00:01:12.120> is

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
manual version and this automatic is

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.090 
manual version and this automatic is
very<00:01:13.710> average<00:01:15.320> you<00:01:16.320> see<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> thing<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.890> it

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
very average you see the thing is it

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.730 
very average you see the thing is it
only<00:01:17.250> has<00:01:17.550> four<00:01:17.790> gears<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.900> gearbox<00:01:19.350> is

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
only has four gears so the gearbox is

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.430 
only has four gears so the gearbox is
not<00:01:19.920> able<00:01:20.190> to<00:01:20.370> keep<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.000> engine<00:01:21.450> at<00:01:21.810> optimal

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
not able to keep the engine at optimal

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.790 
not able to keep the engine at optimal
ribs<00:01:22.680> at<00:01:22.950> all<00:01:23.250> times<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.300> I<00:01:25.020> think<00:01:25.410> I<00:01:25.530> just

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
ribs at all times and I think I just

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.740 
ribs at all times and I think I just
have<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.130> manual<00:01:26.520> save<00:01:26.820> ten<00:01:27.090> thousand<00:01:27.540> read

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
have the manual save ten thousand read

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.590 
have the manual save ten thousand read
and<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.620> think<00:01:28.650> you'd<00:01:29.460> probably<00:01:29.700> save<00:01:30.150> petrol

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
and I think you'd probably save petrol

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:38.780 
and I think you'd probably save petrol
too<00:01:36.140> now<00:01:37.140> I've<00:01:37.380> chosen<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.950> compare<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.550> car

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
too now I've chosen to compare this car

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.990 
too now I've chosen to compare this car
to<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> false<00:01:39.360> bargain<00:01:39.810> Polo<00:01:40.400> automatic<00:01:41.400> 1.2

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
bluetooth but the one thing that I think

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.860 
bluetooth but the one thing that I think
is<00:02:52.220> missing<00:02:52.370> you<00:02:53.090> can't<00:02:53.330> have<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.540> touchscreen

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
is missing you can't have a touchscreen

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.230 
is missing you can't have a touchscreen
whereas<00:02:54.740> you<00:02:54.890> can<00:02:55.130> in<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.370> core<00:02:55.610> serve<00:02:55.880> as<00:02:56.030> an

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
whereas you can in the core serve as an

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.810 
whereas you can in the core serve as an
option<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:56.990> it<00:02:57.140> is<00:02:57.320> standard<00:02:57.860> in<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.460> polo

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
option and it is standard in the polo

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.210 
option and it is standard in the polo
but<00:02:59.420> one<00:02:59.630> thing<00:02:59.870> and<00:03:00.350> I<00:03:00.440> really<00:03:00.470> have<00:03:01.010> got

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
but one thing and I really have got

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.570 
but one thing and I really have got
write<00:03:01.460> these<00:03:02.030> front<00:03:02.480> seats<00:03:02.840> are<00:03:03.050> so<00:03:03.290> wide<00:03:04.100> and

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
write these front seats are so wide and

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.670 
write these front seats are so wide and
comfortable<00:03:05.120> it's<00:03:05.750> like<00:03:05.990> they're<00:03:06.230> borrowing

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
comfortable it's like they're borrowing

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.820 
comfortable it's like they're borrowing
them<00:03:07.070> from<00:03:07.400> a<00:03:07.490> bigger<00:03:07.700> car

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.190 

but<00:03:11.580> I<00:03:11.610> suppose<00:03:11.880> numbers<00:03:12.660> don't<00:03:12.870> tell<00:03:13.020> the

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
but I suppose numbers don't tell the

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.040 
but I suppose numbers don't tell the
whole<00:03:13.380> story<00:03:13.710> and<00:03:14.130> this<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.490> xx<00:03:14.970> feels<00:03:15.780> good<00:03:15.990> on

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
whole story and this I xx feels good on

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.170 
whole story and this I xx feels good on
the<00:03:16.170> road<00:03:16.440> very<00:03:16.860> comfortable<00:03:17.520> good<00:03:17.940> ride

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
the road very comfortable good ride

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.360 
the road very comfortable good ride
quality<00:03:18.210> like<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.930> much<00:03:19.170> bigger<00:03:19.380> car<00:03:19.770> actually

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
quality like a much bigger car actually

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.760 
quality like a much bigger car actually
and<00:03:20.610> when<00:03:21.210> it<00:03:21.300> comes<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.720> looks<00:03:21.990> I<00:03:22.230> think

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
and when it comes to looks I think

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.340 
and when it comes to looks I think
they've<00:03:22.920> done<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:23.160> great<00:03:23.640> job<00:03:23.670> with<00:03:24.180> us<00:03:24.240> I<00:03:24.540> xx<00:03:25.080> I

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
they've done a great job with us I xx I

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.900 
they've done a great job with us I xx I
think<00:03:25.740> it's<00:03:25.830> one<00:03:25.980> of<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.190> best<00:03:26.370> looking<00:03:26.550> cars

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
think it's one of the best looking cars

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:35.770 
think it's one of the best looking cars
in<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.150> segment

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.840 

so<00:03:36.470> at<00:03:36.620> about<00:03:36.860> two<00:03:37.070> hundred<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:37.490> twenty-two

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
so at about two hundred and twenty-two

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.910 
so at about two hundred and twenty-two
thousand<00:03:38.510> for<00:03:38.660> this<00:03:38.780> auto<00:03:38.990> and<00:03:39.350> about<00:03:39.560> two

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
thousand for this auto and about two

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.010 
thousand for this auto and about two
hundred<00:03:39.950> twelve<00:03:40.460> thousand<00:03:41.000> for<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.630> manual

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
hundred twelve thousand for the manual

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.280 
hundred twelve thousand for the manual
the<00:03:42.380> i-20<00:03:43.280> is<00:03:43.490> quite<00:03:44.150> an<00:03:44.270> attractive<00:03:44.630> package

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
the i-20 is quite an attractive package

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.220 
the i-20 is quite an attractive package
especially<00:03:45.620> from<00:03:46.550> the<00:03:46.700> outside<00:03:47.390> and<00:03:47.840> if<00:03:48.110> you

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
especially from the outside and if you

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.470 
especially from the outside and if you
really<00:03:48.410> must<00:03:48.680> have<00:03:48.920> an<00:03:49.040> auto<00:03:49.220> it's<00:03:49.940> not<00:03:50.210> bad

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
really must have an auto it's not bad

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.870 
really must have an auto it's not bad
it'll<00:03:50.960> get<00:03:51.200> you<00:03:51.350> through<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.650> traffic

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
it'll get you through the traffic

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.000 
it'll get you through the traffic
comfortably<00:03:52.880> but<00:03:53.840> I<00:03:54.230> really<00:03:54.560> think<00:03:54.770> it<00:03:54.860> could

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
comfortably but I really think it could

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.449 
comfortably but I really think it could
have<00:03:55.130> been<00:03:55.300> spectator<00:03:56.380> in<00:03:57.380> terms<00:03:57.770> of<00:03:58.010> safety

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
have been spectator in terms of safety

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.090 
have been spectator in terms of safety
so<00:03:58.940> if<00:03:59.150> you<00:03:59.420> are<00:03:59.600> looking<00:03:59.959> to<00:04:00.350> spend<00:04:00.560> about<00:04:00.770> two

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
so if you are looking to spend about two

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.860 
so if you are looking to spend about two
hundred<00:04:01.250> twenty<00:04:01.850> thousand<00:04:02.360> on<00:04:02.450> a<00:04:02.510> small

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
hundred twenty thousand on a small

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.870 
hundred twenty thousand on a small
hatchback<00:04:03.080> I'd<00:04:03.830> also<00:04:04.040> go<00:04:04.190> have<00:04:04.490> a<00:04:04.520> look<00:04:04.760> at

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
hatchback I'd also go have a look at

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.440 
hatchback I'd also go have a look at
that<00:04:05.060> Corsa<00:04:05.600> and<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:06.500> Polo<00:04:07.030> just<00:04:08.030> seems<00:04:08.270> like

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
that Corsa and the Polo just seems like

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.150 
that Corsa and the Polo just seems like
a<00:04:08.780> little<00:04:08.959> bit<00:04:09.170> too<00:04:09.200> much<00:04:09.530> really

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:27.870 

you

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.940 

you
