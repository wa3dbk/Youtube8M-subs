have no religious affiliation and then

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.560 
have no religious affiliation and then
percentage<00:01:52.409> jumps<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.920> 30%<00:01:53.820> for<00:01:54.030> people<00:01:54.329> under

the<00:01:54.720> age<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:55.049> 30<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.649> these<00:01:56.189> numbers<00:01:56.610> never

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
the age of 30 and these numbers never

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.149 
the age of 30 and these numbers never
seem<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.390> go<00:01:57.659> down<00:01:57.689> they<00:01:58.200> always<00:01:58.710> seem<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.950> be

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
seem to go down they always seem to be

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.550 
seem to go down they always seem to be
increasing<00:01:59.759> so<00:01:59.909> that's<00:02:00.600> good<00:02:00.930> right

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
you now I'm not saying we should

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
because he or she is an atheist but

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.550 
because he or she is an atheist but
you'd<00:02:50.730> hope<00:02:51.000> that<00:02:51.269> if<00:02:51.389> they<00:02:51.540> say<00:02:51.900> openly<00:02:52.439> that

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
you'd hope that if they say openly that

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.649 
you'd hope that if they say openly that
they<00:02:52.769> are<00:02:53.040> atheist<00:02:53.549> it's<00:02:54.000> really<00:02:54.329> just<00:02:54.480> a

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
they are atheist it's really just a

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.750 
they are atheist it's really just a
symbol<00:02:55.139> and<00:02:55.349> it's<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.739> sign<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:56.069> they<00:02:56.549> know

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
symbol and it's a sign that they know

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.520 
symbol and it's a sign that they know
how<00:02:56.939> to<00:02:56.970> think<00:02:57.090> critically<00:02:57.599> and<00:02:58.079> ask<00:02:58.319> tough

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
how to think critically and ask tough

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.159
