 you had added and everything 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.920
 in the place of parties support the saying 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.560
 that the fucking montage has nine thousand lies 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.450
 and you see that they are collateral singles and 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.720
 the writing is finished or another click happens 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.240
 suddenly and I wait for you this now not 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.550

 inclusion one million 400 thousand visits of 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.010
 one million 400 thousand go cloth were times 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.300
 as I say france what was for 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.410
 This is how it's fun and right now 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.850
 broke two mounts and people immediately 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.840
 The only thing he does is speak my side 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.460
 these standards of I do not know what you like 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.900
 the video you enjoy watching the video is 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.900
 the important thing look collateral you 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.330

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.330
 pretty style is and 6 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.650

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.739
 great 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:27.140
 Naomi likes when we say and people do not 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.140
 I was thinking about washington plus 20 or not 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.989
 not too much when the world changes 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.180
 and the truth is that they are musicians of that 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.680
 Awesome 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.099
 look at the past 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.390
 Frank also good then there will be people 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.920
 on my channel that you already know that all the 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.930
 people who follow me because they are sniper the 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.670
 most love all this topic and 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.530
 Well, there will be people saying that 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.409
 frozen commenting with these when this 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.159
 Uncle is competitive because I say now 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:01.909
 I no longer believe that he makes commented example 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.909
 ladies of these 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.120
 but what I say is that I mean that 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.889
 you can aces have three assemblies in 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.569
 hardware cinema or you have also gone 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.909
 the sniper for a long time and that 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.189
 people a lot of people do not know it thinks 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:16.169
 that I always come the usual good 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:17.459
 You know, you 're the typical smartass 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:20.280
 he wins that he knows with the sniper 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.989
 what is better from the black ops 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.540
 using sniper look the typical 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.669
 smartass that go fuck videos ups 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.919
 mounts like mine and well I have 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.930
 that laugh your face because when the kid 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:32.819
 I did not know I say Youtube because I already 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.090
 I was doing rides that with you is like that 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.580
 I know it's very good times those seem 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.370
 what was yesterday that to see 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:44.230
 look at this shoot kleim olp a clip and 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.230
 here the line grams 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.580
 is what I say uncle that is that 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.590
 now if you raise this right now inflate to 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.880
 disney 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.070
 the typical ones of this I do not know how many in 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.800
 it really gives me a little pity that 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.570
 continue like this you know why if I already pulled out 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.210
 clip to two and if it's not complicated when 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.500
 the uses also I am also of those of 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.680
 all the people that there are right now in 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.489
 youtube but it would be nice if you did 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.280
 something like that in nobody or a chassis stowage 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.780
 so I enjoyed doing what he does 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.000
 that is they like those clips and upload them 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.380
 and people enjoy watching it because what 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.130
 see that you do not like it so do not look at it 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.710
 you know 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:38.800
 see yourself putting air supports you're 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:42.599
 giving a pass that I think is the 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.599
 that closes with that montage 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:48.280
 blackout fix is ​​blackout everything 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.900
 has gotten white with in code 4 all 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.599
 the assemblies that we have seen and look 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.810
 what things went up when the 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:57.849
 game is what is it is what 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.169
 that was cool what was now going with a 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:01.720
 image now of background well while 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.819
 we talk or what will be put something 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.220
 modern warfare2 community is not what 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:08.800
 he knows not his whore mother but he is using 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.419
 the favorite of this is my montage 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.699
 favorite of more truthfully not simply 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.770
 by the fact that the clips in that 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:17.830
 then not for besides what 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.659
 I was carrying it outside or it was a pass but 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.460
 by the fact that the assembly that to me 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:23.680
 he marked me saying everyone with 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.150
 fucking catcher as you've seen 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.550
 that I had back then 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.220
 we had all going to fall then and 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.050
 you already have assemblies so the rock flipped and 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.320
 good good in this montage had a boom 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.610
 you flip and I saw it and I say water 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.580
 this montage is cool I can do what 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.110
 same and there good already made mounts in 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.970
 this time and he has recorded to do 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.210
 montages and such but let's say that was the 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:48.370
 that inspired me how to say no then the 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.199
 true that incredible 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.479
 just before I looked a bit for dates 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:53.800
 the optique is that everyone knows 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:55.889
 that was the first modern warfare 2 that 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.509
 it went up and it went up 7 days later 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:00.669
 and still has much better writes this 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:03.370
 and that of optics and nothing then until 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:07.620
 here with blackmails with these episode 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.620
 number 4 something to say 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.849
 I suppose that people will think that 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.919
 I do not know how weird not one talking like that 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:19.800
 with you that in this community 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:22.169
 is very seen saying they were saying 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.199
 I am one of those who urge their speaking 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:27.449
 with phrases or magician is not like very 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:30.060
 seen that one who does there sniper then 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:31.530
 I spoke with a cone that makes comments 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.449
 you can tell right now and the truth 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.900
 is that I've known you for three 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:37.590
 years and so it's something between 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.379
 friends 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.479
 we are friends friends among all 

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:44.219
 sorry and then nothing, I hope that you 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:48.349
 you enjoyed the same thing that we did 

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:48.349
 until the next until then bye
