00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.710
 we are here as part of a 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.060
 communication policy that fits 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.780
 in the European program called 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.860
 life and that aims to teach children 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.620
 how to produce less waste 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.899
 sometimes change to change or 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.070
 by changing consumption patterns 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.019
 but also to sort the waste 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.410
 housewares actually sort the waste 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:46.000
 household 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.890
 it's something that is not innate 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.420
 who learns that would undermine how 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.909
 learns to read as one learns to write 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.010
 and politics have set up aims 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.989
 to bring down production 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.769
 waste and especially to sort everything 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.239
 who can be 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.580
 the life program is the commission 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.949
 European Union in fact holding back 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.019
 projects considered interesting in 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.070
 environmental issues and the 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.200
 community of haute provence has had the 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.180
 luck I say good luck to be the 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.460
 only local territorial authority 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.659
 sorry the only collectivity because he 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.220
 there is a department it is essonne but 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.220
 we are the only ones retained in France 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:47.030
 for you to discover, we will wait for 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:51.400
 noble you are fine for the garden and the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.870
 glass and violent husbands 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:58.760
 I have a first question to you 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:04.520
 ask very little rats that sort his 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:06.410
 waste because this is not already planned at the 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.940
 home parents who more is that 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:13.340
 you shout waste of the question 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.400
 that's what you withheld from that 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.400
 little film that was removed the medal 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.209
 habit to this content it results from 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.209
 light weight 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.720
 the meaning of my you 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.070
 travel 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.070
 Yes Miss 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.340
 we have very well that's very very 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.820
 impressive of tiny items 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.130
 municipal employees the new chip 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.070
 had curry they are and then came the 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.140
 communal way says we will do you the 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.000
 hand gameiro take all their drunk 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.900
 beautiful forever our tarn cards 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.720
 obviously and then who loses this bib 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:05.390
 10 trips in less exciting young 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:14.840
 crushed man 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:16.340
 from 1992 strauss it impose on 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.470
 municipalities and municipalities or to 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.260
 place two selective collections this is at 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.230
 say we go again 1992 as as 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:29.209
 began to pray the tears do 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:31.459
 that you have delivered to France from each 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:36.800
 of us each person produces 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:49.430
 as waste per day average 100 days 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:51.640
 this is a little bit the case at esa care 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.640
 two 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:10.980
 the plane to gain space but 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.280
 this is a package and we are going 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:21.950
 make sure to 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:32.440
 it seems that the product is here TV 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:32.440
 ars launched yesterday 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:03.540
 but the challenge the main issue is I 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.620
 believe that's not everyone starts to 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.970
 understand it today it's 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.660
 actually protecting our 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.570
 environment 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.760
 sustainable development protection of 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.710
 our planet 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.480
 stop destroying our resources 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.530
 that's still primordial it's the 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.030
 first things become 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.550
 things that comes to my mind it's 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.410
 sort actually we saw it sorting 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:26.010
 its waste why simply 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.890
 for the cost of sorting the collection 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.200
 garbage and garbage 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.700
 be reduced too, and that's 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.470
 still very interesting especially in 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.240
 our portfolios on arrival whatever 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.250
 share in all the families 1 jeans 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.600
 francois is what has a ricochet effect 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.580
 in this type of intervention is what we 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.810
 also hope that arrived at home he 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.580
 go tell mum dad he's flying a little bit 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.470
 listen to them I think it's 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.520
 actually a big sports that 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:52.110
 based on our interventions 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.290
 we actually realized that 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:57.210
 the kids are very very good vector 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.160
 in fact communication maybe 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.360
 better than us when they go 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.850
 arrive at home effectively and 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.760
 especially with tools like the past 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.890
 especially the bags to sort for 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.420
 Sort their waste we are we know 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.030
 aptly that there is going to be an impact 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.410
 at the family level, saying it must 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.540
 sort the garbage because that's 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.730
 important and I believe it's one of 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.960
 better ways today of 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.360
 communication the kids are so 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.249
 receptive and so voluntary and 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.529
 to raise awareness of these problems 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:28.779
 that in my opinion we will have the results 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:31.769
 very quickly ben we talked about 

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:35.679
 waste they to laval in the room and after 

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:37.680
 and before recycling and pre-placing it 

00:06:35.679 --> 00:06:42.060
 naval ground so that 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:45.389
 i disintegrates that it is necessary that it is necessary 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:48.030
 well recycled bah if you do not recycle 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:51.570
 it's a gesture for the planet 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.740
 that we learned how to sort waste for 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:57.180
 not pollute the planet 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:07:00.330
 that's important yes that recycling 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:04.289
 it is absolutely necessary to do for not 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:06.539
 that our for that so that we stay 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:09.360
 living for not that the earth be 

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:12.210
 polluted it explains how sort the 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.650
 waste for example the cartons you 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.169
 the loved ones in the yellow trash the 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:22.440
 bottles under but a trash 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:25.199
 green and after the papers I am but 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:28.620
 the blue bin ben because that's it 

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:29.099
 for life and school so for us for 

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.020
 learn 

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:32.759
 there will be a president to others 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.660
 initiatives in the field of waste 

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:35.759
 about the community 

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.050
 so of course yes there is everything 

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:38.490
 first a dump that will be 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.800
 intercommunale which is set up 

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:43.620
 thanks to the live project and then especially a 

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.810
 collection device that changes the 

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.909
 current habits that aims to limit 

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:50.010
 the frequency of the tours for everything 

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:52.260
 simply produced in less than CO2 and 

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.310
 then encourage sorting by 

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.849
 devices that are put to the 

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.849
 available to the public 

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.680
 black gold 

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.070
 the
