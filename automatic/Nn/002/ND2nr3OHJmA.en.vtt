it<00:02:04.299> and<00:02:04.569> as<00:02:05.139> you<00:02:05.169> add<00:02:05.469> colors<00:02:05.889> and<00:02:06.099> dyes<00:02:06.249> to<00:02:06.279> it

want
this<00:02:15.460> piece<00:02:15.730> here<00:02:16.030> I'm<00:02:16.480> assuming<00:02:16.690> is<00:02:17.140> howlite

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
this piece here I'm assuming is howlite

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.430 
this piece here I'm assuming is howlite
and<00:02:17.800> they've<00:02:18.010> died<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.580> blue<00:02:19.570> and<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:20.230> looks

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
and they've died that blue and it looks

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.490 
and they've died that blue and it looks
like<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.590> he<00:02:20.800> she<00:02:20.860> cut<00:02:21.220> turquoise<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:23.320> those

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
like a he she cut turquoise and those

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.930 
like a he she cut turquoise and those
are<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.710> things<00:02:23.860> one<00:02:24.130> must<00:02:24.370> look<00:02:24.490> out<00:02:24.670> for

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
are the things one must look out for

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.660 
are the things one must look out for
again<00:02:25.630> it<00:02:25.960> boils<00:02:26.380> down<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.860> asking<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.370> lot<00:02:27.550> of

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
again it boils down to asking a lot of

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.090 
again it boils down to asking a lot of
questions<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.300> lot<00:02:28.600> of<00:02:28.810> people<00:02:28.900> will<00:02:29.290> ask<00:02:29.470> well

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
questions a lot of people will ask well

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.490 
questions a lot of people will ask well
