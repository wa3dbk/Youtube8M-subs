00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
what what their mechanics of drawing are

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.349 
what what their mechanics of drawing are
as<00:00:25.199> well<00:00:25.710> as<00:00:25.890> sort<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.189> what's<00:00:26.580> what<00:00:27.090> are<00:00:27.119> some

as well as sort of what's what are some
of<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.510> ideas<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.960> what<00:00:28.470> makes<00:00:29.340> something<00:00:29.609> art

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
of the ideas of what makes something art

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.889 
of the ideas of what makes something art
there's<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.170> much<00:00:31.260> exploration<00:00:31.650> going<00:00:32.070> on

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
there's so much exploration going on

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.740 
there's so much exploration going on
focusing<00:00:33.899> very<00:00:33.960> little<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:35.070> technique<00:00:35.750> it

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
focusing very little on technique it

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.740 
focusing very little on technique it
will<00:00:36.930> really<00:00:37.140> help<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:38.300> expand<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.510> keep<00:00:39.629> it

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
will really help to expand and keep it

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.160 
will really help to expand and keep it
age-appropriate

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.270 

there's<00:00:43.170> often<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.530> mistake<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:44.100> telling

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
there's often a mistake of telling

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.400 
there's often a mistake of telling
people<00:00:44.460> what<00:00:44.789> color<00:00:45.030> things<00:00:45.690> need<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.050> be<00:00:46.200> you

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
people what color things need to be you

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.139 
people what color things need to be you
know<00:00:46.500> make<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.829> grass<00:00:47.039> green<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.640> that's

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
know make the grass green and that's

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.240 
know make the grass green and that's
really<00:00:48.809> something<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.860> want<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.039> avoid

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
really something you want to avoid

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.240 
really something you want to avoid
because<00:00:50.989> as<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.140> said<00:00:52.199> exploration<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.039> key

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
because as I said exploration is key

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.139 
because as I said exploration is key
exploring<00:00:54.030> what<00:00:54.270> what<00:00:54.629> if<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:56.000> throwing<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
exploring what what if and throwing the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.660 
exploring what what if and throwing the
world<00:00:57.420> open<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.469> lot<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.710> possibilities<00:00:59.370> can

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
world open to a lot of possibilities can

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.610 
world open to a lot of possibilities can
really<00:00:59.910> help<00:01:00.000> your<00:01:00.180> child<00:01:00.480> see<00:01:00.809> art<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.469> way

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
really help your child see art in a way

really help your child see art in a way
that<00:01:02.030> they<00:01:03.030> can<00:01:03.180> continue<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.780> enjoy<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.260> for

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
that they can continue to enjoy it for

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.060 
that they can continue to enjoy it for
as<00:01:04.619> long<00:01:04.650> as<00:01:04.920> possible<00:01:06.260> but<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.740> basic

as long as possible but on the basic

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.700 
as long as possible but on the basic
level<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.340> may<00:01:09.000> need<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.330> help<00:01:09.479> children<00:01:10.350> hold

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
level you may need to help children hold

material they're going to be using they

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.580 
material they're going to be using they
might<00:01:15.630> need<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> little<00:01:16.110> bit<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.259> instruction

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
might need a little bit of instruction

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.980 
might need a little bit of instruction
about<00:01:16.979> how<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.250> balance<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.880> on<00:01:18.030> their<00:01:18.360> ring

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
about how to balance it on their ring

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.640 
about how to balance it on their ring
finger<00:01:19.439> how<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.130> hold<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.630> with<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
finger how to hold it and and with the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.340 
finger how to hold it and and with the
point<00:01:23.130> pointing<00:01:23.640> towards<00:01:23.970> their<00:01:24.240> shoulder<00:01:24.750> so

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
point pointing towards their shoulder so

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.830 
point pointing towards their shoulder so
you<00:01:25.409> can<00:01:25.830> give<00:01:25.979> them<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.189> little<00:01:26.280> bit<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.520> basic

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
you can give them a little bit of basic

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.630 
you can give them a little bit of basic
technique<00:01:27.840> about<00:01:27.990> how<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.320> hold<00:01:28.619> things<00:01:28.950> but

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
technique about how to hold things but

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.550 
technique about how to hold things but
also<00:01:29.820> at<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.090> same<00:01:30.329> time<00:01:30.409> letting<00:01:31.409> them

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
also at the same time letting them

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.670 
also at the same time letting them
explore<00:01:32.329> how<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.479> feels<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:34.020> draw<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
explore how it feels to draw on the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.999 
explore how it feels to draw on the
paper<00:01:35.750> they<00:01:36.750> can<00:01:36.810> also<00:01:37.020> do<00:01:37.259> some<00:01:37.470> tracing

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
paper they can also do some tracing

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.219 
paper they can also do some tracing
that's<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.150> good<00:01:39.299> way<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.450> them<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.840> build<00:01:40.020> fine

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
that's a good way for them to build fine

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.050 
that's a good way for them to build fine
motor<00:01:40.439> skills<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.310> couldn't<00:01:41.610> let<00:01:41.970> them

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
motor skills you couldn't let them

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.660 
motor skills you couldn't let them
explore<00:01:42.450> tracing<00:01:43.049> different<00:01:43.710> objects<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
explore tracing different objects on the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.359 
explore tracing different objects on the
paper<00:01:44.909> tracing<00:01:45.540> their<00:01:45.689> hand<00:01:46.009> this<00:01:47.009> can<00:01:47.250> give

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
paper tracing their hand this can give

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.450 
paper tracing their hand this can give
them<00:01:47.549> some<00:01:47.790> practice<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.689> using<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.470> using

how it feels to draw something they

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.120 
how it feels to draw something they
could<00:01:57.840> trace<00:01:58.079> their<00:01:58.290> hand<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.590> then<00:01:58.710> color<00:01:58.950> it

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
could trace their hand and then color it

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.190 
could trace their hand and then color it
in<00:02:00.290> do<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> lot<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:02.030> color<00:02:03.030> use<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.689> lot<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.990> color
