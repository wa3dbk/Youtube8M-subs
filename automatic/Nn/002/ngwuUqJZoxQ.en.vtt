so<00:00:01.949> stay<00:00:02.190> here<00:00:02.399> on<00:00:02.610> YouTube<00:00:03.000> and<00:00:03.210> you<00:00:03.929> just

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
so stay here on YouTube and you just

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.050 
so stay here on YouTube and you just
came<00:00:04.290> across<00:00:04.440> one<00:00:04.859> of<00:00:04.950> I<00:00:05.100> hearts<00:00:05.460> new<00:00:05.670> videos

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
came across one of I hearts new videos

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.919 
came across one of I hearts new videos
and<00:00:06.330> hexaflexagons<00:00:07.849> my<00:00:08.849> heart<00:00:09.120> was<00:00:09.300> going<00:00:09.599> way

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
and hexaflexagons my heart was going way

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.839 
and hexaflexagons my heart was going way
too<00:00:09.990> fast<00:00:10.559> but<00:00:10.889> you<00:00:10.950> really<00:00:11.219> want<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.490> make<00:00:11.610> a

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
too fast but you really want to make a

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.230 
too fast but you really want to make a
try<00:00:12.150> hexaflexagon<00:00:13.139> so<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.370> video<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:15.000> going

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
try hexaflexagon so this video is going

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.750 
try hexaflexagon so this video is going
to<00:00:15.360> walk<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.900> through<00:00:16.170> how<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.650> make<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.310> try

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
to walk you through how to make a try

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.200 
to walk you through how to make a try
exit<00:00:18.330> flexagon<00:00:18.750> using<00:00:19.230> one<00:00:19.410> strip<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.859> paper

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
exit flexagon using one strip of paper

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.670 
exit flexagon using one strip of paper
so<00:00:21.210> what<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.510> will<00:00:21.600> need<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.080> long<00:00:22.320> strip<00:00:22.560> of

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
so what you will need is a long strip of

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.960 
so what you will need is a long strip of
paper<00:00:23.180> preferably<00:00:24.180> one<00:00:24.689> inch<00:00:24.960> thick<00:00:25.400> to<00:00:26.400> begin

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
paper preferably one inch thick to begin

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.740 
paper preferably one inch thick to begin
take<00:00:27.269> one<00:00:27.510> end<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.580> fold<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
take one end and fold it so that the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.620 
take one end and fold it so that the
corner<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.380> one<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.740> your<00:00:31.859> triangles<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.790> going

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
corner of one of your triangles is going

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.959 
corner of one of your triangles is going
to<00:00:33.809> be<00:00:33.960> bisected<00:00:34.800> by<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.100> edge<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.700> paper

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
to be bisected by the edge of that paper

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.569 
to be bisected by the edge of that paper
just<00:00:36.360> like<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.219> once<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.370> have<00:00:38.550> that

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
just like that and once you have that

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.790 
just like that and once you have that
you<00:00:38.940> can<00:00:39.120> fold<00:00:39.329> these<00:00:39.570> equilateral<00:00:40.290> triangles

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
you can fold these equilateral triangles

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.700 
you can fold these equilateral triangles
on<00:00:41.040> your<00:00:41.670> strip<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.000> paper<00:00:42.180> until<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.320> are

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
on your strip of paper until you are

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.010 
on your strip of paper until you are
finished<00:00:44.309> throughout<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.059> entire<00:00:45.360> strip<00:00:45.780> and

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
finished throughout the entire strip and

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.110 
finished throughout the entire strip and
make<00:00:46.710> sure<00:00:46.860> when<00:00:47.100> you're<00:00:47.250> doing<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.730> you're

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
make sure when you're doing this you're

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.910 
make sure when you're doing this you're
folding<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.870> paper<00:00:48.899> back<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.500> forth

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
folding the paper back and forth

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.290 
folding the paper back and forth
basically<00:00:50.340> fanning<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.090> back<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.449> forth<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
basically fanning it back and forth and

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.850 
basically fanning it back and forth and
if<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.510> were<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.899> do<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.620> do<00:00:55.829> not

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
if you were to do it so that you do not

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.279 
if you were to do it so that you do not
fan<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.520> back<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.850> forth<00:00:57.090> then<00:00:57.899> your

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
fan it back and forth then your

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.590 
fan it back and forth then your
triangles<00:00:59.100> will<00:00:59.280> not<00:00:59.460> be<00:00:59.670> consistent<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.329> make

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
triangles will not be consistent so make

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.270 
triangles will not be consistent so make
sure<00:01:00.629> you're<00:01:00.989> kind<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.350> doing<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.890> like<00:01:02.129> as

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
sure you're kind of doing this like as

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.119 
sure you're kind of doing this like as
if<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.640> are<00:01:02.760> folding<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.180> fan's<00:01:03.860> now<00:01:04.860> it's

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
if you are folding a fan's now it's

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.130 
if you are folding a fan's now it's
important<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.850> count<00:01:06.180> how<00:01:06.360> many<00:01:06.420> equilateral

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
important to count how many equilateral

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.580 
important to count how many equilateral
triangles<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:07.830> here<00:01:08.670> I'm<00:01:08.909> numbering

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
triangles you have here I'm numbering

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.560 
triangles you have here I'm numbering
nine<00:01:10.590> equilateral<00:01:11.310> triangles<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.330> is

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
nine equilateral triangles and that is

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.090 
nine equilateral triangles and that is
the<00:01:12.720> least<00:01:12.869> amount<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.320> triangles<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.860> need

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
the least amount of triangles you need

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.660 
the least amount of triangles you need
to<00:01:14.280> make<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.640> tri<00:01:15.000> hexaflexagon<00:01:15.840> if<00:01:16.670> you're

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
to make a tri hexaflexagon if you're

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.960 
to make a tri hexaflexagon if you're
using<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.270> glue<00:01:18.600> stick<00:01:19.130> it<00:01:20.130> might<00:01:20.400> be<00:01:20.520> better<00:01:20.700> to

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
using a glue stick it might be better to

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.910 
using a glue stick it might be better to
have<00:01:21.000> eleven<00:01:21.659> equilateral<00:01:22.290> triangles<00:01:22.740> to

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
have eleven equilateral triangles to

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.460 
have eleven equilateral triangles to
make<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.220> hexaflexagon<00:01:24.180> look<00:01:24.390> nicer<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.290> that

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
make the hexaflexagon look nicer so that

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.320 
make the hexaflexagon look nicer so that
is<00:01:25.619> how<00:01:25.890> many<00:01:26.100> triangles<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.700> will<00:01:26.880> be<00:01:26.970> using

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
is how many triangles I will be using

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:43.710 
is how many triangles I will be using
for<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.630> strip<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.960> paper

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.720 

after<00:01:44.720> you<00:01:44.990> have<00:01:45.320> finished<00:01:45.530> folding<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.340> tri

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:46.730 
after you have finished folding the tri

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.420 
after you have finished folding the tri
hexaflexagon<00:01:47.570> you<00:01:48.140> can<00:01:48.380> practice<00:01:48.860> flexing<00:01:49.310> it

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
hexaflexagon you can practice flexing it

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.700 
hexaflexagon you can practice flexing it
by<00:01:49.700> pinching<00:01:50.150> the<00:01:50.270> edges<00:01:50.300> um<00:01:51.400> but<00:01:52.400> in<00:01:52.640> order<00:01:52.910> to

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
by pinching the edges um but in order to

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.140 
by pinching the edges um but in order to
make<00:01:54.710> sure<00:01:54.740> everything<00:01:55.400> works<00:01:55.610> well<00:01:55.790> make
