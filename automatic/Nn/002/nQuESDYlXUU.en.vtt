00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:02.090
 work on 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.340
 worthy of passive systems 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.060
 security is ongoing 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.520
 but never ours 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.220
 the group was invited to the scheduled tests in 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.809
 safety laboratories 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:13.819
 AvtoVAZ we could not refuse 

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:16.369
 a blow to European standards should 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.550
 has been subject to prior salary 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.230
 wagon and I repeat 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.970
 planned vehicle tests 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.660
 conducted in accordance with 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.730
 schedule and above all these works 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.949
 being conducted for quality control 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.149
 machine assembly 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:32.469
 Test 5 is not an expensive main task 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.079
 check in the complex almost everything 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.440
 car systems this ikar is welded 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.870
 and no collected 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.090
 Are the seats installed correctly and 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.330
 dashboard 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.880
 certainly not least 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.080
 verifies and restraint systems 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.380
 i.e. seat belts 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.280
 security 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.690
 Naturally similar tests are conducted 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.580
 in the presence in the car dummies 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.610
 if the sensors themselves allow to measure 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.960
 of all strength 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.650
 men on mannequin 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.650
 and the body itself in a collision 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.140
 frankly however 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.840
 to make it happen with the car 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.360
 but the passengers in the lab than in 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.320
 real life 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.979
 the most important thing is that the plant does not spare money 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.860
 conducting these tests 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.560
 constantly improving 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.300
 car design 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.120
 filling york but died more 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.070
 advanced systems 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.560
 Well, now let's see what happened to 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.760
 machine test 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.200
 better entrance on Independence 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.690
 laboratory specialist 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.690
 I would like to draw your attention 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.180
 hit the whole 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.900
 now that we have 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.300

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.300
 Salon information 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.650
 during the strike we did not open 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.410
 after hitting we opened 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.350
 Sergey Mikhalkov including engines 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.930
 days of baku 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.930
 I would like to hear each other 6 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:13.419
 let's see what's going on inside 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:14.379
 salon 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.249
 Russia we have interior elements 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:18.219
 stayed in its proper place 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:19.749
 besides devices 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:21.399
 the seats 

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:22.769
 wheel 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.079
 the list is marked 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.209
 new mannequins 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.669
 driver airbag 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.469
 note that the imprint r 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:32.729
 is under pillow control 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:35.179
 security 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:36.969
 surprised positive moment 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:40.259
 for us without rant 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:43.529
 we donâ€™t have them jammed 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:44.799
 bodywork and so on 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.079
 If you look from Astana and the passenger is 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.789
 also see that 

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:52.119
 imprint ooo white mannequin pillow 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:53.449
 passenger safety too 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:54.949
 put on the shelf 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:57.629
 the rear seats are in place 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.469
 head restraints in place 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:00.739
 which does not create additional 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.739
 traumatic 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.769
 satisfactory 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.569
 the whole system evkurov worked in normal 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.379
 mode 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:13.319
 as you can see 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.079
 quality improvement work is not 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.930
 only build control hit 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.279
 accessories 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:20.639
 not only thorough 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.619
 checking the car after leaving 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:25.409
 conveyor in terms of continuous analysis 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.089
 work ability systems even in so 

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:30.689
 difficult situation how to calculate 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:32.319
 the main thing is that the largest 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.409
 car assembly enterprises of Russia 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.229
 which no doubt AvtoVAZ 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:38.269
 constantly improving 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.059
 own products and from this 

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:42.009
 in the end win 

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.789
 consumer
