00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
files to mu master / nest directory so

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.349 
files to mu master / nest directory so
let's<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.660> say<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:01.140> want<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.320> go<00:01:01.410> PSX<00:01:02.359> again

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
let's just say you want to go PSX again

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.390 
let's just say you want to go PSX again
there's<00:01:03.600> nothing<00:01:03.840> there<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.350> want<00:01:04.500> PSX<00:01:04.979> you

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
there's nothing there you want PSX you

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.190 
there's nothing there you want PSX you
have<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.700> put<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.030> files<00:01:06.270> into<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.689> PSX

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
have to put the files into the PSX

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.990 
have to put the files into the PSX
directory<00:01:09.500> images<00:01:10.549> obviously<00:01:11.549> I'm<00:01:11.670> guessing

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
directory images obviously I'm guessing

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.590 
directory images obviously I'm guessing
that's<00:01:12.119> straight<00:01:12.600> from<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.990> game<00:01:14.600> another

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
that's straight from the game another

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.630 
that's straight from the game another
view<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.020> games<00:01:16.880> about<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.439> it's<00:01:19.640> point

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
view of the games about it it's point

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.420 
view of the games about it it's point
zero<00:01:21.119> point<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.140> version<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.220> still

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
zero point to the version so it's still

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.200 
zero point to the version so it's still
very<00:01:23.670> very<00:01:23.850> very<00:01:24.420> early<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:25.909> if<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.030> want<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
very very very early on if you want to

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.780 
very very very early on if you want to
support<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.630> app<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.960> can<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.229> donate<00:01:28.790> um

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
support the app you can just donate um

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.370 
support the app you can just donate um
so<00:01:30.659> yeah<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.140> think<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:31.950> probably<00:01:33.170> not<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.200> I

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
so yeah I think it's probably not that I

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.690 
so yeah I think it's probably not that I
really<00:01:34.530> can<00:01:34.920> say<00:01:35.100> much<00:01:35.280> because<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.520> haven't

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
really can say much because I haven't

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.760 
really can say much because I haven't
done<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.060> lot<00:01:36.299> but<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.110> do<00:01:37.170> think<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.590> probably

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
done a lot but I do think is probably

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.100 
done a lot but I do think is probably
one<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.159> better<00:01:38.310> emulators<00:01:39.030> mainly<00:01:39.900> based

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
one of the better emulators mainly based

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.530 
one of the better emulators mainly based
on<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.590> fact<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.970> it<00:01:41.970> does<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> nice

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
on the fact that it does have a nice

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.539 
on the fact that it does have a nice
looking<00:01:42.810> interface<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.530> also<00:01:44.040> supports

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
looking interface and also supports

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.080 
looking interface and also supports
multiple<00:01:45.360> platforms<00:01:45.689> for<00:01:46.439> emulating<00:01:47.090> so

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
multiple platforms for emulating so

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.710 
multiple platforms for emulating so
that's<00:01:48.270> my<00:01:48.420> review<00:01:48.570> or<00:01:49.729> mu<00:01:50.729> master<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:51.360> the
