and<00:01:52.159> what's<00:01:53.159> neat<00:01:53.340> about<00:01:53.369> using<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.390> if

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
and what's neat about using this is if

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.010 
and what's neat about using this is if
you<00:01:55.290> listen<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.770> file<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.579> iTunes<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.570> then

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
you listen to a file in iTunes and then

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.230 
you listen to a file in iTunes and then
sync<00:01:58.409> your<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:59.430> know<00:01:59.520> your<00:01:59.729> iPod<00:02:00.090> or<00:02:00.119> your

sync your you know your iPod or your

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.870 
sync your you know your iPod or your
iPhone<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.810> your<00:02:00.840> computer<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.549> to<00:02:02.549> iTunes

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
iPhone to your computer and to iTunes

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.609 
iPhone to your computer and to iTunes
then<00:02:03.450> when<00:02:03.719> you're<00:02:03.840> actually<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.439> go

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
then when you're actually on the go

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.969 
then when you're actually on the go
it'll<00:02:05.219> move<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.119> pointer<00:02:06.479> within<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
it'll move the pointer within the

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.740 
it'll move the pointer within the
recording<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.670> spot<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.360> finished

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
recording to that spot that you finished

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.300 
recording to that spot that you finished
when<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.140> listen<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.679> on<00:02:10.770> your<00:02:10.830> computer

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
when you listen to it on your computer

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.980 
when you listen to it on your computer
so<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.849> can<00:02:12.000> be<00:02:12.060> really<00:02:12.239> handy<00:02:12.390> if<00:02:12.629> you
