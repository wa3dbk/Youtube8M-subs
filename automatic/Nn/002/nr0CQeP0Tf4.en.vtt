00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.699 
corazon why did he kill his own brother
but<00:04:11.519> honestly<00:04:12.030> I<00:04:12.329> could<00:04:13.109> be<00:04:13.259> completely<00:04:13.409> wrong

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
but honestly I could be completely wrong

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.220 
but honestly I could be completely wrong
on<00:04:14.009> this<00:04:14.159> but<00:04:14.219> I<00:04:14.430> believe

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
on this but I believe

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.770 
on this but I believe
it<00:04:15.530> was<00:04:15.709> pretty<00:04:15.950> much<00:04:16.130> a<00:04:16.190> setup<00:04:16.790> basically<00:04:17.750> I

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
it was pretty much a setup basically I

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.199 
it was pretty much a setup basically I
set<00:04:18.169> up<00:04:18.350> so<00:04:18.799> that<00:04:18.829> the<00:04:19.040> flamingo<00:04:19.579> can<00:04:19.760> take<00:04:19.970> all

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
set up so that the flamingo can take all

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.409 
set up so that the flamingo can take all
the<00:04:20.359> power<00:04:20.570> because<00:04:20.690> you<00:04:21.139> can<00:04:21.320> definitely<00:04:21.620> see

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
the power because you can definitely see

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.909 
the power because you can definitely see
even<00:04:23.419> with<00:04:23.630> me<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:23.930> whole<00:04:24.080> team<00:04:24.680> made

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
even with me the whole team made

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.439 
even with me the whole team made
bullshit<00:04:25.490> I<00:04:26.000> believe<00:04:26.750> that<00:04:26.990> he<00:04:27.820> he<00:04:28.820> just<00:04:28.850> looks

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
bullshit I believe that he he just looks

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.290 
bullshit I believe that he he just looks
like<00:04:29.540> a<00:04:29.690> fucking<00:04:30.139> maniac<00:04:30.610> he<00:04:31.610> just<00:04:31.850> looks<00:04:32.180> like

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
like a fucking maniac he just looks like

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.420 
like a fucking maniac he just looks like
a<00:04:32.449> person<00:04:33.020> who<00:04:33.169> wants<00:04:33.470> all<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:33.919> power<00:04:34.160> who

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
care all the power maybe it was

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.810

something<00:05:37.820> like<00:05:38.000> that<00:05:38.289> and<00:05:39.289> also<00:05:39.530> how<00:05:40.370> deep<00:05:40.610> is

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
something like that and also how deep is

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.730 
something like that and also how deep is
the<00:05:40.970> connection<00:05:41.330> with<00:05:41.780> corazon<00:05:42.320> and<00:05:43.220> law

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
the connection with corazon and law

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.830 
the connection with corazon and law
because<00:05:45.740> he<00:05:46.610> sees<00:05:46.849> that<00:05:46.970> they<00:05:47.120> delegate<00:05:47.810> a

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
because he sees that they delegate a

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.050 
because he sees that they delegate a
deep<00:05:48.110> connection<00:05:48.530> because<00:05:49.250> law<00:05:49.610> wants<00:05:50.030> to

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
deep connection because law wants to

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.900 
deep connection because law wants to
take<00:05:50.389> out<00:05:50.680> the<00:05:51.680> Flamingo<00:05:52.130> because<00:05:52.550> of<00:05:52.729> that
