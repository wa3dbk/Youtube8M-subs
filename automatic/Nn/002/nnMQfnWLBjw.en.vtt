00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.640
 iphone 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:47.320

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.320

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.560
 hilter 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.370
 how hectic that we are again 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.290
 But luckily you have the breath of one 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.870
 chance 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:17.270

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:20.260
 I understand my girlfriend is the one 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.260
 currency to seem 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.650

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:39.040

 a colleague does not work for me 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.320
 so 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.070
 but comes from 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.960
 Sometimes the artists do not decide 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.700
 and that's the way to decimate everyone 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.239
 you know the oster and tony christie 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:15.709
 fit together like what do I know 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:18.440
 our tip please only four opponents me 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.880
 I know what they all have, me 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:28.130
 I would be completely torn apart 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:29.450
 so this is okay i will go in 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.470
 future about michael's tricks 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.400
 a little change yes with it a bit 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.360
 get fun and I think the 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.650
 opponents but also slowly the snout 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.590
 full of lost so we'll change that soon 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.400
 online now really excited about me 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.400
 want another five seconds 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.540
 it's not fair 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.480
 which is pretty cool now 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.030
 a bit first explained is explained 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:03.790
 I want to have this one 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.790
 the sweet I want to get him I cool 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:17.989
 but it was not the one it should have 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.140
 but somehow behind and snipers things 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.140
 his 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.940
 okay what I come pretty close 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.920
 I'll go out 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.610
 that's too far, it's mine 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:47.170
 pushing mails scratch backwards 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.170
 so I'm already 40 that 's good 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.130
 OK 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:00.560
 then he has a fighter but 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:04.580
 why am I just dying like that? 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:12.830
 this can survive is one 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:15.830
 Mighty okay so it's a lot 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:19.480
 just pay attention he does not come like that 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.480
 first blow will clear everything 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.300
 they are really all in the house in it 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.380
 45 1 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.400
 the bit boring 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.750
 conclusion by normal 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:09.169
 no m50 1 finally a cool one again 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.680
 Choir 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:16.860
 with reasonably good mail but that's me 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.479
 nice as you are but forgive me that 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:23.729
 I should be better in the future 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:27.419
 bring in if you like it 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:28.830
 with a thumb up and thank you for 900 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.229
 subscribers meanwhile that's it 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.849
 a handsome number at 1000 will 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.340
 I open a lobby make his name 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:37.860
 could not gamble anymore when and how 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.419
 that will be depends on how fast 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.990
 reach many thousands so lay down 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:44.330
 to the witness 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.330
