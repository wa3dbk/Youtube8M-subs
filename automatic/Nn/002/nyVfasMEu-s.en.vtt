00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.600
 Hello guys

 I'm here today to teach you 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.980
 make a slash is usually placed 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.890
 call the original plan Saturday then I will 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.929
 give some tips on this here you 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.800
 mark at the time you want your 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.020
 bar go you measure the size of the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.180
 bar and you go up what in the case is the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.260
 bar has a two-way size 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.879
 they are climbing two centimeters up 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:50.879
 lulinha placed here two cm 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:01:06.260
 This is not where I'm going to put mine. 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:01:10.430
 bar folds the fabric is where I go 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:17.729
 put the stitching on my bar 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:22.140
 original is the neighborhood is placed on top 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.930
 And then I'm going to retire and go with the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.159
 Our milk I come to all this extent 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.159
 I leave it all 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.159
 same size same size 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.469
 Then I do a sewing volume on the machine. 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.560
 huh 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:41.259
 in case here are just a few tips, I'll go 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:48.819
 in the machine I do not 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:56.560
 sells with the bar the pants bar 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:02:01.179
 I'm going to learn so I put it with the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:11.519
 machine is sewing around not 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:17.650
 liked it and back until you get the end here 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:20.079
 After I liked it, that's where I cut. 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.019
 if you want you can cut a 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.790
 Piece to not get too big here 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.640
 the fabric 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.069
 but if the customer wants it not to cut 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.370
 so you just put it inside like that 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.380
 leaves uncut 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.000
 so it leaves without cutting but if you 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:43.630
 want to cut the other leg is already 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:47.620
 ready for you I cut and passed 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.660
 shame this bar is ready and 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.970
 if you want to rock then you 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:58.630
 passes after passing the largest with 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:03:01.290
 to serve the harmony between the Flemish 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.900
 everything right the edit everything there you come 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:09.760
 pleats a line of fabric color 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:14.530
 then you go 13 points high up like this 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.269
 3rd agent with the bar seam of the 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.639
 beach is well patent had yes 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:25.209
 appears the seam which is only ready 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:30.430
 answer up with the rope of the pants 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:33.030
 not to appear not the person does not understand 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:38.550
 Then you passed that seam 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:40.530
 and 13 point to fifth out there you come and 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.750
 passes a culture that to ensure 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.310
 that piece of bar left over if 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.209
 can pass a posture that is going on 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:52.140
 so in the four corners that side and in the 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.870
 O front so money that's only bar 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:00.660
 is ready equal to this 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:04.500
 It does not look like it was made 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:08.510
 bar on the original bar here is good and just 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.510
 This for now even more
