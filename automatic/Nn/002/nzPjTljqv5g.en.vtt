00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
it's going to feel a little bit awkward

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.660 
it's going to feel a little bit awkward
on<00:01:49.350> your<00:01:49.470> head<00:01:49.590> at<00:01:49.710> first<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.369> they're<00:01:50.520> made

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
on your head at first but they're made

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.190 
on your head at first but they're made
pretty<00:01:50.880> much<00:01:51.060> entirely<00:01:51.360> out<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.630> plastic<00:01:52.079> so

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
pretty much entirely out of plastic so

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.719 
pretty much entirely out of plastic so
it's<00:01:52.320> going<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.560> be<00:01:52.619> lightweight<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.250> also

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
it's going to be lightweight and also

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.069 
it's going to be lightweight and also
there's<00:01:53.880> no<00:01:54.000> wire<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:54.630> definitely<00:01:54.930> going

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
there's no wire so it's definitely going

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.319 
there's no wire so it's definitely going
to<00:01:55.140> be<00:01:55.229> comfortable<00:01:55.590> after<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> few<00:01:56.159> uses<00:01:56.399> and

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
to be comfortable after a few uses and

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.760 
to be comfortable after a few uses and
it<00:01:57.420> also<00:01:57.540> has<00:01:57.659> little<00:01:58.110> foam<00:01:58.290> padding<00:01:58.649> down

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
right out of the box and it was starting

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.819 
right out of the box and it was starting
to<00:02:06.570> come<00:02:06.719> off<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.110> not<00:02:07.259> like<00:02:07.409> it's<00:02:07.590> glued

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.199 
to come off and it's not like it's glued
down<00:02:08.039> or<00:02:08.220> anything<00:02:08.520> it's<00:02:08.670> just<00:02:08.729> kind<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.090> this

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
down or anything it's just kind of this

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.910 
down or anything it's just kind of this
little<00:02:09.420> hole<00:02:09.690> right<00:02:09.720> here<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.590> isn't<00:02:10.860> even

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
little hole right here this isn't even

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.380 
little hole right here this isn't even
that<00:02:11.039> great<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.520> flap<00:02:11.819> so<00:02:12.000> it's<00:02:12.120> kind<00:02:12.330> of

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
that great of a flap so it's kind of

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.740 
that great of a flap so it's kind of
just

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
just

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.020 
just
they're<00:02:13.230> so<00:02:13.470> if<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.250> have<00:02:14.400> them<00:02:14.580> on<00:02:14.730> your<00:02:14.790> head

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.980 
they're so if you have them on your head
they're<00:02:15.300> probably<00:02:15.450> not<00:02:15.630> going<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.810> fall<00:02:15.960> off

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
they're probably not going to fall off

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.240 
they're probably not going to fall off

but maybe if you're tossing around in

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.370 
but maybe if you're tossing around in
your<00:02:17.280> backpack<00:02:17.520> it<00:02:18.300> might<00:02:18.510> be<00:02:18.630> expect<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.260> put

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
your backpack it might be expect to put

audio<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:41.490> overall<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:41.970> think<00:02:42.150> it's<00:02:42.390> just<00:02:42.540> a

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600

pretty<00:02:42.780> good<00:02:42.959> product<00:02:43.380> aside<00:02:43.590> from<00:02:43.709> a<00:02:43.860> few

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
pretty good product aside from a few

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.500 
pretty good product aside from a few
mishaps<00:02:44.250> here<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:44.730> there<00:02:44.850> I<00:02:45.030> definitely

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
mishaps here and there I definitely

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.490 
mishaps here and there I definitely
think<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.840> should<00:02:45.900> go<00:02:46.080> out<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.290> check<00:02:46.380> these

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
think you should go out and check these

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.530 
think you should go out and check these
out<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:46.709> once<00:02:47.040> again<00:02:47.190> these<00:02:47.760> are<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.209> pulse

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
out so once again these are the pulse
