00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:12.879 
I made to show my students all the

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.490 
I made to show my students all the
different<00:00:13.269> techniques<00:00:13.780> or<00:00:14.019> side<00:00:14.289> the

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500 
different techniques or side the

different techniques or side the
techniques<00:00:14.980> that<00:00:15.190> you<00:00:15.309> can<00:00:15.339> use<00:00:15.580> for<00:00:16.680> writing

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
techniques that you can use for writing

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.570 
techniques that you can use for writing
in<00:00:17.980> icing<00:00:19.020> I'm<00:00:20.020> Ron<00:00:20.349> plaques<00:00:20.710> which<00:00:21.130> is<00:00:21.310> a<00:00:21.340> good

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
in icing I'm Ron plaques which is a good

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.670 
in icing I'm Ron plaques which is a good
idea<00:00:22.029> to<00:00:22.330> do<00:00:22.450> your<00:00:22.630> writing<00:00:22.840> on<00:00:23.170> planks<00:00:23.529> if

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
idea to do your writing on planks if

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.349 
idea to do your writing on planks if
you're<00:00:23.830> not<00:00:23.920> too<00:00:24.160> happy<00:00:24.340> about<00:00:24.519> doing<00:00:24.789> it<00:00:25.269> and

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:25.359 
you're not too happy about doing it and

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.029 
you're not too happy about doing it and
then<00:00:25.480> you<00:00:25.570> put<00:00:25.779> the<00:00:25.900> plaque<00:00:26.140> on<00:00:26.380> the<00:00:26.439> cake

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
then you put the plaque on the cake

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.419 
then you put the plaque on the cake
rather<00:00:27.369> than<00:00:27.550> typing<00:00:28.449> straight<00:00:28.840> on<00:00:29.050> the<00:00:29.199> cake

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
rather than typing straight on the cake

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.110 
rather than typing straight on the cake
up<00:00:30.429> at<00:00:30.490> the<00:00:30.760> top<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:32.529> technique<00:00:33.129> they're

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
up at the top this technique they're

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.960 
up at the top this technique they're
here<00:00:35.080> in<00:00:35.290> these<00:00:35.470> two<00:00:35.769> letters<00:00:36.220> and<00:00:36.430> all<00:00:36.790> the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
here in these two letters and all the

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.660 
here in these two letters and all the
numbers<00:00:37.300> at<00:00:37.420> the<00:00:37.449> bottom<00:00:37.570> are<00:00:38.199> done<00:00:38.920> in<00:00:39.190> what's

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
numbers at the bottom are done in what's

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.979 
numbers at the bottom are done in what's
called<00:00:39.969> a<00:00:40.300> run-out<00:00:41.129> technique<00:00:42.129> or<00:00:42.550> in<00:00:43.120> the<00:00:43.450> USA

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
called a run-out technique or in the USA

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.490 
called a run-out technique or in the USA
it's<00:00:44.350> called<00:00:44.770> color<00:00:45.129> flow<00:00:45.460> which<00:00:46.500> describes

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
it's called color flow which describes

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.069 
it's called color flow which describes
it<00:00:47.680> very<00:00:47.890> well<00:00:48.160> because<00:00:48.430> what<00:00:48.820> you<00:00:49.000> do<00:00:49.210> is<00:00:49.450> you

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
it very well because what you do is you

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.709 
it very well because what you do is you
put<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:52.149> draw<00:00:52.480> around<00:00:52.570> a<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:55.030> outline<00:00:55.420> of

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
put the you draw around a the outline of

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.930 
put the you draw around a the outline of
a<00:00:55.870> letter<00:00:56.110> say<00:00:56.469> and<00:00:56.770> then<00:00:57.219> you<00:00:57.370> put<00:00:57.550> a<00:00:57.610> piece<00:00:57.910> of

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
a letter say and then you put a piece of

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.560 
a letter say and then you put a piece of
paper<00:00:58.300> on<00:00:58.660> top<00:00:58.989> that's<00:00:59.710> nonstick<00:01:00.460> you<00:01:01.300> then

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
paper on top that's nonstick you then

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.290 
paper on top that's nonstick you then
outline<00:01:02.289> the<00:01:02.649> line<00:01:03.190> you<00:01:03.430> can<00:01:03.699> see<00:01:03.910> through<00:01:04.239> the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
outline the line you can see through the

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.020 
outline the line you can see through the
paper<00:01:04.629> and<00:01:05.050> you<00:01:05.470> flood<00:01:05.860> is<00:01:06.070> in<00:01:06.310> so<00:01:06.580> that's<00:01:06.789> why

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
paper and you flood is in so that's why

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.440 
paper and you flood is in so that's why
in<00:01:07.330> the<00:01:07.840> USA<00:01:08.259> its<00:01:08.440> core<00:01:08.710> color<00:01:09.070> flow<00:01:09.399> you<00:01:10.119> can

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
in the USA its core color flow you can

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.690 
in the USA its core color flow you can
cover<00:01:10.869> up<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.200> icing<00:01:11.649> to<00:01:11.770> plug<00:01:12.009> it<00:01:12.160> in<00:01:12.340> or<00:01:12.550> if

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
cover up the icing to plug it in or if

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.600 
cover up the icing to plug it in or if
you<00:01:12.729> like<00:01:13.060> as<00:01:13.450> I've<00:01:13.899> done<00:01:14.170> there<00:01:14.470> are<00:01:14.679> painted

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
you like as I've done there are painted

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
you like as I've done there are painted
over<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.300> letters<00:01:16.690> once<00:01:16.959> they<00:01:17.229> were<00:01:17.289> dried<00:01:18.630> so

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
over the letters once they were dried so

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.650 
over the letters once they were dried so
as<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:19.959> same<00:01:20.200> this<00:01:20.950> these<00:01:21.729> are<00:01:22.119> done<00:01:22.330> in<00:01:22.509> that

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
as the same this these are done in that

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.930 
as the same this these are done in that
method<00:01:22.840> this<00:01:23.500> is<00:01:23.679> called<00:01:23.979> a<00:01:24.099> monogram<00:01:24.729> it's

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
method this is called a monogram it's

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.410 
method this is called a monogram it's
the<00:01:25.090> same<00:01:25.360> method<00:01:25.869> which<00:01:26.080> is<00:01:26.259> a<00:01:26.289> run<00:01:26.590> out<00:01:26.830> and

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
the same method which is a run out and

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.779 
the same method which is a run out and
it's<00:01:28.420> two<00:01:28.599> letters<00:01:29.500> linked<00:01:29.770> together<00:01:30.009> it's

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
it's two letters linked together it's

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.779 
it's two letters linked together it's
very<00:01:31.119> good<00:01:31.420> for<00:01:31.479> instance<00:01:32.259> on<00:01:32.530> a<00:01:32.590> wedding<00:01:33.429> cake

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
very good for instance on a wedding cake

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.870 
very good for instance on a wedding cake
when<00:01:34.149> you<00:01:34.179> may<00:01:34.539> link<00:01:34.810> thee<00:01:35.170> and<00:01:35.619> the<00:01:36.340> initials

of the bride and groom together these

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.290 
of the bride and groom together these
words<00:01:41.110> are<00:01:41.500> piped<00:01:42.039> with<00:01:42.369> a<00:01:42.429> number<00:01:42.759> one

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
words are piped with a number one

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.370 
words are piped with a number one
nozzles<00:01:43.869> so<00:01:44.289> it's<00:01:44.739> under<00:01:45.190> one<00:01:45.550> or<00:01:45.940> it's<00:01:46.149> a<00:01:46.380> 1.5

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
nozzles so it's under one or it's a 1.5

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.979 
nozzles so it's under one or it's a 1.5
which<00:01:47.800> is<00:01:48.039> a<00:01:48.069> little<00:01:48.399> bit<00:01:48.550> bigger<00:01:48.819> but<00:01:49.420> a<00:01:49.660> one

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:49.989 
which is a little bit bigger but a one

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:54.570 
which is a little bit bigger but a one
is<00:01:50.380> quite<00:01:50.770> fine<00:01:51.399> to<00:01:51.729> work<00:01:51.940> with<00:01:52.270> so<00:01:53.200> booze<00:01:54.069> and

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
is quite fine to work with so booze and

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.169 
is quite fine to work with so booze and
these<00:01:55.000> this<00:01:55.509> is<00:01:55.569> a<00:01:55.929> good<00:01:56.590> way<00:01:56.830> of<00:01:57.179> typing

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
these this is a good way of typing

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.229 
these this is a good way of typing
letters<00:01:58.599> because<00:01:59.110> instead<00:01:59.500> of<00:01:59.560> princes<00:02:00.239> doing

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:01.239 
letters because instead of princes doing

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:03.570 
letters because instead of princes doing
a<00:02:01.390> circle<00:02:01.959> front<00:02:02.289> upper<00:02:02.679> north<00:02:03.039> which<00:02:03.369> is

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
a circle front upper north which is

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.100 
a circle front upper north which is
quite<00:02:03.789> difficult<00:02:04.090> to<00:02:04.450> guide<00:02:04.750> your<00:02:04.899> hand

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
quite difficult to guide your hand

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.350 
quite difficult to guide your hand
around<00:02:05.259> a<00:02:05.500> circle<00:02:05.770> you've<00:02:06.759> got<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.149> both

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
around a circle you've got the both

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.660 
around a circle you've got the both
straight<00:02:07.840> sides<00:02:08.200> appear<00:02:08.920> at<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.129> top<00:02:09.160> and

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
straight sides appear at the top and

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.880 
straight sides appear at the top and
another<00:02:10.330> day<00:02:10.629> at<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:10.810> bottom<00:02:11.260> you<00:02:11.410> see<00:02:11.440> in<00:02:11.739> the

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
another day at the bottom you see in the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.930 
another day at the bottom you see in the
sea<00:02:12.160> so<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.120> have<00:02:13.360> strict<00:02:13.780> sides<00:02:14.400> instead

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
sea so you have strict sides instead

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.540 
sea so you have strict sides instead
skirts<00:02:16.570> are<00:02:16.750> always<00:02:17.140> harder<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.740> do<00:02:17.920> the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
skirts are always harder to do the

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.290 
skirts are always harder to do the
straight<00:02:18.910> lines<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:21.370> has<00:02:21.520> occurred<00:02:21.820> you<00:02:22.090> see

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
straight lines this has occurred you see

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.570 
straight lines this has occurred you see
so<00:02:22.510> when<00:02:22.720> I<00:02:22.750> did<00:02:23.050> better<00:02:23.200> have<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:23.590> hold<00:02:24.280> the

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
so when I did better have to hold the

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.660 
so when I did better have to hold the
nozzle<00:02:24.820> quite<00:02:25.330> away<00:02:25.750> from<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.380> relax<00:02:27.220> so<00:02:27.520> that

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
nozzle quite away from the relax so that

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.600 
nozzle quite away from the relax so that
I<00:02:27.820> could<00:02:27.880> guide<00:02:28.300> it<00:02:28.570> round<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.230> then<00:02:30.130> bring<00:02:30.430> it

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
I could guide it round and then bring it

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.170 
I could guide it round and then bring it
down<00:02:30.820> at<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.090> last<00:02:31.300> minute<00:02:32.730> i'm<00:02:33.730> going<00:02:34.000> to

straight<00:03:12.040> on<00:03:12.250> top<00:03:12.430> what<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.060> does<00:03:13.300> is<00:03:13.330> it

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
straight on top what it does is it

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.320 
straight on top what it does is it
appraises<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.350> icing<00:03:14.890> slightly<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.610> gives

it more effect the same nozzle has been

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.340 
it more effect the same nozzle has been
used<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.540> pipe<00:03:19.980> these<00:03:20.980> little<00:03:21.370> dots<00:03:21.580> which<00:03:22.030> are

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
tip and the run outs here you see two to

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.790 
tip and the run outs here you see two to
highlight<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.330> beginning<00:03:34.810> of<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.080> words<00:03:35.320> and

highlight the beginning of the words and
then<00:03:36.420> these<00:03:37.420> are<00:03:37.480> being<00:03:37.930> painted<00:03:38.230> over<00:03:38.620> I<00:03:39.070> can

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
then these are being painted over I can

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.340 
then these are being painted over I can
see<00:03:39.730> by<00:03:40.030> looking<00:03:40.060> at<00:03:40.510> them<00:03:40.720> that<00:03:40.840> I<00:03:40.870> painted

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
see by looking at them that I painted

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.040 
see by looking at them that I painted
them<00:03:41.709> sometimes<00:03:42.580> it's<00:03:42.850> quicker<00:03:43.150> to<00:03:43.300> paint

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
them sometimes it's quicker to paint

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.880 
them sometimes it's quicker to paint
them<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:45.250> one<00:03:45.780> start<00:03:46.780> covering<00:03:47.080> up<00:03:47.410> a<00:03:47.500> bag<00:03:47.709> full

of icing so now I'll show you some

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.320 
of icing so now I'll show you some
painting<00:03:52.420> techniques<00:03:52.930> I<00:03:53.340> have<00:03:54.340> here<00:03:54.640> a<00:03:54.970> small

that<00:06:30.189> all<00:06:30.370> the<00:06:30.729> letters<00:06:31.090> are<00:06:31.330> practically

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
that all the letters are practically

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.170 
that all the letters are practically
touching<00:06:32.289> not<00:06:32.650> much<00:06:32.860> space<00:06:33.189> if<00:06:33.580> they<00:06:33.909> have<00:06:34.150> a

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
touching not much space if they have a

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.939 
touching not much space if they have a
big<00:06:34.449> area<00:06:34.689> to<00:06:34.840> cover<00:06:35.139> them<00:06:35.439> make<00:06:35.590> the<00:06:35.770> letters

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:35.949 
big area to cover them make the letters

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:39.510 
big area to cover them make the letters
bigger<00:06:36.400> I'll<00:06:37.300> just<00:06:37.629> do<00:06:37.870> that<00:06:37.900> little<00:06:38.520> squiggly

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
bigger I'll just do that little squiggly

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.760 
bigger I'll just do that little squiggly
line<00:06:39.759> for<00:06:40.150> you<00:06:40.330> and<00:06:40.629> when<00:06:41.110> you're<00:06:41.229> doing<00:06:41.590> it

and let's say I would normally do it

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:46.890 
and let's say I would normally do it
with<00:06:45.279> the<00:06:45.370> number<00:06:45.699> one<00:06:45.909> oz<00:06:46.120> or<00:06:46.300> not<00:06:46.479> a<00:06:46.509> number
