00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
into the stuff that we

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.020 
into the stuff that we
we<00:01:56.259> also<00:01:56.560> have<00:01:56.829> a<00:01:56.860> new<00:01:57.070> protein<00:01:57.549> that<00:01:57.789> was

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
we also have a new protein that was

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.749 
we also have a new protein that was
really<00:01:58.329> rhinos<00:01:58.860> project<00:01:59.860> and<00:02:00.100> so<00:02:00.310> I'm<00:02:00.579> sure

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
really rhinos project and so I'm sure

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.370 
really rhinos project and so I'm sure
he's<00:02:00.939> excited<00:02:01.360> to<00:02:01.420> tell<00:02:01.539> us<00:02:01.630> about<00:02:01.719> that<00:02:01.810> yeah

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
he's excited to tell us about that yeah

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.990 
he's excited to tell us about that yeah
I<00:02:02.409> wanted<00:02:02.799> its<00:02:03.100> course<00:02:03.369> you<00:02:03.579> know<00:02:03.700> all<00:02:03.880> these

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
I wanted its course you know all these

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.749 
I wanted its course you know all these
products<00:02:04.479> and<00:02:04.740> everybody<00:02:05.740> knows<00:02:05.920> I'm<00:02:06.159> never

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
products and everybody knows I'm never

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.719 
products and everybody knows I'm never
satisfied<00:02:07.390> with<00:02:07.860> one<00:02:08.860> level<00:02:09.190> we<00:02:09.310> need<00:02:09.429> to<00:02:09.489> keep

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
satisfied with one level we need to keep

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.040 
satisfied with one level we need to keep
doing<00:02:09.940> it<00:02:10.030> we<00:02:10.090> need<00:02:10.209> to<00:02:10.239> make<00:02:10.420> it<00:02:10.539> better<00:02:10.720> when

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
doing it we need to make it better when

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.600 
doing it we need to make it better when
you<00:02:11.110> keep<00:02:11.349> testing<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.160> this<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.489> then

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
you keep testing it and this and then

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.550 
you keep testing it and this and then
that's<00:02:12.849> when<00:02:13.390> I<00:02:13.420> came<00:02:13.510> up<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:13.959> new<00:02:14.080> protein

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
that's when I came up to the new protein

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.640 
that's when I came up to the new protein
I<00:02:14.800> wanted<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.340> make<00:02:15.489> a<00:02:15.519> better<00:02:15.849> cleaner

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
I wanted to make a better cleaner

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.440 
I wanted to make a better cleaner
non-gmo<00:02:17.650> organic<00:02:17.860> protein<00:02:18.610> all<00:02:19.239> the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
non-gmo organic protein all the

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.970 
non-gmo organic protein all the
ingredients<00:02:19.690> then<00:02:20.050> there's<00:02:20.200> non<00:02:20.410> GMO<00:02:20.590> and

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
ingredients then there's non GMO and

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.979 
ingredients then there's non GMO and
organic<00:02:21.459> so<00:02:21.910> we<00:02:22.060> worked<00:02:22.239> really<00:02:22.599> really<00:02:22.750> hard

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
organic so we worked really really hard

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.410 
organic so we worked really really hard
to<00:02:23.590> get<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:24.040> best<00:02:24.310> ingredients<00:02:24.519> for<00:02:25.239> this

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
to get the best ingredients for this

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.870 
to get the best ingredients for this
protein<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:26.050> then<00:02:26.380> we<00:02:26.890> came<00:02:27.040> up<00:02:27.099> with<00:02:27.760> the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
protein and then we came up with the

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.400 
protein and then we came up with the
price<00:02:28.120> we<00:02:28.360> didn't<00:02:28.569> care<00:02:28.720> about<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.989> price<00:02:29.200> we

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
price we didn't care about the price we

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.660 
price we didn't care about the price we
cared<00:02:29.590> about<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.860> performance<00:02:30.370> because

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
cared about the performance because

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.729 
cared about the performance because
that's<00:02:30.880> me<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:31.390> take<00:02:31.750> my<00:02:31.959> products<00:02:32.380> so<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:32.500> want

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
that's me I take my products so I want

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.380 
that's me I take my products so I want
my<00:02:32.830> product<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.250> be<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.400> best<00:02:33.730> that<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.239> can

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
my product to be the best that it can

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.900 
my product to be the best that it can
possibly<00:02:34.450> be<00:02:34.900> so<00:02:35.530> this<00:02:35.709> new<00:02:35.920> protein<00:02:36.400> here<00:02:36.670> is

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
possibly be so this new protein here is

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.050 
possibly be so this new protein here is
amazing<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.900> taste<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.799> quality<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:40.000> the

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
amazing the taste the quality and the

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.780 
amazing the taste the quality and the
performance<00:02:40.690> of<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.620> me<00:02:41.769> knocks<00:02:42.340> our<00:02:42.610> last

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
performance of it to me knocks our last

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.089 
performance of it to me knocks our last
one<00:02:43.000> out<00:02:43.690> of<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.810> park<00:02:44.110> we<00:02:44.560> use<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.709> number<00:02:45.069> of

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
one out of the park we use a number of

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.750 
one out of the park we use a number of
different<00:02:45.489> facilities<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.269> we<00:02:47.079> voluntarily

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
different facilities and we voluntarily

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.979 
different facilities and we voluntarily
stepped<00:02:48.760> up<00:02:48.910> our<00:02:49.060> level<00:02:49.420> to<00:02:49.660> produce

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
stepped up our level to produce

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.589 
stepped up our level to produce
everything<00:02:50.590> at<00:02:50.709> an<00:02:50.829> NSF<00:02:51.310> facility<00:02:51.790> which

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
everything at an NSF facility which

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.330 
everything at an NSF facility which
means<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:53.049> no<00:02:53.200> banned<00:02:53.470> substances<00:02:53.980> are<00:02:54.130> even

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
means that no banned substances are even

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.970 
means that no banned substances are even
allowed<00:02:54.610> into<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.269> facility<00:02:55.780> so<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.380> option

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
allowed into the facility so the option

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.920 
allowed into the facility so the option
of<00:02:57.099> cross-contamination<00:02:57.519> is<00:02:58.239> not<00:02:58.420> even<00:02:58.720> there

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
of cross-contamination is not even there

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.289 
of cross-contamination is not even there
we<00:02:59.799> thought<00:03:00.040> we've<00:03:00.250> also<00:03:00.430> voluntarily<00:03:01.060> gone

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
we thought we've also voluntarily gone

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.390 
we thought we've also voluntarily gone
completely<00:03:01.840> gluten-free<00:03:02.170> on<00:03:02.920> everything

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
completely gluten-free on everything

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.550 
completely gluten-free on everything
that<00:03:03.430> we<00:03:03.670> do<00:03:03.850> like<00:03:04.269> Rhino<00:03:04.540> said<00:03:04.900> non-gmo

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
that we do like Rhino said non-gmo

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.380 
that we do like Rhino said non-gmo
ingredients<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:06.280> organic<00:03:06.670> ingredients<00:03:07.209> and

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
ingredients and organic ingredients and

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.440 
ingredients and organic ingredients and
it's<00:03:07.750> in<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:08.019> new<00:03:08.170> two-pound<00:03:08.769> package<00:03:09.670> which<00:03:10.269> is

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
it's in a new two-pound package which is

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.449 
it's in a new two-pound package which is
nice<00:03:10.720> because<00:03:10.989> it<00:03:11.109> allows<00:03:11.470> our<00:03:11.680> consumers<00:03:12.310> to

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
nice because it allows our consumers to

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.879 
nice because it allows our consumers to
have<00:03:12.549> a<00:03:12.609> little<00:03:12.910> bit<00:03:13.090> less<00:03:14.019> of<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.319> price<00:03:14.590> point

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889 
have a little bit less of a price point

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.009 
have a little bit less of a price point
to<00:03:15.609> enter<00:03:15.940> in<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.269> start<00:03:16.450> using<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.810> Rhino

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
power but the highest quality that we

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.759 
power but the highest quality that we

each serving here has eight point five
grams<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.769> BCAAs<00:03:24.310> which<00:03:24.579> is<00:03:24.730> a<00:03:24.760> industry<00:03:25.750> high

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
grams of BCAAs which is a industry high

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.840 
grams of BCAAs which is a industry high
we<00:03:26.680> don't<00:03:26.859> know<00:03:26.980> of<00:03:27.010> any<00:03:27.220> other<00:03:27.340> company<00:03:27.819> that

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
we don't know of any other company that

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.030 
we don't know of any other company that
has<00:03:28.600> that<00:03:28.750> many<00:03:28.930> of<00:03:28.989> these<00:03:29.079> areas<00:03:29.290> per<00:03:29.620> serving

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
has that many of these areas per serving

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.580 
has that many of these areas per serving
so<00:03:30.250> that's<00:03:31.030> kind<00:03:31.239> of<00:03:31.299> an<00:03:31.420> exciting<00:03:31.720> addition

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
so that's kind of an exciting addition

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.620 
so that's kind of an exciting addition
to<00:03:32.620> all<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.579> great<00:03:33.730> stuff<00:03:33.970> that<00:03:34.180> Rhino<00:03:34.359> just

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
to all the great stuff that Rhino just

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.100 
to all the great stuff that Rhino just
pointed
