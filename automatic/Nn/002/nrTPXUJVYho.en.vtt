do work outside if it's windy I'll
recommend<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.990> one<00:01:34.049> because<00:01:34.350> you'll<00:01:34.590> see

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
recommend this one because you'll see

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.160 
recommend this one because you'll see
when<00:01:35.400> it's<00:01:35.549> there<00:01:35.790> it's<00:01:36.000> standing<00:01:36.600> strong<00:01:36.930> and

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
when it's there it's standing strong and

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.080 
when it's there it's standing strong and
the<00:01:37.229> wind<00:01:37.409> can<00:01:37.470> blow<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:38.040> thing<00:01:38.250> okay

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
the wind can blow on this thing okay

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.760 
the wind can blow on this thing okay
obviously<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.600> won't<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:39.960> an<00:01:40.079> umbrella<00:01:40.350> on

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
obviously I won't have an umbrella on

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.289 
obviously I won't have an umbrella on
this<00:01:41.189> thing<00:01:41.369> winner<00:01:41.520> wins<00:01:41.759> blame<00:01:42.000> because<00:01:42.150> it

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
this thing winner wins blame because it

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.999 
this thing winner wins blame because it
will<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:42.600> blow<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.840> entire<00:01:42.960> fin<00:01:43.350> over<00:01:43.860> but

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
will just blow the entire fin over but

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.010 
will just blow the entire fin over but
you<00:01:44.100> can<00:01:44.250> have<00:01:44.369> your<00:01:44.460> flash<00:01:44.759> on<00:01:45.000> here<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.420> you

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
you can have your flash on here and you

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.210 
you can have your flash on here and you
can<00:01:46.140> just<00:01:46.320> use<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.619> with<00:01:46.770> other<00:01:46.979> light

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
can just use it with other light

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.429 
can just use it with other light
modifier<00:01:47.759> but<00:01:48.270> I'm<00:01:48.570> afraid<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.110> one<00:01:49.320> will

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
modifier but I'm afraid this one will

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.139 
modifier but I'm afraid this one will
just<00:01:49.649> blow<00:01:49.829> over<00:01:49.860> if<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.340> take<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.670> maybe<00:01:50.939> to

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
just blow over if you take this maybe to

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.700 
just blow over if you take this maybe to
the<00:01:51.180> Strand<00:01:51.630> or<00:01:51.780> something<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.470> wind's

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
the Strand or something and the wind's

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.139 
the Strand or something and the wind's
blowing<00:01:52.740> strong<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:53.520> going<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.790> blow<00:01:53.939> this

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
blowing strong it's going to blow this

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.179 
blowing strong it's going to blow this
thing<00:01:54.299> over<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.810> roll<00:01:55.409> then<00:01:55.619> go<00:01:55.770> for<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.009> heavy

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189

thing over so roll then go for the heavy
duty<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:56.670> if<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.719> look<00:01:57.930> at<00:01:58.170> your<00:01:58.500> brackets

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
duty one if you look at your brackets

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
now here we've got a bracket and you

can<00:02:48.660> move<00:02:48.840> around<00:02:48.959> nowadays<00:02:49.440> you're<00:02:49.950> on<00:02:50.069> this

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
can move around nowadays you're on this

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.009 
can move around nowadays you're on this
side<00:02:50.489> you<00:02:50.819> can't<00:02:51.239> see<00:02:51.299> nowadays<00:02:51.569> a<00:02:51.750> little

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
side you can't see nowadays a little

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.650 
side you can't see nowadays a little
screw<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.379> I<00:02:52.560> can<00:02:52.769> tighten<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.370> then<00:02:54.239> the

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
screw that I can tighten and then the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.949 
screw that I can tighten and then the
umbrella<00:02:54.989> is<00:02:55.290> faster<00:02:56.190> than<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:56.459> can<00:02:56.489> fall<00:02:56.879> out

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
umbrella is faster than it can fall out

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.780 
umbrella is faster than it can fall out
it's<00:02:57.959> nice<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.409> look<00:02:58.590> for<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.099> little<00:02:59.370> screw

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
it's nice to look for that little screw

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.339 
it's nice to look for that little screw
there<00:02:59.940> cuz<00:03:00.090> sometimes<00:03:00.299> it<00:03:00.659> doesn't<00:03:00.989> have<00:03:01.140> one

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
there cuz sometimes it doesn't have one

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.630 
there cuz sometimes it doesn't have one
and<00:03:01.560> then<00:03:01.680> your<00:03:01.799> umbrella<00:03:02.099> can<00:03:02.310> just<00:03:02.489> move

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
and then your umbrella can just move

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.580 
and then your umbrella can just move
around<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.030> entire<00:03:03.299> time<00:03:03.569> and<00:03:03.690> in<00:03:04.409> the<00:03:04.440> same

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.069 
around the entire time and in the same
at<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.069> top<00:03:05.310> here<00:03:05.510> you'll<00:03:06.510> see<00:03:06.569> if<00:03:06.780> i<00:03:06.840> take

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
at the top here you'll see if i take

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:13.220 
at the top here you'll see if i take
