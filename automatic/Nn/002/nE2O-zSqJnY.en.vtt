00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.689
 we do many courses of 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.460
 photography but they are usually courses 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.920
 theoretical or practical courses in the 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.230
 which practices we carry out 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.019
 here next here after in the 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.600
 proximity of our store this time 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:43.940
 We have considered it opportune to go to 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.890
 a site a little more special and in need 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.900
 of being able to move to kenya or 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.330
 Tanzania do safaris we have considered 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.100
 timely that the barcelona show could 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:56.620
 be a very good option to perform 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.300
 a photography course thinking about 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.010
 all in the photograph capture of 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.739
 animated you have to have a certain 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.960
 predisposition to like you 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.750
 precisely that environment the environment then 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.520
 of wild animals although in the 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.490
 zoo of savages every time they have 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.460
 less but really what gives us 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.770
 is the ease of photographing those 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.830
 animals without the need to make large 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.350
 commuting with much comfort and 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.880
 a very fast and agile way some of 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.649
 the basic questions that 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.960
 We advise people to wear 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.940
 first in your camera that there's the 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.920
 possibility of having a telephoto lens or 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.929
 be to approximate the animals not 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.899
 we always have animals to a 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:40.179
 adequate distance then that would be the 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.619
 first question the second that 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.780
 control the issue of speed a lot 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.759
 so that said animals and they are few 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.210
 nervous move the photo does not stay 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.580
 well moved and finally the subject of the 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.470
 smooth sensitivity because not always 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.659
 we are in places that there is a lot of light to 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.090
 Sometimes you enter areas such as the terrarium 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.230
 see that from lizards to 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.870
 snakes 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.490
 which are very low lights very little light 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.010
 then people have to 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.600
 get used to working with the iso for 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.819
 compensate and be able to work with 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.340
 slightly faster speeds 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.709
 we have thought that with 7 hours 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.620
 is more than enough to give a 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.480
 photographic turn , the normal thing is that we 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.129
 let's find at 10 o'clock in the morning 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.670
 barcelona zoo we make a small 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:28.389
 theoretical class of hour and a half hour for 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.159
 that people got a little familiar with 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:33.359
 a series of parameters that we 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:36.549
 we advise to take the photograph and 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:38.799
 we go out normally and we try to 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.840
 come also a guide of one's own 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.569
 zoo that will pay us a visit 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.849
 generic and it also helps us to 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.040
 begin to familiarize ourselves a little with 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.699
 the animals there and then finally 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.400
 the rest is photographic or logical safari 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:57.519
 in which then everyone goes a little 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.370
 with the chip your personal chip at the time 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.230
 to take pictures and support our 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.120
 to tell you then look at this maybe you can not 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.400
 is going well for this reason or for 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.139
 another or there is always a continuous support 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.139
 before the doubts that arise
