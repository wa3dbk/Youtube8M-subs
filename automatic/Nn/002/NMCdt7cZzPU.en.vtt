00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.419
 hello with you evgeny kartashov and in 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.669
 This video clip I want to talk about 

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:11.390
 such a wonderful tool for 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:12.980
 photo processing as a lightroom myself 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.320
 I use this program every day 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.390
 for handling large quantities 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.699
 photos 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.429
 often from novice photographers i hear 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.470
 what question is why do I need lightroom if 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:25.779
 i have photoshop i can do everything 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.429
 photoshop 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.470
 Yes, you can do everything in Photoshop 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.020
 but let's see why 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.960
 was created photoshop and for what 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:40.070
 lightroom was created more precisely for nothing 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.500
 but for whom is the fact that photoshop 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.340
 originally created for color correctors 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.590
 printers who prepared the image 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.739
 print in some magazines the thing is 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.690
 That digital cameras then not was 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.500
 digital images were few 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.379
 they were obtained by scanning 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.640
 film negatives or slides and 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.499
 Photoshop tools 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.850
 built to work with such 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:09.500
 images with photoshop time 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.979
 overgrown with various auxiliary 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.829
 instruments and turned into the most powerful 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.049
 universal editor not only 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.350
 image but also vector graphics and 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.600
 video in it you can create animation 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.200
 working with 3d objects is wonderful 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.619
 program 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.380
 but the question is whether all this is necessary 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.030
 photographer after all for photo processing 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.840
 rather limited set is used 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.229
 tools and the fact is that this one 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.719
 here 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.780
 complexity of the universality of the program 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:45.240
 she creates big learning problems 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:49.570
 very difficult to learn photoshop 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.880
 The second problem is converter converter 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.330
 adobe camera raw he is of course very 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.240
 good but not adapted to work with 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:02.190
 lots of pictures and in it 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.190
 pretty awkward interface and 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.200
 finally the third problem is the price 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.660
 adobe photoshop photoshop 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.110
 the normal version is not extended worth 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.680
 about 27 thousand rubles for a beginner 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.680
 photographer's amount is simply very heavy 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.570
 now let's look at the lightroom 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.700
 lightroom no extra tools he 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.700
 designed specifically to work with 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.620
 photos 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.690
 also when creating a lightroom in his 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.450
 testing took part such 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.900
 famous photographers like scott kelby 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.110
 from the national association 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.820
 professionals photoshop us camera moat 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.670
 in lightroom there is a converter 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:49.600
 called a processing module or modules 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.239
 develop and it has much more convenient 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.459
 interface than adobe camera raw it 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.770
 specially created for batch 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.070
 image processing ie working with 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.269
 a large number of images 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.550
 the most powerful lightroom tool 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.390
 are presets that allow 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.820
 handle photos in one click and 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.410
 you can apply them 1 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.230
 a dozen or hundreds even thousands 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.480
 photos and finally the last 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.600
 An important factor is the price of the program 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.430
 it is several times lower than adobe 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.650
 photoshop and is about 5 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.959
 half thousand rubles i.e. 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.420
 principle buy this program can 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:32.380
 any novice photographer if a bit 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.660
 save money compare photoshop 27000 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.690
 and lightroom 5 half is the difference 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.000
 obvious of course for serious retouching 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.590
 for serious processing lightroom not 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.660
 fit it just does not have such 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.780
 tools for example no tool 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.790
 plastic there are no such developed tools 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.330
 retouching in it cannot be cut any 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.700
 parts of the image embed them other 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.220
 but is it always necessary 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.760
 such a treatment for the bulk 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.090
 photos let's say a wedding photographer 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:06.750
 mainly color correction is performed 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.830
 contrast correction and so on but 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.050
 be easy retouching 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.349
 all this can be done with 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.790
 lightroom and photoshop leave for dessert 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:19.109
 Here are exactly such operations as 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:21.269
 collage deep retouching different 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.310
 such creative processing when 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.520
 some parts of the photo are replaced 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.350
 inserted but others think it's 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.470
 used for just a few 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.900
 photos from the series and therefore a large 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.120
 part of the work you can do just 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.650
 in the lightroom in this way the lightroom 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.710
 is the perfect solution for 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.389
 Photographer can use it bundles 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.120
 hacks photoshop and with others 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.830
 programs and plugins using 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.290
 lightroom you will significantly increase 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.120
 speed and quality of processing their 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.979
 photos 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.200
 more about the nuances of working in 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.360
 lightroom you can learn from our 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.120
 course lightroom enchanter 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.570
 with you was evgeny kartashov to new 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.570
 meeting
