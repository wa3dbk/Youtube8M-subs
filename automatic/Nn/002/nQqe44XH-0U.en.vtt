00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
train I personally believe this part is

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.990 
train I personally believe this part is
the<00:00:31.260> hardest<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.920> don't<00:00:32.189> know<00:00:32.340> why<00:00:32.460> people<00:00:32.489> say

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
the hardest I don't know why people say

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.139 
the hardest I don't know why people say
this<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.300> easy<00:00:33.600> because<00:00:34.559> um<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.309> tried<00:00:35.940> for

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
this is easy because um I tried for

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.690 
this is easy because um I tried for
literally<00:00:36.480> an<00:00:36.570> hour<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.170> got<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.469> once<00:00:37.739> for

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
literally an hour and I got it once for

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.030 
literally an hour and I got it once for
some<00:00:38.910> reason<00:00:39.329> unlike<00:00:39.989> black<00:00:40.260> ops<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.800> game

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
some reason unlike black ops this game

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.420 
some reason unlike black ops this game
is<00:00:41.190> very<00:00:41.219> inconsistent<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.860> don't

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
is very inconsistent and I I don't

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.220 
is very inconsistent and I I don't
understand<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.239> was<00:00:45.629> looking<00:00:45.719> at<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.050> person

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
understand I was looking at the person

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.860 
understand I was looking at the person
for<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.010> whole<00:00:47.160> time<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:47.789> couldn't<00:00:48.450> get<00:00:48.690> it

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
for the whole time and I couldn't get it

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.770 
for the whole time and I couldn't get it
so<00:00:49.770> if<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.219> get<00:00:50.370> lucky<00:00:50.550> enough<00:00:50.969> once<00:00:51.629> you're

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
so if you get lucky enough once you're

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.740 
so if you get lucky enough once you're
on<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.899> tree<00:00:52.280> place<00:00:53.280> your<00:00:53.460> tank<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:54.030> suggest

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
on the tree place your tank I suggest

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.840 
on the tree place your tank I suggest
using<00:00:54.930> one<00:00:55.230> man<00:00:55.410> army<00:00:55.620> when<00:00:56.520> you're<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
using one man army when you're on the

using one man army when you're on the
pole<00:00:57.770> but<00:00:58.770> once<00:00:58.920> you're<00:00:59.039> on<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.160> tree<00:00:59.430> um

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
pole but once you're on the tree um

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.360 
pole but once you're on the tree um
sprint<00:01:00.570> jump<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> pole<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:02.010> once<00:01:02.219> you're

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
sprint jump to the pole and once you're

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.119 
sprint jump to the pole and once you're
there<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.699> know<00:01:02.820> use<00:01:03.480> one<00:01:03.719> an<00:01:03.899> army<00:01:04.350> place

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129

your<00:01:05.280> TAC<00:01:05.460> there<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.030> then<00:01:06.210> once<00:01:06.570> you're

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
your TAC there and then once you're

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.469 
your TAC there and then once you're
there<00:01:06.960> do<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> simple<00:01:08.159> sprint<00:01:08.670> jump<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.360> then
