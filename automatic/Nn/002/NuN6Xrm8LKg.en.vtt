think<00:03:25.190> that<00:03:25.310> your<00:03:25.489> arrogance<00:03:26.269> is<00:03:26.420> something

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
think that your arrogance is something

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.449 
think that your arrogance is something
that<00:03:26.930> you<00:03:27.049> need<00:03:27.200> to<00:03:27.380> abolish<00:03:27.620> from<00:03:28.040> your<00:03:28.220> life

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
that you need to abolish from your life

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.180 
that you need to abolish from your life
and<00:03:28.760> while<00:03:29.510> arrogance<00:03:30.079> can<00:03:30.440> lead<00:03:30.739> to<00:03:30.950> weak

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
and while arrogance can lead to weak

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.190 
and while arrogance can lead to weak
moments<00:03:31.760> there<00:03:32.030> are<00:03:32.150> times<00:03:32.510> when<00:03:32.750> arrogance

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
moments there are times when arrogance

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.680 
moments there are times when arrogance
can<00:03:33.470> become<00:03:33.920> part<00:03:34.190> of<00:03:34.250> a<00:03:34.340> great<00:03:34.579> strength<00:03:35.060> like

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
can become part of a great strength like

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.090 
can become part of a great strength like
in<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.930> case<00:03:36.109> of<00:03:36.290> how<00:03:36.380> you<00:03:36.440> started<00:03:36.859> doing

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
in the case of how you started doing

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.340 
in the case of how you started doing
videos<00:03:37.459> on<00:03:37.700> YouTube<00:03:38.150> I'm<00:03:38.690> sure<00:03:38.989> you<00:03:39.200> can

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
videos on YouTube I'm sure you can

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.840 
videos on YouTube I'm sure you can
remember<00:03:39.650> what<00:03:39.950> it<00:03:39.980> felt<00:03:40.280> like<00:03:40.430> in<00:03:40.549> those

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
remember what it felt like in those

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.699 
remember what it felt like in those
early<00:03:41.269> days<00:03:41.299> when<00:03:41.780> you<00:03:41.870> were<00:03:41.959> first<00:03:42.200> trying<00:03:42.560> to

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
early days when you were first trying to

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.530 
early days when you were first trying to
gain<00:03:42.920> an<00:03:43.100> audience<00:03:43.190> do<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:44.000> believe<00:03:44.299> that<00:03:44.329> you

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
gain an audience do you believe that you

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.330 
gain an audience do you believe that you
could<00:03:44.750> have<00:03:44.840> come<00:03:45.170> this<00:03:45.380> far<00:03:45.709> without<00:03:45.920> that

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
could have come this far without that

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.099 
could have come this far without that
driving<00:03:46.940> feeling<00:03:47.450> that<00:03:47.600> you<00:03:47.690> could<00:03:47.870> be<00:03:47.989> the

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
driving feeling that you could be the

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.110 
driving feeling that you could be the
best<00:03:48.350> at<00:03:48.590> something<00:03:48.799> perhaps<00:03:49.519> even<00:03:49.760> better

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
best at something perhaps even better

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.930 
best at something perhaps even better
than<00:03:50.359> those<00:03:50.540> who<00:03:50.780> had<00:03:50.900> come<00:03:51.079> before<00:03:51.230> you<00:03:51.590> I

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
than those who had come before you I

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.009 
than those who had come before you I
think<00:03:52.940> there<00:03:53.090> was<00:03:53.180> a<00:03:53.239> time<00:03:53.510> when<00:03:53.720> I<00:03:53.780> first

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
think there was a time when I first

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.810 
think there was a time when I first
started<00:03:54.410> out<00:03:54.560> that<00:03:54.739> I<00:03:54.799> began<00:03:55.130> to<00:03:55.280> doubt<00:03:55.489> if<00:03:55.730> my

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
started out that I began to doubt if my

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:56.860 
started out that I began to doubt if my
work<00:03:56.030> had<00:03:56.299> any<00:03:56.449> in

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
work had any in

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.630 
work had any in
I<00:03:57.170> was<00:03:57.410> just<00:03:57.620> doing<00:03:57.830> it<00:03:57.890> for<00:03:58.099> fun<00:03:58.310> because

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
I was just doing it for fun because

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.690 
I was just doing it for fun because
riding<00:03:59.120> made<00:03:59.269> me<00:03:59.450> happy<00:03:59.840> it<00:04:00.260> was<00:04:00.500> my<00:04:00.739> stress

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
riding made me happy it was my stress

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.160 
riding made me happy it was my stress
relief<00:04:02.030> because<00:04:02.300> I<00:04:02.450> could<00:04:02.720> channel<00:04:02.930> my

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
relief because I could channel my

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.809 
relief because I could channel my
opinions<00:04:03.620> into<00:04:03.800> something<00:04:04.099> productive<00:04:04.220> at

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
opinions into something productive at

that point when I was finally ready to

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.440 
that point when I was finally ready to

fouled and respected not by force but by

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.830 
fouled and respected not by force but by
earning<00:04:31.340> it<00:04:31.460> but<00:04:32.060> do<00:04:32.150> I<00:04:32.210> believe<00:04:32.300> I<00:04:32.660> would<00:04:32.720> have

made it without the skill or the drive I
think<00:04:35.180> I<00:04:35.419> may<00:04:35.750> have<00:04:35.840> given<00:04:36.080> up<00:04:36.380> back<00:04:36.680> then<00:04:37.010> had

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
think I may have given up back then had

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.580 
think I may have given up back then had
I<00:04:37.610> not<00:04:37.850> found<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.300> spark<00:04:38.750> that<00:04:39.020> relit<00:04:39.440> the

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
I not found the spark that relit the

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.129 
I not found the spark that relit the
flame<00:04:39.889> within<00:04:40.100> me<00:04:40.340> to<00:04:40.460> continue<00:04:40.970> think<00:04:41.870> of<00:04:41.990> it

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
flame within me to continue think of it

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.050 
flame within me to continue think of it
sort<00:04:42.380> of<00:04:42.500> like<00:04:42.680> Trixie<00:04:43.220> I<00:04:43.370> mean<00:04:43.580> she<00:04:43.820> almost

00:06:33.489 --> 00:06:33.499 
best of us it's like a car going full

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:35.409 
best of us it's like a car going full
speed<00:06:33.860> on<00:06:33.889> cruise<00:06:34.279> control<00:06:34.430> it's<00:06:34.969> going<00:06:35.210> to<00:06:35.300> go

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419 
speed on cruise control it's going to go

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:37.209 
speed on cruise control it's going to go
far<00:06:35.749> there's<00:06:36.110> no<00:06:36.289> doubt<00:06:36.499> about<00:06:36.620> that

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:37.219 
far there's no doubt about that

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:39.429 
far there's no doubt about that
but<00:06:37.580> once<00:06:37.759> it<00:06:37.879> starts<00:06:38.210> swerving<00:06:38.779> twisting<00:06:39.319> and

00:06:39.429 --> 00:06:39.439 
but once it starts swerving twisting and

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:41.920 
but once it starts swerving twisting and

this<00:06:46.819> we<00:06:47.419> all<00:06:47.569> know<00:06:47.599> that<00:06:47.930> there<00:06:48.080> is<00:06:48.289> control

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:49.069 
this we all know that there is control

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:51.579 
this we all know that there is control
and<00:06:49.339> once<00:06:49.759> we<00:06:49.939> find<00:06:50.300> that<00:06:50.389> control<00:06:50.960> you<00:06:51.409> can

00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:51.589 
and once we find that control you can

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:54.010 
and once we find that control you can
refine<00:06:51.979> yourself<00:06:52.550> and<00:06:52.759> then<00:06:53.210> well<00:06:53.599> you've

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020 
refine yourself and then well you've

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.320 
refine yourself and then well you've
reached<00:06:54.379> a<00:06:54.589> top<00:06:55.009> it's<00:06:55.639> up<00:06:55.849> to<00:06:55.999> you<00:06:56.059> to<00:06:56.180> continue

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:56.330 
reached a top it's up to you to continue

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:57.879 
reached a top it's up to you to continue
climbing<00:06:56.779> because<00:06:57.199> I've<00:06:57.319> learned<00:06:57.529> in<00:06:57.740> life

00:06:57.879 --> 00:06:57.889 
climbing because I've learned in life

00:06:57.889 --> 00:06:59.739 
climbing because I've learned in life
you<00:06:58.129> only<00:06:58.159> get<00:06:58.550> to<00:06:58.639> the<00:06:58.699> top<00:06:58.969> when<00:06:59.270> you<00:06:59.389> stop

00:06:59.739 --> 00:06:59.749 
you only get to the top when you stop

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:02.350 
you only get to the top when you stop
climbing<00:07:00.580> well<00:07:01.580> I<00:07:01.610> think<00:07:01.909> that<00:07:02.240> we've

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
climbing well I think that we've

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.119 
climbing well I think that we've
accomplished<00:07:02.899> some<00:07:03.080> good<00:07:03.289> things<00:07:03.620> here<00:07:04.009> I

00:07:04.119 --> 00:07:04.129 
accomplished some good things here I

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:05.379 
accomplished some good things here I
hope<00:07:04.520> that<00:07:04.699> you<00:07:04.789> will<00:07:04.909> remember<00:07:05.210> that

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:05.389 
hope that you will remember that
