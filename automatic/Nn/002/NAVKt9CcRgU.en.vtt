out of but all the very careful closing
it

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
it

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.640 
it
otherwise<00:02:56.670> you'll<00:02:57.019> you'll<00:02:58.019> rip<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.409> from<00:02:58.560> the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
otherwise you'll you'll rip it from the

otherwise you'll you'll rip it from the
top<00:02:59.040> here<00:02:59.310> when<00:02:59.610> it<00:02:59.790> could<00:02:59.970> be<00:03:00.000> fixed<00:03:00.450> if<00:03:00.599> but

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
top here when it could be fixed if but

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.080 
top here when it could be fixed if but
I'm<00:03:01.379> to<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.799> probably<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.730> could<00:03:02.819> probably<00:03:02.940> be

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
I'm to a probably it could probably be

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.380 
I'm to a probably it could probably be
easily<00:03:03.510> fixed<00:03:04.069> but<00:03:05.069> I'm<00:03:05.159> too<00:03:05.310> lazy<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.730> do<00:03:06.359> a

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
easily fixed but I'm too lazy to do a

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.599 
easily fixed but I'm too lazy to do a
little<00:03:06.540> machine<00:03:07.409> a<00:03:07.590> water-cooled<00:03:08.250> machine

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
like the rear rear escape hatch well

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:23.479 
like the rear rear escape hatch well
it's<00:03:22.470> supposed<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.739> be<00:03:22.829> a<00:03:22.859> rear<00:03:23.040> escape<00:03:23.310> hatch

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
ignorance but I and it moves kind of

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.759 
ignorance but I and it moves kind of
