00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
have to work with each other and of

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.390 
have to work with each other and of
course<00:02:23.840> with<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.170> patients<00:02:24.680> as<00:02:24.830> well<00:02:25.010> so<00:02:25.340> I

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
course with the patients as well so I

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.840 
course with the patients as well so I
think<00:02:25.490> it's<00:02:26.240> taught<00:02:26.840> me<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:27.050> lot<00:02:27.230> about

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
think it's taught me a lot about

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.730 
think it's taught me a lot about
relationship<00:02:28.850> building<00:02:29.260> so<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.410> best<00:02:30.560> thing

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
relationship building so the best thing

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.340 
relationship building so the best thing
about<00:02:30.770> studying<00:02:31.570> was<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:32.810> support<00:02:33.140> that<00:02:33.260> we

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
about studying was the support that we

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.199 
about studying was the support that we
got<00:02:33.470> from<00:02:33.590> all<00:02:33.770> our<00:02:33.890> mentors<00:02:34.280> on<00:02:34.910> Frank

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
got from all our mentors on Frank

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.949 
got from all our mentors on Frank
placement<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.580> I<00:02:37.580> think<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.270> variety<00:02:38.930> that

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
placement and I think the variety that

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.260 
placement and I think the variety that
the<00:02:39.170> course<00:02:39.380> gives<00:02:39.650> you<00:02:39.920> you're<00:02:40.820> constantly

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
the course gives you you're constantly

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.790 
the course gives you you're constantly
in<00:02:41.390> placement<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:42.260> there's<00:02:42.440> no<00:02:42.560> block

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
in placement and there's no block

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.979 
in placement and there's no block
placement<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:43.550> it's<00:02:43.700> you're<00:02:44.360> in<00:02:44.480> uni<00:02:44.780> and

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
placement so it's you're in uni and

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.780 
placement so it's you're in uni and
placement<00:02:45.410> at<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.560> same<00:02:45.739> time<00:02:46.040> which<00:02:46.640> I<00:02:46.760> think

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
placement at the same time which I think

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.699 
placement at the same time which I think
gives<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.330> a<00:02:47.360> lot<00:02:47.570> of<00:02:47.690> continuity<00:02:48.080> with<00:02:48.590> your

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
gives you a lot of continuity with your

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.440 
gives you a lot of continuity with your
learning<00:02:49.160> it's<00:02:50.030> not<00:02:50.120> like<00:02:50.300> you're<00:02:50.420> just

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
learning it's not like you're just

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.960 
learning it's not like you're just
stepping<00:02:50.810> in<00:02:51.050> and<00:02:51.200> out<00:02:51.320> of<00:02:51.850> education<00:02:52.850> and

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
stepping in and out of education and

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.390 
stepping in and out of education and
practice<00:02:53.090> though<00:02:53.830> it's<00:02:54.830> given<00:02:55.100> me<00:02:55.160> a<00:02:55.190> much

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
practice though it's given me a much

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.050 
practice though it's given me a much
firmer<00:02:55.670> idea<00:02:56.209> of<00:02:56.420> where<00:02:57.019> I<00:02:57.050> want<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.530> take<00:02:58.060> my

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
firmer idea of where I want to take my

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.620 
firmer idea of where I want to take my
career<00:02:59.420> and<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:01.040> sector<00:03:02.000> that<00:03:02.120> I<00:03:02.180> want<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.480> go

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
most out of the experience I think that

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.910 
most out of the experience I think that
it<00:03:54.890> makes<00:03:55.790> me<00:03:55.970> more<00:03:56.360> open-minded<00:03:56.660> about<00:03:57.470> the

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
it makes me more open-minded about the

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.410 
it makes me more open-minded about the
different<00:03:58.459> health<00:03:58.610> care<00:03:58.760> systems<00:03:59.150> are

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
different health care systems are

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.890 
different health care systems are
available<00:04:00.049> and<00:04:00.350> throughout<00:04:00.950> Europe

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
available and throughout Europe

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.059 
available and throughout Europe
especially<00:04:02.900> in<00:04:03.260> Denmark<00:04:03.680> obviously

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
especially in Denmark obviously

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.520 
especially in Denmark obviously
and<00:04:05.249> I<00:04:05.730> think<00:04:05.969> ultimately<00:04:06.120> that<00:04:06.569> is<00:04:06.629> made<00:04:07.260> me

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
and I think ultimately that is made me

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.349 
and I think ultimately that is made me
more<00:04:08.069> open-minded<00:04:08.400> about<00:04:08.849> potentially

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
more open-minded about potentially

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.140 
more open-minded about potentially
finding<00:04:09.719> a<00:04:09.810> job<00:04:10.019> outside<00:04:10.469> of<00:04:11.159> England<00:04:11.579> and

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
finding a job outside of England and

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.479 
finding a job outside of England and
it's<00:04:12.780> not<00:04:12.930> all<00:04:13.079> about<00:04:13.349> the<00:04:13.620> UK<00:04:14.129> than<00:04:14.370> their

they don't always make those

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.800
