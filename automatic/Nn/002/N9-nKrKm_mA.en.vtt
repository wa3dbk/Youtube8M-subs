twice within 14 and a knife and this way

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.140 
twice within 14 and a knife and this way
you'll<00:01:23.040> maximize<00:01:23.189> your<00:01:23.580> points<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.939> get<00:01:24.060> them

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
you'll maximize your points to get them

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.399 
you'll maximize your points to get them
a<00:01:24.180> lot<00:01:24.390> more<00:01:24.420> points<00:01:24.960> than<00:01:25.020> just<00:01:25.290> shooting

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
a lot more points than just shooting

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.020 
a lot more points than just shooting
them<00:01:25.619> normally<00:01:26.009> or<00:01:26.130> just<00:01:26.340> knifing<00:01:26.670> stuff<00:01:26.909> like

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
them normally or just knifing stuff like

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.620 
them normally or just knifing stuff like
that<00:01:27.060> because<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.229> get<00:01:28.430> for<00:01:29.430> every<00:01:29.729> hit

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
that because you get for every hit

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.880 
that because you get for every hit
marker<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.049> get<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.290> them<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.560> get<00:01:31.710> ten

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
marker you get on them and get ten

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.620 
marker you get on them and get ten
points<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.729> great<00:01:32.909> way<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.150> maximize

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
points so it's a great way to maximize

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.240 
points so it's a great way to maximize
your<00:01:33.750> points<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.259> get<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> lot<00:01:34.799> more<00:01:34.829> points

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
your points and get a lot more points

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.920 
your points and get a lot more points
than<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.490> normally<00:01:35.729> would<00:01:35.939> if<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.900> just

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
than you normally would if you just

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.749 
than you normally would if you just
normally<00:01:37.229> shoot<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.710> only<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:37.979> 14<00:01:38.340> stuff

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
normally shoot that only in 14 stuff

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.420 
normally shoot that only in 14 stuff
like<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.500> so<00:01:40.500> once<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.009> once<00:01:41.340> you

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
like that so once you do this once you

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.670 
like that so once you do this once you
have<00:01:41.579> 6,000<00:01:42.420> points<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.110> should<00:01:43.439> have

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
have 6,000 points so you should have

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.639 
have 6,000 points so you should have
around<00:01:43.979> 6,000<00:01:44.970> points<00:01:45.119> by<00:01:45.479> maybe<00:01:45.960> around<00:01:46.290> for

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
around 6,000 points by maybe around for

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.219 
around 6,000 points by maybe around for
around<00:01:47.520> five<00:01:47.729> if<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.149> get<00:01:48.329> lucky<00:01:48.509> with<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
around five if you get lucky with the

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.200 
around five if you get lucky with the
double<00:01:49.470> points<00:01:49.860> anything<00:01:50.189> like<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.369> ok<00:01:51.000> one

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
double points anything like that ok one

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.179 
double points anything like that ok one
thing<00:01:51.360> i<00:01:51.420> want<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.600> say<00:01:51.659> as<00:01:51.899> well<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.950> do

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
thing i want to say as well is you do

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.090 
thing i want to say as well is you do
never<00:01:53.579> want<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:55.229> never<00:01:55.439> want<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.770> rebuild

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
never want to you never want to rebuild

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.069 
never want to you never want to rebuild
barriers<00:01:56.549> because<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:57.420> want<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.689> oh<00:01:57.990> I

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
barriers because you want to oh I

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.800 
barriers because you want to oh I
wouldn't<00:01:58.770> say<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.009> but<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.640> wouldn't<00:02:00.540> kill

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
wouldn't say that but I wouldn't kill

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.990 
wouldn't say that but I wouldn't kill
zombies<00:02:01.350> inside<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.340> Windows<00:02:02.640> i<00:02:02.790> would<00:02:02.909> let

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
zombies inside of Windows i would let

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.060 
zombies inside of Windows i would let
them<00:02:03.180> come<00:02:03.390> out<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.899> windows<00:02:04.200> first<00:02:04.500> so

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
them come out of the windows first so

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.190 
them come out of the windows first so
that<00:02:05.219> way<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.700> have<00:02:06.180> more<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.630> chance<00:02:06.659> of

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
that way you have more of a chance of

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.199 
that way you have more of a chance of
getting<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:08.190> job<00:02:08.220> because<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.849> want<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.119> get

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
getting a job because you want to get

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.210 
getting a job because you want to get
maximals<00:02:09.899> whenever<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.259> can<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.129> way

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
maximals whenever you can so that way

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.530 
maximals whenever you can so that way
you<00:02:11.280> can<00:02:11.459> keep<00:02:11.610> getting<00:02:11.760> more<00:02:12.000> points<00:02:12.420> or

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
you can keep getting more points or

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.850 
you can keep getting more points or
double<00:02:12.840> points<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.290> get<00:02:13.440> even<00:02:13.530> more

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
double points so you get even more

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.710 
double points so you get even more
you<00:02:14.100> want<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.280> keep<00:02:14.430> getting<00:02:14.940> as<00:02:15.180> many<00:02:15.300> jobs<00:02:15.540> as

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
you want to keep getting as many jobs as

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.090 
you want to keep getting as many jobs as
you<00:02:15.780> possibly<00:02:16.110> can<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:16.470> don't<00:02:16.770> kill<00:02:16.920> any

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
you possibly can so don't kill any

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.140 
you possibly can so don't kill any
zombies<00:02:17.130> when<00:02:17.580> they're<00:02:17.700> still<00:02:17.940> in<00:02:18.060> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
zombies when they're still in the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.820 
zombies when they're still in the
barriers<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.930> let<00:02:19.110> them<00:02:19.230> come<00:02:19.440> out<00:02:19.470> i<00:02:19.590> think

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
barriers and let them come out i think

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.930 
barriers and let them come out i think
kill<00:02:20.040> them<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.340> way<00:02:20.490> you<00:02:20.610> can<00:02:20.790> possibly

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
kill them so that way you can possibly

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.060 
kill them so that way you can possibly
get<00:02:21.210> a<00:02:21.270> drop<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:22.350> once<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.620> get<00:02:22.770> a<00:02:22.800> lot<00:02:23.040> of

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
get a drop so once you get a lot of

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.470 
get a drop so once you get a lot of
points<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.490> can<00:02:23.640> go<00:02:23.850> get<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.120> galvin<00:02:24.360> not

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
points you can go get the galvin not

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.420 
points you can go get the galvin not
close<00:02:24.630> anymore<00:02:24.870> go<00:02:25.080> all<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.470> way<00:02:25.500> down<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.800> the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
close anymore go all the way down to the

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.910 
close anymore go all the way down to the
upside-down<00:02:27.090> room<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.810> from<00:02:28.470> there<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.890> can

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
upside-down room and from there you can

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.890 
upside-down room and from there you can
just<00:02:29.190> pretty<00:02:29.820> much<00:02:29.940> do<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.150> same<00:02:30.450> thing<00:02:30.690> if

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
just pretty much do the same thing if

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.060 
just pretty much do the same thing if

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
but um I would just suggest gaveling

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.650 
but um I would just suggest gaveling
them<00:02:46.230> that's<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:47.040> safest<00:02:47.550> way<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.760> do<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.120> but

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
them that's the safest way to do it but

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.610 
them that's the safest way to do it but
if<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.810> want<00:02:49.020> to<00:02:49.080> go<00:02:49.140> ahead<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.500> keep

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
if you want to go ahead and keep

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.290 
if you want to go ahead and keep
shooting<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.190> trying<00:02:50.490> to<00:02:50.610> get<00:02:50.880> more<00:02:51.060> points

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
shooting and trying to get more points

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.900 
shooting and trying to get more points
than<00:02:51.450> go<00:02:51.810> ahead<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.290> do<00:02:52.350> that<00:02:52.670> also<00:02:53.670> one<00:02:53.880> thing

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
than go ahead and do that also one thing

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.510 
than go ahead and do that also one thing
I<00:02:54.150> want<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.300> say<00:02:54.360> is<00:02:54.690> do<00:02:54.989> not<00:02:55.140> get<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.470> nuke<00:02:55.830> if

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.540 
I want to say is do not get a nuke if
you<00:02:56.670> see<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:56.940> nuke<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.530> I<00:02:58.530> just<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.370> just

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
you see the nuke and I just you just

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.250 
you see the nuke and I just you just
want<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.790> leave<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.120> because<00:03:00.360> honestly<00:03:00.780> you're

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
want to leave it because honestly you're

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.290 
want to leave it because honestly you're
just<00:03:01.290> gonna<00:03:01.500> lose<00:03:02.220> so<00:03:02.489> many<00:03:02.580> more<00:03:02.820> points<00:03:03.180> do

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
just gonna lose so many more points do

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.940 
just gonna lose so many more points do
you<00:03:03.360> get<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:03.690> many<00:03:03.750> more<00:03:03.989> points<00:03:04.470> instead<00:03:04.739> of

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
you get so many more points instead of

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.560 
you get so many more points instead of
just<00:03:05.670> getting<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:06.000> new<00:03:06.120> because<00:03:06.360> you<00:03:06.450> only

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
just getting the new because you only

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.790 
just getting the new because you only
get<00:03:06.720> four<00:03:06.930> hundred<00:03:06.959> points<00:03:07.320> for<00:03:07.470> getting<00:03:07.739> a

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
get four hundred points for getting a

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.840 
get four hundred points for getting a
nuke<00:03:07.980> you<00:03:08.100> don't<00:03:08.250> get<00:03:08.370> any<00:03:08.489> points<00:03:08.700> for

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
nuke you don't get any points for

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.900 
nuke you don't get any points for
killing<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.270> zombies<00:03:09.660> with<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.930> nuke<00:03:10.080> so

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
killing the zombies with the nuke so

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.220 
killing the zombies with the nuke so
basically<00:03:11.910> if<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.150> see<00:03:12.300> a<00:03:12.330> nuke<00:03:12.570> maybe<00:03:12.930> wait

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
basically if you see a nuke maybe wait

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.320 
basically if you see a nuke maybe wait
until<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.650> end<00:03:13.890> of<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.280> round<00:03:14.489> until<00:03:15.150> there's

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
until the end of the round until there's

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.820 
until the end of the round until there's
no<00:03:15.510> zombies<00:03:15.900> doesn't<00:03:16.260> get<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.440> nuke<00:03:16.620> if

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
no zombies doesn't get the nuke if

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.830 
no zombies doesn't get the nuke if
that's<00:03:17.220> possible<00:03:17.430> or<00:03:17.910> just<00:03:18.480> leave<00:03:18.660> it<00:03:18.690> alone

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
that's possible or just leave it alone

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.090 
that's possible or just leave it alone
so<00:03:18.989> that<00:03:19.320> way<00:03:19.410> you<00:03:19.500> can<00:03:19.620> get<00:03:19.709> more<00:03:19.920> points

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
so that way you can get more points

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.320 
so that way you can get more points
because<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.519> nuke<00:03:20.670> lonely<00:03:20.910> gives<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.150> four

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
because the nuke lonely gives you four

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.670 
because the nuke lonely gives you four
hundred<00:03:21.540> points<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:21.989> it<00:03:22.080> just<00:03:22.260> gets<00:03:22.410> rid<00:03:22.620> of

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
hundred points and it just gets rid of

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.530 
hundred points and it just gets rid of
all<00:03:22.860> zombies<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.489> you<00:03:23.850> could<00:03:24.000> have<00:03:24.090> gotten<00:03:24.239> so

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
all zombies and you could have gotten so

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.090 
all zombies and you could have gotten so
many<00:03:24.630> more<00:03:24.810> points<00:03:25.230> if<00:03:25.380> you<00:03:25.500> just<00:03:25.709> didn't<00:03:26.010> get

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
many more points if you just didn't get

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.220 
many more points if you just didn't get
the<00:03:26.160> nuke<00:03:26.400> so<00:03:27.390> another<00:03:27.750> thing<00:03:27.870> I<00:03:28.049> would<00:03:28.200> like

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
the nuke so another thing I would like

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.750 
the nuke so another thing I would like
to<00:03:28.350> say<00:03:28.590> is<00:03:28.830> you<00:03:28.860> want<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.280> keep<00:03:29.370> gavel

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
to say is you want to keep gavel

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.660 
to say is you want to keep gavel
knuckling<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.360> the<00:03:30.660> Nova<00:03:31.590> crawlers<00:03:32.010> every

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
knuckling and the Nova crawlers every

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.840 
knuckling and the Nova crawlers every
single<00:03:32.820> round<00:03:33.390> on<00:03:33.570> round<00:03:33.840> 5<00:03:34.080> 10<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.769> then<00:03:35.250> 15

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
single round on round 5 10 and then 15

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.420 
single round on round 5 10 and then 15
there's<00:03:36.090> still<00:03:36.330> one<00:03:36.600> hit<00:03:36.810> but<00:03:37.260> one<00:03:37.980> thing<00:03:38.220> I

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
there's still one hit but one thing I

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.880 
there's still one hit but one thing I
would<00:03:38.820> like<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:38.940> say<00:03:39.269> is<00:03:39.630> that<00:03:39.660> galvanic<00:03:40.530> holes

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
would like to say is that galvanic holes

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.400 
would like to say is that galvanic holes
are<00:03:41.040> no<00:03:41.280> longer<00:03:41.580> a<00:03:41.850> one<00:03:42.060> hit<00:03:42.269> at<00:03:42.420> around<00:03:42.600> 15<00:03:43.140> to

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
are no longer a one hit at around 15 to

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.009 
are no longer a one hit at around 15 to
normal<00:03:44.040> zombies<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.670> also<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.090> lose<00:03:45.420> jug<00:03:45.750> pro

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
normal zombies and also you lose jug pro

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.440 
normal zombies and also you lose jug pro
at<00:03:46.230> around<00:03:46.410> 15<00:03:46.950> so<00:03:47.580> before<00:03:47.820> you<00:03:48.000> get<00:03:48.209> to<00:03:48.330> round

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
at around 15 so before you get to round

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.530 
at around 15 so before you get to round
15<00:03:48.989> I<00:03:49.320> would<00:03:49.739> definitely<00:03:49.890> suggest<00:03:50.340> going<00:03:51.060> to
