00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 And then everything is quiet today, I'm going to tell 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.549
 a little about how I gained weight and my 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.549
 evolution after surgery 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.630
 the day this video is being played. 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.730
 been released almost six months 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.310
 since my surgery they were more than 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.779
 46 pounds eliminated stopping to think 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.240
 about everything I've been through the past 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.400
 years all the constraints to 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.019
 difficulty of the moments in which I already 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.830
 had given up completely on me 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.239
 take care 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.760
 I see that today I'm having a second 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.290
 chance a second chance to fix 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.600
 the mistakes I made with my health 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.579
 that with my body in the last three 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.079
 years that was the period in which I gained 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.579
 63 kg 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.520
 three years ago when I was in the third 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.500
 year of high school did not weigh 116 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.850
 because it is not too serious for a 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.789
 person of my height 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.670
 at the time my sister and mass index 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.100
 body weight was 30.51 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.260
 which according to the mc table eu 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.809
 in the category of mild obesity 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.119
 but at that time I was not sedentary 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.860
 I practiced sports every day and 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.930
 despite being chubby, had some 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.030
 but I decided that I wanted to 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.170
 I lost weight and started running on the beach 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.630
 every day 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.030
 in the beginning it was almost sad I was running 20 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.840
 was tired and walked to 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.270
 rest 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.490
 ran 20 meters more and getting tired and 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.439
 walked to rest every day 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.540
 I could run a little bit by 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.890
 more and so gradually until 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.350
 get behind the flemish 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.780
 whole at the end of a month running 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.159
 every day I had already lost 16 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.140
 pounds and with 100 kilos my imc was 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.280
 26.3 because they no longer placed the category 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.189
 overweight 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.810
 almost in my ideal weight 100 kilos was the 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.700
 the lowest I've ever been since 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.310
 I followed my weight but I already 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.960
 I was on the run every day and 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.090
 I did not even divert myself 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.380
 compensated in exercise on the days when 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.090
 I ate more bullshit 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.790
 What happened to make me 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.500
 let go enough to fatten 63 kilos and 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.460
 to get morbidly obese 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.650
 besides the genetic predisposition 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.570
 I was a victim of what in my opinion is 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.179
 the worst enemy of anyone 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.830
 depression at that time when he was in the 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.390
 peak of my healthy life 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.040
 I lost my mother in an accident 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.120
 This bus changed my life. 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.459
 radically 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.560
 soon after I went to live alone with 19 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.750
 years what the 19-year-old does 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.520
 living alone with a depression over 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.709
 the rope does not talk to anyone 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.560
 well basically I eat bullshit the day 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.020
 whole every day without exception 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.880
 This is not to mention the absurdities of more than 20 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.870
 liters of coca cola I took for 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.250
 week 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.440
 I do not know how you did not develop a 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.540
 diabetes a strong gastritis at this time 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.610
 I still tried to do some exercises 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.920
 in the gym since he was living far away 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.880
 of the beach but the sedentary lifestyle was 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.890
 strong that I 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.150
 I did not even think about doing the 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.280
 bariatric surgery 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.050
 so with many people I thought 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.910
 was an easier way out than people 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.260
 They tried to pack to lose weight. 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.570
 I kept remembering the time when 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.190
 It happened on the beach and they talked to me. 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.290
 I managed to lose weight alone without 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.030
 surgery and that I should not try to take 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.000
 the easier way I should take 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.140
 shame in the face and do the exercises 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.579
 in short, I was prejudiced by myself 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.690
 even per second 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.850
 but when a college colleague 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.680
 I decided to do the surgery. 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.959
 I personally want something cool. 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.940
 I changed my concepts, I talked 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.560
 a lot with this my friend and did all the 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.510
 Questions that I had in my head 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.220
 despite the fear of having surgery that 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.079
 I would change my life forever 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.420
 I took the initiative and went behind a 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.160
 doctor I think my biggest fear before 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.590
 of surgery was not even happening 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.329
 something I die my biggest fear 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.950
 I could never eat the things I 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.290
 I liked to eat all the time. 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.570
 Look at the fat head anyway. 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.850
 few months after the first consultation 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.440
 I was already starting a marked day 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.190
 now that I've counted a thousand before 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.350
 surgery 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.680
 Let's talk about the after this time. 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.209
 I'm weighing about 117 pounds. 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.709
 that takes me back to the weight I 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.900
 I had at the time I started running 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.790
 now more than ever I see 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.590
 very clearly to such a second chance 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.510
 but everything has a price 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.829
 and to me the worst of all is the excess of 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.359
 skin that stays after people 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.390
 will not get much into this 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.740
 topic now this theme for another video 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.780
 but it is something that gives a certain 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.950
 discouraged no matter how we return to 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.930
 fit in clothes 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.100
 without them the story is different and not always 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.990
 so nice 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.700
 still this is no reason to 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.230
 give up doing surgery 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.480
 Anyway, we have plastic for 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.030
 then just fix it we have 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.560
 patience and wait for the minimum two years 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.310
 recommended for surgery 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.080
 restorative 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.210
 What bothers me the most about 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.640
 excess skin is knowing that when you had 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.740
 117 that the anti-fattening 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.990
 I was slimmer than I am today 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.820
 even weighing the same thing but staying 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.590
 thinking about the negative side does not help in 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.970
 Nothing, then I'd rather think that I 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.370
 I'm much better than six months ago. 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.180
 ago when I completed five months of 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.380
 surgery 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.660
 My doctor released me to do 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.850
 activities with impact I came back soon 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.460
 running is exactly like the one in 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.280
 again I run a little tired the 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.169
 way to rest for a little tired 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.580
 way to rest but there is only 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.680
 happiness that I finally have 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.120
 Being able to run again is already worth it. 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.919
 and I know that I am soon going okay 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.660
 getting the whole run again 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.800
 for who could not even climb a 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.790
 right ladder 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.890
 I'm very happy with my 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.750
 physical conditioning now 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.400
 the most awaited moment has arrived is my 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.720
 first before and after and after 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.450
 do surgery 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.400
 This was the one with 163 pounds 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.530
 It's hard to believe that I was 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.030
 size is amazing how we get 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.250
 Look in the mirror every day. 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.990
 You realize how gained the plug only 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.310
 fell when we look at an old photo 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.640
 or something like that 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.900
 good now this is me today with 117 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.300
 pounds 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.310
 the difference is quite large despite the 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.450
 belly is a little fallen could be good 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.740
 worse 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.479
 now I have to keep doing 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.520
 all that is within my reach to 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:46.740
 decrease sagging how to ingest 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.300
 collagen-rich foods to use 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.700
 moisturizer to keep the skin 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.169
 hydrated with two years of surgery 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.580
 We 'll see if you really need to 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.169
 remedial or not 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.360
 to close this video I wanted 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.740
 leave two questions for you to answer 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.860
 below in comments 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.210
 the first question is or was your 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.940
 greater fear of surgery 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.800
 varied as I said my biggest fear 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.440
 was that he could no longer eat bullshit 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.240
 I ate my 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.400
 of surgery then I thought that never again 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.570
 would be happy to eat more things 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.100
 I saw that I was wrong. 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.300
 Nowadays I 'm already eating everything and 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.110
 sometimes it does not even seem like I made the 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.480
 surgery 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.280
 The second question is what bothers you the most. 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.930
 after surgery 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.940
 besides the excess skin that I already spoke 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.500
 something that bothers me a lot until 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.290
 which brown had medium before swallowing 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.060
 this is necessary because as a remedy 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.550
 passes very fast by our way 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.870
 whole it will not be well absorbed 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.460
 by our body 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.830
 but I have a tip to help you with 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.180
 This morning every morning I take the 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.280
 kogut remedies 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.440
 I put the whole medicine in my mouth and 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.840
 but thiago cocks an ass and can not feel it 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.060
 the taste of medicine is the tip is that 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.290
