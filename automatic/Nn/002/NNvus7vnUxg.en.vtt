00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
pretty high I think that's a little bit

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.430 
pretty high I think that's a little bit
optimistic<00:03:19.459> as<00:03:19.970> well<00:03:20.090> myself<00:03:20.329> because<00:03:20.720> myself

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
optimistic as well myself because myself

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.020 
optimistic as well myself because myself

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
and Jason Mills going completely other

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.330 
and Jason Mills going completely other
way<00:03:23.269> and<00:03:23.840> we're<00:03:24.019> going<00:03:24.230> to<00:03:24.290> city<00:03:24.590> minus<00:03:25.099> point

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
way and we're going to city minus point

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.699 
way and we're going to city minus point
75<00:03:25.819> in<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.090> Aegean<00:03:26.329> handicap<00:03:26.750> market<00:03:27.200> and

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
75 in the Aegean handicap market and

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.460 
75 in the Aegean handicap market and
that's<00:03:27.889> a<00:03:28.129> 1.86<00:03:29.030> or<00:03:29.510> 12<00:03:29.720> bit<00:03:29.930> at<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:30.139> moment

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
that's a 1.86 or 12 bit at the moment

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.140 
that's a 1.86 or 12 bit at the moment
and<00:03:30.590> I<00:03:30.709> think<00:03:31.160> that's<00:03:31.340> much<00:03:31.609> more<00:03:31.910> reasonable

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
and I think that's much more reasonable

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.030 
and I think that's much more reasonable
certainly<00:03:33.019> that's<00:03:33.230> where<00:03:33.500> my<00:03:33.620> money's<00:03:33.889> going
