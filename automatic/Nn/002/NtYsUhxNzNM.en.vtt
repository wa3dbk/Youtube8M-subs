00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
since they were born they've been living

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.440 
since they were born they've been living
at<00:02:25.079> altitude<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.670> probably<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.880> aerobic

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
at altitude and probably the aerobic

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.420 
at altitude and probably the aerobic
capacity<00:02:27.600> that<00:02:28.140> they<00:02:28.200> developed<00:02:28.799> over<00:02:29.310> their

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
capacity that they developed over their

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.569 
capacity that they developed over their
life<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:30.120> something<00:02:30.780> that's<00:02:31.019> that's<00:02:31.650> it's

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
life is something that's that's it's

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.789 
life is something that's that's it's
just<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.910> tremendous<00:02:33.600> advantage<00:02:33.810> they<00:02:34.680> are

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
just a tremendous advantage they are

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.580 
just a tremendous advantage they are
training<00:02:35.780> before<00:02:36.780> they're<00:02:36.989> really<00:02:37.140> even

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
training before they're really even

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.680 
training before they're really even
involved<00:02:38.070> in<00:02:38.190> running<00:02:38.340> as<00:02:38.609> a<00:02:38.640> sport<00:02:39.030> they<00:02:39.630> are

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
involved in running as a sport they are

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.500 
involved in running as a sport they are
training<00:02:40.019> because<00:02:40.410> they<00:02:41.070> run<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.579> walk<00:02:41.790> in

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
training because they run and walk in

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.670 
training because they run and walk in
order<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.870> get<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.109> where<00:02:43.230> they<00:02:43.350> have<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.650> go

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
order to get to where they have to go

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.440 
order to get to where they have to go
there's<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.400> lot<00:02:44.549> of<00:02:44.579> talk<00:02:44.850> about<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.269> fact

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
there's a lot of talk about the fact

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.000 
there's a lot of talk about the fact
that<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.780> Africans<00:02:46.140> are<00:02:46.200> born<00:02:46.410> at<00:02:46.560> altitude

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
that the Africans are born at altitude

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.470 
that the Africans are born at altitude
in<00:02:47.100> ways<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.549> was<00:02:47.670> shooting<00:02:47.850> trained<00:02:48.329> at

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
in ways that I was shooting trained at

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.310 
in ways that I was shooting trained at
altitude<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.170> run<00:02:50.510> 10<00:02:51.510> miles<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:52.049> and<00:02:52.200> from

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
altitude and run 10 miles to and from

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.530 
altitude and run 10 miles to and from
school<00:02:52.380> every<00:02:52.680> day<00:02:52.950> which<00:02:53.700> isn't<00:02:53.910> true<00:02:54.209> I

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
school every day which isn't true I

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.020 
school every day which isn't true I
asked<00:02:55.140> them<00:02:55.380> they<00:02:55.530> say<00:02:55.739> no<00:02:55.920> we<00:02:56.100> get<00:02:56.280> get<00:02:56.880> in<00:02:56.970> the

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
asked them they say no we get get in the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.750 
asked them they say no we get get in the
car<00:02:57.269> get<00:02:57.570> not<00:02:57.750> bus<00:02:57.989> but<00:02:58.920> there's<00:02:59.459> just<00:02:59.670> this

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
car get not bus but there's just this

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.860 
car get not bus but there's just this
aura<00:03:00.060> about<00:03:00.209> them

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.369 

a<00:03:05.450> lot<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.480> people<00:03:07.190> that<00:03:08.599> get<00:03:09.599> intimidated<00:03:10.260> by

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
a lot of people that get intimidated by

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.130 
a lot of people that get intimidated by
them<00:03:10.620> or<00:03:10.739> watch<00:03:11.430> too<00:03:12.000> closely<00:03:12.299> well<00:03:12.930> know<00:03:13.080> too

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
them or watch too closely well know too

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.949 
them or watch too closely well know too
much<00:03:13.409> about<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:13.769> think<00:03:14.549> that<00:03:15.090> they<00:03:15.269> can't<00:03:15.780> race

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
much about it think that they can't race

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.089 
much about it think that they can't race
against<00:03:16.349> them<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:16.920> gun<00:03:17.099> goes<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.610> they<00:03:17.760> I

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
against them so the gun goes and they I

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.410 
against them so the gun goes and they I
suppose<00:03:20.099> they're<00:03:20.280> already<00:03:20.430> beaten<00:03:20.819> I<00:03:21.000> would

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
suppose they're already beaten I would

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.850 
suppose they're already beaten I would
line<00:03:21.569> up<00:03:21.599> in<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:21.900> race<00:03:22.079> to<00:03:22.110> try<00:03:22.379> and<00:03:22.500> win<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.620> that

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
line up in a race to try and win it that

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.160 
line up in a race to try and win it that
was<00:03:22.980> what<00:03:23.129> I<00:03:23.159> thought<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.519> rules<00:03:23.730> were<00:03:24.170> gun

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
was what I thought the rules were gun

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.649 
was what I thought the rules were gun
goes<00:03:25.440> try<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.310> win<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.489> race<00:03:26.670> there's<00:03:27.420> not

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
goes try and win the race there's not

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:28.910 
goes try and win the race there's not
many<00:03:27.780> of<00:03:27.930> me<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.319> there's<00:03:28.409> a<00:03:28.530> hell<00:03:28.650> of<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.799> lot

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
many of me and there's a hell of a lot

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.640 
many of me and there's a hell of a lot
of<00:03:28.950> them<00:03:29.159> so<00:03:29.970> there<00:03:30.450> are<00:03:30.720> more<00:03:31.019> of<00:03:31.049> an<00:03:31.200> anomaly

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
of them so there are more of an anomaly

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.960 
of them so there are more of an anomaly
than<00:03:31.829> they<00:03:31.950> are<00:03:32.129> they<00:03:32.310> probably<00:03:32.549> standing<00:03:32.879> on

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
than they are they probably standing on

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:40.449 
than they are they probably standing on
the<00:03:33.060> start<00:03:33.269> like<00:03:33.420> worried<00:03:33.659> about<00:03:33.840> big<00:03:34.290> mazinga

a<00:04:24.700> full<00:04:25.030> range<00:04:25.240> of<00:04:25.450> motion

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.159 

we<00:04:30.740> got<00:04:30.889> into<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.160> nike<00:04:31.460> lab<00:04:31.639> today<00:04:31.850> to<00:04:32.330> get<00:04:33.110> my

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
we got into the nike lab today to get my

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.050 
we got into the nike lab today to get my
foot<00:04:33.440> molded<00:04:33.860> and<00:04:34.010> to<00:04:34.520> add<00:04:34.669> the<00:04:34.820> attempt

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
foot molded and to add the attempt

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.180 
foot molded and to add the attempt
custom-made<00:04:35.540> spikes<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:36.229> shoes<00:04:36.290> which<00:04:36.800> I

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
custom-made spikes and shoes which I

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.090 
custom-made spikes and shoes which I
think<00:04:37.880> for<00:04:38.060> me<00:04:38.210> a<00:04:38.449> mental<00:04:39.350> advantage<00:04:39.470> over<00:04:39.919> a

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
think for me a mental advantage over a

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.439 
think for me a mental advantage over a
lot<00:04:40.340> of<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.460> other<00:04:40.580> athletes<00:04:40.970> I'm<00:04:41.120> competing

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
lot of the other athletes I'm competing

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:42.879 
lot of the other athletes I'm competing
against<00:04:41.930> because<00:04:42.139> it<00:04:42.229> the<00:04:42.320> level<00:04:42.590> that<00:04:42.680> that

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
against because it the level that that

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:44.890 
against because it the level that that
we<00:04:43.310> train<00:04:43.550> and<00:04:43.729> race<00:04:43.850> I<00:04:44.270> think<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:44.720> major

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
we train and race I think the major

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.540 
we train and race I think the major
difference<00:04:45.350> is<00:04:45.470> the<00:04:45.590> way<00:04:45.710> you<00:04:45.770> mentally<00:04:46.430> you

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
difference is the way you mentally you

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.490 
difference is the way you mentally you
approach<00:04:46.850> it<00:04:46.880> if<00:04:47.570> they<00:04:47.720> see<00:04:47.780> me<00:04:47.990> on<00:04:48.199> the<00:04:48.260> start

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
approach it if they see me on the start

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.570 
approach it if they see me on the start
line<00:04:48.560> with<00:04:48.830> a<00:04:48.860> pair<00:04:49.100> of<00:04:49.130> shoes<00:04:49.370> that<00:04:49.400> they

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
line with a pair of shoes that they

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.770 
line with a pair of shoes that they
haven't<00:04:49.820> got<00:04:50.000> that<00:04:51.520> look<00:04:52.520> good<00:04:52.729> and<00:04:52.970> they<00:04:53.570> look

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
haven't got that look good and they look

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.710 
haven't got that look good and they look
fast<00:04:54.050> then<00:04:54.440> they<00:04:54.830> want<00:04:55.040> to<00:04:55.100> shoot<00:04:55.310> you<00:04:55.370> know

looks like they their feet have been in

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.920 
looks like they their feet have been in
the<00:05:35.720> weight<00:05:35.870> room<00:05:35.900> so<00:05:36.620> we<00:05:36.889> developed<00:05:37.280> a<00:05:38.120> shoe

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
the weight room so we developed a shoe

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.980 
the weight room so we developed a shoe
that<00:05:39.610> allows<00:05:40.610> your<00:05:40.880> feet<00:05:41.090> to<00:05:41.210> behave<00:05:41.660> as<00:05:41.960> if

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
that allows your feet to behave as if

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.890 
that allows your feet to behave as if
they<00:05:42.500> had<00:05:42.830> no<00:05:42.979> shoes<00:05:43.160> on<00:05:43.340> at<00:05:43.550> all<00:05:43.700> I<00:05:44.030> always<00:05:44.660> say

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
they had no shoes on at all I always say

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.409 
they had no shoes on at all I always say
I<00:05:44.930> hope<00:05:45.289> that<00:05:45.470> I<00:05:45.560> shoes<00:05:45.860> give<00:05:46.729> this<00:05:46.910> much<00:05:47.150> but<00:05:47.389> i

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
I hope that I shoes give this much but i

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:49.180 
I hope that I shoes give this much but i
have<00:05:47.750> to<00:05:47.870> give<00:05:48.020> most<00:05:48.380> of<00:05:48.530> the<00:05:48.620> credit<00:05:48.770> i<00:05:49.010> think

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
have to give most of the credit i think

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.440 
have to give most of the credit i think
to<00:05:49.250> the<00:05:49.370> athletes<00:05:49.700> and<00:05:49.910> their<00:05:50.030> training<00:05:50.389> in

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
to the athletes and their training in

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:58.129 
to the athletes and their training in
their<00:05:50.539> hard<00:05:50.750> work

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.399 

we<00:05:58.710> do<00:05:58.860> a<00:05:58.889> lot<00:05:59.039> of<00:05:59.099> work<00:05:59.419> in<00:06:00.419> the<00:06:00.569> gym<00:06:00.749> as<00:06:01.139> cross

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:01.409 
we do a lot of work in the gym as cross

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:03.080 
we do a lot of work in the gym as cross
training<00:06:01.439> I<00:06:01.889> suppose<00:06:02.159> this<00:06:02.370> there's<00:06:02.729> only<00:06:02.849> so

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
training I suppose this there's only so

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.059 
training I suppose this there's only so
much<00:06:03.210> running<00:06:03.449> that<00:06:03.629> you<00:06:03.719> can<00:06:03.900> do<00:06:04.050> so<00:06:04.590> there's

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:05.069 
much running that you can do so there's

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:06.529 
much running that you can do so there's
other<00:06:05.249> areas<00:06:05.669> your<00:06:05.789> core<00:06:06.060> and<00:06:06.419> your

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
other areas your core and your

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:08.450 
other areas your core and your
midsection<00:06:07.229> and<00:06:07.529> stuff<00:06:07.770> that<00:06:07.800> needs<00:06:08.189> to<00:06:08.340> be

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
midsection and stuff that needs to be
