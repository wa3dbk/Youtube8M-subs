00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
and for an example Alexander Ovechkin so

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.060 
and for an example Alexander Ovechkin so
fast<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.280> snipes<00:01:20.610> 60<00:01:21.270> goals<00:01:21.510> of<00:01:21.690> season<00:01:22.070> 5550

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
fast and snipes 60 goals of season 5550

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.730 
fast and snipes 60 goals of season 5550
whatever<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.640> that's<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.690> key<00:01:24.840> thing<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.439> you

whatever and that's a key thing and you
got<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.979> go<00:01:26.040> really<00:01:26.220> fast<00:01:26.490> when<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.909> want<00:01:27.030> to

like that like Hank the tank did and

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.310 
like that like Hank the tank did and
stipe<00:01:52.439> goal<00:01:52.799> it's<00:01:53.610> easy<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.990> know<00:01:55.140> if<00:01:55.259> you

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
stipe goal it's easy but you know if you

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.980 
stipe goal it's easy but you know if you
don't<00:01:55.500> go<00:01:55.740> down<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.189> an<00:01:56.340> angle<00:01:56.850> then<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.930> suggest

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
don't go down on an angle then I suggest

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.230 
don't go down on an angle then I suggest
you<00:01:58.470> just<00:01:58.650> do<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> whole<00:01:59.100> bunch<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.610> moves<00:01:59.880> and

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
you just do a whole bunch of moves and

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.929 
you just do a whole bunch of moves and
if<00:02:01.200> you're<00:02:01.439> left-handed<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:02.280> always<00:02:02.579> suggest

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
if you're left-handed I always suggest

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.569 
if you're left-handed I always suggest
you<00:02:03.360> go<00:02:03.479> back<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.829> because<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.130> goalie<00:02:05.310> won't

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
you go back and because the goalie won't

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.910 
you go back and because the goalie won't
expect<00:02:05.970> it<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:07.320> just<00:02:07.439> gotta<00:02:07.649> pretend

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
expect it and you just gotta pretend

you're<00:02:08.040> going<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.220> go<00:02:08.310> for<00:02:08.549> hand<00:02:08.759> then<00:02:08.910> you

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
you're going to go for hand then you

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.610 
you're going to go for hand then you
quickly<00:02:09.119> go<00:02:09.360> back<00:02:09.540> and<00:02:09.810> write<00:02:10.019> but<00:02:10.769> anyways<00:02:11.459> uh

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.600 
you know when you make your final move
that<00:02:15.780> one<00:02:15.989> final<00:02:16.470> move<00:02:16.650> where<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:16.980> shoot<00:02:17.250> from

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
that one final move where you shoot from

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.990 
that one final move where you shoot from
I<00:02:17.850> suggest<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:18.780> don't<00:02:18.989> make<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.560> like<00:02:20.220> in<00:02:20.459> the

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
I suggest you don't make it like in the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.789 
I suggest you don't make it like in the
crease<00:02:21.299> always<00:02:21.720> shoot<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.019> before<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.530> crease

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
crease always shoot it before the crease

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:23.510 
crease always shoot it before the crease
go

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
go

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.030 
go
if<00:02:23.820> you<00:02:24.060> shoot<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.510> in<00:02:24.690> decreasing<00:02:25.350> almost

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
if you shoot it in decreasing almost

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.920 
if you shoot it in decreasing almost
like<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.310> right<00:02:26.490> here<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:26.760> almost<00:02:27.480> missed

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
like that right here I almost missed

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.220 
like that right here I almost missed
because<00:02:28.740> I<00:02:28.890> went<00:02:29.100> in<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.520> crease<00:02:29.790> kinda<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.480> I

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230
