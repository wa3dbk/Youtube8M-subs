 well thank you very much for the invitation and 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.400
 enlisted all trying this new 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.160
 100% electric vehicle without your exhaust 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.530
 although it does not emit any emission of co2 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.199
 to the environment in this vehicle already has 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.600
 mass production worldwide is 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.010
 sold more than 30,000 units Spain and 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.260
 the other countries are the big ones 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.649
 consumers of this type of vehicle and 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.749
 our brand nissan leaf and for 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.359
 Colombia is a very interesting market 

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:51.800
 for several reasons because the generation 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:54.860
 electric in colombia is very clean 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.649
 further strengthens the entire process of 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.120
 vehicles since its generation 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.449
 consumption and final disposal of the product 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.210
 is environmentally friendly and for 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.520
 colombia well we are a little bit to the 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.310
 wait for the conditions 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.670
 from the governmental point of view and 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.110
 sectoral so that they actually 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:19.070
 these suits in these conditions should 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.380
 be the government and the sector have the 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.229
 greater amount and 102 so that the 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.509
 final consumer the Colombian said 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.100
 the equipment good luck for 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.890
 me being this year has been very very 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.700
 interesting show 65 percent 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.799
 last year 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.120
 however looking for the sector has not 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:42.700
 grown against last year 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.700
 the comparison did not happen strange 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.420
 10 of the loans growths well 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:51.030
 important being the best years for 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.159
 the industry vehicles this year is a 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.920
 year that is very good also for 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.209
 us the brands but it has not grown 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.420
 so much we hope that they decide if not 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:05.579
 we have great surprises we have 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.299
 our new house that would come to be 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.299
 present in society 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:24.079
 we have also we are going to no change 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:35.440
 for car people 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.909
 super this portal and we wait for you 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.209
 of automobile health in Colombia 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:42.940
 good many thanks for this 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.250
 interview let's do a little 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.819
 introduction to what is the part 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.700
 mechanics 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.849
 the nissan leaf to start this is a 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.069
 hundred percent electric vehicle 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:57.560
 we have an 80 kilowatt motor 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:01.579
 power and is the target to horses of 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:06.079
 force translates 107 horsepower 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:07.879
 the big difference of this this engine is 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.340
 that I'm going to have a linear torque a 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:12.139
 direct torque what does this mean that 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.819
 from the moment I have incentive 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:16.310
 the vehicle and I'm going to start accelerating 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.650
 I have available the 80 kilowatts that 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.040
 translates into this an acceleration 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.230
 immediate 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.670
 It is a vehicle with all the systems of 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:29.510
 Safety eight air bags ABS brakes 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.670
 the traction control and put the 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.920
 all the safety implements to the 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.370
 Agenda load times 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.910
 I have different options to call them 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.790
 A) Yes 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.410
 the fast charge that can be considered 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.910
 It is serious 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.980
 at a voltage of 440 and the vehicle 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.830
 being practically at zero percent 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.050
 of battery charge would take about 28 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.460
 minutes integrates 80% of the 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.100
 capacity capabilities of the 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:05.960
 fast download batteries 440 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.680
 it's a connector a bit more robust than 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:13.030
 the vehicle 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:17.289
 the other loading mode would be 220 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:20.229
 240 for a time of 8 hours of charging 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:22.150
 of the batteries and the option that we have 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:26.020
 It is a portable charger as incredible 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.900
 said the vehicle weighs 110 120 that would be 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.360
 for a time from zero to 21 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.460
 load hours because success with test is 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.889
 total in this vehicle 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:40.389
 because we already have is to enter 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:42.280
 on the chip it's going from his hand 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.750
 with the environment say a little 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.300
 ecological in our style of 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.889
 driving acceptance in different 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.750
 market blocks has been complete 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:55.720
 call europe fears states and 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.990
 economies in deposit then to the hundred percent 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.720
 I forget about filters 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.240
 fuel air filters and only 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.430
 I have to think is in pills 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.699
 brake as in any vehicle 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.289
 alignment and bullets wait displayed on the 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.870
 car show do not do our 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:16.330
 our toy our spoiled child 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.860
 then the invitation is to all 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.470
 public to come close to what 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.470
 know to ask him to inquire 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.509
 so that here in Colombia and we all 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.030
 let's get into the subject of vehicles 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:30.389
 electric and welcome here when 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.389
 want
