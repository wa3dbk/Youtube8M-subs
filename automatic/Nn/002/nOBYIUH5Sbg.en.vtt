00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.470 
serious drunk and fall a serious drunk
and<00:03:25.940> fall<00:03:26.180> off<00:03:26.989> that<00:03:27.069> edge<00:03:28.389> that<00:03:29.389> is<00:03:29.420> not<00:03:31.480> and

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
and fall off that edge that is not and

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.970 
and fall off that edge that is not and
i'm<00:03:32.690> going<00:03:32.840> to<00:03:32.900> say<00:03:33.109> with<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.349> glass<00:03:33.620> that's

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
i'm going to say with the glass that's

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.640 
i'm going to say with the glass that's
it's<00:03:34.760> simply<00:03:35.389> so<00:03:35.810> you<00:03:35.870> can<00:03:36.290> be<00:03:37.040> down<00:03:37.340> there

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
it's simply so you can be down there

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.630 
it's simply so you can be down there
looking<00:03:39.650> upward

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.410 

I<00:03:42.750> would<00:03:43.750> say<00:03:43.990> this<00:03:44.230> is<00:03:44.550> poised<00:03:45.550> more<00:03:46.060> for<00:03:46.390> a

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
I would say this is poised more for a

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.230 
I would say this is poised more for a
group<00:03:47.130> goop<00:03:48.360> that's<00:03:50.670> how<00:03:51.670> do<00:03:51.730> you<00:03:51.880> will<00:03:52.060> be

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
group goop that's how do you will be

00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:03.420 
group goop that's how do you will be
hanging<00:03:52.569> on<00:03:52.630> that<00:03:52.690> couch<00:03:53.200> anymore<00:04:02.400> wanting<00:04:03.400> to

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
hanging on that couch anymore wanting to

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.000 
hanging on that couch anymore wanting to
use

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.900 

every<00:04:11.010> room<00:04:11.250> is<00:04:11.310> a<00:04:11.520> new<00:04:11.760> twister<00:04:12.330> game<00:04:13.910> you

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910
