00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
think that because all of the specs are

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.690 
think that because all of the specs are
very<00:01:19.780> important<00:01:20.350> because<00:01:20.590> we've<00:01:21.250> got<00:01:21.430> such<00:01:21.670> a

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
very important because we've got such a

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.410 
very important because we've got such a
