last<00:01:06.470> weekend<00:01:06.980> when<00:01:07.100> they<00:01:07.250> popped<00:01:07.490> up<00:01:07.760> I

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
last weekend when they popped up I

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.880 
last weekend when they popped up I
thought<00:01:09.100> what<00:01:10.100> a<00:01:10.130> perfect<00:01:10.550> time<00:01:10.730> to<00:01:10.850> try<00:01:11.030> these

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.469 

it's<00:01:15.890> mainly<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.550> durability<00:01:17.000> that<00:01:17.420> I

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
it's mainly the durability that I

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.640 
it's mainly the durability that I
believe<00:01:17.900> is<00:01:18.080> gonna<00:01:18.290> be<00:01:18.440> in<00:01:18.590> these<00:01:19.060> personally

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.840 

and<00:01:24.650> all<00:01:24.800> of<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.070> protection<00:01:25.670> that<00:01:25.820> goes

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
and all of the protection that goes

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.110 
and all of the protection that goes
along<00:01:26.210> with<00:01:26.330> it<00:01:26.690> along<00:01:27.470> with<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.920> lightweight

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.660 

and<00:01:32.120> that<00:01:32.540> sole<00:01:32.900> which<00:01:33.800> i<00:01:33.980> think<00:01:34.040> is<00:01:34.310> gonna<00:01:34.460> be

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
and that sole which i think is gonna be

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.470 
and that sole which i think is gonna be
very<00:01:35.920> stable<00:01:38.950> in<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.910> field<00:01:41.150> for<00:01:41.420> the

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480
