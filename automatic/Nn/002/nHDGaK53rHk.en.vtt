00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.259
 today we will do these 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.949
 beautiful flowers that we already have yellow 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.990
 red and lilac 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:25.609
 for example, take yellow for this to us 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:28.470
 need yellow cardboard 2 leaves 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:31.099
 such a stencil can be yourself 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:36.570
 draw i show now how scissors 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:40.739
 glue glitter glitter pencils different 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.890
 i have different colors equal shine for 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.610
 we need to start two 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:54.890
 squares are exactly the same here 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:01:02.969
 A4 sheet to fold the corners are not 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:11.270
 it was visible to be seen and cherry 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:11.270
 cut off we get a square in 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:25.530
 get us now our square we 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:37.140
 fold in half fold and 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:40.890
 we fold again in half turned 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:45.079
 the triangle the triangle here and now we 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.680
 apply our stencil need to attach 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:54.540
 the very bottom and the usual pencil 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:56.509
 draw such two curved lines i 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.619
 I do not remember how geometry is called 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.829
 You can do about it yourself 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.049
 retreat about 2 centimeters above 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:08.509
 Here is the main central . 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.929
 under the top point of the triangle and down 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:15.030
 down without getting down so 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:21.459
 now we need to cut along this line 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:27.549
 we cut this side on the other hand 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:30.370
 we also cut that out 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.019
 I got stencils turned out 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.629
 these snowflakes here which you 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.280
 showed red lilac yellow here 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.989
 I have this trophy flowing you get 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.549
 so many of these stencilic of 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:47.230
 as a result we got this 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:52.030
 figure of the future flower now take 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.799
 simple pencil and draw along the line two 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:01.230
 lines here is one line like this 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:05.469
 about the same from this side too 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:11.439
 arbitrarily the exact same lines 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:12.189
 let's draw it like this and cut it according to this 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:15.669
 lines 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:22.949
 without cutting to the end of course only 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:22.949
 lines of vision neat and second too 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:34.349
 exactly the same on the other side 1 and 2 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:45.219
 now we discover what we do 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.959
 open our flower as we have 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:52.719
 volumetric flower is our one part 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:55.260
 you see our little flowers turned out 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:04:00.730
 such a flower 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:03.430
 now take the average average lobe 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:07.919
 and a little bit here and so out of the corner edge 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.689
 we turn down the average here 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:15.969
 tisine and here and the day now we 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:20.259
 need a place where we turned down 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:26.280
 spread with glue or you can take PV 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:29.320
 it perfectly glues cardboard and is safe and 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:33.250
 We look to the center where our center and to the center 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:36.160
 we glue our petals like this 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:40.110
 the middle one is the middle 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:43.900
 glue we fix for one or two minutes 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:48.750
 enough to stick these here 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.750
 petals so turn down beautifully go 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:05:00.389
 we get one part of our little flower 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:02.980
 so beautiful and doing the same with 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:06.430
 second square 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.430
 our square 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:14.000
 now we need to combine but not 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:17.270
 just a little bit 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.530
 with a shift here shift get here 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.400
 so go beautiful flower for this 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:28.120
 we will smear 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.120
 we can in the middle and our how and 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:38.080
 combine with a slight twist 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.080
 our two halves. 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.190
 give a little bit 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.940
 Here is our flower already dried up and we can 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.650
 it's just a little to embellish it 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:57.370
 yellowish principle yellowish too 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:07:00.849
 okay, let's take a little shine 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:03.849
 say festive close because 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:08.009
 You will decorate the apartment here with me 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:10.539
 there is glitter red gold silver 

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:12.569
 This method will not take the golden 

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:20.919
 probably 

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:25.050
 happiness on glue is beautiful fine 

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:29.190
 glued West smartly 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.190
 you can still decorate 

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.850
 see how we decorated here 

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:43.180
 petals than here a flight of fancy is not 

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:46.449
 limited travel checks you can so here
