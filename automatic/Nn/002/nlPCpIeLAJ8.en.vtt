 that is why he thinks the colors are convenient 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.189
 communicated the study 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.849
 the elite 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.320
 yes no the income tax of people touch the evolution of employment 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.249
 total of badajoz 

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:22.659
 after the shock of them can buy the product this export sector the 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:26.570
 medium-high technology the reported filed 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.590
 exports power tepco this official party newspaper 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.290
 everything you always wanted to know about technology and never dared to 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.450
 ask 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.450
 the languages ​​of the machines 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.570
 let's say that you go down the street and meet China 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.450
 but so be it for celia communicates with me 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.310
 even more prayer 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.340
 2004 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.430
 they are injuries 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.050
 or when one has a dog 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.000
 the dogs do not speak but one can also communicate with them 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.150
 few 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.840
 treaty 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.830
 well, very well 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.830
 What would happen if one meets a computer 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.800
 gago how he told him I tell him 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.200
 gift computer is she the celestial machine can be turned on 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.130
 welcome then coquito second season 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.930
 silvio miranda and from the explora park in Medellín today we will talk about 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.890
 language 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.870
 of machines 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.190
 you suddenly remember that computers were great machines in 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.880
 large rooms that scientists know 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.850
 put 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.909
 well today computers of all sizes ica so we're 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.370
 waiting for them 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.370
 control in the world 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.910
 and safe for you after two seasons of techno coquito because it's more 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:50.909
 easy to understand 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.119
 how is the world inside a computer what it is used for and what 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.479
 all how it is used we have already said many times that inside this box what 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:00.329
 what are they? 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.310
 he got injured 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.790
 there is a photo 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.120
 zeros and ones according to videos 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.639
 steel packers internet 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.739
 I know what I want is for everything severe 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:15.590
 pigs 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.549
 mun2 zeros a few pigs 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.449
 avn 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:25.229
 just as humans communicate with each other using symbols at 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:29.249
 machines they had to invent a very basic code so that they understood 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:32.389
 everything the programmers put them more 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:35.729
 computers are machines that obey orders to solve 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:38.029
 problems 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:39.219
 to turn off 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:41.609
 open close 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.969
 avoid changing size cut 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:47.819
 sea ​​pray in order 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.289
 this language based on numerous eroski ones is called binary language 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:59.159
 then a particular third third combination equals a letter 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:00.039
 of the alphabet 

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:02.489
 like him a century 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.930
 and so the machine understands everything turning it like that the tribunes 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:13.899
 every 0 and 1 the message converted by the machine is a bic 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:17.659
 that's why computers need more and more space to keep the 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:22.540
 information in a century for example five thousand 900 million lives 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.889
 that are 5 thousand 900 million with each other or themselves 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:29.699
 rather it is as if we had all this study no longer want China 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.489
 to see is as if we had fifteen hundred books of 200 pages each 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:37.679
 one 

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:45.069
 in other words, 8 bits are a country and thus a girl are one thousand 73 million 742 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.069
 thousand 824 view 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:52.449
 and that multiplied by eight entities 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.359
 cedice imagine the programmers working with zeros and ones 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.169
 no no no no the programmers who write in the language of the 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:07.529
 computers programs so that this 

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:10.029
 is not an empty box without life 

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:13.089
 yes no the useful computers that are today 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:16.430
 and the programs of the operating system to the programs of 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.109
 office or the internet browser are not written with zeros and ones but 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.159
 with letters and symbols that have an order or logical rules close to the 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:29.689
 mathematics this makes every task that in holland and everything 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:32.689
 in form and algorithms 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.210
 but what is an algorithm 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.580
 an algorithm that is a sum of tasks that result in a solution as a 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.360
 recipe for cooking your first you have the ingredients that are the variables 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.990
 of how the recipe can be 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.599
 then the tasks are performed 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:52.740
 first boil the water 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.499
 then pay for the salt and the pasta 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:58.729
 and then make the sauce mix 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.199
 ready 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:04.199
 Matched it turned out a delicious lunch 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:08.249
 6 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:12.089
 clear that these algorithms are written in a mathematical language that 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:14.700
 surely you and I can not understand 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.400
 because it is a language full of symbols of letters with more equal 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.100
 parentheses brackets 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.120
 squeezed 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.350
 in the end you always have to give the pp 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.870
 so that the machine can solve the algorithm and thus to task after chorea 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.990
 after many hard years the programmer of now writing a program 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.200
 One-eyed harassment is ready for the machine to execute and for us 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:41.309
 that we are the users because we can use it 

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:45.589
 There are also many computer languages ​​as it is already 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:48.999
 ccs 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:50.699
 b and c 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:52.430
 efe cobos 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.729
 all these are languages ​​just like Portuguese, English or Spanish and 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:00.500
 It serves so that one can communicate in different ways with machines or 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.710
 with different objectives 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.710
 there they did not finish they are towel 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.779
 although it seems in other languages ​​ap 

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:13.169
 and so it seems that sometimes the machines are more important are more 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:17.559
 intelligent that we his language is still invented by beings 

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:21.729
 humans so we're far from the era in which robots sound dignified 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:24.509
 6 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:27.810
 remember, we humans are the ones who invented machines and 

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:29.879
 we enjoy them 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:33.899
