00:00:02.998 --> 00:00:05.810
Hello, and welcome to v2 of my Atlantis TAS!

00:00:05.827 --> 00:00:08.827
Please enjoy!

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:16.647
Zones 1-98 have no changes in them.

00:00:20.303 --> 00:00:23.303
However, each transition between stages have a 1 frame improvement.

00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:29.376
1 frame saved!

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:34.035
2 frames saved!

00:00:36.942 --> 00:00:39.942
The key is that this game allows for input from Player 2.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.270
So instead of P1 Pause, Blank Frame, P1 Pause; I can go P1 Pause, P2 Pause.

00:00:46.926 --> 00:00:49.926
This saves a frame every time.

00:00:55.578 --> 00:00:58.578
Kudos to NitroGenesis for discovering this trick.

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.049
Total Saved now: 6 frames

00:01:37.675 --> 00:01:40.675
There are some slight changes here that include killing more enemies for points.

00:01:44.331 --> 00:01:47.331
However there are no frames saved here.

00:01:54.731 --> 00:01:57.731
1 frame saved at the start due to better acceleration thanks to yuigenron.

00:02:00.305 --> 00:02:03.305
I jump here to manipulate the bats that fly at you.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.460
1 frame saved here from better throwing the bomb.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.450
That throw took absolutely forever to do.

00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:21.441
Total time saved: 13 frames (0.21 seconds)

00:02:23.433 --> 00:02:26.433
I hope you have enjoyed!
