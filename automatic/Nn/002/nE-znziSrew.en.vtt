there's<00:00:25.170> some<00:00:25.350> debate<00:00:25.740> as<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.099> whether<00:00:26.430> it's

the chief cause of the death of

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940

hadn't hid and for whatever reason

the<00:01:09.750> dinosaurs<00:01:09.780> would<00:01:10.470> still<00:01:10.950> be<00:01:11.130> around<00:01:11.369> as<00:01:11.729> I

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
the dinosaurs would still be around as I

the dinosaurs would still be around as I
said<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.210> only<00:01:12.840> been<00:01:13.530> half<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.790> period<00:01:15.210> of

there's no reason to think the dinosaurs
