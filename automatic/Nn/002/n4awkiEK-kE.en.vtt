 hello everyone here commands and today I'm going 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.470
 to teach everything you have to do 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.020

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.970
 you have to do is kill a berman 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.850
 catch the pearl that gives killed blaze 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.430
 grab the blaze bar and flick the 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.230
 with fire and good once once 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.420
 done that you will have the eyes understand that 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.370
 is this what I have in my hand after 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.110
 of that you have to find a 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.809
 strength to find a fortress 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.940
 you have to roll your eyes and follow the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.769
 path that mark my mark in this 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.050
 direction as you see the strength is in 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.180
 this address 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.730
 once the site has arrived, what are you going to 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.160
 need is going to be every bar wash and 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.579
 let's say let's say a hole or a tunnel to 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.320
 get to what is the portal room 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.989
 once inside you are going to make sure 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.820
 and clean the entire area so that they have not 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.970
 tests with bugs and bother us 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.650
 nothing 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.110
 once the area is secured what you are going to 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.180
 need is going to be open the portal and 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.080
 ready for it you are going to need 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.490
 twelve eyes of ander and complete all the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.110
 holes that there are 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.180
 by doing this let's say the portal opens 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.950
 and as you see this allows the step towards 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.439
 the dragon but before I felt I was 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.180
 prepared to be well prepared at 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.700
 slow what you are going to need is going to be 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.530
 a good armor is to say helmet and 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.380
 diamond dungarees greg others and all 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.700
 delighted with a good enchantment 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.549
 then you will also need good 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.439
 weapons that are going to be a sword of 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.820
 diamond for example for the sender man 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.580
 since they are always usually there 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.039
 bothering you are going to need a good arc 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.780
 another spare for that case won from the 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.270
 dragon to be able to be one that takes away a lot 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.789
 for without killing it before and that we good 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.640
 problems and many dates in case not 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.619
 you have the infinity spell so 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.020
 you will both have arrows and you will have to 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.209
 spend the then you can also carry 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.250
 emotions that will help you endure and 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.390
 all of that especially those of strength that 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.970
 you will do more damage for a while 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.190
 perfect to kill the last of the dragon 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.780
 vandermark is bothering health 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.510
 snapshot more than anything because the 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.760
 Dragon is 5 ° at a time is very simple 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.459
 power right away options for 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.450
 recover and not lose time as 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.209
 has another pass 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.769
 of the generation just in case they are not so 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.590
 good as instant status 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.720
 they are worse but you can take 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.030
 just in case and speed presence and 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.010
 to escape or allude to the dragon and then 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.220
 others are going to need to take a peak 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.790
 diamond to say let's break blocks of 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.110
 everything and build in a hurry and not 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.000
 waste time 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.950
 then the water cube to move them away from 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.870
 sea ​​that are near or below the 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.670
 towers then the pearls of anders are 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.530
 very important because if they appear at all 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.630
 more start on a kind of platform 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.160
 in the middle of the air the island goes far 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.510
 you will need to throw a just to the 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.190
 floating island before the arrival 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.319
 dragon and I pull you because being and another 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.690
 way you can not use the balls of 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.340
 snow to keep the brothers away 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.560
 back to the dragon so that the dragon of 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.840
 as it turned upon receiving damage 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.880
 of delmas is usually turned then you can 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.650
 use any other easy block of 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.480
 put and fast and destroy to climb the 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.680
 towers as you like, although it is 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.720
 highly recommended with current sell 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.329
 hard apples always come good for 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.360
 the bonuses that give as much for food as 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.950
 for existence and all that and strength and 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.140
 then if you want to distract you can 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:36.390
 put with goals goals of snow 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:39.420
 of snow to the dragon so they take it far and 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.430
 the iron one will prevent it 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.140
 will put to god later that 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.300
 yes it's not for much purposes and that those are going 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.910
 to die after once having the 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.120
 team are going to have to go to the 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.860
 once prepared we skipped the portal to 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.080
 jump our transported the instant 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.760
 to a place of in as you see now I am 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.200
 in the room you can have left a 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.610
 disinfectant something that wants another site 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.200
 in case of action what you have to 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.470
 make it stay here by applying towards 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.470
 above 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.959
 once they arrive, you are going to make 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.910
 destroy all the obsidian towers or 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.010
 pillars of the city that you see since 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.110
 These towers are what give life to 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.670
 dragon and all that the dragon can do 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.290
 several passes to avoid disturbing 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.940
 what you can do to divert it 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.040
 to study the arrows or balls of 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.350
 anything else and that bothers us 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.120
 so much 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.550
 as you will see in slow and much sender 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.160
 man and it's normal so try 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.840
 avoid them you can use pumpkins or 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.780
 it's just those professionals not 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.610
 look at them has been avoiding problems for 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.710
 climb the towers you can use any 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.690
 another block you can use aim or 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.120
 you can have the shovels extend you have 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.890

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.030
 and if you want to upload quickly 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.280
 you can put any block we upload what

 you upload images quickly once 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.520
 stars all the towers what are you going to 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.260
 focus is on taking the dragon's life 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.230
 expand all the arrows you can 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.620
 before he does his past and remove you 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:04.440
 life once the dragon is killed he will do 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.270
 a kind of expression releasing as 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.850
 you see flashes and small explosions 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.130
 while it disintegrates doing this 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.990
 then he will release a home to a large 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.790
 class and will release a lot of experience and 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.550
 under the new one you have killed will appear 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.020
 the portal back to the normal world like 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.020
 you see surrounds the experience with the 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.819
 dragon egg top 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.960
 to get the egg what are you going to 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:26.330
 do what is going to be first 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.740
 hit it up to be transported 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.539
 since this egg to knock each 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.159
 transportation and then in the place that 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:33.349
 I have done something like this 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:35.870
 put a torch under and break the 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:37.729
