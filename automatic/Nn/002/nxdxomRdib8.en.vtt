00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.380
 what's up guys this is the case 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.240
 I hope you are well 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.130
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.840
 new video in which I'm going 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.119
 introduce yourself from a to z 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.369
 my new amazon brand tripod 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.320
 basics because yes it's amazon who 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.670
 did it so let's start right now 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.680
 the video then this tripod or gray design 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.770
 matte with some touches of plastic 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.600
 black provided with a small black bag 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.760
 provided with the shot is with a shoulder strap 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.579
 adjustable practices to take him 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.230
 everywhere with you and the first thing 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.850
 that we notice when we each other 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.750
 or not in hand and well it's its weight 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.190
 tier of 1.3 kg as much tell you he 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.590
 is really but then really very 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.020
 lightweight and to ease handling 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.789
 amazon has everything planned by integrating it 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.890
 wrist on the body of the device 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.979
 very handy to move it where you 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.110
 want to bend the tripod is quite small 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.510
 because it is only 63 cm high 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.280
 and yes cm wide which is very 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.320
 effective if you do not have a lot of 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.600
 place to tidy up before starting 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.759
 to unfold it we will notice the feet 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.850
 anti-slip with ball joints for 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.189
 have a maximum of stabilization so 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.960
 by unfolding it with the clip system 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.299
 you will notice that this tripod 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.720
 has two extensions per foot 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.369
 about 35 cm each so you'll have 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.799
 several levels of different 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.229
 heights the first very low like everything 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.729
 the feet are bent the second down 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.369
 we do voulent lying with 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.229
 first extends the third goes also 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.759
 happy you lie down with only 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.649
 the second lengthens what comes back 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.049
 exactly same as with the first 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.640
 fourth means extension when you 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.530
 the loin and with all the extensions of 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.329
 amazon feet did not stop there 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.180
 she proposes to extend it to 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.460
 about 1 meter 50 sec thanks and a 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.030
 crank located near the handle that 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.770
 lengthen the center column of the tripod 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.110
 little trick if you are sure interests 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.060
 in boots or not perfectly right there 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.220
 you will still be able to 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.650
 shorten or extend one or more 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.180
 feet in order to be right as well as 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.550
 to direct the rotation of the feet 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.920
 anti-slip and that's why amazon 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.170
 equipped this tripod with two levels to 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.940
 belley ain at the level of the head and 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.310
 the other at the level of the course of the tripod 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.170
 which is more than effective also we 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.480
 can see a kind of ring 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.580
 on this central column that allows 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.740
 to discard or bring the feet closer 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.450
 with a kind of screw to block at 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.010
 distance between the feet and just in 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.720
 underneath is hung for 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.820
 hang something heavier 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.310
 like your bag and therefore avoid that the 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.710
 tripod now rocking now let's attack 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.310
 we at the head has not everything I specify from 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.070
 tripod 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.890
 then you have three axes a horizontal 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.830
 360 degree useful for doing 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.530
 panoramic pictures another vertical 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.670
 180 degrees to make it cool 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.560
 to your videos there is another side of 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.640
 90 Â° which can possibly be used to 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.650
 to make pictures in portrait also thanks 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.780
 to this three axes you rots all 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.400
 adjust by blocking them or just the 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.140
 locks for more details 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.860
 there is so set your device as 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.900
 good you seems 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.000
 in addition to all that you also have 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.010
 and luckily I would say no vices 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.989
 detachable from its support to put it 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.360
 your camera and if they have the ass ross 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.040
 webcam logitech its 920 with which 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.450
 I finished my previous videos and I 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.390
 Account much everything has changed in fact be 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.430
 we do not lose too much in the details 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.320
 and to conclude this video the tripod 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.310
 is pretty well finished with a designer toy 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.810
 enough goes everywhere 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.970
 good now as far as the 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.800
 quality of manufacture do you expect 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.600
 not to be well over 100 happy but 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.830
 it remains very correct for its price and 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.840
 where they are caught I did not want to said 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.640
 you may be waiting for a price 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.070
 exorbitant and well no think again 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.959
 because amazon offers for 25 euros 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.690
 only with delivery charges 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.940
 free and so if you're starting out 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.200
 youtube when I can only you 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.660
 recommend this tripod 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.880
 thank you for watching the video remember 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.450
 not react in comments and to 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.019
 the next 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.019
 ciao
