00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
of bloatware and in my opinion it's long

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.039 
of bloatware and in my opinion it's long
you<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.380> learned<00:01:55.619> advice<00:01:55.979> down<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:57.210> have<00:01:57.840> made

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
you just learned advice down I have made

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.380 
you just learned advice down I have made
the<00:01:58.170> video<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.590> how<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.860> disable<00:01:59.310> as<00:01:59.700> ways<00:02:00.210> to

the video on how to disable as ways to
make<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.570> advice<00:02:00.930> faster<00:02:01.439> but<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.159> still<00:02:02.430> do

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
make the advice faster but I still do

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.880 
make the advice faster but I still do
like<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:03.060> risk<00:02:03.329> because<00:02:03.390> it's<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.960> comes<00:02:04.680> with

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
like that risk because it's a comes with

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.310 
like that risk because it's a comes with
so<00:02:05.070> much<00:02:05.189> blood<00:02:05.880> work<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.930> don't<00:02:07.140> really

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320
