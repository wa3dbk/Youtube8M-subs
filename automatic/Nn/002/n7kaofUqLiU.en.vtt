00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.770
 we have already passed this guest from there being mayor of san martin de 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.620
 valdeiglesias pablo martín very good night rodas nights thanks for being 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.279
 with us there are three items for inviting me 

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:13.589
 good after 20 years of socialist governments or municipality 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:18.349
 has chosen to the pp the last elections because he believes that in taking out and believes that it is 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:19.529
 and this change 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.489
 and who has the consequences? 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.660
 good in delegations we form a government team 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.240
 percent by an independent alternative citizen party san martín el 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.689
 popular party 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.590
 we are seven people and in fact the change we all agree that we are 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.610
 liberal center people 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.610
 and the consequences well then well again san martín 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.880
 We intend to open doors and windows that circulate the air that returns life 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.680
 economic socially and politically martín to breathe clean air and 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.290
 new freedom pt 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.680
 because he thinks it's aerial, you have to believe that there are exits of change 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.440
 because, after 20 years, ideas are basically exhausted 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.840
 and above all because the socialist management models we are seeing that 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.610
 at a general level in Spain because they are obsolete models 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.380
 they only lead to paralysis 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.290
 and our people san martín de valdeiglesias would not be less san 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.030
 Martin was very paralyzed Fig Tree essential change of neighbors 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.230
 from san martin asylum they understood 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.510
 and they chose some for the popular party others for alternatiba city san martín 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.890
 and between the two of us we agree fundamentally what we want to 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.640
 san martín and how we have formed a solid government team bilbao 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.420
 his rival paralyzing one would be working 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.640
 of the contracts of the town hall 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.510
 because this measure has been taken and in what it consists 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.800
 basically because any manager that boasts the first thing that 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.070
 have to do when he arrives at a new place 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.150
 is to learn about the real situation 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.049
 we were already aware that they are left in 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.800
 following the behavior pattern of almost all 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.080
 socialist managers there had been quite a few anomalies in the 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.330
 hiring not 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.440
 mostly by method through cronyism 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.880
 then the mosco opted to know what the real situation is think 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.750
 san martín de valdeiglesias a village 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.240
 of 8 thousand inhabitants since yesterday 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.819
 has 182 municipal workers well above average we wanted to know 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.199
 what was the situation 

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.729
 and we have done a labor audit that is analyzing labor contracts 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:18.469
 fundamentally the percent waiting is what unfortunately is 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.229
 they are finding numerous anomalies 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.940
 often little about natal percent issue is the creation of the national 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.590
 403 that has caused some problems with the ministry of 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.590
 encouragement that in me was the magdalena minister 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.109
 because these controversies have occurred 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:37.239
 with them 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.870
 basically because in us the first news we have of these 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.919
 Castrations performances that is in October of this year 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:47.110
 and not directly through the ministry but through a company 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.130
 that is dedicated to do studies related to age with the future 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.180
 dual carriageway 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.660
 national 403 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.240
 and because the variant that they want to execute to communicate the future 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.689
 motorway with san martín 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.909
 because the road leaves us again practically next to the urban center of 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.139
 San Martin 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.669
 they had not informed them of what they are going to do and you who claim 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:11.599
 We claim that this variant area is much more separated from the 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:12.129
 village 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.919
 because it is already hitting the new developments in fact 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:16.559
 one of the roundabouts is 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:21.100
 stuck the invader part of the green zone of an industrial estate already built 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.549
 and the following layout 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.720
 will go parallel and very close to the two new developments 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.259
 that are already approved and that should be underway 

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:32.799
 therefore that highway to the wing turned of three four years will be practically 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.249
 one more street of the town 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:36.310
 we demand that you separate 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.350
 the pretty bypass of the town a lot farther but they have 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.289
 already received a response to the ministry 

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:46.439
 we still do not expect that on Monday when the meeting with the 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.829
 people who are going to be expropriated to make that variant will expose us the 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:50.519
 draft 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.360
 and let's see what solutions can be given because the solution 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.370
 if you want simple even 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.890
 less dangerous for road users because they would eliminate very curve 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.149
 dangerous that are again tracing 

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:04.659
 with another road the n 501 has not happened the same thing upside down it seems that all 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:05.190
 sides 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.930
 political groups agree in turn will lie and their approach to 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.400
 clear municipality logically the political groups we are all in agreement 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.509
 because the neighbors demand it from us 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:15.710
 It is a road 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.950
 the fundamental one that communicates southwest of madrid with castile-lion and with 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.150
 castilla-la mancha even with extremadura 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.670
 and it is essential for that road circulate daily more than 15 thousand 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.930
 neighbors vehicles of our towns 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.310
 that go in an insecure way for this is little in which we live in the heat of century 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.069
 twenty-one 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:35.890
 users demand safety and comfort 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.830
 and that is what we intend with the unfolding of the road 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.390
 more that they are sorry some lounge ecologists 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.170
 that curiously they have not protested anything by unfolding of the national 403 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.830
 maybe because it's the promotion ministry 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.569
 good and has requested the ministry 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:53.389
 stampede towards 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.090
 of the cut of the 501 if the killer who is good as of is competence in itself 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.780
 exclusive to the community of madrid because we have already spoken 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.170
 economic of madrid and we have detected 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.500
 there is indeed good disposition why 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.349
 if something is characterized to the community of madrid 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:12.399
 the comrades of my party is pose next to citizens are sensitive 

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:13.650
 to the demands of citizens 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.810
 but first you have to finish what this is that is really important 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.880
 let's take it tobias so aberrant and conclude the test we'll talk about set 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.599
 to take it to san martín 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:26.129
 canán a little bit of topic recently carried out a series of measures 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:27.259
 fiscal 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:30.809
 Cajamar ejido until the citizens could tell us about the 

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:32.900
 Well, basically we've done something 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.150
 quesque 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.240
 to create the characteristic of the management of governments to the pp that 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.800
 is to lower taxes 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.340
 we in this first phase what we have done has been to freeze the rates 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.450
 in the amounts of 2007 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.090
 which means that for 2008 really 4 have dropped like 3% 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.990
 that what the infringement has gone up 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.990
 obviously that means putting more money in the hands of citizens 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.969
 that they can only spend with absolute freedom in what they have left 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:00.409
 how this is achieved 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:01.999
 because it lowers taxes 

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:03.270
 it seems complicated 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.350
 no it is not very easy and the really easy expert other 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.639
 you lower taxes 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.189
 get the services 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:14.330
 remain with the same quality even improve it ontiveros we what 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.279
 we are going to do for example by lowering taxes we are going to assemble or a new 

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:21.639
 home care service that did not exist until then 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:25.319
 there was an imitation through a grant from the Madrid community of 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:26.270
 an employment workshop 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.759
 that new service as such in fact when the classes ended 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:31.810
 in the summer and at Christmas 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.550
 the elders of san martin remained without service 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.069
 Now we are still lowering taxes 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:38.240
 let's dedicate 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.130
 an amount without support for font has to create this permanent service of 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.330
 home assistance 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.950
 and for example we are capable 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.060
 to increase investment in infrastructure by 60% 

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:53.619
 to finish that here the measures to carry out his government in this 

00:06:53.619 --> 00:06:55.289
 period of office 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:58.210
 to improve the quality of life of its citizens 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.130
 Basically what we want is for people to have confidence again 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.389
 san martín and what do I express freely 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:07.939
 We have done a very important image wash that is paying off 

00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:12.590
 the people were again to know that san martín de valdeiglesias is a 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.659
 paradise of cultural and natural leisure that is still only now of mothers 

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:20.069
 by in dovecote that thank you very much for having been are going away we 

00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:21.599
 we want others to invite us 

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:23.619
 we continue with more information
