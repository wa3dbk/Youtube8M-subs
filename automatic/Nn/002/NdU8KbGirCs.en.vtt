00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:23.880
 I see well then because sometimes I 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.609
 realize that I feel people do not 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.039

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:35.309
 France with his mouth while then 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:38.239
 that we are still being named 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.239
 overall we are high ranking 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.750

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.160

 ouellet gr20 behind I am a 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.700
 turned north you 're right we 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.010
 is happy but not everyone 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.649
 and then so much better so that's enough 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.699
 the soul twice 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.500
 I noticed that in a room 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.610
 show when you understand a joke 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:11.420
 and that the next guy does not understand 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:13.220
 the decor is to complain doctor once 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.290
 I see how many people are going 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.490
 at the restaurant of the heart is there since I see 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.250
 I 've heard twice my 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.300
 program 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:30.110
 and then when I give to my dog 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:33.380
 I almost orgasm it's crazy or 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.650
 in France we have a little tense here are the 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.890
 young people smoke firecrackers and old skull 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.070
 and bam boom that inhabits you the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.070
 Earth 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.530
 recchi late holidays and thankfully 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.390
 g happily in France is still 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.659
 normal people who grows to expand 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.579
 your part so how do I do this 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.679
 beer so when you're at a 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:00.600
 coffee terrace all that quiet and 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.600
 so you want to relax then 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.729
 I like things 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.459
 so you can pretty much see it 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:14.830
 like that ie to the versions he 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:17.200
 feared but the problem is we 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.160
 says in the ease the lead in the 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.780
 consumer society 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.010
 and today we can not last as 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.390
 that there is the land cpt in the process of getting 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.160
 warm up there are the penguins that are 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.420
 dying hot so I say 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.650
 for younger generations and for those 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.200
 who are closer to the end I the 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.360
 say that can not finish his series 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:39.879
 so then I propose 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:45.940
 I propose to return your I propose the 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:51.560
 beer on the dock because there we are 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:53.090

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.890

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.150

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.840
 that's me but when I see people 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.870
 who see their coffee terraces to 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.800
 paris there are not many ecologists 1 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.709
 because she has your brain no longer 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.849
 available and the gamecube coca cola which 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:20.239

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:22.069

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:27.440
 yours well she confesses well the invs or 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:29.330

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.220
 yeah right there you get caught 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.480
 risk to beer but you 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:40.970
 personally you do not agree 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:43.060
 out of play offers I propose taking 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.060
 height 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:51.830
 Here c is that of Treviso is a 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.569
 little soft and there people and you redo 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.750
 that it is said to him it is flat to die for 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.750
 his ideas 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.180
 so do not forget the goods because 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.810
 that she confesses to pass for a con if you 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.299
 and made it there and then give you 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.860
 meaning to your actions wow I did not know 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:16.100
 why I was on earth that's it 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:19.940
 discover the lives of people say yes 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.790
 he at greenpeace is there do not you 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:29.090
 again it is bypassed by 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:30.640
 laÃ¯b on and off puff of guard because 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.860
 that if his plot 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:37.360
 you like war because the subject 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.360
 really soft it's all a stop here 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:54.509
 this is well worth the gutter gum 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.800
 champagne now you're good you 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:59.280
 go say yes all this is very nice 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.509
 the sahb pics good the problem the 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.919
 ecological problem today it's 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:04.380
 still more oil the tides 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:10.770
 black his life the ecological problem he 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:20.280
 is much more complicated than that I 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:23.820
 propose this beer crash you have that 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.949
 does musicians pass not too loud the 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.690
 beer because that's where young people get 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:29.340
 say to him not only he defends his 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.759
 ideas but I have with the biggest is 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.759
 going out 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.610
 it'll calm down it'll calm down 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.710
 it does not calm 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.819
 it's a little girl 500 her moss or 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.819
 sarkozy that's it 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.389
 I propose to go even further from a 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:07.180
 complexification because that's it 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:09.159
 complicates at table I propose the table 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.490
 she will calm down yes no or soon 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:13.710
 so the table his strange people are proposing 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.699
 height rise 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:23.229
 oh yes because there now we laugh 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:25.810
 no longer thoroughly I propose the 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:28.509
 strange sound chair had eight missiles 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:31.030
 years of school now to the now 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:32.080
 the pope he is beaten here you will see 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:37.870
 never come a Buddhist to do 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:40.469
 what then of course the foot 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.469
 it's not a good idea 

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:52.330
 we are too numerous on earth for sure 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:53.650
 and there you will arrive long before 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.310
 relax you should expect 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:07:00.030
 here and there we are in a logic of 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.030
 it goes or it breaks 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.900
 yeah
