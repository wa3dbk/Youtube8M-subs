like that so you can make it match the

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.969 
like that so you can make it match the
box<00:01:24.400> with<00:01:25.240> then<00:01:26.110> you<00:01:26.260> want<00:01:26.409> to<00:01:26.500> place<00:01:26.619> a<00:01:26.650> wall

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
be a place at the start as the NC edges

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.020 
be a place at the start as the NC edges
together<00:01:40.900> starting<00:01:41.710> around<00:01:41.799> and<00:01:42.340> you'll<00:01:42.880> be

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
together starting around and you'll be

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.780 
together starting around and you'll be
left<00:01:43.210> with<00:01:43.360> just<00:01:43.450> your<00:01:43.750> wall<00:01:47.460> there's<00:01:48.460> my<00:01:48.610> wall

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
left with just your wall there's my wall

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.310 
left with just your wall there's my wall
and<00:01:49.060> that<00:01:49.150> gravel<00:01:49.509> it<00:01:49.600> was<00:01:49.750> from<00:01:50.020> something

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
and that gravel it was from something

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.350 
and that gravel it was from something
else<00:01:50.500> so<00:01:50.890> just<00:01:51.130> leading<00:01:51.670> it<00:01:51.850> has<00:01:51.939> nothing<00:01:52.150> to

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
else so just leading it has nothing to

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.690 
else so just leading it has nothing to
do<00:01:52.450> with<00:01:52.570> this<00:01:53.280> then<00:01:54.280> you<00:01:54.369> want<00:01:54.490> to<00:01:54.549> place<00:01:54.670> a

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
do with this then you want to place a

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.100 
do with this then you want to place a
fence<00:01:55.060> wolcott<00:01:55.540> it's<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.750> best<00:01:55.930> for

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
fence wolcott it's the best for

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.660 
fence wolcott it's the best for
measuring<00:01:56.470> you<00:01:56.560> can<00:01:56.710> do<00:01:56.860> you<00:01:57.280> probably<00:01:57.490> do

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
measuring you can do you probably do

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.760 
measuring you can do you probably do
anything<00:01:57.700> but<00:01:58.180> is<00:01:58.450> that<00:01:58.509> this<00:01:58.869> measures<00:01:59.590> it

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
anything but is that this measures it

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.830 
anything but is that this measures it
best<00:02:00.189> and<00:02:00.460> this<00:02:00.880> is<00:02:01.030> really<00:02:01.180> easy<00:02:01.329> all<00:02:01.600> you<00:02:01.630> do

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
best and this is really easy all you do

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.609 
best and this is really easy all you do
is<00:02:01.990> place<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:02.710> send<00:02:03.070> an<00:02:03.189> or<00:02:03.310> nodes<00:02:03.790> inside

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
is place the to send an or nodes inside

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.050 
is place the to send an or nodes inside
where<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:05.799> box<00:02:06.009> and<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.369> doors<00:02:06.549> would<00:02:06.729> be<00:02:06.759> as

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
where the box and the doors would be as

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.919 
where the box and the doors would be as
like<00:02:07.810> that<00:02:08.640> put<00:02:09.640> it<00:02:09.729> put<00:02:09.940> them<00:02:10.329> on<00:02:10.420> a<00:02:10.450> channel

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
like that put it put them on a channel

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.470 
like that put it put them on a channel
or<00:02:11.079> you<00:02:11.320> can<00:02:11.410> keep<00:02:11.530> that<00:02:11.560> channel<00:02:11.980> 10<00:02:12.940> but<00:02:13.239> I

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
or you can keep that channel 10 but I

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.750 
or you can keep that channel 10 but I

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
you can see the edge of the teleporters

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.960 
you can see the edge of the teleporters
are<00:02:33.080> sticking<00:02:33.530> out<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:34.670> want<00:02:34.820> to<00:02:34.880> make

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
are sticking out and you want to make

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.580 
are sticking out and you want to make
sure<00:02:35.030> that<00:02:35.150> side<00:02:35.630> is<00:02:35.780> going<00:02:35.990> in<00:02:36.110> sador<00:02:36.350> is<00:02:36.440> not

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
sure that side is going in sador is not

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.720 
sure that side is going in sador is not
the<00:02:36.740> other<00:02:36.860> way<00:02:36.980> around<00:02:37.010> because<00:02:37.400> then<00:02:37.610> those

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
the other way around because then those

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.370 
the other way around because then those
orange<00:02:38.150> when<00:02:38.510> you<00:02:38.600> see<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.870> orange<00:02:39.110> things

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
orange when you see the orange things

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.920 
orange when you see the orange things
poking<00:02:39.560> out<00:02:39.830> it<00:02:40.370> doesn't<00:02:40.610> work<00:02:40.880> because<00:02:41.120> it's

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
poking out it doesn't work because it's

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.740 
poking out it doesn't work because it's
too<00:02:42.170> thick<00:02:42.410> on<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.680> top<00:02:42.830> or<00:02:42.980> something<00:02:43.750> you

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
too thick on the top or something you

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.200 
too thick on the top or something you
won't<00:02:44.960> be<00:02:45.440> teleporting<00:02:46.100> through<00:02:46.280> it<00:02:46.400> you<00:02:47.180> can

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
won't be teleporting through it you can

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.770 
won't be teleporting through it you can
I<00:02:47.600> don't<00:02:48.290> know<00:02:48.350> why<00:02:48.590> they<00:02:49.370> showed<00:02:49.670> a<00:02:49.970> lot<00:02:50.510> this

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
I don't know why they showed a lot this

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.880 
I don't know why they showed a lot this
time<00:02:51.050> usually<00:02:51.830> they<00:02:52.070> don't<00:02:52.100> really<00:02:52.490> do<00:02:52.640> that

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
time usually they don't really do that

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.850 
time usually they don't really do that
let's<00:02:54.890> see<00:02:55.100> it<00:02:55.190> works<00:02:55.480> perfectly<00:02:56.480> fine<00:02:56.720> if<00:02:57.530> you

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
let's see it works perfectly fine if you

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.890 
let's see it works perfectly fine if you
didn't<00:02:58.160> like<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:58.340> you<00:02:58.550> just<00:02:58.790> redo<00:02:59.360> that<00:02:59.540> try

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
didn't like it you just redo that try

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.750 
didn't like it you just redo that try
and<00:03:00.080> moving<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.620> fence<00:03:00.800> well<00:03:01.010> not<00:03:01.430> as<00:03:01.580> tight

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
and moving the fence well not as tight

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.420 
and moving the fence well not as tight
against<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.120> regular<00:03:02.690> wall<00:03:02.870> or<00:03:02.990> something

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
against the regular wall or something

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.890 
against the regular wall or something
that's<00:03:04.430> how<00:03:04.550> you<00:03:04.610> do<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:05.890> yeah
