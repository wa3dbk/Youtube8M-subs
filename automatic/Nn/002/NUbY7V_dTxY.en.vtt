or around the speaker so as you can see
here<00:01:00.310> that's<00:01:00.940> why<00:01:01.149> it<00:01:01.210> doesn't<00:01:01.540> cover<00:01:01.660> those

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
here that's why it doesn't cover those

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.960 
here that's why it doesn't cover those
parts<00:01:02.770> you<00:01:03.010> can<00:01:03.040> see<00:01:03.280> it's<00:01:03.399> open<00:01:03.760> at<00:01:03.880> the

takes<00:01:10.000> quality<00:01:10.570> probably<00:01:11.470> to<00:01:11.650> the<00:01:11.680> next<00:01:11.979> level

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
takes quality probably to the next level

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.610

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
for the mute switch and volume so it

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.899 
for the mute switch and volume so it
does<00:01:52.570> go<00:01:52.689> around<00:01:53.170> it<00:01:53.439> but<00:01:54.310> as<00:01:54.490> you<00:01:54.549> can<00:01:54.610> see<00:01:54.790> the
