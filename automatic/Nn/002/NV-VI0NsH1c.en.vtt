00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
always wins coca yeah so I guess cuz it

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.500 
always wins coca yeah so I guess cuz it
would<00:02:13.320> have<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.650> come<00:02:13.680> out<00:02:13.950> later<00:02:14.190> yeah<00:02:14.760> that

would have to come out later yeah that

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.259 
would have to come out later yeah that
makes<00:02:15.630> sense<00:02:16.220> it's<00:02:17.220> just<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.670> think<00:02:17.730> Odie's<00:02:18.150> is
