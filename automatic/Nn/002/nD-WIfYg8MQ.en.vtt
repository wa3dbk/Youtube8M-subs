00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:19.870
 ah yes 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.130
 hello to all my name is I love it 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.660
 gas she is in this video I you 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.790
 learn from a raw shoe 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.650
 to reach a patina a little more 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.720
 complicated called purple rain and 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.820
 which includes two colors the purple and 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.250
 the blue is not going to be a patina 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.710
 I call black orchid and that is based 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.430
 of rape is degraded on the black for 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.930
 the brushes choose brushes not 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.670
 too strong in self-hair as if like 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.960
 this one is too late for 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.699
 deal with making the mass 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.530
 shoe rather brushes of 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.989
 painters have this style there see a little the 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.110
 brush style quite wide but not 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:56.979
 too used either course 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.390
 inks for indelible leather 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:01.239
 finally I prepared a mixture of 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.100
 purple and blue because the rape 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.710
 being too pink the latter night with some 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.320
 blue the white paper is used to test the 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.869
 color must know that a dry ink 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.880
 about two-thirds or so you'll see 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.470
 that after drying you go 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.170
 maybe on a lighter shade than 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:21.030
 it still does not load the brush 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:26.219
 to avoid drips and we start 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.359
 massively always stretches the color 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.670
 well insist on the level of the tip sort 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:33.250
 it is often there that we forget and 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.929
 put forward if we tend to 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.340
 forget the ever noticed that 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:38.530
 very real time dry dye 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.359
 quickly it clears up more 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.960
 iron the dye more color will be 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:46.229
 dark pay attention to you attention to 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.969
 splashing never finish the movement 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.119
 brutally always do it 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:54.579
 fall down attention little forgetfulness 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.929
 as is the language is at best 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.549
 cards and for not too touched 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.439
 the inside of the leather even if we will see it 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.210
 never hesitate to do minimum 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.159
 almost two layers over the entire 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.520
 shoe to have a uniform shoe 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.869
 and that the dye penetrates well was 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.580
 not also to follow the movement your 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.350
 brush to put the shoe to the 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.450
 down on as it uses 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.470
 a color that is created she will follow 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.670
 your movement 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.090
 do not hesitate to fight at 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:24.160
 week long the basecoat 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.320
 so after passing both layers 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.610
 on each shoe I let it dry in 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.720
 about an hour then there by cons 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.910
 use a brush that is a lot 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.890
 the finer it is a brush in hairs of 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.900
 you mark the difference 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.970
 the happier the finer it allows 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.280
 to be is very very accurate very 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.170
 linear and we always start with 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.970
 base contours the shoe you 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.660
 notice that the estrie are very very 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.240
 fine do not hesitate to insisted on 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.760
 put a little volume you to put 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.250
 the contrast you do not want too much 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.459
 saturated ink brush avoids 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.800
 mistakes we first work all the 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.850
 contour of the shoe and one degrades in 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.530
 lightness the brush avoids too much support 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.720
 to leave a lighter shade in 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.580
 the central parts start first 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.830
 rather otherwise of the shoe and 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.530
 not by the front of before being the the 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.209
 more difficult to work was starting 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.100
 a bit to see the volume get in 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.080
 place because in the central parts 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.970
 always violet start leaving always 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.950
 from where you started even 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.100
 if you think it's enough 20 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.600
 years we continue to come to the fore 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.760
 the least ink possible at the beginning for 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.650
 not be too scared in where you are from where 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.090
 the interest of a brush in itself that you 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.930
 notice that the estrie are very fine 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:42.320
 that allow to merge the 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.670
 effects to you to choose if you want 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.040
 really have a lot more tip 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.989
 marked dark or slightly tinted 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.180
 depending on the desired effect you can very 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.470
 well accentuate the estrie have the wind 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.570
 your brush but still have a 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.340
 striated effect a little wooded skis but 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.989
 also depth to your patina on 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.560
 on the other hand goes lightly in support 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:02.090
 hardly assist the dark parties 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.670
 really what he is very pretty 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.700
 to insist at that level we could 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.650
 put a little paint also do them 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.420
 hollow and the shoe is vaulted enter 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.310
 inside so we must insist 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.510
 on the part of the arch the 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.280
 put a little volume again 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.829
 do not forget that the paint dries and 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.720
 clears up so the effect will not be the 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.310
 even once dry that thought that after 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.040
 you're going to wax the shoe the iced 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.530
 darker lapointe will come out with 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.430
 the frosting still check that the 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.320
 two sides are pretty much the same have 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.380
 tight is dry a good half hour 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.620
 minimum we take the cream it fits 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.470
 black part of the shoe created black 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.710
 of course the brush and we start 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.540
 always by the basics never started 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.479
 in the middle if you have task and 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.090
 your shoe me you have draw on 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.290
 the brush plus allow you to scratch 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.090
 overall the shoe you 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.180
 notice that it does not pitch by doing 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.310
 but it's still going to have a 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.630
 nourishing side once you have 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.440
 almost no more waxing on the 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.100
 brush it's all over again 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.890
 notice that it does not affect 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:15.470
 degraded parts hard part is the 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:17.990
 heel the base and the top to keep 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:23.120
 a central gradient now a time 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:24.320
 pause is required after leaving the 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.930
 shoe rest one more time 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.500
 good half an hour we take the 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:34.870
 goat prose 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:38.200
 and shine the whole here is a 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.820
 executioner shoe ccir and we move on to 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.290
 icing 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.640
 you can either iced with blue labatt 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.800
 marine that will have a tendency was a little 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.060
 less contrasted than black but for 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.830
 to show you I used black instead 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.660
 to really peck you up 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.310
 dark is a dough that helps 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.740
 make the emulsion of water and draw on 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.260
 the front and back parts it does not serve 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.640
 not to wax your shoe completely 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.860
 would do the opposite effect to dry out 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.710
 your your shoe 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:08.020
 as usual we wipe away well 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:11.860
 flat at the level of the rag have turned a 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.960
 little bit to see this effect there for the 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.430
 first time you can afford 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.720
 to follow a little bit the contrasts of 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.350
 your shoe with the dough 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.810
 but later you wax it and with 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.310
 a cream of the wise and in business on 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.370
 the end part 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:30.490
 in the back and for purists at 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:33.580
 level of the stripes there is the heel 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.950
 always we do not hesitate 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.510
 insists on lacing rather on 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.180
 the outside of the foot knowing that the 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.380
 friction during the walk we go 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.820
 damage your classes inside 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.860
 do not hesitate to rest between 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.960
 two icing as I am is still 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.430
 cool dye do not hesitate 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.919
 always master of the steam at any 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.900
 what time of the process in time a whole 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:55.590
 little bit it's not going too fast at 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:58.390
 early I still wish fresh 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.950
 there now we avoid wax and the 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.169
 shoe overall so the ace 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.970
 lapointe otherwise you're going to have a 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:06.190
 shoe that will be dried at the level 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.620
 duplication that at this level there avoid 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.910
 always go back too much frosting it's 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.830
 that we want to do more 

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:14.729
 higher up we start to have an effect 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.729
 a little bit of a mirror 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:21.060
 I repeat you will have a long steam not 

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.380
 too fast no use blowing 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:29.040
 on it you really have to have a side 

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:31.440
 show here is a patina the agreement that 

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.090
 two goes up to z first step leather 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.100
 natural second stage first layer 

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:37.230
 third stage paint the 

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:39.540
 contrasts the glaze of icing and well 

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.640
 sure my little technique darling 

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:44.150
 butterfly lacing thank you then to very 

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.150
 soon I hope
