Tim<00:03:17.430> David<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.450> do<00:03:18.630> this<00:03:18.840> effect<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.470> different

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
Tim David to do this effect a different

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.280 
Tim David to do this effect a different
way<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:21.239> create<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.690> illusion<00:03:21.750> that

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
way so that you create the illusion that

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.990 
way so that you create the illusion that
the<00:03:22.410> cards<00:03:22.680> coming<00:03:23.040> out<00:03:23.160> of<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.640> center<00:03:23.970> of

the cards coming out of the center of
the<00:03:24.270> deck<00:03:24.450> okay<00:03:25.290> so<00:03:25.890> remember<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.310> old<00:03:26.489> way

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
the deck okay so remember the old way

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.720 
the deck okay so remember the old way
was<00:03:27.660> just<00:03:28.020> to<00:03:28.140> bring<00:03:28.350> it<00:03:28.500> up<00:03:28.620> like<00:03:28.860> this<00:03:29.160> using

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
was just to bring it up like this using

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.970 
was just to bring it up like this using
your<00:03:30.060> pinky<00:03:30.300> and<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:31.350> reason<00:03:31.620> that's<00:03:31.770> not

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
your pinky and the reason that's not

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.710 
your pinky and the reason that's not
good<00:03:32.280> is<00:03:32.520> because<00:03:32.760> it's<00:03:33.030> coming<00:03:33.360> up<00:03:33.450> from<00:03:33.660> the

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
good is because it's coming up from the

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.120 
good is because it's coming up from the
back<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.170> it's<00:03:34.260> kind<00:03:34.470> of<00:03:34.530> obvious<00:03:34.739> what

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
back and it's kind of obvious what

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.990 
back and it's kind of obvious what
you're<00:03:35.250> doing<00:03:35.550> so<00:03:36.180> what<00:03:36.330> I<00:03:36.360> recommend<00:03:37.020> is<00:03:38.000> you

carefully move the front of the deck up
about<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:51.000> half<00:03:51.950> of<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.130> front<00:03:53.400> of<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.550> deck

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
about the half of the front of the deck

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.120 
about the half of the front of the deck
up<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.180> you're<00:03:54.720> gonna<00:03:54.840> leave<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.650> back<00:03:55.860> of

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
up and you're gonna leave the back of

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.690 
up and you're gonna leave the back of
the<00:03:56.310> deck<00:03:56.519> down<00:03:57.440> okay<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:58.709> you'll<00:03:59.280> find<00:03:59.550> out

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
the deck down okay and you'll find out

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.280 
the deck down okay and you'll find out
why<00:03:59.910> we're<00:04:00.150> doing<00:04:00.269> this<00:04:00.540> in<00:04:00.720> a<00:04:00.780> moment<00:04:01.170> and

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
why we're doing this in a moment and

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.290 
why we're doing this in a moment and
then<00:04:01.800> you<00:04:01.920> take<00:04:02.130> your<00:04:02.310> hand<00:04:02.550> and<00:04:02.700> keep<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:03.030> here

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
then you take your hand and keep it here

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.910 
then you take your hand and keep it here
because<00:04:03.600> if<00:04:03.720> you<00:04:03.750> move<00:04:04.019> it<00:04:04.260> they'll<00:04:04.680> see

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
because if you move it they'll see

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.560 
because if you move it they'll see
you're<00:04:05.040> doing<00:04:05.340> something<00:04:05.580> okay<00:04:05.940> so<00:04:06.209> this<00:04:06.330> hand

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
you're doing something okay so this hand

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.420 
you're doing something okay so this hand
must<00:04:06.780> stay<00:04:06.989> here<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:07.610> you<00:04:08.610> quickly<00:04:08.880> create<00:04:09.510> a

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
must stay here and you quickly create a

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.800 
must stay here and you quickly create a
little<00:04:11.430> dip<00:04:11.700> in<00:04:11.850> the<00:04:12.000> cards<00:04:12.330> there<00:04:12.540> without

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
little dip in the cards there without

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.680 
little dip in the cards there without
them<00:04:12.989> noticing<00:04:13.200> okay<00:04:14.150> now<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.209> reason<00:04:15.300> you're

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
them noticing okay now the reason you're

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.849 
them noticing okay now the reason you're
doing<00:04:15.840> this<00:04:16.080> is<00:04:16.140> because<00:04:16.410> when<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:16.650> bring

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
doing this is because when you bring

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.289 
doing this is because when you bring
this<00:04:17.010> card<00:04:17.340> up<00:04:17.489> you're<00:04:17.640> going<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.820> be<00:04:17.940> dropping

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
this card up you're going to be dropping

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.670 
this card up you're going to be dropping
it<00:04:18.660> in<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.810> middle<00:04:19.140> and<00:04:19.230> this<00:04:19.290> makes<00:04:19.530> it

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
it in the middle and this makes it

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.800 
it in the middle and this makes it
easier<00:04:20.010> okay<00:04:20.790> so<00:04:20.850> now<00:04:21.060> you<00:04:21.150> get<00:04:21.269> to<00:04:21.419> this<00:04:21.540> point

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
easier okay so now you get to this point

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.520 
easier okay so now you get to this point
where<00:04:21.959> each<00:04:22.080> time<00:04:22.200> you're<00:04:22.320> going<00:04:22.410> to<00:04:22.470> find

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.999 
can show them their car just came out of
the<00:05:32.539> deck<00:05:32.780> and<00:05:33.110> there's<00:05:33.289> no<00:05:33.440> gimmicks<00:05:33.889> you

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:34.009 
the deck and there's no gimmicks you

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:35.350 
the deck and there's no gimmicks you
know<00:05:34.130> they<00:05:34.280> can<00:05:34.460> check<00:05:34.639> out<00:05:34.789> this<00:05:34.969> deck<00:05:35.150> when

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
know they can check out this deck when

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.240 
know they can check out this deck when
you're<00:05:35.479> done<00:05:35.599> so<00:05:36.409> I<00:05:36.440> think<00:05:36.560> this<00:05:36.830> is<00:05:36.889> when<00:05:37.130> it's

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
you're done so I think this is when it's

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.659 
you're done so I think this is when it's
done<00:05:37.400> right<00:05:37.669> it's<00:05:37.820> very<00:05:37.880> good<00:05:39.250> you<00:05:40.250> can<00:05:40.280> just

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
done right it's very good you can just

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.249 
done right it's very good you can just
fan<00:05:41.000> the<00:05:41.180> deck<00:05:41.360> and<00:05:41.599> let<00:05:41.719> them<00:05:41.870> see<00:05:42.020> it's<00:05:42.139> in

fan the deck and let them see it's in

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:43.959
