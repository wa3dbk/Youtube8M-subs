that<00:01:36.470> opportunity<00:01:37.470> arise<00:01:37.680> but<00:01:37.980> and<00:01:38.130> again

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
that opportunity arise but and again

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.160 
that opportunity arise but and again
it's<00:01:38.940> more<00:01:39.120> than<00:01:39.240> likely<00:01:39.300> that<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:39.900> guy<00:01:40.110> you

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
it's more than likely that the guy you

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.520 
it's more than likely that the guy you
make<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.810> crossing<00:01:42.810> finger<00:01:43.200> whatever
