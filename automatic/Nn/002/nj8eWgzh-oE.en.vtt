from<00:00:24.560> driving<00:00:24.800> television<00:00:25.369> the<00:00:25.640> one<00:00:25.790> thing

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
from driving television the one thing

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.760 
from driving television the one thing
about<00:00:25.970> hybrid<00:00:26.630> as<00:00:26.750> a<00:00:26.779> term<00:00:27.079> a<00:00:27.110> lot<00:00:27.500> of<00:00:27.590> people

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
about hybrid as a term a lot of people

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.679 
about hybrid as a term a lot of people
think<00:00:27.950> it's<00:00:28.070> one<00:00:28.279> technology<00:00:28.700> and<00:00:29.300> it<00:00:29.419> really

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
think it's one technology and it really

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.389 
think it's one technology and it really
isn't<00:00:29.869> is<00:00:30.259> there<00:00:30.380> a<00:00:30.559> few<00:00:30.829> different<00:00:31.099> kinds<00:00:31.189> of

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
isn't is there a few different kinds of

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.790 
isn't is there a few different kinds of
hybrid<00:00:32.000> then<00:00:32.149> well<00:00:32.450> there<00:00:32.899> are<00:00:32.989> two<00:00:33.170> main<00:00:33.469> and

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
hybrid then well there are two main and

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.500 
hybrid then well there are two main and
then<00:00:33.950> there's<00:00:34.309> some<00:00:34.460> modifications<00:00:35.149> of<00:00:35.300> those

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
then there's some modifications of those

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.660 
then there's some modifications of those
the<00:00:35.750> first<00:00:35.780> is<00:00:36.260> what's<00:00:36.500> called<00:00:36.710> a<00:00:36.860> mild<00:00:37.190> hybrid

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
the first is what's called a mild hybrid

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.280 
the first is what's called a mild hybrid
I<00:00:37.880> want<00:00:38.210> you<00:00:38.300> have<00:00:38.480> there<00:00:38.719> is<00:00:38.840> you<00:00:38.930> have<00:00:39.110> the

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
I want you have there is you have the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.320 
I want you have there is you have the
regular<00:00:39.440> gasoline<00:00:39.860> engine<00:00:40.550> and<00:00:40.700> electric

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
regular gasoline engine and electric

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.230 
regular gasoline engine and electric
motor<00:00:41.780> that<00:00:42.590> assists<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:43.250> load<00:00:43.730> on<00:00:44.030> that

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:44.240 
motor that assists the load on that

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.270 
motor that assists the load on that
engine<00:00:44.420> so<00:00:45.110> as<00:00:45.290> you're<00:00:45.440> driving<00:00:45.650> along<00:00:45.920> the

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
engine so as you're driving along the

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.640 
engine so as you're driving along the
electric<00:00:46.640> motor<00:00:46.880> produces<00:00:47.450> power<00:00:47.960> and<00:00:48.290> that

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
electric motor produces power and that

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.530 
electric motor produces power and that
helps<00:00:48.980> reduce<00:00:49.340> the<00:00:49.520> load<00:00:49.700> on<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:49.880> gasoline

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
helps reduce the load on the gasoline

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.360 
helps reduce the load on the gasoline
engine<00:00:50.840> and<00:00:50.960> brings<00:00:51.230> down<00:00:51.320> the<00:00:51.740> amount<00:00:52.220> of

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
engine and brings down the amount of

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.250 
engine and brings down the amount of
fuel<00:00:52.610> you<00:00:52.730> use<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:53.329> second<00:00:53.780> we're<00:00:53.960> here<00:00:54.170> in

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
fuel you use the second we're here in

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.250 
fuel you use the second we're here in
front<00:00:54.350> of<00:00:54.500> the<00:00:54.560> Lexus<00:00:54.890> RX<00:00:55.280> 450h<00:00:56.120> a<00:00:56.870> long<00:00:57.079> name

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
to start on pure electric and then when

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.719 
to start on pure electric and then when
you<00:01:05.659> get<00:01:05.840> up<00:01:05.960> to<00:01:05.990> thirty<00:01:06.770> kilometres<00:01:07.009> an<00:01:07.369> hour

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
you get up to thirty kilometres an hour

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.910 
you get up to thirty kilometres an hour
the<00:01:07.939> gasoline<00:01:08.329> comes<00:01:08.780> on<00:01:09.049> and<00:01:09.290> they<00:01:09.710> work

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
the gasoline comes on and they work

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.740 
the gasoline comes on and they work
together<00:01:10.130> after<00:01:10.790> that<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.390> that's<00:01:11.540> what's

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
together after that so that's what's

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.209 
together after that so that's what's
called<00:01:11.930> a<00:01:12.020> pure<00:01:12.259> hybrid<00:01:12.619> is<00:01:12.710> that<00:01:12.829> considered

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.219 
called a pure hybrid is that considered

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:16.270 
called a pure hybrid is that considered
more<00:01:13.520> efficient<00:01:14.439> you<00:01:15.439> know<00:01:15.530> there<00:01:15.920> are<00:01:16.009> some

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
more efficient you know there are some

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.249 
more efficient you know there are some
mild<00:01:16.579> hybrids<00:01:17.060> that<00:01:17.149> achieve<00:01:17.479> very<00:01:17.810> very<00:01:18.079> good

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
mild hybrids that achieve very very good

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:19.779 
mild hybrids that achieve very very good
numbers<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:18.799> they're<00:01:18.889> pure<00:01:19.280> hybrids<00:01:19.700> that

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
numbers and they're pure hybrids that

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.489 
numbers and they're pure hybrids that
get<00:01:20.329> it<00:01:20.450> as<00:01:20.539> well<00:01:20.689> but<00:01:20.840> you<00:01:20.929> know<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.139> biggest

in<00:01:40.340> a<00:01:40.399> lab<00:01:40.579> so<00:01:41.179> you<00:01:41.240> drive<00:01:41.659> in<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:41.929> real-world

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
in a lab so you drive in the real-world

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.499 
in a lab so you drive in the real-world
conditions<00:01:42.499> but<00:01:43.279> the<00:01:43.459> thing<00:01:43.670> is<00:01:43.850> with<00:01:44.029> hybrids

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
conditions but the thing is with hybrids

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.719 
conditions but the thing is with hybrids
if<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:45.259> driver<00:01:45.590> is<00:01:45.829> in<00:01:46.009> tune<00:01:46.310> with<00:01:46.579> the

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
if the driver is in tune with the

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.029 
if the driver is in tune with the
vehicle's<00:01:47.179> onboard<00:01:47.420> dynamics<00:01:48.350> and<00:01:48.560> telemetry

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
vehicle's onboard dynamics and telemetry

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.800 
vehicle's onboard dynamics and telemetry
that<00:01:49.429> lets<00:01:49.579> you<00:01:49.729> know<00:01:49.939> what<00:01:50.389> the<00:01:50.509> hybrid

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
that lets you know what the hybrid

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.599 
that lets you know what the hybrid
system<00:01:50.990> is<00:01:51.289> doing<00:01:51.619> and<00:01:51.829> you've<00:01:52.189> watched<00:01:52.459> that

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:52.609 
system is doing and you've watched that

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:54.969 
system is doing and you've watched that
and<00:01:52.969> you<00:01:53.060> adjust<00:01:53.450> your<00:01:53.539> driving<00:01:54.020> style<00:01:54.319> you

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
and you adjust your driving style you

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.669 
and you adjust your driving style you
can<00:01:55.159> achieve<00:01:55.279> very<00:01:56.179> very<00:01:56.599> close<00:01:57.200> if<00:01:57.469> not

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
can achieve very very close if not

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:59.800 
can achieve very very close if not
better<00:01:57.950> than<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:58.939> posted<00:01:59.359> mileage<00:01:59.689> there

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
better than the posted mileage there

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.999 
better than the posted mileage there
were<00:01:59.899> some<00:02:00.109> people<00:02:00.259> there<00:02:00.409> called<00:02:00.740> hyper

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
were some people there called hyper

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.859 
were some people there called hyper
milers<00:02:01.549> and<00:02:01.969> they'll<00:02:02.119> do<00:02:02.270> things<00:02:02.479> like<00:02:02.659> drive

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
milers and they'll do things like drive

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.059 
milers and they'll do things like drive
with<00:02:03.049> no<00:02:03.139> air<00:02:03.259> conditioning<00:02:03.679> in<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.859> summer

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
with no air conditioning in the summer

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.639 
with no air conditioning in the summer
and<00:02:04.219> wear<00:02:04.369> a<00:02:04.399> cold<00:02:04.700> vest<00:02:05.029> but<00:02:06.020> that's<00:02:06.380> a<00:02:06.499> bit

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
and wear a cold vest but that's a bit

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:07.839 
and wear a cold vest but that's a bit
crazy<00:02:06.770> I<00:02:07.069> don't<00:02:07.130> like<00:02:07.279> something<00:02:07.459> I<00:02:07.549> might<00:02:07.729> do

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
crazy I don't like something I might do

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:09.490 
crazy I don't like something I might do
yeah<00:02:08.119> we<00:02:08.300> might<00:02:08.479> try<00:02:08.750> it<00:02:08.810> for<00:02:09.020> a<00:02:09.080> day<00:02:09.200> anyway

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
yeah we might try it for a day anyway

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.740 
yeah we might try it for a day anyway
what<00:02:09.800> about<00:02:09.979> that<00:02:10.099> other<00:02:10.250> myth<00:02:10.520> that<00:02:10.880> you<00:02:11.660> know

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
what about that other myth that you know

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.050 
what about that other myth that you know
the<00:02:11.930> creating<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.920> hybrid<00:02:13.280> vehicle<00:02:13.459> could

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
the creating the hybrid vehicle could

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.240 
the creating the hybrid vehicle could
potentially<00:02:14.780> offset<00:02:15.260> that<00:02:15.620> environmental

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
potentially offset that environmental

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.740 
potentially offset that environmental
impact<00:02:16.550> of<00:02:16.700> driving<00:02:17.030> with<00:02:17.120> outcasts

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
impact of driving with outcasts

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.479 
impact of driving with outcasts
well<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.379> reduce<00:02:18.680> your<00:02:18.829> fuel<00:02:19.040> when<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:19.310> drive

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
well you reduce your fuel when you drive

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:20.920 
well you reduce your fuel when you drive
with<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.670> hybrid<00:02:20.030> but<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.329> biggest<00:02:20.689> energy

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
with a hybrid but the biggest energy

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.199 
with a hybrid but the biggest energy
consumption

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
consumption

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.880 
consumption
making<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.840> vehicle<00:02:23.170> is<00:02:23.290> adding<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.680> extra

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
making a vehicle is adding the extra

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.649 
making a vehicle is adding the extra
hybrid<00:02:24.310> components<00:02:24.579> so<00:02:24.879> yes<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.150> hybrid

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
hybrid components so yes a hybrid

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.929 
hybrid components so yes a hybrid
vehicle<00:02:26.019> does<00:02:26.260> use<00:02:26.890> more<00:02:27.159> energy<00:02:27.609> to<00:02:27.730> make

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
vehicle does use more energy to make

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.149 
vehicle does use more energy to make
you've<00:02:28.090> got<00:02:28.239> a<00:02:28.269> mind<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.140> or<00:02:29.319> for<00:02:29.920> the

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
you've got a mind the or for the

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.099 
you've got a mind the or for the
batteries<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:30.969> you're<00:02:31.180> making<00:02:31.480> two<00:02:31.659> systems

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.109 
batteries and you're making two systems

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:34.110 
batteries and you're making two systems
gas<00:02:32.319> and<00:02:32.620> electric<00:02:33.010> so<00:02:33.370> yes<00:02:33.579> to<00:02:33.790> use<00:02:33.909> more

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
gas and electric so yes to use more

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.839 
gas and electric so yes to use more
energy<00:02:34.420> but<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.439> real<00:02:35.739> amount<00:02:36.069> of<00:02:36.340> fuel

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
energy but the real amount of fuel

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.330 
energy but the real amount of fuel
that's<00:02:37.060> used<00:02:37.420> is<00:02:37.689> in<00:02:37.959> its<00:02:38.109> in<00:02:38.379> life<00:02:38.620> use<00:02:39.099> so

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
that's used is in its in life use so

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.830 
that's used is in its in life use so
when<00:02:39.459> it's<00:02:39.579> being<00:02:39.670> driven<00:02:39.939> on<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.150> road<00:02:40.239> for

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
when it's being driven on the road for

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.209 
when it's being driven on the road for
the<00:02:40.930> 10<00:02:41.079> or<00:02:41.200> 12<00:02:41.409> years<00:02:41.620> that's<00:02:41.799> going<00:02:41.829> to<00:02:41.980> be<00:02:42.069> on

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:42.219 
the 10 or 12 years that's going to be on

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:43.920 
the 10 or 12 years that's going to be on
the<00:02:42.310> road<00:02:42.489> and<00:02:42.730> that<00:02:42.760> is<00:02:43.180> substantially

the road and that is substantially

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.839 
the road and that is substantially
reduced<00:02:44.260> which<00:02:44.469> more<00:02:44.769> than<00:02:44.799> offsets<00:02:45.400> the

reduced which more than offsets the
extra<00:02:46.239> energy<00:02:46.359> to<00:02:46.689> make<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.019> vehicles<00:02:47.379> that

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
extra energy to make the vehicles that

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:49.500 
extra energy to make the vehicles that
is<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:47.680> bit<00:02:47.859> of<00:02:47.889> a<00:02:48.010> myth<00:02:48.219> in<00:02:48.730> your<00:02:48.939> opinion<00:02:49.329> then

get<00:03:07.870> so<00:03:08.079> expensive<00:03:08.349> so<00:03:09.250> these<00:03:09.939> hybrid

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
get so expensive so these hybrid

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.270 
get so expensive so these hybrid
vehicles<00:03:10.840> today<00:03:11.049> are<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.500> stepping<00:03:11.889> stone<00:03:12.099> to

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
vehicles today are the stepping stone to

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.500 
vehicles today are the stepping stone to
what<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.519> next<00:03:12.669> generation<00:03:12.819> the<00:03:13.480> generation

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
what the next generation the generation

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.530 
what the next generation the generation
after<00:03:14.260> that<00:03:14.439> are<00:03:14.799> so<00:03:15.310> if<00:03:15.669> you<00:03:15.790> can<00:03:16.120> extract

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
after that are so if you can extract

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.970 
after that are so if you can extract
efficiencies<00:03:17.260> of<00:03:17.530> twenty<00:03:17.799> and<00:03:17.889> thirty

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
efficiencies of twenty and thirty

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.039 
efficiencies of twenty and thirty
percent<00:03:18.489> then<00:03:18.909> the<00:03:19.060> next<00:03:19.239> ones<00:03:19.419> are<00:03:19.510> maybe<00:03:19.629> 50

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
percent then the next ones are maybe 50

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.959 
percent then the next ones are maybe 50
or<00:03:20.169> 60<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:20.739> then<00:03:20.829> on<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:21.189> on<00:03:21.280> we're<00:03:21.730> slowly

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:21.969 
or 60 and then on and on we're slowly

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:23.940 
or 60 and then on and on we're slowly
going<00:03:22.150> to<00:03:22.239> wean<00:03:22.480> our<00:03:22.659> way<00:03:22.900> away<00:03:23.019> from<00:03:23.230> fossil

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
going to wean our way away from fossil

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.039 
going to wean our way away from fossil
fuels<00:03:24.159> and<00:03:24.370> right<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.209> electric<00:03:25.599> cars<00:03:25.750> so

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
fuels and right to electric cars so

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.270 
fuels and right to electric cars so
these<00:03:26.199> vehicles<00:03:26.409> are<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.739> stepping<00:03:27.069> stone

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
these vehicles are a stepping stone

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.740 
these vehicles are a stepping stone
there<00:03:27.760> you<00:03:27.819> have<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.120> if<00:03:28.269> you<00:03:28.389> want<00:03:28.599> to<00:03:28.659> be

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
there you have it if you want to be

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.149 
there you have it if you want to be
conscious<00:03:28.989> about<00:03:29.349> the<00:03:29.470> environment<00:03:29.500> and

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 
conscious about the environment and

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:31.589 
conscious about the environment and
potentially<00:03:30.669> save<00:03:30.909> a<00:03:30.940> little<00:03:31.180> bit<00:03:31.299> of<00:03:31.389> money

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
potentially save a little bit of money

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.270 
potentially save a little bit of money
while<00:03:31.900> driving<00:03:32.229> you<00:03:32.739> might<00:03:32.889> want<00:03:33.069> to<00:03:33.099> take<00:03:33.250> a

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
while driving you might want to take a

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.039 
while driving you might want to take a
look<00:03:33.459> at<00:03:33.549> hybrid<00:03:33.909> technology<00:03:34.449> Zach<00:03:34.930> Spencer

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
look at hybrid technology Zach Spencer

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.539 
look at hybrid technology Zach Spencer
