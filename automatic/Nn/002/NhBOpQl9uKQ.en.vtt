00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.759
 need to move 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:22.529
 switched again how important is how much 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:25.580
 can i want how many can robots soon 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.550
 war is soon the end of the world 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.330
 how much but now when I threw back 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.780
 madness 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.840
 let's evaluate this situation from different sides to 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.870
 gta suffered a bad night of course but 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.000
 think why it was done as 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.390
 old mocks the trunk 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.760
 and I don't like my fans d Denmark g guys 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.070
 but it's understandable that they just donâ€™t 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.350
 managed to finish work on but to the version 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.239
 they approach this with zeal and soul 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.579
 work is not trying to make a game 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.520
 as good as they really are 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.079
 try to make the most perfect 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.059
 version for pc 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.020
 but instead of saying the term is old 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.720
 thank you there were angry comments from 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.479
 people that I would wait for this 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.790
 while i wanted to buy but carry carry 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.580
 I'm tired of them I downloaded the pirate 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.040
 still buy something you think 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.180
 what is it for the benefit of this expectation for the benefit 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.850
 to get the game out 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.730
 remember as much as possible 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.680
 the history of swatch dogs where ubisoft is clearly not 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.450
 I have time to finish the game so only 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.180
 opportunities has been cut down 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.090
 the game was poorly optimized you want 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.429
 see similar for the year again on bye 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.189
 I also thought that there was not so much for him 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:45.130
 waited for the trunk that two months is 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.469
 just just nothing so I tell you 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.490
 I suggest not to write angry comments 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:52.960
 about rockstar 1 turn tell them thanks 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.539
 thank you for trying 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.149
 maximum will please us the way by 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:01.209
 extra wait but this is what 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.310
 and friends it is worth it so we will 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:05.770
 wait friends nothing more 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.530
 It remains for the woods to hope that now 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.799
 before rockstar they have enough time to finish 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.420
 the game and then my catch up 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.910
 all ahead friends are waiting not 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.680
 we get upset we believe the best choices for 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.870
 viewing if you agree with me 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.120
 be sure to like and if you 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.010
 want to pass the time before gta 5 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.799
 on pc and then subscribe to my channel 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.200
 See the vidos and the time when the games 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:32.040
 will pass completely unnoticed 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.040
