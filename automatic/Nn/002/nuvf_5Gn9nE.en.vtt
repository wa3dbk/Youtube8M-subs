00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.340 
struggle as much when buying technology
and<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:45.060> think<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:45.420> because<00:01:45.720> buying<00:01:46.229> a

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
and I think it's because buying a

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.960 
and I think it's because buying a
computer<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.890> basically<00:01:47.250> have<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.670> spend

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
computer you basically have to spend

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.139 
computer you basically have to spend
$1,500<00:01:48.899> $2,000<00:01:49.710> something<00:01:50.040> like<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.939> get

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
$1,500 $2,000 something like that to get

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.870 
$1,500 $2,000 something like that to get
what<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.390> need<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.020> can't<00:01:52.829> pay<00:01:53.220> less<00:01:53.520> and

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
what you need and you can't pay less and

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.340 
what you need and you can't pay less and
if<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.149> do<00:01:54.210> pay<00:01:54.479> less<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.810> doesn't<00:01:54.930> have<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
if I do pay less it doesn't have the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.520 
if I do pay less it doesn't have the
same<00:01:55.590> functionality<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.329> spending<00:01:58.320> that

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
same functionality that I spending that

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.679 
same functionality that I spending that
full<00:01:58.829> price<00:01:59.100> would<00:01:59.399> so<00:01:59.909> for<00:02:00.119> me<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.479> that's

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
full price would so for me that that's

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.270 
full price would so for me that that's
kind<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.110> justification<00:02:01.469> in<00:02:01.950> my<00:02:02.040> head<00:02:02.189> of

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
kind of a justification in my head of

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.530 
kind of a justification in my head of
why<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.670> spend<00:02:02.850> more<00:02:03.000> money<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.299> technology

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
why I can spend more money on technology

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.840 
why I can spend more money on technology
but<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.350> can't<00:02:04.979> necessarily<00:02:05.219> spend<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.729> much

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
but I can't necessarily spend that much

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.270 
but I can't necessarily spend that much
money<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.119> shoes<00:02:06.509> or<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> handbag<00:02:07.290> but<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:07.979> want

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
money on shoes or a handbag but I want

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.969 
money on shoes or a handbag but I want
to<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.539> people<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:09.989> decided<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.530> do<00:02:10.739> is

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
to so this people have decided to do is

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.230 
to so this people have decided to do is
some

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
some

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.180 
some

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
and I think by writing it down by even

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.230 
and I think by writing it down by even
by<00:05:20.530> me<00:05:20.680> doing<00:05:20.830> this<00:05:21.010> video<00:05:21.310> it's<00:05:21.550> like<00:05:21.910> making

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
by me doing this video it's like making

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.060 
by me doing this video it's like making
a<00:05:22.330> commitment<00:05:22.660> if<00:05:23.320> I<00:05:23.440> don't<00:05:23.620> tell<00:05:23.830> anybody

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
a commitment if I don't tell anybody

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.680 
a commitment if I don't tell anybody
about<00:05:24.400> it<00:05:24.550> then<00:05:24.790> it's<00:05:24.910> just<00:05:25.000> easy<00:05:25.300> for<00:05:25.570> me<00:05:25.660> to

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
about it then it's just easy for me to

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.450 
about it then it's just easy for me to
just<00:05:25.960> not<00:05:26.260> do<00:05:27.100> it

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
just not do it

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.550 
just not do it
but<00:05:27.790> by<00:05:28.030> this<00:05:28.090> way<00:05:28.360> by<00:05:28.540> me<00:05:28.690> telling<00:05:29.080> you<00:05:29.260> guys

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
but by this way by me telling you guys

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.870 
but by this way by me telling you guys
then<00:05:29.950> you<00:05:29.980> guys<00:05:30.280> can<00:05:30.460> hold<00:05:30.610> me<00:05:30.790> accountable

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
then you guys can hold me accountable

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.600 
then you guys can hold me accountable
and<00:05:31.540> then<00:05:31.930> at<00:05:32.110> the<00:05:32.230> very<00:05:32.260> end<00:05:32.620> of<00:05:33.160> this<00:05:33.340> whole

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
and then at the very end of this whole

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.090 
and then at the very end of this whole
process<00:05:33.880> when<00:05:34.630> I've<00:05:34.750> decided<00:05:34.870> to<00:05:35.290> purchase

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
process when I've decided to purchase

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.500 
process when I've decided to purchase
whatever<00:05:36.430> I<00:05:36.610> end<00:05:36.640> up<00:05:36.820> purchasing<00:05:37.210> it<00:05:37.360> may

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
whatever I end up purchasing it may

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.270 
whatever I end up purchasing it may
change<00:05:37.780> but<00:05:37.990> at<00:05:38.080> the<00:05:38.170> moment<00:05:38.470> if<00:05:38.530> it<00:05:38.890> ends<00:05:39.250> up

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
change but at the moment if it ends up

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.130 
change but at the moment if it ends up
being<00:05:39.490> the<00:05:39.670> bag<00:05:39.850> then<00:05:40.120> I<00:05:40.180> can<00:05:40.330> do<00:05:40.660> a<00:05:40.690> video<00:05:40.810> and

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 
being the bag then I can do a video and

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.510 
being the bag then I can do a video and
show<00:05:41.290> you<00:05:41.320> guys<00:05:41.560> maybe<00:05:41.830> to<00:05:42.010> a<00:05:42.040> what's<00:05:42.280> in<00:05:42.400> my

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520
