game plan going in not necessarily

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.069 
game plan going in not necessarily
because<00:00:38.280> they're<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.090> offensive<00:00:39.600> team<00:00:39.870> that

versatility<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.590> defensive<00:00:50.010> end<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.489> we

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
versatility on the defensive end so we

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.979 
versatility on the defensive end so we
can<00:00:50.760> switch<00:00:51.090> we<00:00:51.390> can<00:00:51.539> give<00:00:51.660> them<00:00:51.809> different

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
can switch we can give them different

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.049

looks<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:53.219> we<00:00:53.340> just<00:00:53.489> tried<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.789> keep<00:00:53.940> them

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
looks and so we just tried to keep them

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.569 
looks and so we just tried to keep them
guessing<00:00:54.239> as<00:00:54.510> much<00:00:54.660> as<00:00:54.780> possible<00:00:55.250> how<00:00:56.250> key<00:00:56.489> is

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470

possible<00:03:38.620> against<00:03:39.220> any<00:03:39.370> team<00:03:39.459> but<00:03:39.640> especially

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
possible against any team but especially

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.590 
possible against any team but especially
you<00:03:40.810> know<00:03:41.350> against<00:03:41.769> Phoenix<00:03:42.100> just<00:03:42.970> too<00:03:43.120> for<00:03:43.480> us

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
you know against Phoenix just too for us

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.000 
you know against Phoenix just too for us
it's<00:03:43.989> great<00:03:44.380> to<00:03:44.470> get<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.680> ball<00:03:44.829> inside

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
it's great to get the ball inside

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.100 
it's great to get the ball inside
because<00:03:45.190> Lauren<00:03:45.880> is<00:03:46.090> Lauren<00:03:46.630> and<00:03:46.750> then<00:03:47.019> it

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
because Lauren is Lauren and then it

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.240 
because Lauren is Lauren and then it
also<00:03:47.200> creates<00:03:47.560> of<00:03:47.620> all<00:03:47.709> a<00:03:47.739> lot<00:03:47.980> of

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
also creates of all a lot of

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.530 
also creates of all a lot of
opportunities<00:03:48.730> because<00:03:48.880> they<00:03:49.000> double-team

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
opportunities because they double-team

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.479 
opportunities because they double-team
so<00:03:50.320> we<00:03:50.410> can<00:03:50.530> kick<00:03:50.709> it<00:03:50.739> out<00:03:50.950> and<00:03:51.130> kind<00:03:51.280> of<00:03:51.340> take

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
so we can kick it out and kind of take

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.539 
so we can kick it out and kind of take
take<00:03:52.269> advantage<00:03:52.630> of<00:03:52.720> those<00:03:52.840> those<00:03:53.799> rotations

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
take advantage of those those rotations

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.130 
take advantage of those those rotations
and<00:03:54.970> that's<00:03:55.180> you<00:03:55.510> know<00:03:55.540> what<00:03:55.660> we<00:03:55.810> were<00:03:55.930> looking

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
defensively it obviously doesn't allow

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.180

yeah you know I think it's one of those
things<00:04:28.480> where<00:04:29.280> it<00:04:30.280> means<00:04:30.460> a<00:04:30.550> lot<00:04:30.700> you<00:04:31.180> know<00:04:31.330> as

an individual player I think right now

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.210 
an individual player I think right now
in<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.780> world<00:04:35.050> this<00:04:35.500> is<00:04:35.680> probably<00:04:35.950> the

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
in the world this is probably the

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.450 
in the world this is probably the
highest<00:04:37.050> honor<00:04:38.050> you<00:04:38.380> can<00:04:38.530> receive<00:04:38.800> as<00:04:39.100> an

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.620 
individual this is the best league with
the<00:04:41.500> best<00:04:41.710> players<00:04:41.860> and<00:04:42.370> to<00:04:42.730> be<00:04:42.820> selected<00:04:43.210> MVP

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
the best players and to be selected MVP

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.060 
the best players and to be selected MVP
it<00:04:44.050> says<00:04:44.800> a<00:04:45.010> lot<00:04:46.260> just<00:04:47.260> based<00:04:47.770> on<00:04:48.010> the

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
it says a lot just based on the

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.950 
it says a lot just based on the
competition<00:04:48.790> the<00:04:49.090> people<00:04:49.420> you<00:04:49.690> know<00:04:49.720> who<00:04:49.930> are

other than she probably potentially most

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.380
