and you know they function in very much
the<00:01:03.629> same<00:01:03.780> way<00:01:04.489> you<00:01:05.489> have<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:06.030> card<00:01:06.390> here<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:06.869> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
choice about so it could be seen as kind

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.539 
choice about so it could be seen as kind
of<00:01:20.040> where<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.580> stand

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
originally or right now before you make

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.280 
originally or right now before you make
a<00:01:25.770> choice<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.549> then<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.270> crossing<00:01:27.810> card<00:01:28.110> of

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
a choice and then the crossing card of

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.440 
a choice and then the crossing card of
course<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.920> sort<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.549> bridge<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.880> have<00:01:30.119> to

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
course is sort of the bridge you have to

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.510 
course is sort of the bridge you have to
cross<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.110> know<00:01:31.950> what<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.280> have<00:01:32.430> to

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
cross and you know what you have to

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.330 
cross and you know what you have to
consider<00:01:32.990> about<00:01:33.990> your<00:01:34.200> general<00:01:34.619> situation

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
consider about your general situation

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.670 
consider about your general situation
that<00:01:35.460> you're<00:01:35.579> moving<00:01:36.060> through<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.810> order<00:01:37.380> to

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
that you're moving through in order to

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.460 
that you're moving through in order to
make<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.920> good<00:01:38.509> educated<00:01:39.920> choice<00:01:41.659> so<00:01:42.659> then<00:01:43.170> from

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
make a good educated choice so then from

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.399 
make a good educated choice so then from
there<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.890> out<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.070> lay<00:01:44.460> out<00:01:44.610> three<00:01:45.290> cards<00:01:46.290> in

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
there on out I lay out three cards in

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.670 
there on out I lay out three cards in
each<00:01:46.740> row<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.460> what<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:47.939> usually<00:01:48.210> do<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.960> I'll

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
each row and what I usually do is I'll

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.370 
each row and what I usually do is I'll
do<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> row<00:01:50.399> for<00:01:50.880> each<00:01:51.149> choice

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
do a row for each choice

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.280 
do a row for each choice
so<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.100> could<00:01:53.340> even<00:01:53.700> do<00:01:54.119> more<00:01:54.540> than<00:01:54.840> two<00:01:55.049> rows

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
so you could even do more than two rows

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.740 
so you could even do more than two rows
I've<00:01:55.530> only<00:01:55.680> diagrams<00:01:56.340> two<00:01:56.670> rows<00:01:56.939> for<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.299> here

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
I've only diagrams two rows for you here

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.990 
I've only diagrams two rows for you here
but<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.439> course<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.829> could<00:01:59.040> do<00:01:59.159> three<00:01:59.549> or<00:01:59.729> four

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
but of course you could do three or four

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.700 
but of course you could do three or four
rows<00:02:00.240> if<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.600> feel<00:02:00.810> like<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.110> have<00:02:01.259> three<00:02:01.560> or

four choices you know two is a really
nice<00:02:04.409> easy<00:02:04.799> number<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.430> have<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.030> when<00:02:06.689> when

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
nice easy number to have so when when

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.109 
nice easy number to have so when when
you<00:02:07.380> are<00:02:07.409> laying<00:02:07.979> out<00:02:08.280> these<00:02:08.459> cards<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.970> course

is in your mind already and I'm going to
lay<00:02:17.610> out<00:02:17.640> one<00:02:18.569> card<00:02:18.930> first<00:02:19.740> of<00:02:19.920> all<00:02:20.069> for<00:02:20.430> each

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
lay out one card first of all for each

first<00:02:25.440> card<00:02:25.800> I<00:02:26.040> really<00:02:26.790> usually<00:02:27.000> just

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
first card I really usually just

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.830 
first card I really usually just
interpret<00:02:28.260> as<00:02:28.530> where<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.550> stand<00:02:29.940> right<00:02:30.390> now

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
interpret as where you stand right now

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.520 
interpret as where you stand right now
or<00:02:31.260> where<00:02:31.709> you<00:02:31.980> would<00:02:32.220> be<00:02:32.430> beginning<00:02:33.209> in<00:02:33.690> each

or where you would be beginning in each
of<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.950> two<00:02:35.190> or<00:02:35.670> three<00:02:35.730> choices<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:37.110> you're

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
of the two or three choices that you're

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.070 
of the two or three choices that you're
wanting<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.820> find<00:02:39.030> out<00:02:39.180> more<00:02:39.420> about<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:39.930> this

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
wanting to find out more about so this

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.440 
wanting to find out more about so this
is<00:02:40.230> sort<00:02:40.440> of<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:41.130> beginning<00:02:41.670> point<00:02:41.940> for<00:02:42.330> each

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
is sort of the beginning point for each

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.080 
is sort of the beginning point for each
choice<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.319> have<00:02:43.350> before<00:02:43.739> you<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.459> then

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
choice that you have before you and then

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.510 
choice that you have before you and then
the<00:02:45.300> second<00:02:45.840> card<00:02:46.110> in<00:02:46.350> each<00:02:46.440> row<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:47.070> second

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
the second card in each row the second

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.120 
the second card in each row the second
card<00:02:47.730> in<00:02:47.940> each<00:02:48.150> choice<00:02:48.510> sort<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.500> represents

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
card in each choice sort of represents

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.040 
card in each choice sort of represents
what<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.370> would<00:02:50.640> have<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:51.000> work<00:02:51.270> through<00:02:51.810> or

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
what you would have to work through or

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.410 
what you would have to work through or
move<00:02:52.380> through<00:02:52.769> so<00:02:53.459> this<00:02:53.610> is<00:02:53.790> sort<00:02:54.060> of<00:02:54.180> like<00:02:54.390> a

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
move through so this is sort of like a

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.920 
move through so this is sort of like a
crossing<00:02:54.989> card<00:02:55.590> or<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:55.920> bridge<00:02:56.489> card<00:02:56.940> for<00:02:57.720> each

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
crossing card or a bridge card for each

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.949 
crossing card or a bridge card for each
choice<00:02:58.380> so<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.400> first<00:02:59.700> card<00:03:00.090> in<00:03:00.450> each<00:03:00.630> row

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
choice so the first card in each row

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.470 
choice so the first card in each row
again<00:03:01.580> represents<00:03:02.580> where<00:03:02.910> you<00:03:03.150> would<00:03:03.330> be

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
again represents where you would be

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.210 
again represents where you would be
starting<00:03:04.019> from<00:03:04.200> if<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:04.560> made<00:03:04.739> that<00:03:04.950> choice

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
starting from if you made that choice

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.940 
starting from if you made that choice
and<00:03:05.580> then<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.300> second<00:03:06.780> card<00:03:06.989> represents<00:03:07.800> the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
and then the second card represents the

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.190 
and then the second card represents the
crossing<00:03:08.640> or<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.510> thing<00:03:09.780> that<00:03:09.989> you<00:03:10.110> would

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
crossing or the thing that you would

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.100 
crossing or the thing that you would
have<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.560> work<00:03:10.800> through<00:03:11.340> if<00:03:11.550> you<00:03:12.150> chose<00:03:12.510> that

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
have to work through if you chose that

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.680 
have to work through if you chose that
particular<00:03:13.530> path<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.400> then<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.180> third<00:03:15.660> and

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
particular path and then the third and

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.250 
particular path and then the third and
final<00:03:16.500> cards<00:03:17.190> in<00:03:17.310> each<00:03:17.519> row<00:03:17.820> represents<00:03:18.260> the

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
final cards in each row represents the

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.640 
final cards in each row represents the
possible<00:03:20.040> or<00:03:20.220> probable<00:03:20.489> outcome<00:03:21.420> if<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:22.380> had

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
possible or probable outcome if you had

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.819 
possible or probable outcome if you had
chosen<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.820> choice<00:03:24.360> now<00:03:25.170> like<00:03:25.380> I<00:03:25.500> said<00:03:25.560> you

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
chosen that choice now like I said you

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.789 
chosen that choice now like I said you
could<00:03:26.190> lay<00:03:26.430> out<00:03:26.579> two<00:03:26.940> or<00:03:27.329> three<00:03:27.360> or<00:03:28.140> four<00:03:28.170> rows

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
could lay out two or three or four rows

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.460 
could lay out two or three or four rows
for<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.940> know<00:03:30.030> any<00:03:30.269> number<00:03:30.720> of<00:03:30.840> choices<00:03:31.440> that

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
for you know any number of choices that

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.160 
for you know any number of choices that
you<00:03:31.829> have<00:03:31.860> here<00:03:32.459> but<00:03:33.180> if<00:03:33.450> you're<00:03:33.660> really<00:03:33.989> just

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
you have here but if you're really just

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.050 
you have here but if you're really just
trying<00:03:34.799> to<00:03:34.980> get<00:03:35.160> a<00:03:35.190> definitive<00:03:35.640> answer

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
trying to get a definitive answer

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.199 
trying to get a definitive answer
without<00:03:36.630> thinking<00:03:37.320> too<00:03:37.620> much<00:03:37.650> about<00:03:38.280> which

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
without thinking too much about which

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.880 
without thinking too much about which
choice<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:39.690> should<00:03:40.200> be<00:03:40.350> having<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.860> course

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
choice you should be having of course

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.610 
choice you should be having of course
you<00:03:41.340> know<00:03:41.459> looking<00:03:42.269> at<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.570> three<00:03:42.870> cards<00:03:43.470> in

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
you know looking at the three cards in

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.170 
you know looking at the three cards in
each<00:03:43.829> row<00:03:44.130> is<00:03:44.280> going<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.549> give<00:03:44.730> you<00:03:44.880> a<00:03:44.910> lot<00:03:45.150> of

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
each row is going to give you a lot of

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.069 
each row is going to give you a lot of
information<00:03:45.420> about<00:03:46.290> each<00:03:47.250> choice<00:03:47.640> but<00:03:48.420> a<00:03:48.720> nice

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
information about each choice but a nice

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.110 
information about each choice but a nice
way<00:03:49.380> that<00:03:49.410> I<00:03:49.680> find<00:03:50.070> to<00:03:50.459> really<00:03:50.670> simplify

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
way that I find to really simplify

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.780 
way that I find to really simplify
matters<00:03:51.750> a<00:03:51.989> little<00:03:52.290> further<00:03:52.530> for<00:03:52.829> myself<00:03:53.190> is<00:03:53.370> I

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
matters a little further for myself is I

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.630 
matters a little further for myself is I
simply<00:03:54.299> look<00:03:54.540> at<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.930> number<00:03:55.410> of<00:03:55.640> reversed

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
simply look at the number of reversed

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.840 
simply look at the number of reversed
cards<00:03:57.209> versus<00:03:57.959> upright<00:03:58.560> cards<00:03:59.070> in<00:03:59.250> each<00:03:59.519> row

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
cards versus upright cards in each row

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.229 
cards versus upright cards in each row
and<00:04:00.090> if<00:04:00.660> there's<00:04:00.930> a<00:04:01.070> majority<00:04:02.070> of<00:04:02.280> reversed

clear very simple answer if you're

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.790 
clear very simple answer if you're
really<00:04:40.030> finding<00:04:40.780> that<00:04:40.900> you're<00:04:41.050> thinking<00:04:41.530> too

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
really finding that you're thinking too

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.010 
really finding that you're thinking too
much<00:04:41.830> about<00:04:42.100> different<00:04:42.880> choices<00:04:43.180> in<00:04:43.960> your

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
much about different choices in your

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.950 
much about different choices in your
life<00:04:44.250> so<00:04:45.250> this<00:04:45.370> is<00:04:45.490> a<00:04:45.550> very<00:04:45.850> simple<00:04:46.600> very<00:04:46.810> easy

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
life so this is a very simple very easy

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.160 
life so this is a very simple very easy
very<00:04:47.440> quick<00:04:47.770> spread<00:04:48.700> unless<00:04:49.660> of<00:04:49.840> course<00:04:49.870> you

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
very quick spread unless of course you

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.500 
very quick spread unless of course you
you're<00:04:50.560> laying<00:04:50.800> out<00:04:51.010> like<00:04:51.070> ten<00:04:51.550> choices<00:04:52.060> and

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
you're laying out like ten choices and

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.030 
you're laying out like ten choices and
then<00:04:52.630> it<00:04:52.750> becomes<00:04:53.080> you<00:04:53.320> know<00:04:53.350> very<00:04:53.770> very

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
then it becomes you know very very

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.970 
then it becomes you know very very
convoluted<00:04:54.880> indeed<00:04:55.540> but<00:04:56.320> I<00:04:56.350> think<00:04:56.680> you<00:04:56.860> know

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
convoluted indeed but I think you know

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.670 
convoluted indeed but I think you know
generally<00:04:57.610> it<00:04:57.850> does<00:04:58.540> have<00:04:59.170> a<00:04:59.200> lot<00:04:59.650> more

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
generally it does have a lot more

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.520 
generally it does have a lot more
directness<00:05:00.520> to<00:05:01.000> it<00:05:01.210> than<00:05:01.660> the<00:05:01.990> ten<00:05:02.230> card

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
directness to it than the ten card

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.920 
directness to it than the ten card
spreads<00:05:02.980> that<00:05:03.190> we<00:05:03.400> did<00:05:03.640> yesterday<00:05:03.970> and<00:05:04.540> it's

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
spreads that we did yesterday and it's

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.560 
spreads that we did yesterday and it's
one<00:05:05.170> that<00:05:05.440> I'll<00:05:05.680> very<00:05:06.040> often<00:05:06.640> work<00:05:06.880> with<00:05:07.180> if<00:05:07.390> I

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
one that I'll very often work with if I
