alright<00:00:27.300> let's<00:00:27.480> get<00:00:27.599> started<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.019> these<00:00:28.109> boots

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
alright let's get started on these boots

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.230 
alright let's get started on these boots
obviously<00:00:28.800> they're<00:00:29.279> an<00:00:29.369> extremely<00:00:30.029> unusual

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
obviously they're an extremely unusual

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.020 
obviously they're an extremely unusual
design<00:00:31.279> basically<00:00:32.279> what<00:00:32.489> under<00:00:32.669> armour<00:00:32.820> I've

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
design basically what under armour I've

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.260 
design basically what under armour I've
done<00:00:33.210> with<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:33.450> one<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.899> they<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.410> added<00:00:34.829> a

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
done with this one is they have added a

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.520 
done with this one is they have added a
synthetic<00:00:36.270> layer<00:00:36.480> underneath<00:00:36.899> if<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.230> open<00:00:37.469> up

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
synthetic layer underneath if I open up

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.200 
synthetic layer underneath if I open up
the<00:00:37.649> blue<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.980> can<00:00:38.010> see<00:00:38.280> there's<00:00:38.489> one<00:00:38.520> single

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
the blue you can see there's one single

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.819 
the blue you can see there's one single
piece<00:00:39.360> synthetic<00:00:39.809> layered<00:00:40.079> it's<00:00:40.260> pretty<00:00:40.469> thin

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
piece synthetic layered it's pretty thin

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.119 
piece synthetic layered it's pretty thin
it's<00:00:41.700> called<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.270> true<00:00:42.989> Vela<00:00:43.350> performance

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
it's called a true Vela performance

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.420 
it's called a true Vela performance
synthetic<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.620> what<00:00:46.620> I've<00:00:46.770> done<00:00:46.920> then<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.309> if

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
synthetic and what I've done then is if

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.979 
synthetic and what I've done then is if
add<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:48.000> rubberized<00:00:48.450> component

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
add this like rubberized component

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.260 
add this like rubberized component
across<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.410> top<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.640> comes<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.059> very

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
across the top and it comes in a very

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.299 
across the top and it comes in a very
unusual<00:00:51.840> design<00:00:52.559> i'll<00:00:52.800> bring<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:52.980> up<00:00:53.160> close

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
unusual design i'll bring you up close

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.580 
unusual design i'll bring you up close
to<00:00:53.430> two<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:54.000> check<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.360> out<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:55.350> basically

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
to two you can check it out so basically

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.729 
to two you can check it out so basically
these<00:00:55.710> are<00:00:55.770> like<00:00:55.980> little<00:00:56.129> cards<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.739> acts

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
these are like little cards and acts

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.020 
these are like little cards and acts
like<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:59.010> support<00:00:59.399> system<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.910> they've

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
like a support system so they've

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.349 
like a support system so they've
actually<00:01:00.149> overlaid<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.780> over<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.170> synthetic

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
actually overlaid it over to synthetic

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.450 
actually overlaid it over to synthetic
and<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.690> runs<00:01:03.899> all<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.229> way<00:01:04.379> right<00:01:05.040> around<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
and it runs all the way right around the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.179 
and it runs all the way right around the
boot<00:01:06.680> adds<00:01:07.680> texture<00:01:09.619> all<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.979> way<00:01:11.070> around

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
boot adds texture all the way around

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.719 
boot adds texture all the way around
through<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> heel<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:13.460> again<00:01:14.460> through<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
through the heel and again through the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.630 
through the heel and again through the
side<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:16.770> only<00:01:16.920> area<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.369> boot<00:01:17.520> that

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
side the only area of the boot that

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.070 
side the only area of the boot that
doesn't<00:01:17.970> have<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.210> robot<00:01:18.600> rubberized

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
doesn't have this robot rubberized

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.140 
doesn't have this robot rubberized
component<00:01:19.560> component<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> tongue<00:01:20.909> even

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
component component is a tongue even

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.310 
component component is a tongue even
though<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.390> looks<00:01:21.420> like<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.750> has<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.049> design

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
though it looks like it has the design

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.410 
though it looks like it has the design
is<00:01:22.590> actually<00:01:22.950> smooth<00:01:25.880> let's<00:01:26.880> boot<00:01:27.090> weighs<00:01:27.270> in

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
is actually smooth let's boot weighs in

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.050 
is actually smooth let's boot weighs in
at<00:01:27.509> eight<00:01:27.750> ounces<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:28.619> hard<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.490> know<00:01:29.640> how<00:01:30.000> to

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
at eight ounces it's hard to know how to

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.730 
at eight ounces it's hard to know how to
categorize<00:01:30.390> them<00:01:30.930> they're<00:01:31.470> not<00:01:31.619> necessarily

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
categorize them they're not necessarily

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.140 
categorize them they're not necessarily
a<00:01:32.130> power<00:01:32.400> boot<00:01:32.700> they're<00:01:32.939> not<00:01:33.060> necessarily

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
a power boot they're not necessarily

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.210 
a power boot they're not necessarily
control<00:01:33.869> although<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.439> do<00:01:34.619> feel<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
control although I do feel like the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.469 
control although I do feel like the
texture<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.880> going<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.119> add<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.450> a

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
texture on it is going to add it a

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.840 
texture on it is going to add it a
little<00:01:36.720> bit<00:01:36.869> more<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.140> control<00:01:37.670> dynamic<00:01:38.670> to

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
little bit more of a control dynamic to

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.560 
little bit more of a control dynamic to
the<00:01:38.880> boot<00:01:40.460> but<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:41.939> hard<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.270> define

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
the boot but it's it's hard to define

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.990 
the boot but it's it's hard to define
them<00:01:42.810> are<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.890> answers<00:01:44.310> are<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.490> an<00:01:44.700> ideal

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
them are the answers are in an ideal

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.429 
them are the answers are in an ideal
range<00:01:45.270> though<00:01:45.540> they're<00:01:45.720> more<00:01:45.869> kind<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.170> like<00:01:46.229> a

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
range though they're more kind of like a

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:55.609 
range though they're more kind of like a
and<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:47.729> hybrid<00:01:48.180> boot<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.869> sorts<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:55.229> subway

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
and a hybrid boot of sorts the subway

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.830 
and a hybrid boot of sorts the subway
again<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:56.189> pretty<00:01:56.610> unusual<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.540> called<00:01:57.750> a

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
again is pretty unusual this is called a

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
these boots out put them in play and

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.750 
these boots out put them in play and
they<00:02:29.780> should<00:02:30.020> feel<00:02:30.200> pretty<00:02:30.470> good<00:02:30.710> in<00:02:30.980> terms<00:02:31.550> of

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
they should feel pretty good in terms of

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.180 
they should feel pretty good in terms of
the<00:02:31.910> sole<00:02:32.120> play<00:02:32.390> how<00:02:33.230> much<00:02:33.440> support<00:02:33.620> this<00:02:33.920> adds

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
the sole play how much support this adds

the sole play how much support this adds
then<00:02:34.970> we're<00:02:35.600> going<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:35.780> see<00:02:35.930> join<00:02:36.170> testing<00:02:36.620> i

booth<00:03:58.910> at<00:03:59.150> that<00:03:59.570> the<00:04:00.260> owner<00:04:00.560> arm<00:04:00.709> are<00:04:00.800> looking

booth at that the owner arm are looking

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.500 
booth at that the owner arm are looking
to<00:04:01.130> do<00:04:01.250> is<00:04:01.400> there<00:04:01.550> i'm<00:04:01.850> looking<00:04:02.060> to<00:04:02.150> add<00:04:02.300> like<00:04:02.480> a

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
to do is there i'm looking to add like a

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.570 
to do is there i'm looking to add like a
two-way<00:04:03.019> stretch<00:04:03.470> so<00:04:04.160> you<00:04:04.220> can<00:04:04.550> actually

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
two-way stretch so you can actually

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.790 
two-way stretch so you can actually
stretch<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:05.269> boot<00:04:05.450> pretty<00:04:05.840> pretty<00:04:06.230> easily<00:04:06.530> in

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
stretch the boot pretty pretty easily in

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.350 
stretch the boot pretty pretty easily in
both<00:04:06.950> directions<00:04:07.100> and<00:04:08.260> so<00:04:09.260> it<00:04:09.320> adds<00:04:09.500> that<00:04:09.739> like

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
both directions and so it adds that like

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.080 
both directions and so it adds that like
natural<00:04:11.360> feel<00:04:11.690> on<00:04:11.959> the<00:04:12.110> ball<00:04:12.400> and<00:04:13.400> that's<00:04:13.670> very

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
natural feel on the ball and that's very

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.520 
natural feel on the ball and that's very
similar<00:04:14.390> to<00:04:14.570> what<00:04:14.690> Puma<00:04:15.080> have<00:04:15.200> done<00:04:15.410> with

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
similar to what Puma have done with

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.650 
similar to what Puma have done with
their<00:04:15.709> evil<00:04:16.130> power<00:04:16.310> and<00:04:16.669> I<00:04:16.940> mean<00:04:17.150> I<00:04:17.180> can<00:04:17.359> easily

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
their evil power and I mean I can easily

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.449 
their evil power and I mean I can easily
just<00:04:18.169> bend<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.560> boot<00:04:18.709> so<00:04:18.859> you<00:04:18.950> can<00:04:19.100> see<00:04:19.280> how<00:04:19.400> do

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
just bend the boot so you can see how do

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.390 
just bend the boot so you can see how do
you<00:04:19.609> add<00:04:19.820> up<00:04:19.850> like<00:04:20.150> upper<00:04:20.570> stretches<00:04:21.400> so

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
you add up like upper stretches so

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.500 
you add up like upper stretches so
they're<00:04:22.550> looking<00:04:22.640> to<00:04:22.789> kind<00:04:22.940> of<00:04:23.060> do<00:04:23.180> the<00:04:23.300> same

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
they're looking to kind of do the same

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.240 
they're looking to kind of do the same
thing<00:04:23.690> with<00:04:23.840> Bob<00:04:23.990> boots<00:04:24.200> obviously<00:04:24.770> what<00:04:25.039> who

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
thing with Bob boots obviously what who

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.840 
thing with Bob boots obviously what who
have<00:04:25.400> done<00:04:25.610> is

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
have done is

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.020 
have done is
they<00:04:25.940> focused<00:04:26.360> on<00:04:26.480> power<00:04:26.710> whereas<00:04:27.710> the<00:04:28.030> the

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
they focused on power whereas the the

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.210 
they focused on power whereas the the
club<00:04:29.240> coach<00:04:29.750> fit<00:04:29.960> series<00:04:30.260> from<00:04:30.740> under<00:04:30.950> armour

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
club coach fit series from under armour

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.260 
club coach fit series from under armour
is<00:04:31.400> a<00:04:31.430> little<00:04:31.670> bit<00:04:31.760> different<00:04:32.060> because<00:04:32.120> it

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
is a little bit different because it

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.240 
is a little bit different because it
doesn't<00:04:32.510> have<00:04:32.600> that<00:04:32.750> direct<00:04:33.290> power<00:04:33.740> element

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
doesn't have that direct power element

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.550 
doesn't have that direct power element
and<00:04:34.780> but<00:04:35.780> they've<00:04:35.900> got<00:04:35.960> those<00:04:36.200> similarities

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
and but they've got those similarities

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.020 
and but they've got those similarities
and<00:04:36.920> leather<00:04:37.040> boot<00:04:37.250> to<00:04:37.370> kind<00:04:37.550> of<00:04:37.610> compare<00:04:37.760> them

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
and leather boot to kind of compare them

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.590 
and leather boot to kind of compare them
to<00:04:38.060> the<00:04:38.210> warrior<00:04:39.140> skreamer<00:04:39.910> it's<00:04:40.910> hard<00:04:41.180> again

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
to the warrior skreamer it's hard again

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.910 
to the warrior skreamer it's hard again
the<00:04:41.780> Screamers<00:04:42.110> not<00:04:42.260> one<00:04:42.440> of<00:04:42.470> those<00:04:42.560> ones<00:04:42.800> that

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
the Screamers not one of those ones that

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.860 
the Screamers not one of those ones that
we<00:04:43.250> kind<00:04:43.370> of<00:04:43.460> put<00:04:43.580> in<00:04:43.700> the<00:04:43.790> power<00:04:44.030> category<00:04:44.510> but

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
we kind of put in the power category but

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.090 
we kind of put in the power category but
it<00:04:44.960> doesn't<00:04:45.170> necessarily<00:04:45.200> have<00:04:45.740> a<00:04:45.770> power

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
it doesn't necessarily have a power

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.100 
it doesn't necessarily have a power
component<00:04:46.580> it's<00:04:46.700> very<00:04:46.910> similar<00:04:47.180> to<00:04:47.330> the<00:04:47.720> club

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
component it's very similar to the club

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.630 
component it's very similar to the club
coach<00:04:48.500> script<00:04:48.740> perl<00:04:48.950> and<00:04:48.980> the<00:04:49.160> fact<00:04:49.370> that<00:04:49.430> has

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
coach script perl and the fact that has

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.250 
coach script perl and the fact that has
those<00:04:49.820> rubberized<00:04:50.270> components<00:04:50.810> on<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:50.990> upper

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
those rubberized components on the upper

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.830 
those rubberized components on the upper
obviously<00:04:52.100> on<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.220> screamer<00:04:52.640> it's<00:04:53.000> not<00:04:53.480> to<00:04:53.690> do

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
obviously on the screamer it's not to do

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.570 
obviously on the screamer it's not to do
with<00:04:53.870> stretch<00:04:54.320> on<00:04:54.620> this<00:04:54.830> one<00:04:55.040> it's<00:04:55.250> just<00:04:55.460> the

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
with stretch on this one it's just the

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.550 
with stretch on this one it's just the
gut<00:04:55.760> to<00:04:55.790> do<00:04:56.030> with<00:04:56.240> that<00:04:56.270> cover<00:04:57.050> in<00:04:57.200> the<00:04:57.350> zone

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
gut to do with that cover in the zone

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.590 
gut to do with that cover in the zone
the<00:04:57.710> strike<00:04:57.740> zone<00:04:58.010> and<00:04:58.880> giving<00:04:59.240> you<00:04:59.330> something

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
the strike zone and giving you something

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.640 
the strike zone and giving you something
a<00:04:59.750> little<00:04:59.870> bit<00:05:00.050> different<00:05:00.320> in<00:05:00.380> terms<00:05:00.500> of

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
a little bit different in terms of

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.000 
a little bit different in terms of
performance<00:05:01.240> so<00:05:02.240> don't<00:05:02.390> we<00:05:02.450> have<00:05:02.570> a<00:05:02.600> guys

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
performance so don't we have a guys

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.680 
performance so don't we have a guys
