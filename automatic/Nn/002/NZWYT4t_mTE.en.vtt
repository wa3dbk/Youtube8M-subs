00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.560 
going to punch me as I can show you this
better<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:33.620> bam<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.860> got<00:00:35.070> poisoned<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.790> also<00:00:36.540> I

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
better and bam I got poisoned and also I

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.720 
better and bam I got poisoned and also I
have<00:00:37.290> no<00:00:37.730> effect<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:38.879> me<00:00:40.219> so<00:00:41.219> let<00:00:41.370> me<00:00:41.520> show<00:00:41.670> you

have no effect on me so let me show you

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.819 
have no effect on me so let me show you
how<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.059> works<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.260> whole<00:00:43.410> system<00:00:43.620> is

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
how this works and the whole system is

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.869 
how this works and the whole system is
apart<00:00:44.219> it's<00:00:45.120> operated<00:00:45.629> by<00:00:45.840> those<00:00:46.350> comic<00:00:46.649> books

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
apart it's operated by those comic books

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.439 
apart it's operated by those comic books
so<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.809> got<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.320> tell<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.890> it's<00:00:50.449> it's

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
so I have got to tell you that it's it's

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.650 
so I have got to tell you that it's it's
this<00:00:52.170> system<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.070> fastest<00:00:53.640> one<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.030> also

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
this system is the fastest one and also

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.380 
this system is the fastest one and also
the<00:00:54.840> simplest<00:00:55.110> one<00:00:55.440> but<00:00:56.039> it's<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.699> probably

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
the simplest one but it's it's probably

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.779 
the simplest one but it's it's probably
not<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.629> design<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.739> would<00:00:58.859> use<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.309> your<00:00:59.340> in

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
not that design you would use in your in

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.750 
not that design you would use in your in
your<00:01:00.719> Advent<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.620> your<00:01:01.770> adventure<00:01:02.309> map<00:01:02.520> or

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
your Advent in your adventure map or

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.140 
your Advent in your adventure map or
whatever<00:01:03.180> ok<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.920> row<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.430> command

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
whatever ok so it is a row of command

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.450 
whatever ok so it is a row of command
blocks<00:01:06.450> indicates<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.680> health<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.310> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
blocks indicates the health of the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.179 
blocks indicates the health of the
player<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.060> punched<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:10.229> when<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
player that is punched so when the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.690 
player that is punched so when the
player<00:01:11.369> has<00:01:11.460> got<00:01:11.850> 20<00:01:12.810> health<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.369> then<00:01:14.369> it

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
player has got 20 health and then it

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.450 
player has got 20 health and then it
immediately<00:01:14.909> goes<00:01:15.600> down<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.350> 13<00:01:16.979> health<00:01:17.220> it

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
immediately goes down to 13 health it

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.570 
immediately goes down to 13 health it
can<00:01:17.700> reach<00:01:17.970> some<00:01:18.210> outlet<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.920> this<00:01:19.920> second

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
can reach some outlet and this second

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.600 
can reach some outlet and this second
row<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.820> command<00:01:21.210> blocks<00:01:21.420> just<00:01:21.659> test<00:01:22.470> if<00:01:22.740> a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
row of command blocks just test if a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.649 
row of command blocks just test if a
player<00:01:24.240> has<00:01:24.659> got<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.170> damaged<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.659> statistic

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
player has got a damaged the statistic

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.120 
player has got a damaged the statistic
of<00:01:27.810> damage<00:01:28.200> dealed<00:01:28.820> at<00:01:29.820> 1<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.049> then<00:01:31.350> resets<00:01:31.920> it

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
of damage dealed at 1 and then resets it

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.280 
of damage dealed at 1 and then resets it
and<00:01:32.310> then<00:01:32.820> generates<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.420> other<00:01:33.600> output<00:01:33.810> and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
and then generates the other output and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.960 
and then generates the other output and
when<00:01:34.710> both<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.520> outputs<00:01:36.020> are<00:01:37.729> active<00:01:38.729> and

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
when both of the outputs are active and

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.859 
when both of the outputs are active and
the<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.200> logic<00:01:40.590> gate<00:01:40.799> generates<00:01:41.600> that<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
the this logic gate generates that the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.560 
the this logic gate generates that the
redstone<00:01:43.560> signal<00:01:43.710> here<00:01:44.520> which<00:01:44.790> poisons<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
redstone signal here which poisons the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.889 
redstone signal here which poisons the
player<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.409> has<00:01:46.680> got<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.820> 14<00:01:48.299> health<00:01:48.600> or

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
player that has got the 14 health or

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.609 
player that has got the 14 health or
whatever<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:51.390> why<00:01:51.720> wouldn't<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.200> want<00:01:52.439> this

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
whatever so why wouldn't you want this

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.980 
whatever so why wouldn't you want this
design<00:01:53.220> on<00:01:53.430> your<00:01:53.610> adventure<00:01:54.240> map<00:01:54.450> there<00:01:54.840> are<00:01:54.930> a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
design on your adventure map there are a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.990 
design on your adventure map there are a
couple<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.320> reasons<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:56.130> first<00:01:56.280> one<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.939> that

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
couple of reasons the first one is that

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.510 
couple of reasons the first one is that
you<00:01:57.600> can<00:01:57.750> simulate<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.439> statistic<00:01:59.040> damage

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
you can simulate the statistic damage

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.600 
you can simulate the statistic damage
dealt<00:01:59.759> by<00:02:00.060> punching<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.140> mob<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.770> if<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.430> person

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
dealt by punching a mob so if a person

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.880 
dealt by punching a mob so if a person
falls<00:02:03.329> down<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> cliff<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.409> continuously

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
falls down a cliff and you continuously

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.980 
falls down a cliff and you continuously
punch<00:02:05.219> em<00:02:05.430> up<00:02:05.579> then<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.329> person<00:02:06.719> will<00:02:06.869> get

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
punch em up then this person will get

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.850 
punch em up then this person will get
poisoned<00:02:07.439> but<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.129> came<00:02:08.310> up<00:02:08.670> with<00:02:08.910> some<00:02:09.599> other

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
poisoned but I came up with some other

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.800 
poisoned but I came up with some other
ideas<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.129> can<00:02:11.310> prevent<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.599> first

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
ideas that can prevent it so the first

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.880 
ideas that can prevent it so the first
one<00:02:12.989> is<00:02:13.020> giving<00:02:13.410> the

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
one is giving the

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.670 
one is giving the
person<00:02:14.220> sort<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.300> so<00:02:16.020> much<00:02:16.260> damage<00:02:16.650> that

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
person sort that is so much damage that

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.940 
person sort that is so much damage that
it<00:02:17.310> lasts<00:02:17.850> only<00:02:18.060> for<00:02:18.390> one<00:02:18.569> hit<00:02:18.840> so<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.800> would

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
it lasts only for one hit so that would

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.220 
it lasts only for one hit so that would
prevent<00:02:20.310> like<00:02:20.640> punching<00:02:21.120> em<00:02:21.390> up<00:02:21.720> continuously

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
prevent like punching em up continuously

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.280 
prevent like punching em up continuously
and<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:23.430> second<00:02:23.730> idea<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:24.270> actually<00:02:24.990> giving

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
and the second idea is actually giving

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.940 
and the second idea is actually giving
the<00:02:25.440> player<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.709> map<00:02:26.100> that<00:02:26.400> gives<00:02:27.380> you<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.560> sort

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
the player a map that gives you a sort

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.070 
the player a map that gives you a sort
but<00:02:29.850> just<00:02:30.330> for<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.540> while

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
but just for a while

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.600 
but just for a while
so<00:02:31.470> that<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:32.400> controls<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.780> what<00:02:34.230> these<00:02:34.610> two

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
so that it controls the what these two

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.770 
so that it controls the what these two
seconds<00:02:36.030> when<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:37.200> can<00:02:37.470> when<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.780> poison

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
seconds when you can when the poison

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.449 
seconds when you can when the poison
sword<00:02:40.050> works<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:42.410> so<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.709> would<00:02:43.920> prevent

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
sword works and so that would prevent

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.020 
sword works and so that would prevent
like<00:02:45.350> goofing<00:02:46.350> around<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:47.040> punching<00:02:47.700> stuff

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
like goofing around and punching stuff

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.020 
like goofing around and punching stuff
to<00:02:48.330> get<00:02:48.540> other<00:02:49.080> people<00:02:49.620> poisoned<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:52.640> so<00:02:53.640> that

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
to get other people poisoned and so that

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.680 
to get other people poisoned and so that
is<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:54.420> but<00:02:54.830> only<00:02:55.830> if<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.459> haven't<00:02:57.269> got<00:02:57.510> to

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
is it but only if you haven't got to

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.160 
is it but only if you haven't got to
like<00:02:57.840> mobs<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.590> you<00:02:59.250> have<00:02:59.489> good<00:02:59.810> adventure<00:03:00.810> an

adventure game mode on your map then in

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.890

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
the system the fastest and easiest one

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.150 
the system the fastest and easiest one
works<00:03:10.620> just<00:03:11.160> fine<00:03:11.580> because<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:13.200> only<00:03:13.530> thing

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
works just fine because the only thing

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.060 
works just fine because the only thing
that<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.489> can<00:03:14.640> punch<00:03:14.880> is<00:03:15.330> another<00:03:15.810> player<00:03:16.070> so

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
that you can punch is another player so
