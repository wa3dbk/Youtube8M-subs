00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.069
 Hello I am the sander of the horses 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.589
 inside.com and I want to meet me today 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.230
 from given occasion deal with 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.969
 the theme support of the horse 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.040
 maybe the old fairness as well 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.040
 all horses in the coat change 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.140
 Unfortunately , the change of coat will be with many 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.629
 horses still underestimated and 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.090
 although most horse owners in the 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.829
 Remember spring that too 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.079
 Support when you get your winter dress 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.739
 It often gets lost in autumn 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.019
 to forget 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.910
 but that is still very important because 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.040
 In the autumn is actually like that 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.699
 that also the cell support 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.430
 need 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.710
 I have here today 34 years old 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.470
 my first horse since 27 years are 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.019
 we have a team and the heidi has me completely 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.390
 many things learned but among other things 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:04.030
 also how important it is not just old 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.430
 horses recommend to support change 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.130
 The change of coat is actually for 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.350
 every horse a certain effort and 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.540
 associated with it also a load for 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.479
 the metabolism and thus also the 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.840
 immune system many horses have in autumn 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.090
 in fact too little so too little 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.119
 Minerals but maybe too little 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.830
 amino acids they receive and 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.770
 easily through the change of fur too 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.659
 Come and see a change of skin 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.460
 You do not always immediately as the owner 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:38.219
 in older horses it is indeed 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:41.170
 so sometimes thats a bit 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:44.399
 weaker that they are more like this 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:48.219
 a bit phlegmatic and tired 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.249
 that you have slow training while in training 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:52.810
 So it's a relatively long journey 

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:55.270
 need up phases that are so 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.130
 typical signs where you can recognize 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.319
 that the horse's change of coat bit 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.719
 has problems or that too 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.939
 Change of coat just takes a long time 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.469
 and sometimes it really can 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.719
 cause the immune system that way 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.520
 attacked is that the horse for 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:13.230
 example 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.620
 simply on flu viruses or just 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.850
 bacteria, etc 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.520
 with all sorts of signs like living or 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.230
 just cough and react like that 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.120
 that is, if the immune system is not 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.070
 It will work more well then 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.440
 horses just finished and then you can 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.150
 so small scratches on the legs too 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.940
 relatively easy to ignite and 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.980
 Just lead regions just because that 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.010
 no more horse himself, so to speak 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.440
 of metabolism and immune system 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.050
 can sufficiently defend the 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.820
 Change of fur as I said is exhausting 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.620
 for horses is not just for old horses 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.810
 like the heath exhausting but for 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.910
 every horse and by that I recommend 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.140
 vehemently the change of coat both in the 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.540
 spring as well as in the fall actually 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.010
 to support 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.400
 recommend a hermes scientist 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.260
 Here are three components that are extremely important 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.080
 of course there are many more but 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.990
 Zinc is very important as it were 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.870
 king of the trace elements is zinc 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:14.680
 classic trace element for skin hair 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:18.459
 and skin health and really 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.640
 the immune system magnesium as it were 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.070
 king of minerals organizes quite 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.600
 many metabolic processes in veert and 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.110
 is quite often forgotten 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.600
 but there are studies that magnesium because 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.890
 easy in many metabolic processes 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.280
 the horse support for example 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.050
 it can only help with summer itch 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.120
 On the edge there are studies I would like 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.590
 it does not have any feed advice 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.240
 make but there are actually 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.370
 Studies that prove that 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.980
 that means magnesium is very important and 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.530
 also essential amino acids that 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.080
 is called protein building blocks and even if the 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.820
 horses are still on grass now are the grass 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.709
 Composition in relation to 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.730
 Spring grass is different now 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:03.670
 it has less protein in it for it 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.860
 horse more incriminating sugar and starch 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.180
 the many horses are not that good 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.010
 can metabolize 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.380
 and that makes it all the more important 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.660
 support the horses position in 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.459
 your metabolism and I go because of that 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.560
 But horses can do that for themselves 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.790
 Do as he would like the horse owner 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.919
 I have great experiences 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.709
 namely with the heidi has ten 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.240
 for years 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.610
 in the past quite bad winter 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.169
 confused though I have 1000 people 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.090
 there were and really many 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.370
 products and useful things 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.039
 have tried and right now 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.870
 I have been feeding for three years now or 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.759
 four years I do not know now 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.099
 just this horse's hand from down pure 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:42.020
 and I'm super happy with that 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:44.889
 horses change and problematic field 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.210
 in some form dull or 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.370
 to become weak or otherwise 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.169
 somehow attacked by the immune system too 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.940
 but of course you can too 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.320
 other products use the 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.729
 ideally have high availability zinc 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.710
 ideally looked and coupled already 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.410
 of amino acids because to metabolize 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.150
 the horses the best 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.430
 magnesium and always because of it 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.590
 Think if the horse in the field change too 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.440
 Enough protein is consumed 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:15.440
 because what is just part of each 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.199
 hair protein becomes simple and that will 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.490
 unfortunately often forgotten when you 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:22.449
 are not sure then ask your 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.419
 rewards or feed experts 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:27.440
 that only as a hint for the change of fur 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.479
 and I thank you for yours 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.759
 attention and wish you much 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.940
 fun with the other videos on youtube 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:36.800
 eg how can I circle my horse 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.990
 moderately support a whole 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.820
 important topic in the change of skin have 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.650
 we have another video from horse insider 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.330
 filmed that you find in our channel 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.080
 and I recommend this to you 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.090
 subscribe to 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.530
 then it's free and it will 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.210
 really many great tips and 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:54.460
 Information for you and your horse 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.460
 see you soon your sandra
