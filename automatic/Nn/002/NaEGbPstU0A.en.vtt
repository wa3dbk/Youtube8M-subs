after<00:00:01.860> you've<00:00:02.600> considered<00:00:03.600> sort<00:00:04.080> of<00:00:04.170> a<00:00:04.230> long

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
after you've considered sort of a long

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.289 
after you've considered sort of a long
list<00:00:04.680> of<00:00:04.859> schools<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.609> you<00:00:05.759> begin<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.060> narrow

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
list of schools and you begin to narrow

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.450 
list of schools and you begin to narrow
it<00:00:06.480> down<00:00:06.540> one<00:00:07.080> of<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.259> things<00:00:07.500> people

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
it down one of the things people

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.400 
it down one of the things people
struggle<00:00:08.880> with<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:09.120> how<00:00:09.480> many<00:00:09.540> schools<00:00:10.080> should

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
struggle with is how many schools should

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.070 
struggle with is how many schools should
they<00:00:10.559> apply<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.599> here's<00:00:12.599> where<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:12.840> think

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
they apply to and here's where I think

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.049 
they apply to and here's where I think
you'll<00:00:13.230> want<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.469> consider<00:00:13.590> how<00:00:14.250> conservative

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
you'll want to consider how conservative

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.750 
you'll want to consider how conservative
or<00:00:15.240> how<00:00:15.330> risky<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.080> approach<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:17.400> would<00:00:17.550> like

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
or how risky and approach you would like

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.630 
or how risky and approach you would like
to<00:00:17.940> take<00:00:18.260> so<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.380> average<00:00:19.529> applicant<00:00:20.490> will

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
to take so the average applicant will

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.259 
to take so the average applicant will
target<00:00:21.170> five<00:00:22.170> or<00:00:22.380> six<00:00:22.650> schools<00:00:23.119> but<00:00:24.119> for

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
target five or six schools but for

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.210 
target five or six schools but for
instance<00:00:24.570> if<00:00:24.689> you're<00:00:24.960> someone<00:00:25.470> who<00:00:25.830> knows<00:00:26.039> you

instance if you're someone who knows you

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.130

have<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.430> flexibility<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.240> attend<00:00:27.779> business

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
choose to take a more risky approach and

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.930 
choose to take a more risky approach and
by<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.690> mean<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:34.800> may<00:00:34.950> choose<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.280> only

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
by that I mean you may choose to only

by that I mean you may choose to only

apply to very hard to get into schools

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.240 
apply to very hard to get into schools
as<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:39.480> will<00:00:39.600> give<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.250> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
as that will give you the the

as that will give you the the
assuredness<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:42.510> you'll<00:00:42.660> be<00:00:42.809> able<00:00:42.960> to

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
attend only a school that you really

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.770 
attend only a school that you really
like<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.710> attend<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:48.149> other<00:00:48.270> hand<00:00:48.480> if<00:00:48.660> you

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
like to attend on the other hand if you

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.479 
like to attend on the other hand if you
know<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.079> necessary<00:00:49.649> for<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.160> attend

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
know it's necessary for you to attend

Business School in this upcoming year

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.900 
Business School in this upcoming year
you'll<00:00:53.520> probably<00:00:53.850> want<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.300> expand<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.840> list

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
you'll probably want to expand that list

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.660 
you'll probably want to expand that list
beyond<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.500> four<00:00:58.500> or<00:00:58.590> five<00:00:58.770> schools<00:00:59.129> but<00:00:59.460> to

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
beyond just four or five schools but to

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.520 
beyond just four or five schools but to
five<00:00:59.879> or<00:01:00.030> six<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:01.170> might<00:01:01.350> actually

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
five or six and you might actually

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.850 
five or six and you might actually
consider<00:01:02.149> applying<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> greater<00:01:03.989> mix<00:01:04.530> of

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
consider applying to a greater mix of

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.390 
consider applying to a greater mix of
schools<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.700> 12<00:01:06.210> too<00:01:06.659> risky<00:01:07.170> schools<00:01:07.470> with

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
schools so 12 too risky schools with

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.300 
schools so 12 too risky schools with
maybe<00:01:09.150> two<00:01:09.479> more<00:01:09.720> solid<00:01:10.260> schools<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.189> are

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
maybe two more solid schools that are

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.310 
maybe two more solid schools that are
really<00:01:11.549> within<00:01:11.820> your<00:01:11.970> sweet<00:01:12.270> spot<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.780> then

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
really within your sweet spot and then

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.179 
really within your sweet spot and then
12<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.880> safer<00:01:14.880> schools<00:01:15.229> of<00:01:16.229> course<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:17.040> other

12 to safer schools of course the other

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.740 
12 to safer schools of course the other
thing<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.430> can't<00:01:17.729> overlook<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:18.450> process

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
thing you can't overlook in this process

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.350 
thing you can't overlook in this process
is<00:01:19.229> how<00:01:19.650> much<00:01:19.830> time<00:01:20.100> do<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.310> have<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.520> devote

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
is how much time do you have to devote

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.660 
is how much time do you have to devote
to<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.689> application<00:01:22.200> process<00:01:22.650> many<00:01:23.520> people

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
to the application process many people

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.539 
to the application process many people
find<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.840> process<00:01:25.080> takes<00:01:25.590> them<00:01:25.799> many

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
find that this process takes them many

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.100 
find that this process takes them many
more<00:01:26.729> hours<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.299> week<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.750> many<00:01:27.960> more

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
more hours in a week and many more

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.289 
more hours in a week and many more
months<00:01:28.350> than<00:01:28.590> they<00:01:28.680> anticipated<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.180> if

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
months than they anticipated and so if

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.120 
months than they anticipated and so if
you're<00:01:30.479> beginning<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.170> apply<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:31.950> two

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
you're beginning to apply just two

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.010 
you're beginning to apply just two
months<00:01:32.280> before<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.790> deadlines<00:01:33.210> it's

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
months before the deadlines it's

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.749 
months before the deadlines it's
probably<00:01:34.259> not<00:01:34.619> realistic<00:01:34.920> for<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.549> apply

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
probably not realistic for you to apply

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.550 
probably not realistic for you to apply
to<00:01:35.850> six<00:01:36.210> goals<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.869> you'll<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.290> think

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
to six goals and you'll have to think

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.380 
to six goals and you'll have to think
about<00:01:37.680> taking<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.400> more<00:01:38.970> conservative

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
about taking a more conservative
