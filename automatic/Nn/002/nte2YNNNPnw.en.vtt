anything better comes along i am

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.920 
anything better comes along i am
thinking<00:02:26.140> however<00:02:26.620> of<00:02:28.019> getting<00:02:29.019> the<00:02:30.930> prequel

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
thinking however of getting the prequel

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.050 
thinking however of getting the prequel
on<00:02:32.190> blu-ray<00:02:33.660> but<00:02:34.660> i<00:02:34.690> don't<00:02:34.959> know<00:02:35.049> if<00:02:35.140> that<00:02:35.290> be

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
on blu-ray but i don't know if that be

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.170 
on blu-ray but i don't know if that be
considered<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.380> double<00:02:38.380> dipping<00:02:38.910> so<00:02:39.910> i<00:02:39.940> really

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
considered a double dipping so i really

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.849 
considered a double dipping so i really
don't<00:02:40.269> know<00:02:40.420> what<00:02:40.570> I'm<00:02:40.630> going<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.350> do<00:02:41.530> as<00:02:41.709> far

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
don't know what I'm going to do as far

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.759 
don't know what I'm going to do as far
as<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.040> blu-ray<00:02:42.459> kjetil<00:02:43.180> collection<00:02:43.690> or<00:02:43.959> just

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
as the blu-ray kjetil collection or just

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.960 
as the blu-ray kjetil collection or just
get<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.070> prequel<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:45.959> wait<00:02:46.959> for<00:02:47.200> something

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
get the prequel and wait for something

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.759 
get the prequel and wait for something
hope<00:02:48.970> for<00:02:49.150> something<00:02:49.299> better<00:02:49.420> for<00:02:49.810> the

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
hope for something better for the

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.140 
hope for something better for the
original<00:02:51.760> trilogy<00:02:53.190> or<00:02:54.190> one<00:02:54.700> idea<00:02:54.910> that<00:02:54.970> I

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
original trilogy or one idea that I

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.360 
original trilogy or one idea that I
actually<00:02:55.540> thought<00:02:55.870> since<00:02:56.410> they're<00:02:57.190> going<00:02:57.310> to

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
actually thought since they're going to

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.539 
actually thought since they're going to
be<00:02:57.459> releasing<00:02:58.150> these<00:02:58.269> in<00:02:58.829> in<00:02:59.829> the<00:02:59.950> theaters<00:03:00.250> in

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
be releasing these in in the theaters in

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.680 
be releasing these in in the theaters in
3d<00:03:00.970> since<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:01.870> have<00:03:01.900> a<00:03:02.049> 3d<00:03:02.410> TV<00:03:03.569> hopefully<00:03:04.569> in<00:03:04.630> the

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
3d since I have a 3d TV hopefully in the

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.590 
3d since I have a 3d TV hopefully in the
future<00:03:05.160> Lucas<00:03:06.160> will<00:03:06.310> do<00:03:06.639> something<00:03:06.819> crazy<00:03:07.389> and

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
future Lucas will do something crazy and

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.940 
future Lucas will do something crazy and
release<00:03:08.410> something<00:03:08.650> 3d<00:03:09.480> but<00:03:10.739> it<00:03:11.739> will

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
release something 3d but it will

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.059 
release something 3d but it will
probably<00:03:12.160> be<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.400> same<00:03:12.819> as<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.560> blu-ray<00:03:14.560> but

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
probably be the same as a blu-ray but

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.430 
probably be the same as a blu-ray but
that<00:03:15.609> way<00:03:15.760> I<00:03:15.790> don't<00:03:15.880> have<00:03:15.970> to<00:03:16.060> double<00:03:16.510> dip<00:03:16.690> but

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
that way I don't have to double dip but

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:24.750 
that way I don't have to double dip but
not<00:03:18.340> sure<00:03:21.810> that's<00:03:22.810> a<00:03:23.139> look<00:03:23.859> at<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.160> dvds
