is a great two tricks for this hand
placement<00:03:57.999> and<00:03:58.450> feet<00:03:58.840> those<00:03:59.139> are<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.379> two<00:03:59.560> big

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
placement and feet those are the two big

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.580 
placement and feet those are the two big
tricks<00:04:00.040> do<00:04:00.430> a<00:04:00.459> step<00:04:00.849> sit<00:04:01.389> up<00:04:01.480> tall<00:04:01.750> step<00:04:02.379> to

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
tricks do a step sit up tall step to

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.530 
tricks do a step sit up tall step to
lean<00:04:02.889> forward<00:04:02.920> I<00:04:03.549> might<00:04:03.760> hold<00:04:03.909> and<00:04:04.150> wait<00:04:04.299> just

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
lean forward I might hold and wait just

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.360 
lean forward I might hold and wait just
hold<00:04:04.719> me<00:04:04.870> away<00:04:05.139> so<00:04:05.560> here<00:04:05.859> what<00:04:06.069> do<00:04:06.129> you<00:04:06.189> do<00:04:06.280> with

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
hold me away so here what do you do with

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.890 
hold me away so here what do you do with
your<00:04:06.519> hands<00:04:06.969> just<00:04:07.120> give<00:04:07.569> her<00:04:07.659> a<00:04:07.689> little<00:04:07.810> bit

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
your hands just give her a little bit

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.929 
your hands just give her a little bit
so<00:04:10.900> he's<00:04:11.439> usually<00:04:12.129> when<00:04:12.249> you<00:04:12.340> pivot<00:04:12.519> towards

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:12.939 
so he's usually when you pivot towards

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.459 
so he's usually when you pivot towards
the<00:04:13.030> side<00:04:13.239> when<00:04:13.510> you<00:04:13.659> did<00:04:13.930> you<00:04:14.049> feel<00:04:14.260> a<00:04:14.290> little

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:14.469 
the side when you did you feel a little

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:17.460 
the side when you did you feel a little
bit<00:04:14.650> more<00:04:14.709> pressure<00:04:15.189> on<00:04:15.340> that<00:04:15.730> side<00:04:16.030> so<00:04:17.019> I'm

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
bit more pressure on that side so I'm

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.039 
bit more pressure on that side so I'm
just<00:04:18.099> pointing<00:04:18.340> that<00:04:18.639> out<00:04:18.910> because<00:04:19.630> what's

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
just pointing that out because what's

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.310 
just pointing that out because what's
the<00:04:20.229> benefit<00:04:21.099> of<00:04:21.870> transferring<00:04:22.870> to<00:04:23.080> an

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
the benefit of transferring to an

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.290 
the benefit of transferring to an
affected<00:04:23.770> side<00:04:24.009> and<00:04:24.310> you're<00:04:24.490> increasing<00:04:25.000> the

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
affected side and you're increasing the

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.360 
affected side and you're increasing the
weight<00:04:25.630> bearing<00:04:25.900> on<00:04:26.110> that<00:04:26.349> side<00:04:26.680> you're

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
weight bearing on that side you're

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.890 
weight bearing on that side you're
giving<00:04:27.759> the<00:04:28.090> patient<00:04:28.479> yet<00:04:28.570> another

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
giving the patient yet another

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.670 
giving the patient yet another
opportunity<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.800> say<00:04:30.250> oh<00:04:30.490> I<00:04:31.150> have<00:04:31.419> a<00:04:31.449> leg<00:04:31.810> ay<00:04:32.139> I

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
opportunity to say oh I have a leg ay I

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.960 
opportunity to say oh I have a leg ay I
can<00:04:33.070> bear<00:04:33.280> weight<00:04:33.460> on<00:04:33.520> and<00:04:33.910> I<00:04:34.060> can<00:04:34.300> move<00:04:34.479> it<00:04:34.690> so

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
can bear weight on and I can move it so

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.390 
can bear weight on and I can move it so
use<00:04:36.970> everything<00:04:37.449> that<00:04:37.660> you<00:04:37.900> got<00:04:38.080> they<00:04:38.949> need<00:04:39.190> to

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
use everything that you got they need to

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.210 
use everything that you got they need to
transfer<00:04:39.789> to<00:04:39.880> both<00:04:40.060> sides<00:04:40.389> and<00:04:41.199> if<00:04:41.740> anything

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
transfer to both sides and if anything

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.890 
transfer to both sides and if anything
you're<00:04:42.370> trying<00:04:42.580> to<00:04:42.849> prevent<00:04:43.150> learn<00:04:43.419> on<00:04:43.660> use

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
you're trying to prevent learn on use

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.960 
you're trying to prevent learn on use
right<00:04:44.259> so<00:04:44.530> you<00:04:44.620> want<00:04:44.949> them<00:04:45.280> to<00:04:45.490> do<00:04:45.639> lots<00:04:45.849> of

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
right so you want them to do lots of

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.839 
right so you want them to do lots of
transfers<00:04:46.419> to<00:04:46.599> their<00:04:46.840> affected<00:04:47.710> side<00:04:47.919> could

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:48.849 
transfers to their affected side could

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:55.420 
transfers to their affected side could
you<00:04:48.970> do<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.240> leg<00:04:49.449> thing<00:04:49.720> with<00:04:49.930> this<00:04:50.080> yeah

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
that okay could you do this in three

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:15.910 
that okay could you do this in three
moves<00:05:12.790> doing<00:05:13.790> the<00:05:13.880> small<00:05:14.150> moves<00:05:14.420> right<00:05:14.920> let's

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:15.920 
moves doing the small moves right let's
