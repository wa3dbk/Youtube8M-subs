sit in there then we're going to take
the<00:02:32.829> fast-setting<00:02:33.220> concrete<00:02:33.340> mix<00:02:34.299> and<00:02:34.900> we're

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
the fast-setting concrete mix and we're

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.270 
the fast-setting concrete mix and we're
going<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.140> pour<00:02:35.379> it<00:02:35.470> in<00:02:35.620> directly<00:02:36.010> on<00:02:36.099> top<00:02:36.250> of

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
going to pour it in directly on top of

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.509 
going to pour it in directly on top of
that<00:02:36.489> yes<00:02:37.090> it's<00:02:37.959> no<00:02:38.200> mixing<00:02:38.590> product<00:02:39.010> so<00:02:39.430> all

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
that yes it's no mixing product so all

that yes it's no mixing product so all
we're<00:02:39.640> going<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:39.819> do<00:02:40.000> is<00:02:40.180> take<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.540> concrete

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
we're going to do is take the concrete

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:50.140 
we're going to do is take the concrete
pour<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.190> in<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.640> hole

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.110 

now<00:02:50.690> what<00:02:50.900> happens<00:02:51.349> there<00:02:51.530> Jeff<00:02:51.799> the<00:02:52.120> the

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
now what happens there Jeff the the

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.789 
now what happens there Jeff the the
moisture<00:02:53.510> obviously<00:02:54.019> in<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.230> bottom<00:02:54.500> in<00:02:54.620> fact

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
moisture obviously in the bottom in fact

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.559 
moisture obviously in the bottom in fact
I<00:02:54.920> saw<00:02:55.129> it<00:02:55.280> squirt<00:02:55.640> up<00:02:55.819> it's<00:02:55.970> actually<00:02:56.299> pushing

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
I saw it squirt up it's actually pushing

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.360 
I saw it squirt up it's actually pushing
the<00:02:56.720> moisture<00:02:57.170> up<00:02:57.290> into<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.709> concrete<00:02:58.069> right

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
the moisture up into the concrete right

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.460 
the moisture up into the concrete right
when<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.090> concrete<00:02:59.510> hits<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.989> water<00:03:00.230> it

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
when the concrete hits the water it

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.500 
when the concrete hits the water it
actually<00:03:00.860> just<00:03:01.069> comes<00:03:01.459> up<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:01.819> mixes<00:03:02.150> itself

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
actually just comes up and mixes itself

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.059 
actually just comes up and mixes itself
alright<00:03:03.110> and<00:03:03.260> I<00:03:03.290> guess<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.620> next<00:03:03.650> thing<00:03:03.890> we

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
alright and I guess the next thing we

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.949 
alright and I guess the next thing we
got<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:04.280> make<00:03:04.370> sure<00:03:04.580> is<00:03:04.700> it's<00:03:04.909> plumb<00:03:05.239> that's

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
got to make sure is it's plumb that's

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.830 
got to make sure is it's plumb that's
pretty<00:03:06.230> fast<00:03:06.470> perfect<00:03:07.190> so<00:03:07.970> we<00:03:08.090> can<00:03:08.239> get<00:03:08.780> a

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
pretty fast perfect so we can get a

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.809 
pretty fast perfect so we can get a
little<00:03:09.019> 2<00:03:09.260> foot<00:03:09.560> level<00:03:09.829> make<00:03:10.129> sure<00:03:10.159> it's<00:03:10.489> plumb

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
little 2 foot level make sure it's plumb

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.080 
little 2 foot level make sure it's plumb
get<00:03:11.150> our<00:03:11.269> bubble<00:03:12.069> all<00:03:13.069> right<00:03:13.280> in<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:13.849> middle

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
get our bubble all right in the middle

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.630 
get our bubble all right in the middle
there<00:03:14.629> we<00:03:14.870> go<00:03:15.129> we're<00:03:16.129> going<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.310> add<00:03:16.430> a<00:03:16.459> little

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
there we go we're going to add a little

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.649 
there we go we're going to add a little
water<00:03:16.879> on<00:03:17.150> top<00:03:18.879> put<00:03:19.879> the<00:03:19.909> rest<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.269> one<00:03:20.420> on<00:03:20.540> the

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:20.659 
water on top put the rest of one on the
