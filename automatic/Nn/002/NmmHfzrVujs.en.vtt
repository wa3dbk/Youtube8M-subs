this to go lead well it definitely gets

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.020 
this to go lead well it definitely gets
a<00:01:05.930> confidence<00:01:06.350> going<00:01:06.820> conversely<00:01:07.820> though

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
a confidence going conversely though

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.520 
a confidence going conversely though
they<00:01:08.360> know<00:01:08.780> some<00:01:09.020> of<00:01:09.050> the<00:01:09.140> guys<00:01:09.170> who<00:01:09.380> aren't<00:01:09.470> on

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
the power play aren't playing so they're

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.860 
the power play aren't playing so they're
not<00:01:10.850> really<00:01:11.060> getting<00:01:11.210> involved<00:01:11.420> in<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.690> game

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
not really getting involved in the game

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.810 
not really getting involved in the game
but<00:01:12.080> now<00:01:12.980> once<00:01:13.159> you're<00:01:13.340> playing<00:01:13.520> with<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:13.700> two

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
but now once you're playing with the two

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.130 
but now once you're playing with the two
goal<00:01:14.000> lead<00:01:14.030> it's<00:01:14.300> a<00:01:14.360> lot<00:01:14.480> easier<00:01:14.510> for<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:14.990> goal

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
goal lead it's a lot easier for the goal

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.270 
goal lead it's a lot easier for the goal
is<00:01:15.320> to<00:01:15.350> get<00:01:15.500> involved<00:01:15.710> a<00:01:15.890> lot<00:01:15.950> easier<00:01:16.190> for

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
is to get involved a lot easier for

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.760

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
everyone to play at that point so it

a parent as well but into the game and

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.149 
a parent as well but into the game and
how<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.140> approach<00:01:37.469> the<00:01:37.679> game<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.070> your

teammates and stuff like that I think

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.990 
teammates and stuff like that I think
it's<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:41.009> learn<00:01:41.159> more<00:01:41.399> of<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.520> routine<00:01:41.819> in

college<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.509> think<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.869> helps<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.259> carry

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
college and I think that helps to carry

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.679 
college and I think that helps to carry
over<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.979> teach<00:01:44.670> younger<00:01:45.000> guys<00:01:45.240> who<00:01:45.479> haven't

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
over and teach younger guys who haven't

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.179 
over and teach younger guys who haven't
really<00:01:45.929> developed<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.409> yet<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:47.100> know

really developed that yet but you know

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.740 
really developed that yet but you know
it<00:01:47.340> does<00:01:47.789> help<00:01:48.030> out<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.179> lot<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.479> have<00:01:48.600> that

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
it does help out a lot to have that

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.899 
it does help out a lot to have that
