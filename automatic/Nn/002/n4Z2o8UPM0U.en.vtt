these things really really bounce around
a<00:02:59.890> lot<00:02:59.950> they<00:03:00.220> got<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.370> lot<00:03:00.550> of<00:03:00.580> movement<00:03:00.880> to<00:03:01.180> them

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
a lot they got a lot of movement to them

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.900 
a lot they got a lot of movement to them
which<00:03:01.989> makes<00:03:02.230> it<00:03:02.380> a<00:03:02.470> safer<00:03:02.860> boat<00:03:03.040> but<00:03:03.670> it<00:03:03.760> also

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
which makes it a safer boat but it also

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.690 
which makes it a safer boat but it also
it<00:03:04.390> makes<00:03:04.570> it<00:03:04.750> a<00:03:04.840> less<00:03:05.560> comfortable<00:03:06.070> boat<00:03:06.280> less

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
it makes it a less comfortable boat less

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.850

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
just adds up really quick and I think

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.930 
just adds up really quick and I think
we've<00:06:32.320> got<00:06:32.500> a<00:06:32.530> good<00:06:32.680> crew<00:06:32.980> and<00:06:33.520> we<00:06:33.640> do<00:06:33.730> a<00:06:33.760> good

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
we've got a good crew and we do a good

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.050 
we've got a good crew and we do a good

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.060 
job of getting along together and it

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.270 
job of getting along together and it
makes<00:06:37.300> life<00:06:37.540> a<00:06:37.690> lot<00:06:37.810> easier<00:06:37.870> I<00:06:38.470> mean<00:06:39.040> if<00:06:39.160> we

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
makes life a lot easier I mean if we

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.270 
makes life a lot easier I mean if we
didn't<00:06:39.520> get<00:06:39.610> along<00:06:39.730> on<00:06:40.180> this<00:06:40.570> boat<00:06:41.280> patrols

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.050 
didn't get along on this boat patrols
would<00:06:42.520> seem<00:06:42.790> a<00:06:42.880> lot<00:06:43.030> longer

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060 
would seem a lot longer

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.000 
would seem a lot longer
we're<00:06:46.060> in<00:06:46.180> and<00:06:46.360> out<00:06:46.510> a<00:06:46.540> lot<00:06:46.810> that<00:06:47.110> makes<00:06:47.860> it

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.010 
we're in and out a lot that makes it

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.950 
we're in and out a lot that makes it
