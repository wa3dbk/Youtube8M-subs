the gigabyte the German gigabyte forum
and<00:00:51.360> moving<00:00:52.360> down<00:00:52.390> you<00:00:52.840> can<00:00:52.989> see<00:00:53.260> it's<00:00:53.520> UEFI

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
and moving down you can see it's UEFI

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.920 
and moving down you can see it's UEFI
BIOS<00:00:54.880> for<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:55.149> z68<00:00:56.970> right<00:00:57.970> now<00:00:58.120> some<00:00:58.360> pre<00:00:58.660> beta

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219 
that soul going down you can check

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:16.440 
that soul going down you can check
they're<00:01:15.369> flashing<00:01:15.670> you<00:01:15.969> have<00:01:16.090> to<00:01:16.179> use<00:01:16.299> the

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
they're flashing you have to use the

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.449 
they're flashing you have to use the

00:01:18.449 --> 00:01:18.459 
special utility to flash it because this

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:21.330 
special utility to flash it because this
is<00:01:18.639> like<00:01:18.909> a<00:01:19.179> major<00:01:19.569> flash<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.319> it's<00:01:20.439> very

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
is like a major flash and it's very

you<00:01:51.999> can<00:01:52.179> see<00:01:52.359> they're<00:01:52.539> flashing<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:54.520> new

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
you can see they're flashing the new

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.959 
you can see they're flashing the new
splash<00:01:54.999> screen<00:01:55.389> and<00:01:56.369> it's<00:01:57.369> pretty<00:01:57.669> cool

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
splash screen and it's pretty cool

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.099 
splash screen and it's pretty cool
actually

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
actually

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:02.489 
actually
it<00:01:59.259> looks<00:01:59.439> pretty<00:01:59.679> good<00:01:59.829> and<00:02:01.109> UEFI<00:02:02.109> is<00:02:02.289> all

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:02.499 
it looks pretty good and UEFI is all

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:05.580 
it looks pretty good and UEFI is all
about<00:02:02.799> fast<00:02:03.340> booting<00:02:03.909> and<00:02:04.090> just<00:02:05.079> moving<00:02:05.439> on

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
about fast booting and just moving on

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.400 
about fast booting and just moving on
and<00:02:06.539> recognizing<00:02:07.539> all<00:02:07.689> your<00:02:07.840> drives<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:08.289> all

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
and recognizing all your drives and all

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.109 
and recognizing all your drives and all
that<00:02:08.560> stuff<00:02:08.770> like<00:02:08.830> really<00:02:09.429> quick<00:02:09.700> so<00:02:09.940> this

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
that stuff like really quick so this

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.490 
that stuff like really quick so this
screen<00:02:10.360> is<00:02:10.509> only<00:02:10.599> gonna<00:02:10.840> show<00:02:11.050> up<00:02:11.140> for<00:02:11.319> 2

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
screen is only gonna show up for 2

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.910 
screen is only gonna show up for 2
seconds<00:02:11.920> or<00:02:12.040> so<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:13.330> that's<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.900> big<00:02:14.530> advantage

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
seconds or so so that's a big advantage

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.610 
seconds or so so that's a big advantage
if<00:02:15.580> you<00:02:15.670> like<00:02:16.300> fast<00:02:16.630> booting<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.470> don't

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
if you like fast booting and you don't

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.870 
if you like fast booting and you don't
really<00:02:17.860> go<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.130> BIOS<00:02:18.460> a<00:02:18.580> lot

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
really go to the BIOS a lot

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.330 
really go to the BIOS a lot
