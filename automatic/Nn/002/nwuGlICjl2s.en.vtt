00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
hey everyone today I have the new Ghost

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.999 
hey everyone today I have the new Ghost
cube<00:00:03.149> this<00:00:03.659> was<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:03.990> puzzle<00:00:04.319> that<00:00:04.470> was<00:00:04.589> inspired

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
cube this was a puzzle that was inspired

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.519 
cube this was a puzzle that was inspired
by<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.310> golden<00:00:05.759> cube<00:00:06.000> back<00:00:06.210> in<00:00:06.359> 2008<00:00:07.049> but

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
by the golden cube back in 2008 but

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.980 
by the golden cube back in 2008 but
unlike<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:08.099> skewed<00:00:08.610> mechanism<00:00:09.179> this<00:00:09.330> one<00:00:09.540> uses

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
unlike a skewed mechanism this one uses

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.370 
unlike a skewed mechanism this one uses
the<00:00:10.200> typical<00:00:10.650> 3x3<00:00:11.610> mechanism<00:00:12.179> so<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.570> am<00:00:12.870> really

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
the typical 3x3 mechanism so I am really

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.560 
the typical 3x3 mechanism so I am really
excited<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.920> try<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.309> out<00:00:14.639> ah<00:00:17.330> comes<00:00:18.330> in<00:00:18.480> a

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
excited to try this out ah comes in a

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.470 
excited to try this out ah comes in a
fancy<00:00:19.289> nice<00:00:19.529> little<00:00:19.980> bag<00:00:21.140> here's<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.380> puzzle

my<00:00:39.750> golden<00:00:40.320> cube<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.070> worn<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.700> lot<00:00:41.940> of

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
my golden cube is so worn that a lot of

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.910 
my golden cube is so worn that a lot of
the<00:00:42.149> color<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.540> faded<00:00:43.050> even<00:00:43.530> my<00:00:43.649> little

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the color is faded even my little

championship<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.289> fading<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.770> little<00:00:46.980> bit<00:00:47.129> so

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
championship is fading a little bit so

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.860 
championship is fading a little bit so
this<00:00:47.610> was<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.820> 3x3<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.510> was<00:00:48.629> initially

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
this was a 3x3 that was initially

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.720 
this was a 3x3 that was initially
extended<00:00:49.530> by<00:00:49.649> Adam<00:00:50.070> G<00:00:50.250> :

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
extended by Adam G :

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.680 
extended by Adam G :
and<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.059> now<00:00:51.210> mass-produced<00:00:51.960> by<00:00:52.079> Messrs<00:00:53.690> so

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
and is now mass-produced by Messrs so

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.420 
and is now mass-produced by Messrs so
yeah<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.170> another<00:00:55.590> one<00:00:55.860> where<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.250> have

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
yeah this is another one where you have

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.479 
yeah this is another one where you have
to<00:00:56.699> uh<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.320> have<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.559> slightly<00:00:58.859> turn<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
to uh like you have to slightly turn the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.760 
to uh like you have to slightly turn the
sides<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.180> then<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:00.870> turn<00:01:01.109> all<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
sides and then you can turn all of the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.410 
sides and then you can turn all of the
layers<00:01:02.039> oh<00:01:03.890> this<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.040> gonna<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.000> hard<00:01:06.270> to

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
layers oh this is gonna be so hard to

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.899 
layers oh this is gonna be so hard to
solve<00:01:06.900> but<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.770> know<00:01:07.860> how<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.189> solve<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.580> super

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
solve but I know how to solve a super

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.660 
solve but I know how to solve a super
cube<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.659> should<00:01:10.080> be<00:01:10.260> able<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.770> eventually

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
cube so I should be able to eventually

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.590 
cube so I should be able to eventually
get<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.260> wow<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.920> looks<00:01:14.250> amazing

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
get it wow this looks amazing

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:23.929 
get it wow this looks amazing
oh<00:01:18.380> geez<00:01:19.380> what<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.490> mess<00:01:21.470> well<00:01:22.470> okay<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.430> I'm

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
oh geez what a mess well okay so I'm

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.789 
oh geez what a mess well okay so I'm
gonna<00:01:24.119> try<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.420> solve<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.110> few<00:01:25.290> times<00:01:25.500> and

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
gonna try to solve it a few times and

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.050 
gonna try to solve it a few times and
then<00:01:25.890> get<00:01:26.130> back<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.549> guys<00:01:26.670> when<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:26.970> know

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
then get back to you guys when I know

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.910 
then get back to you guys when I know
more<00:01:27.330> about<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.750> alright<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.500> I've<00:01:28.590> had<00:01:28.770> this

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
more about it alright so I've had this

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.679 
more about it alright so I've had this
cube<00:01:29.189> for<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> few<00:01:29.640> days<00:01:29.880> now<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.540> first

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
cube for a few days now and the first

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.899 
cube for a few days now and the first
couple<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.110> times<00:01:31.170> man<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.220> was<00:01:32.460> tough<00:01:32.880> to

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
couple of times man it was tough to

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.990 
couple of times man it was tough to
solve<00:01:33.479> because<00:01:34.350> just<00:01:34.890> like<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.250> golden<00:01:35.670> cube

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
solve because just like the golden cube

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.539 
solve because just like the golden cube
here<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.990> have<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.950> layers<00:01:38.250> are

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
here you have the the layers are

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.600 
here you have the the layers are
actually<00:01:38.700> misaligned<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:40.049> have<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.610> realign

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
actually misaligned you have to realign

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.340 
actually misaligned you have to realign
them<00:01:41.970> before<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.479> can<00:01:42.630> turn<00:01:42.810> any<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
them before you can turn any of the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.319 
them before you can turn any of the
other<00:01:43.500> layers<00:01:43.740> which<00:01:44.340> means<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:45.090> actually

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
other layers which means you actually

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.569 
other layers which means you actually
have<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:46.170> solve<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.220> configuration

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
have to solve it in this configuration

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.600 
have to solve it in this configuration
and<00:01:48.270> figuring<00:01:48.960> out<00:01:48.990> which<00:01:49.350> pieces<00:01:49.710> matches<00:01:50.399> up

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
and figuring out which pieces matches up

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.690 
and figuring out which pieces matches up
with<00:01:50.820> what<00:01:50.960> makes<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.140> very<00:01:52.710> difficult<00:01:53.100> so

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
with what makes it very difficult so

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.429 
with what makes it very difficult so
after<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.030> get<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.299> first<00:01:54.450> layer<00:01:54.750> solved<00:01:55.290> I'm

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
after I get the first layer solved I'm

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.219 
after I get the first layer solved I'm
constantly<00:01:56.009> having<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.630> realign<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.930> middle

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
constantly having to realign the middle

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.380 
constantly having to realign the middle
layer<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.979> see<00:01:59.130> how<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.280> pieces<00:01:59.579> fit<00:02:00.060> into

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
layer to see how the pieces fit into

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.090 
layer to see how the pieces fit into
each<00:02:00.719> other<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.170> what<00:02:01.469> this<00:02:01.619> cube<00:02:01.920> really

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
each other and what this cube really

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.700 
each other and what this cube really
reminded<00:02:02.820> me<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.659> picture<00:02:04.229> cube<00:02:04.469> like

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
reminded me of is a picture cube like

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.950 
reminded me of is a picture cube like
this<00:02:04.770> chess<00:02:05.340> one<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.060> got<00:02:06.299> from<00:02:06.450> V<00:02:06.659> cubes

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
this chess one that I got from V cubes

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.760 
this chess one that I got from V cubes
com<00:02:07.320> all<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.160> pieces<00:02:08.700> look<00:02:09.270> very<00:02:10.020> similar

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
com all of the pieces look very similar

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.850 
com all of the pieces look very similar
when<00:02:11.069> this's<00:02:11.489> make

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
when this's make

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.810 
when this's make
stop<00:02:12.070> so<00:02:12.640> there<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.240> definitely<00:02:14.820> great

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
stop so there is definitely great

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.060 
stop so there is definitely great
difficulty<00:02:16.660> here<00:02:17.080> now<00:02:17.380> one<00:02:17.590> thing<00:02:17.740> I<00:02:17.890> was

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
difficulty here now one thing I was

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.280 
difficulty here now one thing I was
actually<00:02:18.400> quite<00:02:18.670> surprised<00:02:19.300> about<00:02:19.510> is<00:02:19.870> how

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
actually quite surprised about is how

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.470 
actually quite surprised about is how
small<00:02:20.740> this<00:02:21.040> thing<00:02:21.310> is<00:02:21.490> I<00:02:21.670> mean<00:02:21.880> compared<00:02:22.300> to

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
small this thing is I mean compared to

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.110 
small this thing is I mean compared to
the<00:02:22.600> golden<00:02:23.020> cube<00:02:23.320> this<00:02:23.890> thing<00:02:24.220> is<00:02:24.370> puny<00:02:24.880> and

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
the golden cube this thing is puny and

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.030 
the golden cube this thing is puny and
this<00:02:25.630> one<00:02:25.840> is<00:02:25.990> more<00:02:26.170> complicated<00:02:26.920> because

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
this one is more complicated because

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.370 
this one is more complicated because
it's<00:02:27.340> got<00:02:27.490> more<00:02:27.670> pieces<00:02:28.000> so<00:02:28.570> it's<00:02:29.080> very

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
it's got more pieces so it's very

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.430 
it's got more pieces so it's very
interesting<00:02:29.770> that<00:02:30.010> they<00:02:30.430> didn't<00:02:30.760> have<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.440> make

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
interesting that they didn't have a make

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.800 
interesting that they didn't have a make
them<00:02:32.620> in<00:02:32.770> like<00:02:32.980> sizes<00:02:33.550> and<00:02:33.790> I've<00:02:34.150> always<00:02:34.480> loved

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
them in like sizes and I've always loved

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.320 
them in like sizes and I've always loved
shape-shifting<00:02:35.800> puzzles<00:02:36.340> because<00:02:36.760> it<00:02:37.030> looks

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
shape-shifting puzzles because it looks

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.560 
shape-shifting puzzles because it looks
like<00:02:37.450> just<00:02:37.840> such<00:02:38.320> a<00:02:38.560> mess<00:02:39.070> when<00:02:39.850> you<00:02:39.970> mix<00:02:40.209> it<00:02:40.420> up

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
like just such a mess when you mix it up

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.470 
like just such a mess when you mix it up
and<00:02:40.840> it's<00:02:41.290> so<00:02:41.620> satisfying<00:02:42.610> when<00:02:42.760> all<00:02:43.180> of<00:02:43.390> the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
and it's so satisfying when all of the

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.170 
and it's so satisfying when all of the
pieces<00:02:43.780> start<00:02:44.290> coming<00:02:44.680> together<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.459> it's

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
pieces start coming together and it's

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.900 
pieces start coming together and it's
especially<00:02:46.830> satisfying<00:02:47.830> right<00:02:48.280> when<00:02:48.700> you're

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
especially satisfying right when you're

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.900 
especially satisfying right when you're
on<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.360> last<00:02:49.690> part<00:02:50.350> of<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.739> cube<00:02:51.160> where

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
on the last part of the cube where

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.120 
on the last part of the cube where
you're<00:02:52.120> orienting<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:53.110> corners<00:02:53.709> at<00:02:53.950> least

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
you're orienting the corners at least

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.449 
you're orienting the corners at least
that's<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.459> method<00:02:54.880> that<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.060> use<00:02:56.370> it's<00:02:57.370> just

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
that's the method that I use it's just

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.810 
that's the method that I use it's just
so<00:02:58.090> satisfying<00:02:58.630> when<00:02:59.200> it<00:02:59.500> finally<00:02:59.980> all<00:03:00.010> comes

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
so satisfying when it finally all comes

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.360 
so satisfying when it finally all comes
together<00:03:01.260> now<00:03:02.260> I<00:03:02.290> will<00:03:02.620> warn<00:03:02.890> you<00:03:03.010> that<00:03:03.040> there

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
together now I will warn you that there

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.699 
together now I will warn you that there
is<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.700> parity<00:03:04.540> error<00:03:04.780> that<00:03:05.110> can<00:03:05.350> occur

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
is a parity error that can occur

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.360 
is a parity error that can occur
possibly<00:03:06.610> even<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:07.390> I<00:03:07.840> won't<00:03:08.200> show<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.590> how<00:03:09.070> it

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
possibly even to I won't show you how it

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.560 
possibly even to I won't show you how it
happens<00:03:09.730> because<00:03:09.880> you<00:03:10.090> know<00:03:10.209> on<00:03:10.330> a<00:03:10.360> typical

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
happens because you know on a typical

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.290 
happens because you know on a typical
3x3<00:03:11.290> parity<00:03:11.709> errors<00:03:11.980> don't<00:03:12.190> happen<00:03:12.730> but<00:03:13.209> on

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
3x3 parity errors don't happen but on

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.570 
3x3 parity errors don't happen but on
this<00:03:13.450> cube<00:03:13.810> it<00:03:13.989> does<00:03:14.620> if<00:03:15.130> you<00:03:15.190> want<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.489> know

cross however on this particular cube
you<00:03:50.799> can't<00:03:51.070> tell<00:03:51.459> if<00:03:51.850> this<00:03:52.420> piece<00:03:52.780> is<00:03:53.019> flipped

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
you can't tell if this piece is flipped

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.080 
you can't tell if this piece is flipped
correctly<00:03:53.890> because<00:03:54.100> it's<00:03:54.400> also<00:03:54.580> in<00:03:54.850> the<00:03:54.940> wrong

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
correctly because it's also in the wrong

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.729 
correctly because it's also in the wrong
spot<00:03:55.360> on<00:03:55.600> this<00:03:55.900> one<00:03:56.080> because<00:03:56.320> this<00:03:56.470> is<00:03:56.530> an

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
spot on this one because this is an

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.110 
spot on this one because this is an
entirely<00:03:57.010> different<00:03:57.160> shape<00:03:57.610> you<00:03:57.820> have<00:03:57.850> no

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
entirely different shape you have no

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.330 
entirely different shape you have no
idea<00:03:58.450> so<00:03:58.959> that's<00:03:59.290> where<00:03:59.799> it's<00:03:59.950> especially

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
idea so that's where it's especially

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.520 
idea so that's where it's especially
tricky<00:04:00.760> so<00:04:01.060> I<00:04:01.090> highly<00:04:01.840> recommend<00:04:02.260> that<00:04:02.350> you

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
tricky so I highly recommend that you

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.170 
tricky so I highly recommend that you
would<00:04:02.620> have<00:04:02.769> one<00:04:02.950> of<00:04:03.040> these<00:04:03.160> cubes<00:04:03.489> sitting

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
would have one of these cubes sitting

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.120 
would have one of these cubes sitting
next<00:04:04.420> to<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:04.900> though<00:04:05.350> of<00:04:05.530> course<00:04:05.709> if<00:04:05.860> you<00:04:05.950> want

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
next to you though of course if you want

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.920 
next to you though of course if you want
a<00:04:06.160> harder<00:04:06.400> challenge<00:04:06.430> I<00:04:06.820> suppose<00:04:07.000> you<00:04:07.180> you

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
a harder challenge I suppose you you

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.830 
a harder challenge I suppose you you
don't<00:04:08.380> need<00:04:08.709> one<00:04:09.010> but<00:04:09.340> that's<00:04:10.120> my<00:04:10.390> personal

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
don't need one but that's my personal

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.120 
don't need one but that's my personal
recommendation<00:04:11.049> oh<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:11.950> if<00:04:12.040> you're

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
recommendation oh and if you're

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.190 
recommendation oh and if you're
interested<00:04:12.610> in<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:12.910> mechanism<00:04:13.239> there's<00:04:13.750> not

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
interested in the mechanism there's not

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.600 
interested in the mechanism there's not
much<00:04:14.440> to<00:04:14.650> it<00:04:14.680> it's<00:04:14.920> pretty<00:04:15.130> much<00:04:15.250> what<00:04:15.459> you

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
much to it it's pretty much what you

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.280 
much to it it's pretty much what you
would<00:04:15.640> expect<00:04:16.150> there's<00:04:16.630> no<00:04:16.870> way<00:04:16.989> I'm<00:04:17.079> going<00:04:17.200> to

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
would expect there's no way I'm going to

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.020 
would expect there's no way I'm going to
completely<00:04:17.680> take<00:04:17.890> this<00:04:18.070> thing<00:04:18.250> apart<00:04:18.549> but

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
completely take this thing apart but

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.810 
completely take this thing apart but
yeah<00:04:19.269> just<00:04:19.540> looks<00:04:19.780> like<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.320> typical<00:04:20.820> Rubik's

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
yeah just looks like the typical Rubik's

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.740 
yeah just looks like the typical Rubik's
brand<00:04:21.910> core<00:04:22.750> in<00:04:23.080> there

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
brand core in there

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.310 
brand core in there
nothing<00:04:24.350> too<00:04:24.470> fancy<00:04:25.840> don't<00:04:26.840> ask<00:04:27.020> me<00:04:27.290> to

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
nothing too fancy don't ask me to

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.770 
nothing too fancy don't ask me to
completely<00:04:27.860> take<00:04:28.280> this<00:04:28.490> cube<00:04:28.790> apart<00:04:29.120> there's

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
completely take this cube apart there's

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.420 
completely take this cube apart there's
no<00:04:29.990> way<00:04:30.140> I'm<00:04:30.290> gonna<00:04:30.410> be<00:04:30.590> doing<00:04:30.830> that<00:04:30.950> and<00:04:31.130> this

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
no way I'm gonna be doing that and this

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.420 
no way I'm gonna be doing that and this
cube<00:04:31.820> actually<00:04:32.150> turns<00:04:32.990> pretty<00:04:33.590> well<00:04:33.950> I<00:04:34.220> was

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
cube actually turns pretty well I was

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.160 
cube actually turns pretty well I was
surprised<00:04:34.820> right<00:04:35.090> out<00:04:35.210> of<00:04:35.270> the<00:04:35.360> box<00:04:35.570> it<00:04:35.900> didn't

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
surprised right out of the box it didn't

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.650 
surprised right out of the box it didn't
really<00:04:36.290> need<00:04:36.500> any<00:04:36.880> lubrication<00:04:37.880> so<00:04:38.330> I<00:04:38.360> was

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
really need any lubrication so I was

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.840 
really need any lubrication so I was
quite<00:04:38.990> pleased<00:04:39.380> with<00:04:39.560> that<00:04:39.680> I<00:04:40.160> don't<00:04:40.640> think<00:04:40.760> I

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
quite pleased with that I don't think I

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.340 
quite pleased with that I don't think I
want<00:04:41.090> to<00:04:41.180> lubricate<00:04:41.390> it<00:04:41.600> anymore<00:04:41.900> it<00:04:42.110> still

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
want to lubricate it anymore it still

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.350 
want to lubricate it anymore it still
feels<00:04:42.560> a<00:04:42.770> little<00:04:42.980> bit<00:04:43.220> sticky<00:04:43.610> but<00:04:43.640> I<00:04:44.090> don't

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
feels a little bit sticky but I don't

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.180 
feels a little bit sticky but I don't
really<00:04:44.660> want<00:04:44.900> to<00:04:44.960> lubricate<00:04:45.440> it<00:04:45.500> more<00:04:45.770> because

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
really want to lubricate it more because

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.550 
really want to lubricate it more because
it<00:04:46.520> may<00:04:47.000> spend<00:04:47.300> too<00:04:47.510> fast<00:04:47.780> because<00:04:48.110> right<00:04:48.320> now

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
it may spend too fast because right now

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.380 
it may spend too fast because right now
it's<00:04:49.160> kind<00:04:49.430> of<00:04:49.490> hard<00:04:49.730> to<00:04:49.820> keep<00:04:50.030> the<00:04:50.210> layers

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
it's kind of hard to keep the layers

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.960 
it's kind of hard to keep the layers
aligned<00:04:50.960> and<00:04:51.230> on<00:04:51.890> the<00:04:52.070> golden<00:04:52.400> cube<00:04:52.670> it<00:04:52.790> has<00:04:52.940> a

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
aligned and on the golden cube it has a

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.690 
aligned and on the golden cube it has a
slight<00:04:53.480> little<00:04:53.810> clicky<00:04:54.320> mechanism<00:04:55.070> and<00:04:55.250> that

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
slight little clicky mechanism and that

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.930 
slight little clicky mechanism and that
helps<00:04:56.090> a<00:04:56.210> lot<00:04:56.810> because<00:04:57.430> you<00:04:58.430> know<00:04:58.580> especially

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
helps a lot because you know especially

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.930 
helps a lot because you know especially
when<00:04:59.690> this<00:04:59.900> thing<00:05:00.169> is<00:05:00.200> all<00:05:00.650> mixed<00:05:00.890> up<00:05:01.190> you<00:05:01.700> can

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
when this thing is all mixed up you can

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.530 
when this thing is all mixed up you can
feel<00:05:02.480> right<00:05:03.020> when<00:05:03.350> you<00:05:04.310> know<00:05:04.430> once<00:05:04.640> you<00:05:04.760> feel

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
feel right when you know once you feel

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.350 
feel right when you know once you feel
that<00:05:05.570> snap<00:05:06.230> it<00:05:06.530> has<00:05:06.890> a<00:05:06.919> firm<00:05:07.250> little<00:05:07.460> click<00:05:07.760> but

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
that snap it has a firm little click but

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.420 
that snap it has a firm little click but
then<00:05:08.510> you<00:05:08.660> notice<00:05:08.900> it<00:05:09.260> also<00:05:09.440> has<00:05:09.620> an<00:05:09.980> extra

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
then you notice it also has an extra

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.220 
then you notice it also has an extra
click<00:05:10.700> like<00:05:11.270> halfway<00:05:11.540> in<00:05:11.720> the<00:05:11.810> middle<00:05:11.870> you

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
click like halfway in the middle you

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.540 
click like halfway in the middle you
like<00:05:12.410> feel<00:05:12.680> an<00:05:12.830> extra<00:05:13.070> click<00:05:13.280> and<00:05:13.430> that's

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
like feel an extra click and that's

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.580 
like feel an extra click and that's
probably<00:05:13.910> so<00:05:14.060> that<00:05:14.240> way<00:05:14.360> you<00:05:15.260> know<00:05:15.290> it'll

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
probably so that way you know it'll

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.440 
probably so that way you know it'll
stave<00:05:15.980> solve<00:05:16.430> because<00:05:16.700> there's<00:05:16.970> a<00:05:17.030> there's<00:05:17.210> a

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
stave solve because there's a there's a

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.310 
stave solve because there's a there's a
mild<00:05:17.780> or<00:05:18.110> click<00:05:18.470> right<00:05:18.740> there<00:05:19.419> so<00:05:20.419> that<00:05:20.900> may<00:05:21.260> be

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
mild or click right there so that may be

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.100 
mild or click right there so that may be
a<00:05:21.500> little<00:05:21.830> too<00:05:22.370> difficult<00:05:22.730> on<00:05:23.360> this<00:05:23.750> puzzle

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
a little too difficult on this puzzle

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.260 
a little too difficult on this puzzle
because<00:05:25.040> you<00:05:25.430> know<00:05:25.550> there's<00:05:25.790> two<00:05:26.090> different

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
because you know there's two different

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.510 
because you know there's two different
slices<00:05:26.930> so<00:05:27.110> there<00:05:27.260> would<00:05:27.380> have<00:05:27.470> to<00:05:27.530> be<00:05:27.650> a<00:05:27.890> lot

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
slices so there would have to be a lot

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.640 
slices so there would have to be a lot
of<00:05:28.700> clicks<00:05:29.030> if<00:05:29.330> you<00:05:29.660> wanted<00:05:30.020> this<00:05:30.200> whole<00:05:30.380> thing

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
of clicks if you wanted this whole thing

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.620 
of clicks if you wanted this whole thing
stay<00:05:31.580> together<00:05:31.729> so<00:05:32.030> that's<00:05:32.210> probably<00:05:32.479> why

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
stay together so that's probably why

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.120 
stay together so that's probably why
they<00:05:32.780> didn't<00:05:33.020> use<00:05:33.080> a<00:05:33.229> clicking<00:05:33.650> mechanism

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
they didn't use a clicking mechanism

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.230 
they didn't use a clicking mechanism
even<00:05:34.280> though<00:05:34.520> it<00:05:34.580> would<00:05:34.669> make<00:05:34.820> it<00:05:34.940> a<00:05:35.000> whole<00:05:35.210> lot

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
even though it would make it a whole lot

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.270 
even though it would make it a whole lot
easier<00:05:35.419> to<00:05:35.750> solve<00:05:36.050> because<00:05:36.530> if<00:05:36.919> you<00:05:37.010> watching

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
easier to solve because if you watching

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.830 
easier to solve because if you watching
my<00:05:37.400> walkthrough<00:05:37.610> video<00:05:38.000> the<00:05:38.150> things<00:05:38.360> probably

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
my walkthrough video the things probably
