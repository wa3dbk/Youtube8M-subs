00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
pretty easy to spawn trap a day but uh

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.649 
pretty easy to spawn trap a day but uh
yeah<00:02:34.950> that's<00:02:35.159> C<00:02:35.370> building<00:02:35.549> everyone<00:02:36.239> loves<00:02:36.510> to

d-minus on no not that bad d plus we'll

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.490 
d-minus on no not that bad d plus we'll
give<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.489> deep<00:03:02.670> loss<00:03:02.819> on<00:03:03.030> balance<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.840> then

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
give it a deep loss on balance and then

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.910 
give it a deep loss on balance and then

little<00:03:36.510> bit<00:03:36.629> worse<00:03:36.810> let's<00:03:37.530> go<00:03:37.680> with<00:03:37.709> C<00:03:38.010> minus

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
little bit worse let's go with C minus

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.460 
little bit worse let's go with C minus
how<00:03:38.819> about<00:03:39.000> it<00:03:39.180> little<00:03:39.510> worse<00:03:39.629> than<00:03:39.660> average<00:03:40.169> I

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
how about it little worse than average I

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.569 
how about it little worse than average I
think<00:03:41.010> c-<00:03:41.430> pretty<00:03:41.760> pretty<00:03:42.120> solid<00:03:42.569> and<00:03:43.459> then<00:03:44.459> of

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
think c- pretty pretty solid and then of

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.240 
think c- pretty pretty solid and then of
course<00:03:44.819> we<00:03:44.970> got<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.389> infamous<00:03:46.129> what<00:03:47.129> is

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
course we got the infamous what is

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.680 
course we got the infamous what is
modern<00:03:47.400> warfare<00:03:47.609> 2<00:03:47.910> known<00:03:48.120> for<00:03:48.359> the<00:03:48.449> best

snipe<00:03:49.379> ability<00:03:49.970> this<00:03:50.970> map<00:03:51.180> pretty<00:03:51.510> damn<00:03:51.690> good

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
snipe ability this map pretty damn good

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.900 
snipe ability this map pretty damn good
um<00:03:52.260> it's<00:03:52.799> not<00:03:52.889> good<00:03:53.129> for<00:03:53.160> thermal<00:03:53.639> scopes

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
um it's not good for thermal scopes

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.729 
um it's not good for thermal scopes
which<00:03:54.180> makes<00:03:54.449> it<00:03:54.569> a<00:03:54.720> little<00:03:55.019> better<00:03:55.230> because

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
which makes it a little better because

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.530 
which makes it a little better because
modern<00:03:56.010> warfare<00:03:56.220> two<00:03:56.549> thermal<00:03:57.180> scopes<00:03:57.389> were

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
pretty bad like in wasteland let's just
