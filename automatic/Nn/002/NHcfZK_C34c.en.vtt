00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello very good ideas I come with a 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.390
 new video and in this video I have a 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.849
 sort of tutorial is simply worth of 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.910
 teaching a song more or less 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.250
 modern for the idea puts in series or what 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.930
 that is, I know we're going to go in, this is the 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.660
 entrance of quite large width not 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.180
 the house of the desired for the clear with 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.070
 its windows with their height and 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.970
 mixed brick and the truth that no 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:32.619
 is nothing more brick so strip 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.619
 enough rooms the majorities 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.620
 a kind of the entrance 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.410
 that this I have put for position and the 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.290
 my land my land block my 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.739
 hatch to AlavÃ©s on top of the 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.810
 complication 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:03.559
 while I light this my water space 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.780
 that goes out at home you have high performance 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.220
 above all it's worth as there's no line in the 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.320
 wooden house always makes things 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.140
 white in my opinion if you have some 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.040
 that have input materials 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.710
 obviously you have to put and 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.050
 splinters and good in the kitchen exposed 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.100
 I usually say these corals with 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:27.880
 brick warn of this and quartz 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:31.780
 then you have my kitchen for cooking and a 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.450
 Tele moderation and leverage the 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.020
 fire refrigerator one lever two 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.020
 blocks of four 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.350
 knee 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:52.330
 and the tap and still do not look at my cake for 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.000
 Kitchen kitchen 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.250
 clearly here not because they leave me and in 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.340
 pressure plates and is a table the 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.280
 you have go and I posters and made a 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.390
 putty that pretty cool and this 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.090
 expression ensures that he puts there 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.690
 I just put a library and 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.420
 was higher and we are in here I have 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.210
 made my high ceiling will come the body 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.980
 so pretty cool there's a look from 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.680
 put has a pool I do not know why 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:29.320
 from good to two in the matter here my 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.320
 kind of ballet with its 4 dewar 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.900
 and here is ours that I have put to him 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.640
 I put I like a hollow 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.980
 four conquests and in the middle it is 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.780
 Water 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.940
 here this room is worth it takes me 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.760
 above 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.650
 here it is managed as I always say 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.690
 that taught to teach that part of 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.730
 there that all the textures in pools 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.900
 then he had it up and I have a 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:10.360
 and large front room as 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.320
 it is purged has brought us here processing 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.320
 criminal because it 's still done 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.940
 like you 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:26.480
 here in my room london other 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.480
 things about my porsche vale 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.480
 simply 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:43.780
 two stone slabs and nothing nothing 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.780
 what do you want? 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.760
 and here they were going to see us quite sure 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:04:08.140
 and is that the big house impossible that 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:11.319
 get out of water even though I have my fireplace 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:15.720
 It is quite curious for Carlos 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:18.959
 circus watching with their houses 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.930
 with my chest 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:25.320
 ok here I have my pass and what I 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.770
 take to my office 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.900
 and time this here is like a pool 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.220
 before facts or inside tried 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.630
 to be worth since well the 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.529
 national fishing aspirations 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:41.249
 It is so asymmetrical that with everything 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:41.249
 that good 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:05:06.210
 and a lot more time 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.810
 so decorate the small room 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.660
 but I liked the project that I liked 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.030
