00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.420
 classrooms of the cybertech institute here 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.759

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.680
 encouraged to promote or promote this idea 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.280
 and if you are born for an innovation 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.860
 our of the whole group supporting us in 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.830
 my skill 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.620
 this year I will over pastry then 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.230
 this we decided to make this product for 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.390
 in order to innovate promote the revolution 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.940
 of the pastry shop we do not really know 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.010
 how to do the how is the explanation 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.170
 exact for the best spirits but in 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.440
 based on tests doing two three times 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.629
 we have arrived at the exact recipe and at 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.550
 precise flavor to develop and the 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.400
 better and that are accepted in the 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.280
 market and in the difficult market of 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.900
 Limeño palate is extractor believe 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.259
 what can you do, yes, of course, yes 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.850
 because we already see we have already left our 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.430
 is several people several people 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.290
 they continue like this exquisite palates do not stay 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.290
 more with less' shakers while being 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.060
 accepted the product know that the machine 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.920
 Now that I lived on the street, it has a 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.350
 special flavor is not no taste 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.390
 nice for many people but still 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.280
 so we have know that these two 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.050
 exquisite qualities well 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.440
 how is it so you 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.740
 they got involved in the idea of ​​Miguel and 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.230
 I understand that all of you are still in the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.660
 administration career but also 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.760
 there are business residents here 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.290
 international like those and that is 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.820
 together 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.670
 well then because we had to 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.470
 develop the project and we analyze 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.270
 several alternatives according to the 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.310
 each one's capabilities and good we 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.750
 We went for Miguel because we know he is 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.210
 the year here is not an opportunity 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.010
 very good apart from that good I am 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.899
 Colombian and the truth interests me a lot 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.270
 explore a little about the grains 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.120
 Andean countries, since in my country they are not 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.790
 there and good when I met them here I gave 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.310
 Not only was he Latino 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.630
 there are other very good Andean grains that 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.100
 can be very helpful for the 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.470
 human consumption and that so far no 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.060
 they are very exploited then because of that 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.010
 we lean towards this product to 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.320
 make it known precisely now 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.530
 I also understand that you are a young 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.380
 Colombian is here in our country 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.890
 but 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:42.130
 had business branch is different to 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.320
 This issue of exploiting what is a 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.870
 business involved with bakeries 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.480
 Of course yes at this moment I work 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.160
 in what this style but I'm interested 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.380
 for this product precisely because it is 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.540
 something I just know that calls me 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.210
 a lot of attention and that I know that 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.630
 we can make a lot of profit and in the 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.090
 your case tell us your experience in my 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.550
 case as well as my partner the subject of 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.190
 make something new these flours that are 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.720
 very nutritious as we take for the 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.750
 nutrition are a bit of inclusion 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.470
 social we want to reach the public with 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.900
 small samples in this and more wineries 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.240
 everything so that it is known that it is not so 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.340
 unpleasant Andean flavor is rich is 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.780
 so to know that also 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.900
 can buy and at the same time be nourished 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.710
 it is also not to say a product if 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:36.100
 it fits the nutritional term in color 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:38.110
 exactly if well and when you who 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.960
 they are starting the career they need 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.520
 money 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:46.350
 here is Prince Charles clear 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.810
 because not to be able to take this out 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.360
 forward this project why not take out 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.670
 a loan starting to be able to this one 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.910
 acquire some fixed assets in the 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.980
 machinery be some tools for 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.900
 I can prepare it since this also 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.880
 It is very convenient to be able to prepare or 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.500
 they do not fit is not much money maybe the 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.750
 investment to be able to buy our 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.030
 inputs but yes to be able to buy the 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.880
 machinery then there we could take out 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.320
 a quiet loan and among the 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.330
 four I think that's how we could assume that 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.340
 responsibility now in this in these 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.820
 first days on what day are you 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.250
 having experience in what is the 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.710
 marketing production 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.010
 what can not he say to me 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.050
 public the best Andean is the is the 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.420
 best product that product can 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.210
 new that can be here in northern Lima 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.700
 because we are encourage north and I 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.730
 everyone consumed like this 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.950
 product since it has good nutrients 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.470
 vitamins not good protein for 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:52.080
 it's even good for nutrition 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:54.210
 exact for children is this is what 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.980
 better for the health of all 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.030
 people even for people 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:02.160
 school that is the best food for 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.650
 the little ones that do not give or are not 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.740
 knowledge this these grains do not 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:11.070
 they feed and not even kiwicha cañihua 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:13.020
 they would be things that can be included in 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.430
 a great fair school fair and that's what 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.760
 he wants right now the first lady not 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.350
 include this this product at night 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.240
 school that is a diet for children 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.120
 so that they are strong and healthy 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.390
 like the Incas like the previous ones this 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.390
 Peruvian
