00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.729
 this video is recorded for our 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:06.430
 Customers who have purchased with us 

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:08.200
 a printer and suddenly they have 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.959
 forgotten how to do a cleaning head 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.759
 a test of injectors since suddenly 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:16.030
 your printer is taking impressions 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:17.920
 as grated but within the software 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.720
 of the machine there is an option to take 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.330
 what a cleanup they discourage 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.580
 directors that will help us improve the 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.410
 printing again then I 'll go 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.330
 to explain step by step how to do that 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.070
 cleaning head and you injectors 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.219
 The first thing you should do is give 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.629
 click on start at start because it's going to 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.820
 look like what devices are 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.170
 printers if you suddenly have x pp this one 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.300
 it's going to look like printers and 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.640
 faxes but it's the same as with cells 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.140
 click on printing devices and it goes 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.390
 to look like the printer that has 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.829
 installed on your computer in this case 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.260
 that we have installed nate x 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.660
 220 but for all machines it is 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.210
 just ok then what are you going to do you're going 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.550
 to stop at your printer so you're going to 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.280
 right click 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.730
 and she will appear here reference 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.730
 of impression 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:08.410
 impression and it will look like what they are 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.390
 the utilities of the machine so that 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.420
 the ink levels that if you want 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.980
 print top photo but the eyelash 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.840
 what are we going to use suddenly to do 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.300
 this one that is utilities based on 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.060
 utilities and it will look like what this one 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.740
 of injectors and head cleaning is a 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.070
 This head cleaning option is the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.390
 that will help us make the machine 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.240
 try to clean the head since 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.400
 soon if you have stopped using it 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.230
 digital you may have covered some 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.450
 injector but the machine itself 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.430
 you can cover ok then what to do is 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.680
 first a test of injectors the test of 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.420
 injectors will allow us to verify 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.300
 what injectors of our machine this 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.420
 stage here you get the window and you're going to 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.420
 give 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.290
 then your machine at this time 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.200
 must be preparing to take a 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.440
 when printing and it has already taken the 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.490
 impression that will come out on the sheet a 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.010
 line quotes like this one like this example 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.400
 that appears here smooth the impression should 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.680
 leave on the sheet as it shows in this 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.540
 example and if it comes out like this you have to 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.800
 do a head cleaning and this is what 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.590
 that is generating that your impressions 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.570
 they come out defective ok but what are you going to 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.720
 do is click here to clean 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.120
 then when they have cleaned 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.860
 Mark here comes another little window that is going 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.360
 to say that you want to cancel or to 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.700
 start then in this case then 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.420
 you press start and another will come out 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.470
 window as if loading a bar and 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.440
 I'm explaining that you're making a 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.060
 cleaning ok when this finishes the 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.120
 machine is going to give you the option again 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.360
 to print the test return print the 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.090
 test 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.080
 and what it does is check if you see that it has 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.510
 improved the line appointments so what does 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.240
 is to finish the picture that you 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.740
 they come out ok because this would be the steps for 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.280
 what is cleaning head 20 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.280
 injectors
