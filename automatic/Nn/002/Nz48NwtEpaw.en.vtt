 monitor draft free news 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.690
 the purpose of which is to identify 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.090
 propaganda on federal TV channels 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.010
 we don't want to listen to the lies about the news and not 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.439
 we want you to listen to it from time to time 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.150
 the same but state times 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.650
 TV channels do not get tired to push one and 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.660
 the same controversial and sometimes deceitful 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.010
 statements inflaming in the audience extremely 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.109
 negative feelings towards 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.450
 Ukraine there and continued to catch them for 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.130
 hand this time it was again about 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.770
 anniversary of the presidency of Poroshenko and his 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.510
 ways to solve the problems of the country Poroshenko 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.399
 held a big press conference on 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.840
 press conference of the President of Ukraine 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.969
 Russian journalists were not allowed to 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.680
 Russian media entrance to the press conference 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.680
 Poroshenko simply banned 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.550
 missed the first channel and channel Russia 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.680
 one 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.620
 although they somehow did the shooting or they 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.120
 took other people's frames without reference to the author 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.460
 nevertheless two TV channels is not all 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.750
 Russian media journalist publishing 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.040
 home merchant for example a prize 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.619
 obstacles were able to get on the press 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.909
 conference on the appointment of saakashvili 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.140
 the governor said that 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.700
 only former president of georgia 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.619
 wanted 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.720
 will bring order in the Odessa region 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.490
 destination us trances all the more 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.930
 possessing such a scandalous image as 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.390
 Saakashvili is a man who can only 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.830
 lose territory it can be explained 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.990
 only by the fact that these people are controlled 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.270
 completely different forces - around on 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.890
 Poroshenko itself also by itself 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.229
 Michael Wanted 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.299
 Saakashvili does not characterize it not even 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.610
 procedural status 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.110
 besieged saakashvili was not an expert 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.640
 opinion of Bogdan and not at all 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.990
 backed by no arguments other than 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.780
 his personal position about some kind of external 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.220
 the impact on Ukraine of the loss of Georgia 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.220
 parts of the territory are quite official 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.869
 had a hand russia worth turning 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.820
 attention that all state media from 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.979
 times in times saakashvili is bad 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.920
 choice though what does russia have 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.299
 and journalists to business in Odessa is not clear 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.729
 but the role of Ukraine in breaking the truce 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.189
 proves it is not necessary today voiced 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.719
 the guarantor of the constitution is the first channel 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.549
 uses selective quoting 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.229
 intend omitting that action height 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.630
 were the responses to the action of the militia 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.190
 dnr 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.540
 for many releases nowhere 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.250
 says fighting from 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.020
 self-proclaimed republics though 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.840
 Obviously, two fights should be involved. 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.370
 side of the dnr usually 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.900
 Mentioned abstract heroic 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.290
 defense or something like that 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.400
 without reference to the time and place of the scales already 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.260
 shows only times 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.910
 adjoining civilians though 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.290
 before militia openly said that 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.050
 shelling from peaceful areas 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.850
 using civilly as a shield for 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.800
 30 minutes we have not met a single 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.140
 a person who would not want to ask 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.000
 Poroshenko about the end of the civil war 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.930
 at the same time there is a fifth wave of the country 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.670
 mobilization 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.560
 on landfills Americans trains 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.990
 Ukrainian fighters stand out huge 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.730
 money to buy a new weapon and all 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.990
 less likely say political scientists that 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.360
 head of state 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.590
 will hear your voters instead 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.150
 commenting selected first 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.190
 channel political scientists offer you 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.700
 familiarize yourself with the sociological data 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.700
 research across the country 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.040
 according to opinion polls conducted in 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.380
 April, the Russian public fund 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.420
 Opinions more than 80 percent of Crimeans 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.760
 believe that in the composition of Russia live better 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.870
 but to survive today is increasingly being said 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.120
 just people on the streets of Ukraine opinion polls 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.680
 however, the Russian side is also conducting 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.900
 it is not known what opinion poll refers 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.550
 correspondent besides from the moment 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.620
 the entry of the peninsula into Russia 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.090
 Crimea was imposed a lot of sanctions that 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.769
 made life difficult strumming 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.769
 they hardly noticed
