00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:51.580 

you<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.759> gonna<00:01:44.939> lose<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.600> one<00:01:46.400> so<00:01:47.689> ready

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:02:04.809 

I<00:01:53.020> look<00:01:54.020> at<00:01:54.140> that<00:01:55.840> too<00:01:56.840> easy<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:04.490> it's<00:02:04.670> all

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
I look at that too easy and it's all

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.809 
I look at that too easy and it's all
over<00:02:05.240> already<00:02:06.130> that's<00:02:07.130> simply<00:02:07.490> because<00:02:07.520> this

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
over already that's simply because this

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.160 
over already that's simply because this
has<00:02:07.939> got<00:02:08.090> four-wheel<00:02:08.450> drive<00:02:08.720> or<00:02:08.869> I<00:02:08.929> think

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
has got four-wheel drive or I think

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.600 
has got four-wheel drive or I think
anyway<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:12.590> was<00:02:12.739> a<00:02:12.769> bit<00:02:12.950> of<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.099> foregone

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
anyway it was a bit of a foregone

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.440 
anyway it was a bit of a foregone
conclusion<00:02:15.280> yeah

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.990 

howdy<00:02:21.450> four-wheel<00:02:21.870> drive<00:02:22.079> traction<00:02:22.849> does<00:02:23.849> the

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
howdy four-wheel drive traction does the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.670 
howdy four-wheel drive traction does the
job<00:02:24.150> when<00:02:24.359> it's<00:02:24.480> wet<00:02:24.689> and<00:02:25.079> I<00:02:25.140> think<00:02:25.319> even<00:02:25.439> if<00:02:25.620> it

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
job when it's wet and I think even if it

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.539 
job when it's wet and I think even if it
was<00:02:25.769> dry<00:02:26.239> this<00:02:27.239> car<00:02:27.480> would<00:02:27.629> have<00:02:27.750> won<00:02:28.430> so<00:02:29.430> the

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
was dry this car would have won so the

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.039 
was dry this car would have won so the
Audi<00:02:29.849> is<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.150> fastest<00:02:30.569> in<00:02:30.689> a<00:02:30.750> straight<00:02:31.019> line

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
Audi is the fastest in a straight line

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.690 
Audi is the fastest in a straight line

car<00:03:29.129> on<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.280> road<00:03:29.489> it's<00:03:30.180> another<00:03:30.510> victory<00:03:30.840> for

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
car on the road it's another victory for

car on the road it's another victory for
the<00:03:31.109> Mercedes<00:03:31.530> I'm<00:03:31.650> afraid<00:03:31.889> it's<00:03:32.190> it<00:03:33.000> just

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
the Mercedes I'm afraid it's it just

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.280 
the Mercedes I'm afraid it's it just
feels<00:03:33.540> more<00:03:34.109> agile<00:03:34.709> more<00:03:34.979> compact<00:03:36.019> you<00:03:37.019> sit

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
feels more agile more compact you sit

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.809 
feels more agile more compact you sit
slightly<00:03:37.560> higher<00:03:37.919> so<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:38.459> doesn't<00:03:38.669> feel<00:03:38.729> quite

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
slightly higher so it doesn't feel quite

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.969 
slightly higher so it doesn't feel quite
sporty<00:03:39.120> as<00:03:39.389> the<00:03:39.510> Audi<00:03:39.780> but<00:03:40.049> that<00:03:40.680> sort<00:03:40.949> of

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:40.979 
sporty as the Audi but that sort of

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:42.800 
sporty as the Audi but that sort of
gives<00:03:41.069> you<00:03:41.189> a<00:03:41.250> better<00:03:41.370> view<00:03:41.549> of<00:03:41.669> the<00:03:41.729> road<00:03:41.909> it

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
gives you a better view of the road it

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.390 
gives you a better view of the road it
allows<00:03:43.229> you<00:03:43.379> to<00:03:43.500> place<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.859> car<00:03:44.040> much<00:03:44.220> more

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
allows you to place the car much more

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.979 
allows you to place the car much more
accurately<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.060> again<00:03:45.510> it's<00:03:45.659> got<00:03:45.810> more

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
accurately and again it's got more

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.979 
accurately and again it's got more
positive<00:03:46.379> turn<00:03:46.560> in<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:47.760> Audi<00:03:48.030> just<00:03:48.720> feels

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
positive turn in the Audi just feels

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.749 
positive turn in the Audi just feels
that<00:03:49.079> bit<00:03:49.290> wide<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.769> follows<00:03:50.099> cameras<00:03:50.549> in<00:03:50.669> the

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:50.759 
that bit wide it follows cameras in the

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:52.729 
that bit wide it follows cameras in the
road<00:03:50.939> under<00:03:51.780> braking<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.259> acceleration

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
road under braking and acceleration

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.030 
road under braking and acceleration
noise<00:03:53.159> as<00:03:53.430> well<00:03:53.639> I<00:03:53.909> think<00:03:54.269> Mercedes<00:03:55.049> again

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
noise as well I think Mercedes again

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.129 
noise as well I think Mercedes again
it's<00:03:56.489> just<00:03:56.699> for<00:03:57.389> more<00:03:57.479> of<00:03:57.599> the<00:03:57.629> time<00:03:57.840> it's<00:03:57.989> got

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
it's just for more of the time it's got

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:59.960 
it's just for more of the time it's got
that<00:03:58.259> really<00:03:58.409> rich<00:03:58.680> v8<00:03:59.099> verbal<00:03:59.519> whereas<00:03:59.819> the

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
that really rich v8 verbal whereas the

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.270 
that really rich v8 verbal whereas the
Audi<00:04:00.209> it's<00:04:00.599> quite<00:04:01.319> muted<00:04:01.560> except<00:04:02.129> when<00:04:02.220> you

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
Audi it's quite muted except when you

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.740 
Audi it's quite muted except when you
get<00:04:02.430> union<00:04:02.790> change<00:04:03.030> down<00:04:03.239> a<00:04:03.299> key<00:04:03.479> and<00:04:03.569> you<00:04:03.629> get

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
get union change down a key and you get

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.179 
get union change down a key and you get
that<00:04:03.840> nice<00:04:04.019> pop<00:04:04.319> and<00:04:04.500> crack<00:04:04.680> or<00:04:04.889> but<00:04:05.009> other

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:05.189 
that nice pop and crack or but other

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:08.059 
that nice pop and crack or but other
than<00:04:05.310> that<00:04:05.400> it's<00:04:06.000> really<00:04:06.269> you<00:04:06.959> know<00:04:07.079> bizarrely

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
than that it's really you know bizarrely

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.490 
than that it's really you know bizarrely
it's<00:04:08.459> very<00:04:08.669> muted<00:04:08.909> I<00:04:09.269> think<00:04:10.139> there's<00:04:10.259> a<00:04:10.319> sports

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
it's very muted I think there's a sports

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.649 
it's very muted I think there's a sports
exhaust<00:04:10.709> option<00:04:11.280> which<00:04:11.430> I<00:04:11.699> think<00:04:12.329> if<00:04:12.419> you<00:04:12.509> had

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
exhaust option which I think if you had

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:14.599 
exhaust option which I think if you had
their<00:04:12.870> deep<00:04:13.650> enough<00:04:13.859> pockets<00:04:14.009> you'd<00:04:14.370> have<00:04:14.489> to

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
their deep enough pockets you'd have to

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.360 
their deep enough pockets you'd have to
go<00:04:14.729> for<00:04:14.970> basically<00:04:15.590> with<00:04:16.590> cars<00:04:16.859> such<00:04:17.009> as<00:04:17.159> these

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
go for basically with cars such as these

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.620 
go for basically with cars such as these
there<00:04:17.880> are<00:04:17.970> some<00:04:18.060> other<00:04:18.239> things<00:04:18.329> to<00:04:18.599> think

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
there are some other things to think

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.740 
there are some other things to think
about<00:04:18.870> such<00:04:19.590> as<00:04:19.799> interior<00:04:20.280> space<00:04:20.820> and<00:04:21.150> in<00:04:21.630> this

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
about such as interior space and in this

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.640 
about such as interior space and in this
respect<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.740> Mercedes<00:04:23.250> is<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.789> bigger<00:04:23.970> car

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
respect the Mercedes is the bigger car

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.570 
respect the Mercedes is the bigger car
interior<00:04:25.650> quality<00:04:25.770> is<00:04:26.099> also<00:04:26.400> another
