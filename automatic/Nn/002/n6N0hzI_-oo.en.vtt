feel<00:02:29.250> about<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.720> it's<00:02:30.720> supposed<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.140> represent

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
feel about it it's supposed to represent

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.700 
feel about it it's supposed to represent
existing<00:02:32.940> worlds<00:02:33.570> coming<00:02:34.020> together<00:02:34.290> and

existing worlds coming together and

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.640 
existing worlds coming together and
forming<00:02:35.070> a<00:02:35.160> new<00:02:35.430> one<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:36.500> don't<00:02:37.500> know<00:02:37.560> it
