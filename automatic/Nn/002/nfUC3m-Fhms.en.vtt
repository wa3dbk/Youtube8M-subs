hello<00:00:13.410> everyone<00:00:13.920> today<00:00:14.190> I'm<00:00:14.940> gonna<00:00:15.150> show<00:00:15.450> how

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
hello everyone today I'm gonna show how

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.070 
hello everyone today I'm gonna show how
to<00:00:15.929> light<00:00:16.440> up<00:00:16.710> charcoal<00:00:17.369> with<00:00:17.820> only<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.750> piece

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
to light up charcoal with only a piece

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.160 
to light up charcoal with only a piece
of<00:00:19.289> paper<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.789> first<00:00:21.060> step<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.630> lighting<00:00:21.960> of

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
of paper the first step in lighting of

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.590 
of paper the first step in lighting of
charcoal<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:23.070> how<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.460> charcoals<00:00:24.300> are

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
charcoal is how the charcoals are

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.160 
charcoal is how the charcoals are
actually<00:00:25.170> arranged<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.750> how<00:00:27.750> they're

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
actually arranged and how they're

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.980 
actually arranged and how they're
stacked<00:00:28.800> on<00:00:29.519> each<00:00:29.550> other<00:00:30.090> they<00:00:30.480> have<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.869> be

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
stacked on each other they have to be

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.290 
stacked on each other they have to be
stacked<00:00:31.380> on<00:00:31.740> each<00:00:31.830> other<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.850> order<00:00:33.090> to

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
stacked on each other in order to

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.900 
stacked on each other in order to
actually<00:00:33.899> make<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.680> hollow<00:00:35.219> cylinder<00:00:36.180> shape

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
actually make a hollow cylinder shape

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.330 
actually make a hollow cylinder shape
maybe<00:00:38.910> just<00:00:39.239> like<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.450> volcano<00:00:39.960> like<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.680> hollow

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
maybe just like a volcano like a hollow

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.700 
maybe just like a volcano like a hollow
volcano<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:44.239> because<00:00:45.239> we<00:00:45.450> need<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:46.020> middle

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
volcano and because we need that middle

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.130 
volcano and because we need that middle
part<00:00:47.989> middle<00:00:48.989> hollow<00:00:49.320> part<00:00:50.840> this<00:00:51.840> type<00:00:52.110> of

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
part middle hollow part this type of

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.229 
part middle hollow part this type of
arrangement<00:00:52.410> will<00:00:53.219> actually<00:00:53.760> ensure<00:00:53.940> that

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
arrangement will actually ensure that

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.139 
arrangement will actually ensure that
all<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.199> charcoals<00:00:55.860> will<00:00:56.699> light<00:00:56.940> up

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
all of the charcoals will light up

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.970 
all of the charcoals will light up
evenly<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.190> later<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.579> when<00:01:00.289> the<00:01:01.289> charcoals

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
evenly and later on when the charcoals

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.910 
evenly and later on when the charcoals
are<00:01:02.100> ready<00:01:02.370> we're<00:01:03.239> gonna<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.629> very<00:01:03.930> evenly

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
are ready we're gonna have a very evenly

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.060 
are ready we're gonna have a very evenly
distributed<00:01:05.820> heat<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:06.900> very<00:01:07.170> easier<00:01:07.770> to

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
distributed heat and it's very easier to

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.030 
distributed heat and it's very easier to
bake<00:01:08.700> things<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:11.580> next<00:01:11.939> step<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:13.040> just

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
bake things the next step is to just

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.219 
bake things the next step is to just
bundle<00:01:14.400> up<00:01:14.549> some<00:01:14.790> pieces<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.540> paper<00:01:15.840> very

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
bundle up some pieces of paper very

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.440 
bundle up some pieces of paper very
loosely<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:18.920> put<00:01:19.920> them<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.670> hollow

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
loosely and put them in that hollow

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.719 
loosely and put them in that hollow
space<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.170> mentioned<00:01:22.799> previously<00:01:24.320> just<00:01:25.320> very

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
space I mentioned previously just very

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.149 
space I mentioned previously just very
very<00:01:26.729> loosely<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.259> papers<00:01:28.829> can<00:01:29.100> be

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
very loosely so that the papers can be

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.770 
very loosely so that the papers can be
in<00:01:29.430> touch<00:01:29.700> with<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.000> lot<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.420> air<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:32.600> they<00:01:33.600> can

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
in touch with a lot of air and they can

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.590 
in touch with a lot of air and they can
light<00:01:33.990> up<00:01:34.100> easier<00:01:36.320> turn<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.710> match<00:01:38.479> it's<00:01:39.479> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
light up easier turn on the match it's a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.310 
light up easier turn on the match it's a
bit<00:01:39.810> windy<00:01:40.049> here

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.980 

throw<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:46.010> down<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:49.210> papers<00:01:50.210> will<00:01:50.450> light<00:01:50.690> up

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
throw it down the papers will light up

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.430 
throw it down the papers will light up
and<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:52.120> it<00:01:53.120> would<00:01:53.270> like<00:01:53.540> to<00:01:53.690> have<00:01:53.810> all<00:01:54.020> of<00:01:54.320> the

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
and the it would like to have all of the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.080 
and the it would like to have all of the
charcoals<00:01:55.040> it<00:01:55.250> will<00:01:56.170> just<00:01:57.170> produce<00:01:57.380> a<00:01:58.190> huge

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
charcoals it will just produce a huge

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
charcoals it will just produce a huge
amount<00:01:59.450> of<00:01:59.630> heat<00:02:00.790> in<00:02:01.790> a<00:02:02.000> few<00:02:02.210> seconds<00:02:02.870> and

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
amount of heat in a few seconds and

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.940 
amount of heat in a few seconds and
that's<00:02:03.650> enough<00:02:04.040> to<00:02:05.000> light<00:02:05.210> up<00:02:05.480> the<00:02:05.950> charcoals

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
that's enough to light up the charcoals

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.570 
that's enough to light up the charcoals
and<00:02:07.160> then<00:02:07.640> you<00:02:07.820> just<00:02:08.030> have<00:02:08.210> to<00:02:08.800> be<00:02:09.800> patient<00:02:10.430> for

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
and then you just have to be patient for

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.790 
and then you just have to be patient for
a<00:02:10.760> few<00:02:11.120> minutes<00:02:13.750> for<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.780> charcoals<00:02:15.440> to

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
a few minutes for the charcoals to

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.400 
a few minutes for the charcoals to
completely<00:02:16.700> light<00:02:17.060> up<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.600> be<00:02:17.750> ready<00:02:17.990> for

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
completely light up and be ready for

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:33.510 
completely light up and be ready for
cooking

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.120 

I've<00:02:34.090> just<00:02:34.360> put<00:02:34.630> some<00:02:34.870> this<00:02:35.620> is<00:02:35.800> maybe<00:02:36.010> a

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
I've just put some this is maybe a

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.810 
I've just put some this is maybe a
minute<00:02:36.370> or<00:02:36.670> two<00:02:36.970> after<00:02:37.620> I've<00:02:38.620> liked<00:02:39.040> living<00:02:39.550> up

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
minute or two after I've liked living up

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.250 
minute or two after I've liked living up
the<00:02:40.410> pay<00:02:41.410> pieces<00:02:41.950> of<00:02:42.070> paper<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:43.050> just<00:02:44.050> put

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
the pay pieces of paper and just put

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.350 
the pay pieces of paper and just put
some<00:02:44.290> few<00:02:44.770> twigs<00:02:45.190> on<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.520> so<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.700> can<00:02:45.850> see<00:02:46.150> that

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
some few twigs on it so you can see that

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.660 
some few twigs on it so you can see that
the<00:02:46.950> inside<00:02:47.950> of<00:02:48.520> this<00:02:48.880> charcoal<00:02:49.540> is

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
the inside of this charcoal is

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:58.690 
the inside of this charcoal is
completely<00:02:51.670> lit<00:02:51.820> up

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.149 

as<00:02:59.300> you<00:02:59.480> can<00:02:59.629> see<00:03:00.020> it's<00:03:00.290> completely<00:03:00.819> turned<00:03:01.819> on

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.660 

a<00:03:05.189> lot<00:03:05.790> of<00:03:05.819> heat<00:03:06.299> I<00:03:06.890> can<00:03:07.890> feel<00:03:08.069> a<00:03:08.099> lot<00:03:08.280> of<00:03:08.430> heat

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
a lot of heat I can feel a lot of heat

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.740 
a lot of heat I can feel a lot of heat
but<00:03:09.060> I'm<00:03:09.780> sitting<00:03:10.109> next<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.500> it

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.680 

now<00:03:16.290> as<00:03:16.410> you<00:03:16.560> can<00:03:16.680> see<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.520> chocolate<00:03:18.030> as<00:03:18.630> you

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
now as you can see the chocolate as you

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.710 
now as you can see the chocolate as you
can<00:03:19.050> see<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:20.160> charcoals<00:03:20.760> are<00:03:21.030> almost<00:03:21.480> ready

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
can see the charcoals are almost ready

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.420 
can see the charcoals are almost ready
just<00:03:22.680> have<00:03:22.860> to<00:03:23.010> wait<00:03:23.220> maybe<00:03:24.050> 5<00:03:25.050> minutes<00:03:25.430> 10

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
just have to wait maybe 5 minutes 10

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.020 
just have to wait maybe 5 minutes 10
minutes<00:03:26.580> to<00:03:27.390> completely<00:03:27.930> light<00:03:28.110> up<00:03:29.030> that's

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
minutes to completely light up that's

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.620 
minutes to completely light up that's
right<00:03:30.270> thank<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.290> very<00:03:31.470> much
