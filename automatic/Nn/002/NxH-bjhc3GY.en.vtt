00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.359
 favorite but we also have four 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.899
 other colors depending on your 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:40.800
 market 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.079
 so there is the version plus version 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.750

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.789
 all the information you have 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.570
 need to bet so on the front 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:05.690
 this case here we have the flash as well 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.370
 that and the d to help eliminate either 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.100
 underwater knows more about this lot than 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.990
 other things 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.140
 as well as the native artist of five ex 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.330
 like like the versions previously 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.210
 is also the little hole here that's 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.480
 for the same mic with this disc or there 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.720
 and still the bike tasks so that's 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:31.260
 the rather simple case of right on 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.590
 back of the case we have the screen there 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.690
 all layers of the zoom issia at 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.360
 below this we have the key for 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.940

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.860
 at one touch you have access to videos 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:48.880

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:52.689
 menu and the four keys 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.180
 left right to the web is also dependent 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:59.020
 of your in which mode you are 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.030
 you also have the fashion and mcdo 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.329
 different from flash their 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.850
 interrogators as well as compensation 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.619
 of exposure but in lifestyle I have 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.959
 also atypical beautiful so this you 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.540
 help to erase an image it's a 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.750
 veterinary for the images that are 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.540
 stranded or want to keep and 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.190
 so race of these here we have the 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.040
 key for viewing photos and 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.880
 if that playback key this 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.799
 touch here the said chosen playback 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.190
 different information on the screen that 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.670
 you want no on the right side of 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.310
 the device 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.140
 we have the battery door and access the 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.380
 memory card and we have a new 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.049
 new style opening version of the 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.560
 door or closing is so here there 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:50.530
 to a little button at the bottom in the sense it's 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.810
 to say and to open the door one has to 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.470
 weigh on the small button to make the 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.269
 validation 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.540
 So that's for sure it's worth to 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.880
 accidentally open underwater or 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.910
 to any other and therefore to 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.889
 renewable here we have membrane 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.989
 that she plays to ensure that she will have 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:09.790
 not and it's very important to have 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:16.569
 that these be conducted in all one 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:18.430
 donation that there is no sand or other 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:22.420
 grids here that could cause that 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.790
 laurent is also you have access to the 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.609
 city ​​as well as the memory card and or 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.060
 not usb and hdmi 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:33.519
 at the same time so that's the side 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:38.650
 right the left side where we missed 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:41.709
 theirs so it's pretty simple here I saw 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.720
 here we have the grance so for 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.650
 the wrist alliance forgotten train station 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.040
 under the tent knows himself for 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.730
 the absurd to trigger the photo the 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.280
 cold shower 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.980
 aof that here on the side and right next 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.709
 we have a special touch for them 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.329
 burst therefore a touch activates the 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.920
 gusts and you're ready to go 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:06.930
 take pictures continuously 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:09.450
 so this is there express 60 yellow plays 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.920
 almost forget the bottom so the bottom there 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.379
 there is not much in your issue 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.310
 serial but what is important if 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:21.359
 it is the assembly of liquorice 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:24.350
 so we covered all sides 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:29.910
 of the case so that's the new ones 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:33.990
