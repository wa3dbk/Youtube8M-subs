difficult<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.029> get<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.270> gameplay<00:00:18.680> it<00:00:19.680> was<00:00:19.830> a

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
difficult to get this gameplay it was a

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.380 
difficult to get this gameplay it was a
hard<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.220> get<00:00:20.369> kills<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.760> was<00:00:20.850> just<00:00:21.000> hard<00:00:21.180> to

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
hard to get kills it was just hard to

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.810 
hard to get kills it was just hard to
get<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.900> gameplay<00:00:22.410> where<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.680> don't<00:00:22.920> die<00:00:23.070> 15<00:00:23.580> 16

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
get a gameplay where I don't die 15 16

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.700 
get a gameplay where I don't die 15 16
times<00:00:24.119> because<00:00:24.480> there's<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:24.750> many<00:00:24.869> people

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
times because there's so many people

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.800 
times because there's so many people
trying<00:00:25.949> super<00:00:26.160> hard<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.730> sitting<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.420> corners

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
trying super hard and sitting in corners

trying super hard and sitting in corners
and<00:00:28.019> all<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.260> garbage<00:00:28.380> but<00:00:28.740> we'll<00:00:28.859> get<00:00:29.010> into

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
and all that garbage but we'll get into

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.429 
and all that garbage but we'll get into

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
that later let's talk about this gun

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.040 
that later let's talk about this gun
right<00:00:31.830> here<00:00:31.859> right<00:00:32.520> now<00:00:32.550> very<00:00:33.239> very<00:00:33.570> good<00:00:33.719> gun

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
right here right now very very good gun

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.420 
right here right now very very good gun
definitely<00:00:34.590> contender<00:00:34.920> for<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.130> best<00:00:35.280> shot

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
definitely contender for the best shot

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.770 
definitely contender for the best shot
gun<00:00:35.579> in<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.790> game<00:00:35.910> one<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.450> best<00:00:36.600> guns

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
gun in the game one of the best guns

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.569 
gun in the game one of the best guns
actually<00:00:37.350> depending<00:00:37.980> on<00:00:38.070> your<00:00:38.129> place<00:00:38.309> out

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
actually depending on your place out

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.270 
actually depending on your place out
obviously<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.450> think<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> Remington<00:00:40.980> just

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
obviously I think the Remington just

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.100 
obviously I think the Remington just
does<00:00:41.670> kind<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.120> take<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.480> over<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> little<00:00:42.870> bit

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
does kind of take it over a little bit

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.200 
does kind of take it over a little bit
for<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.590> best<00:00:43.739> shotgun<00:00:44.100> because<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.760> easier

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
for the best shotgun because it's easier

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.569 
for the best shotgun because it's easier
it's<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:46.110> can<00:00:46.260> hit<00:00:46.410> fire<00:00:46.649> with<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.129> it's

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
it's just you can hit fire with it it's

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.130 
it's just you can hit fire with it it's
a<00:00:47.700> little<00:00:48.000> over<00:00:48.239> power<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.629> my<00:00:48.750> opinion

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
a little over power to my opinion

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.110 
a little over power to my opinion
whereas<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.770> actually<00:00:50.219> very<00:00:50.250> precise

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
whereas this is actually very precise

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.150 
whereas this is actually very precise
you<00:00:51.300> have<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.510> be<00:00:51.629> extremely<00:00:52.020> accurate<00:00:53.010> with

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
you have to be extremely accurate with

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.220 
you have to be extremely accurate with
it<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.489> order<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.059> get<00:00:54.210> your<00:00:54.239> kills<00:00:54.600> but<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
it in order to get your kills but the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.250 
it in order to get your kills but the
one<00:00:55.440> shot<00:00:55.680> range<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.660> super<00:00:57.660> long<00:00:57.870> you

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
one shot range on it is super long you

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.290 
one shot range on it is super long you
can<00:00:58.440> get<00:00:58.590> gills<00:00:58.890> from<00:00:59.250> across<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.550> room<00:00:59.820> super

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
can get gills from across the room super

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.959 
can get gills from across the room super
easy<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:00.750> long<00:01:00.930> as<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.199> land<00:01:01.440> those<00:01:01.680> shots<00:01:02.100> now

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
easy as long as you land those shots now

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.939 
easy as long as you land those shots now
keeping<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:03.930> mind<00:01:04.110> when<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.559> want<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.860> get

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
keeping that in mind when I want to get

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.410 
keeping that in mind when I want to get
this<00:01:05.100> gun<00:01:05.309> gold<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.939> try<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.119> get<00:01:06.270> these

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
this gun gold and try to get these

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.600 
this gun gold and try to get these
gameplays<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:06.900> stuff<00:01:07.200> like<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.799> knew

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
gameplays and stuff like that I knew

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.460 
gameplays and stuff like that I knew
that's<00:01:09.030> how<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.270> gun<00:01:09.570> works<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.320> was

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
that's how the gun works so I was

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.080 
that's how the gun works so I was
thinking<00:01:10.799> maybe<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.159> should<00:01:11.250> try<00:01:11.610> running<00:01:12.030> it

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
thinking maybe I should try running it

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.149 
thinking maybe I should try running it
more<00:01:12.299> like<00:01:12.479> an<00:01:12.630> AR<00:01:13.049> with<00:01:13.439> attachments<00:01:14.040> and

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
more like an AR with attachments and

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.280 
more like an AR with attachments and
stuff<00:01:14.430> that's<00:01:14.970> exactly<00:01:15.150> what<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.720> did<00:01:15.840> it

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
stuff that's exactly what I did it

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.859 
stuff that's exactly what I did it
actually<00:01:16.680> works<00:01:16.860> out<00:01:17.040> extremely<00:01:17.970> well<00:01:18.180> you

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
actually works out extremely well you

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.929 
actually works out extremely well you
kind<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.140> play<00:01:19.350> at<00:01:19.500> more<00:01:19.740> as<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.340> like<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
kind of play at more as like a like the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.640 
kind of play at more as like a like the
ballista<00:01:21.360> iron<00:01:21.600> sights<00:01:21.990> kind<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.439> but<00:01:22.619> a

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
ballista iron sights kind of but a

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.190 
ballista iron sights kind of but a
little<00:01:23.009> bit<00:01:23.100> easier<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.610> use<00:01:24.000> type<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.990> thing

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
little bit easier to use type of thing

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.740 
little bit easier to use type of thing
you<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.310> kind<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.640> go<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.150> use<00:01:27.299> quick-draw

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
you just kind of go in I use quick-draw

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.749 
you just kind of go in I use quick-draw
handle<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.200> use<00:01:28.350> long<00:01:28.560> barrel<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.009> then<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.549> use

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
handle I use long barrel and then I use

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.760 
handle I use long barrel and then I use
stock<00:01:30.180> now<00:01:30.509> it's<00:01:30.810> two<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.350> those<00:01:31.439> attachments

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
stock now it's two of those attachments

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.980 
stock now it's two of those attachments
that<00:01:32.040> using<00:01:32.340> my<00:01:32.430> ARS<00:01:32.850> obviously<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.689> don't<00:01:33.810> use

long barrel on theirs because it's not

long barrel on theirs because it's not
there<00:01:35.670> i<00:01:35.700> use<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.090> reflex<00:01:36.509> sight<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.500> i'll<00:01:37.590> use

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
there i use the reflex sight so i'll use

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.960 
there i use the reflex sight so i'll use
a<00:01:37.770> longer<00:01:37.979> barrel<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.610> get<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.850> extra

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
a longer barrel on this to get the extra

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.670 
a longer barrel on this to get the extra
range<00:01:39.329> easier<00:01:39.780> one<00:01:39.960> shots<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.380> stuff<00:01:40.530> like

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
range easier one shots and stuff like

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.270 
range easier one shots and stuff like
that<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.070> may<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.270> does<00:01:42.659> work<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.950> stock

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
that and may it does work the stock

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.590 
that and may it does work the stock
really<00:01:44.579> kind<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.820> speed<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.210> up<00:01:45.240> because

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
really kind of speed you up because

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.880 
really kind of speed you up because
you're<00:01:45.689> gonna<00:01:45.810> be<00:01:45.960> aiming<00:01:46.350> most<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.710> time

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
you're gonna be aiming most of the time

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.679 
you're gonna be aiming most of the time
with<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.310> shotgun<00:01:47.549> anyway<00:01:47.820> because<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:48.420> a

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
with the shotgun anyway because it's a

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.780 
with the shotgun anyway because it's a
single<00:01:49.020> strap<00:01:49.290> slug<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.829> has<00:01:49.920> zero<00:01:50.250> spread<00:01:50.640> at

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
single strap slug it has zero spread at

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.429 
single strap slug it has zero spread at
all<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.509> you're<00:01:51.600> going<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.780> be<00:01:51.869> aiming<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.320> get

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
all so you're going to be aiming to get

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.170 
all so you're going to be aiming to get
the<00:01:52.560> accurate<00:01:52.799> shot<00:01:53.250> make<00:01:53.520> sure<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.790> hit<00:01:53.939> them

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
the accurate shot make sure you hit them

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.330 
the accurate shot make sure you hit them
with<00:01:54.329> now<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:55.229> doesn't<00:01:55.500> mean<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.890> can't<00:01:56.159> hip

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
with now that doesn't mean you can't hip

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.100 
with now that doesn't mean you can't hip
fire<00:01:56.579> somebody<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.240> much<00:01:57.570> easier<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:58.020> hit

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
fire somebody is much easier to hit

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.260 
fire somebody is much easier to hit

kills with snipers if you could just hit

by<00:02:09.209> them<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.660> would<00:02:09.840> actually<00:02:10.200> go<00:02:10.470> where

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
by them and it would actually go where

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.790 
by them and it would actually go where
you're<00:02:11.310> looking<00:02:11.610> but<00:02:12.390> this<00:02:12.569> shotgun

you're looking but this shotgun

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.410

essentially<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.790> just<00:02:15.000> doesn't<00:02:15.300> have

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
essentially that it just doesn't have

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.690 
essentially that it just doesn't have
the<00:02:15.450> range<00:02:15.810> of<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.170> sniper<00:02:16.440> it's<00:02:16.830> super<00:02:17.310> easy<00:02:17.340> to

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
the range of a sniper it's super easy to

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.150 
the range of a sniper it's super easy to
get<00:02:17.880> hit<00:02:18.240> buyers<00:02:18.480> still<00:02:18.840> just<00:02:19.440> not<00:02:19.650> as<00:02:19.770> easy<00:02:20.040> to

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
get hit buyers still just not as easy to

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.920 
get hit buyers still just not as easy to
say<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.490> Remington<00:02:21.000> right<00:02:21.300> or<00:02:21.480> any<00:02:21.720> other

shotgun<00:02:22.410> pretty<00:02:22.650> much<00:02:22.800> because<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:23.250> doesn't

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
shotgun pretty much because it doesn't

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.220 
shotgun pretty much because it doesn't
have<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.700> spread<00:02:24.150> it's<00:02:24.330> just<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.570> single<00:02:24.810> slug

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
have that spread it's just a single slug

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.590 
have that spread it's just a single slug

berry berry good setup I use dexterity
as<00:03:03.210> well<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.690> said<00:03:03.900> in<00:03:04.020> my<00:03:04.110> AR<00:03:04.470> so<00:03:04.770> when<00:03:05.100> I'm

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
as well you said in my AR so when I'm

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.710 
as well you said in my AR so when I'm
running<00:03:05.370> like<00:03:05.790> around<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.120> corner<00:03:06.480> if<00:03:06.600> I'm

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
running like around the corner if I'm

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.140 
running like around the corner if I'm
rushing<00:03:07.140> up<00:03:07.320> my<00:03:08.100> gun<00:03:08.310> will<00:03:08.460> come<00:03:08.640> up<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:08.940> lot

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
rushing up my gun will come up a lot

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.030 
rushing up my gun will come up a lot
faster<00:03:09.450> plus<00:03:09.990> you<00:03:10.170> combine<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.530> with<00:03:10.680> quick

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
faster plus you combine that with quick

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.980 
faster plus you combine that with quick
draw<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.520> you're<00:03:11.820> basically<00:03:12.330> golden<00:03:12.750> right

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
draw and you're basically golden right

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.750 
draw and you're basically golden right
there<00:03:13.170> so<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.470> can<00:03:13.710> pretty<00:03:14.100> much<00:03:14.190> be<00:03:14.520> most

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
there so you can pretty much be most

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.090 
there so you can pretty much be most
people<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.450> jump<00:03:15.780> with<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.680> first<00:03:17.010> shot

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
people to the jump with the first shot

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.910 
people to the jump with the first shot
almost<00:03:17.730> every<00:03:18.209> time<00:03:18.450> so<00:03:18.840> very<00:03:19.410> good<00:03:19.590> setup

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
almost every time so very good setup

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.160 
almost every time so very good setup
tried<00:03:20.550> out<00:03:20.760> if<00:03:21.000> it's<00:03:21.150> your<00:03:21.330> style<00:03:21.600> go<00:03:21.930> ahead

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
tried out if it's your style go ahead

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.570 
tried out if it's your style go ahead
and<00:03:22.290> try<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.470> if<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:22.709> don't<00:03:22.920> really<00:03:23.220> like<00:03:23.430> the

and try it if you don't really like the

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.760 
and try it if you don't really like the

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
kind of rushing AR type of thing then

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.170 
kind of rushing AR type of thing then
you<00:03:25.890> can<00:03:25.920> try<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.340> figure<00:03:26.459> out<00:03:26.580> your<00:03:26.790> setup

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
you can try and figure out your setup

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.030 
you can try and figure out your setup

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
as they possibly can because it's double
