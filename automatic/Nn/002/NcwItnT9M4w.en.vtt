00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.130
 located at the foot of the bed but it allows 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.720

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.159
 distance no longer need to monitor him 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.899
 he will stop alone and once 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.610
 immersed this young woman can even 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.670
 surf the internet with a keyboard 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.770

 or watch a TV program in 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.880
 soaping up the heyday of the coup if you 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.560
 are on a showroom that presents 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.780
 near everything that can be done in a 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.250
 domestic space after obviously we 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.760
 made his choice according to his 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.920
 needs 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.410
 so it can go from an installation 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.260
 between quotation marks 15 20 30 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.060
 thousand euros and then after we have no 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.500
 obviously limit and those who have them 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.690
 means can therefore be built 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.430
 this bespoke movie theater with a 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.080
 amazing system that moves the 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.410
 sofa according to the film that we 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.150
 look at all the technologies of this 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.650
 house of the future actually exists 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.100
 today and they can prove 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.080
 very useful even for the stunned 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.470
