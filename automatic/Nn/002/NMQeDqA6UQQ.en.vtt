00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 it's the or hdd which is better this 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.379
 and more you will learn after the intro i 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:17.699
 I am not from apple task and wishes 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:20.490
 you have fun it is the or hdd what 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.859
 should i take anything meaning 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.250
 that actually well I'm starting now 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.400
 from the very back to ssd or just 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.949
 Hdds are storage volumes for computers 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.370
 laptops and sometimes also like cell phones 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.260
 cameras and game consoles and so on 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.379
 this will be data in the form of 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.309
 new or saved individually but how 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.600
 should do that 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.370
 the data are mostly with the help of 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.039
 Algorithm on a storage volume 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.440
 This is the abbreviation for 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.070
 american summer of code of information 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.670
 interchange every sign will be in the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.039
 that can convert to asc death 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.100
 For example, look like that for the 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:09.150
 Term youtube is here is one 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.299
 list of all hs ce signs of these signs 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.760
 salad is converted to binary code 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.820
 so louder little ones and singles arise 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.600
 each of these is called a 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:26.520
 weighs 8 of this joke are a forest 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.890
 One far can pay 256 different 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.140
 include letters or characters 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.729
 and it can always only 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.430
 to spend one 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.070
 Now a little example with the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.460
 Become youtube first 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.040
 Letters converted into the asc ecod 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.860
 After that, they are put into binary code 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.020
 the disk is saved here then 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.420
 even the first difference to the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.390
 store flats to see for on the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.360
 hard disk so on the hdd while 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.930
 These burned as if on a cd 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.120
 they are all small balls 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.270
 which each for a 1 or 1 0 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.740
 By the way , hdd is the abbreviation for 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.260
 harddrive disc 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.260
 it contains several layers 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.600
 layered plates or cds 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.080
 above as described below 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.390
 can 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.330
 the head or the pen 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.590
 burns and reads all the bits while 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.550
 to turn the discs 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:30.210
 a ssd has a solid state drive 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.640
 no letter as medium also no head the 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.220
 reading and writing technique is very different 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.650
 like the hard disk here are the 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.530
 biz in the form of electricity or not electricity 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.810
 stored in tiny cells which must 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.210
 a joke will be described a 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.770
 One cell must be deleted 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.590
 this will be unloaded 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.890
 But what are the advantages and now 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.500
 which is better the ssd is in almost 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.680
 all aspects of hdd definitely 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.660
 think more about that later 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.640
 the ssd has no rotatable medium 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.950
 which saves a lot of power and time 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.890
 electricity can be there because no engine 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.510
 is used and time since the ssd the 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.970
 can get data immediately 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.400
 unlike the hard drive because there 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.530
 must first be serviced until the 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.540
 head and the plate turned right 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.770
 have to read the data and 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.530
 to be able to write 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.140
 the hdd has in my opinion exactly 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.810
 First of all, this is two advantages 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.459
 cheaper and secondly, these in 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.310
 most of them are also much more 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.260
 Storage today has hard disks 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.100
 for home school than three 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.810
 terabyte 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:47.430
 That's 60 million to 388 billion 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:50.310
 and 279 million 66 1624 biz notes 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:54.090
 Let's face it, what an incomprehensible one 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:57.239
 I would sum up a lot 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.950
 clearly a ssd that I'm faster and 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.170
 much less power consumed than 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.090
 advantage was the dax is 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.920
 that 's about it, too 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.170
 my video i hope you have it 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.670
 like shows but with a like 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.670
 and goodbye
