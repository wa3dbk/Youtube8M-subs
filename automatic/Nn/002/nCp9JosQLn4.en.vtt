this device is no Retina display which

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.889 
this device is no Retina display which
might<00:00:37.680> be<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> deal-breaker<00:00:38.280> for<00:00:38.699> some<00:00:39.090> but<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
might be a deal-breaker for some but the

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.290 
might be a deal-breaker for some but the
display<00:00:40.289> nonetheless<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:41.010> pretty<00:00:41.250> good<00:00:41.489> and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
display nonetheless is pretty good and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.750 
display nonetheless is pretty good and
it's<00:00:42.450> not<00:00:42.600> like<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.810> would<00:00:43.260> be<00:00:43.920> putting<00:00:44.190> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
it's not like that would be putting the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.300 
it's not like that would be putting the
tablet<00:00:45.210> straight<00:00:45.540> to<00:00:45.780> your<00:00:45.960> eyes<00:00:46.110> just<00:00:46.530> to

for<00:02:23.460> those<00:02:23.580> of<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.940> wondering<00:02:24.090> about<00:02:24.420> the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
for those of you wondering about the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.050 
for those of you wondering about the
Apple<00:02:24.900> stickers<00:02:25.050> it's<00:02:25.440> there<00:02:25.850> we<00:02:26.850> have<00:02:27.030> the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
Apple stickers it's there we have the

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
so that's what Apple's trying to

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.930 
so that's what Apple's trying to
implement<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:34.800> it<00:02:35.040> looks<00:02:35.220> like<00:02:35.310> we<00:02:35.520> have<00:02:35.640> just

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940

implement and it looks like we have just
the<00:02:36.060> standard<00:02:36.840> adapter<00:02:37.740> and<00:02:38.670> surprise

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
the standard adapter and surprise

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.510 
the standard adapter and surprise
surprise<00:02:39.660> Apple<00:02:40.560> does<00:02:40.710> not<00:02:40.890> include<00:02:41.250> the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
surprise Apple does not include the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.440 
surprise Apple does not include the
Apple<00:02:41.820> earpods<00:02:42.200> so<00:02:43.200> just<00:02:43.470> quickly<00:02:43.830> up<00:02:44.450> wrap
