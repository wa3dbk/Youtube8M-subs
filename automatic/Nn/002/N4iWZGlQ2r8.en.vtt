actually hold a knife you know it as a

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.549 
actually hold a knife you know it as a
stance<00:00:33.579> and<00:00:33.970> you<00:00:34.390> go<00:00:34.510> so<00:00:34.660> hold<00:00:34.870> Magnum<00:00:35.410> and

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559

other different types of weapons and you

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.080 
other different types of weapons and you
can<00:00:38.170> see<00:00:38.350> now<00:00:38.500> in<00:00:38.680> slow<00:00:39.010> motion<00:00:39.280> right<00:00:39.760> there

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
can see now in slow motion right there

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.600 
can see now in slow motion right there
you<00:00:40.540> can<00:00:40.750> pick<00:00:41.020> whatever<00:00:41.350> stances<00:00:42.130> you<00:00:42.280> want

knife here probably also the sniper

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.930 
knife here probably also the sniper
rifle<00:00:47.559> if<00:00:47.680> that's<00:00:47.890> even<00:00:48.129> possible<00:00:48.280> that<00:00:48.730> will

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
rifle if that's even possible that will

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.630 
rifle if that's even possible that will
be<00:00:49.059> really<00:00:49.510> cool<00:00:49.750> 243<00:00:50.620> industries<00:00:51.070> you've

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
see even more nextly um right here you

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.039 
see even more nextly um right here you
can<00:01:02.800> see<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:02.949> colors<00:01:03.479> this<00:01:04.479> is<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.719> top<00:01:04.899> of

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
can see the colors this is the top of

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.319 
can see the colors this is the top of
colors<00:01:05.439> you<00:01:05.560> can<00:01:05.709> get<00:01:05.950> inhale<00:01:06.310> for<00:01:06.579> and<00:01:06.729> so<00:01:07.090> far

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:07.329 
colors you can get inhale for and so far

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:09.599 
colors you can get inhale for and so far
it<00:01:07.450> looks<00:01:07.479> like<00:01:07.659> 20<00:01:08.590> different<00:01:08.740> types<00:01:09.189> of<00:01:09.399> them

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:09.609 
it looks like 20 different types of them

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:12.419 
it looks like 20 different types of them
wall<00:01:09.969> man<00:01:10.270> this<00:01:10.990> is<00:01:11.139> actually<00:01:11.979> pretty<00:01:12.219> cool

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:12.429 
wall man this is actually pretty cool

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:14.489 
wall man this is actually pretty cool
rather<00:01:13.060> than<00:01:13.209> in<00:01:13.389> Halo<00:01:13.630> Reach<00:01:13.719> where<00:01:14.170> we<00:01:14.319> had

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:14.499 
rather than in Halo Reach where we had

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:16.980 
rather than in Halo Reach where we had
like<00:01:15.159> 10<00:01:15.459> of<00:01:15.490> them<00:01:15.639> now<00:01:16.060> we<00:01:16.119> have<00:01:16.359> like<00:01:16.509> a<00:01:16.539> wider

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
like 10 of them now we have like a wider

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.809 
like 10 of them now we have like a wider
variety<00:01:17.289> so<00:01:17.889> everyone<00:01:18.279> can<00:01:18.429> express

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:18.819 
variety so everyone can express

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:22.039 
variety so everyone can express
themselves<00:01:19.389> differently<00:01:19.889> now<00:01:20.889> this<00:01:21.219> clip<00:01:21.609> is

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
themselves differently now this clip is

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.410 
themselves differently now this clip is
actually<00:01:23.049> really<00:01:23.289> interesting<00:01:24.179> let's<00:01:25.179> make

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
actually really interesting let's make

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.080 
actually really interesting let's make
it<00:01:25.450> slower<00:01:25.959> for<00:01:26.259> you<00:01:26.349> guys<00:01:26.560> there<00:01:27.099> we<00:01:27.369> go<00:01:27.579> nice

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
it slower for you guys there we go nice

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.149 
it slower for you guys there we go nice
and<00:01:28.149> slowly<00:01:28.869> now<00:01:29.259> we<00:01:29.319> can<00:01:29.590> actually<00:01:29.770> see

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
and slowly now we can actually see

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.279 
and slowly now we can actually see
what's<00:01:30.340> going<00:01:30.639> on<00:01:30.849> here<00:01:31.090> so<00:01:31.689> basically<00:01:32.049> these

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
what's going on here so basically these

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.639 
what's going on here so basically these
are<00:01:32.349> the<00:01:32.880> specializations<00:01:33.880> you<00:01:34.749> can<00:01:35.079> pick<00:01:35.380> in

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
are the specializations you can pick in

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.709 
are the specializations you can pick in
Halo<00:01:35.859> 4<00:01:36.249> as<00:01:36.429> you<00:01:36.520> can<00:01:36.639> see<00:01:36.789> chicken<00:01:37.539> look<00:01:37.630> at

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 
Halo 4 as you can see chicken look at

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:40.529 
Halo 4 as you can see chicken look at
the<00:01:37.810> helmet<00:01:38.109> look<00:01:38.619> how<00:01:39.039> it<00:01:39.249> changes<00:01:39.880> every

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
the helmet look how it changes every

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.379 
the helmet look how it changes every
time<00:01:40.810> you<00:01:40.990> switch<00:01:41.319> to<00:01:41.349> another<00:01:42.389> different

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:43.389 
time you switch to another different

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:45.839 
time you switch to another different
specialization<00:01:44.380> this<00:01:44.679> is<00:01:44.829> basically<00:01:45.279> what<00:01:45.579> is

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:45.849 
specialization this is basically what is

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:48.779 
specialization this is basically what is
all<00:01:46.119> about<00:01:46.389> so<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.590> specialization<00:01:48.489> also

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
all about so the specialization also

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:50.789 
all about so the specialization also
affect<00:01:49.270> your<00:01:49.509> helmet<00:01:49.989> I<00:01:50.169> don't<00:01:50.529> know<00:01:50.590> if<00:01:50.679> you

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
affect your helmet I don't know if you

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.429 
affect your helmet I don't know if you
can<00:01:50.889> either<00:01:51.069> no<00:01:51.999> take<00:01:52.239> what<00:01:52.659> works<00:01:52.989> and<00:01:53.229> then

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
can either no take what works and then

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.289 
can either no take what works and then
you<00:01:53.619> know<00:01:53.739> switch<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.340> helmet<00:01:54.729> or<00:01:54.909> something

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
you know switch the helmet or something

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.209 
you know switch the helmet or something
else<00:01:55.479> that<00:01:55.569> you<00:01:55.779> already<00:01:55.899> have<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:57.099> know

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
else that you already have you know
