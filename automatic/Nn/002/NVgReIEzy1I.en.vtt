00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
looked pretty good and that you can

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.190 
looked pretty good and that you can
measure<00:04:41.970> all<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.450> way<00:04:42.570> some<00:04:42.810> of<00:04:42.900> them<00:04:43.020> there's

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
measure all the way some of them there's

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.570 
measure all the way some of them there's
like<00:04:43.350> a<00:04:43.380> gap<00:04:43.740> where<00:04:44.010> you<00:04:44.100> can't<00:04:44.310> do<00:04:44.460> the

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
like a gap where you can't do the

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.130 
like a gap where you can't do the
measurements<00:04:45.090> which<00:04:45.270> is<00:04:45.480> really<00:04:45.750> a<00:04:45.810> pain<00:04:46.050> in

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
measurements which is really a pain in

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.980 
measurements which is really a pain in
the<00:04:46.200> butt<00:04:46.380> so<00:04:47.120> but<00:04:48.120> that<00:04:48.330> one<00:04:48.540> for<00:04:48.780> Half<00:04:48.960> Price
