what I have here is a uitextfield

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.380 
what I have here is a uitextfield
control<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.830> I'm<00:00:20.520> going<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.699> click<00:00:20.880> on<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.270> and

control and I'm going to click on it and

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.700 
control and I'm going to click on it and
type<00:00:21.869> in<00:00:22.020> my<00:00:22.550> twitter<00:00:23.550> name<00:00:23.689> and<00:00:24.689> when<00:00:25.439> i<00:00:25.500> press

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
type in my twitter name and when i press

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.300 
type in my twitter name and when i press
return<00:00:26.960> my<00:00:27.960> twitter<00:00:28.199> name<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.619> put<00:00:28.949> into<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
return my twitter name is put into the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.890 
return my twitter name is put into the
UI<00:00:29.580> label<00:00:29.820> up<00:00:30.060> here<00:00:30.269> which<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.510> can't<00:00:30.810> see

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
UI label up here which you can't see

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.770 
UI label up here which you can't see
because<00:00:31.199> it's<00:00:31.529> transparent<00:00:32.420> but<00:00:33.420> essentially

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
because it's transparent but essentially

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.229 
because it's transparent but essentially
the<00:00:34.110> idea<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.649> UI<00:00:35.010> text<00:00:35.340> field<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.850> it's

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
the idea is that UI text field is it's

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.729 
the idea is that UI text field is it's
just<00:00:36.360> something<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.809> can<00:00:37.050> use<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.410> input<00:00:37.710> data

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
just something you can use to input data

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.790 
just something you can use to input data
and<00:00:38.329> it's<00:00:39.329> simple<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.629> use<00:00:39.719> but<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.649> not

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
and it's simple to use but it's not

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.670 
and it's simple to use but it's not
straightforward<00:00:41.190> necessarily<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.590> right<00:00:43.590> off

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
straightforward necessarily to right off

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.500 
straightforward necessarily to right off
the<00:00:43.800> bat<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:43.980> see<00:00:44.219> how<00:00:44.309> it's<00:00:44.489> done<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:44.940> i'm

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
the bat that see how it's done so i'm

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.090 
the bat that see how it's done so i'm
going<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.719> show<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.870> how<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.140> use<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.469> code<00:00:46.829> in

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
going to show you how to use the code in

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.130 
going to show you how to use the code in
my<00:00:47.129> little<00:00:47.670> code<00:00:47.969> toolbox<00:00:48.420> i<00:00:48.600> use<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.989> keep

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
my little code toolbox i use to keep

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.410 
my little code toolbox i use to keep
track<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.410> my<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.860> little<00:00:50.640> simple<00:00:51.000> task<00:00:51.210> like

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
track of my a little simple task like

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.049 
track of my a little simple task like
this<00:00:52.039> you<00:00:53.039> may<00:00:53.190> remember<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.579> from<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
this you may remember this from the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.680 
this you may remember this from the
e-book<00:00:54.690> demonstration<00:00:55.500> i<00:00:55.590> gave<00:00:55.800> earlier<00:00:56.190> i

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
e-book demonstration i gave earlier i

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.900 
e-book demonstration i gave earlier i
have<00:00:57.690> about<00:00:57.899> all<00:00:58.079> my<00:00:58.260> all<00:00:58.739> my<00:00:58.800> code<00:00:59.219> i<00:00:59.399> use<00:00:59.760> i

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
have about all my all my code i use i

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.720 
have about all my all my code i use i
put<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.300> code<00:01:00.570> toolbox<00:01:01.020> basically<00:01:01.730> so

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
put in this code toolbox basically so

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.250 
put in this code toolbox basically so
the<00:01:02.879> first<00:01:03.030> thing<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.300> need<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.660> do<00:01:03.960> with

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
the first thing you need to you do with

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.679 
the first thing you need to you do with
a<00:01:04.650> uitextfield<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.030> need<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.360> use<00:01:06.540> this

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
a uitextfield is you need to use this

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.480 
a uitextfield is you need to use this
delegation<00:01:07.170> pattern<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.860> delegation

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
delegation pattern a delegation

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.840 
delegation pattern a delegation
essentially<00:01:09.360> means<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.780> you're<00:01:10.049> going<00:01:10.170> to

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
essentially means that you're going to

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.640 
essentially means that you're going to
indicate<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> system<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.510> your<00:01:13.110> object

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
indicate to the system that your object

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.289 
indicate to the system that your object
or<00:01:13.860> an<00:01:14.010> object<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.490> going<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.700> act<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:15.090> behalf

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
or an object is going to act on behalf

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.870 
or an object is going to act on behalf
of<00:01:15.810> something<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.280> case<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.670> want

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
of something and in this case we want

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.760 
of something and in this case we want
our<00:01:18.060> UI<00:01:18.270> view<00:01:18.630> controller<00:01:18.659> which<00:01:19.350> i'm<00:01:19.500> calling

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
our UI view controller which i'm calling

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.310 
our UI view controller which i'm calling
text<00:01:20.100> field<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:20.880> now<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.780> act<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.170> behalf

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
text field for for now to act on behalf

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.910 
text field for for now to act on behalf
of<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.770> uitextfield<00:01:23.720> so<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:25.049> had<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.350> implement

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
of a uitextfield so we had to implement

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.679 
of a uitextfield so we had to implement
the<00:01:26.130> UI<00:01:26.310> text<00:01:26.640> field<00:01:26.790> delegate<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.570> do

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
the UI text field delegate and you do

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.590 
the UI text field delegate and you do
that<00:01:27.840> by<00:01:27.900> typing<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.890> intimate<00:01:29.520> just<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
that by typing this intimate just the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.819 
that by typing this intimate just the
name<00:01:30.780> going<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.960> delegate<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.500> between<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
name going to delegate in between the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.740 
name going to delegate in between the
greater<00:01:32.040> than<00:01:32.220> less<00:01:32.369> than<00:01:32.430> signs<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.689> you

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
greater than less than signs and you

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.660 
greater than less than signs and you
always<00:01:33.869> put<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.140> after<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.740> name<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
always put it after the name of the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.170 
always put it after the name of the
class<00:01:36.470> so<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.740> interface<00:01:38.340> file<00:01:38.729> for

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
class so this is the interface file for

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.480 
class so this is the interface file for
my<00:01:39.869> view<00:01:40.049> controller<00:01:40.380> i'm<00:01:40.500> using<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.130> demo

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
my view controller i'm using is to demo

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.690 
my view controller i'm using is to demo
the<00:01:41.790> UI<00:01:41.939> text<00:01:42.240> field<00:01:43.159> okay<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
the UI text field okay so this is the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.480 
the UI text field okay so this is the
view<00:01:44.850> controller<00:01:45.320> implementation<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.950> just

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
view controller implementation so just

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.310 
view controller implementation so just
to<00:01:47.670> do<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.180> part<00:01:48.540> real<00:01:48.689> quick<00:01:48.899> i<00:01:48.990> just<00:01:49.140> want

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
to do this part real quick i just want

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.230 
to do this part real quick i just want
to<00:01:49.380> show<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.590> how<00:01:49.950> i<00:01:49.979> implement<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.850> controls

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
to show you how i implement the controls

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.420 
to show you how i implement the controls
i<00:01:51.509> essentially<00:01:52.079> put<00:01:52.320> local<00:01:52.500> instances<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.280> the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
i essentially put local instances of the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.630 
i essentially put local instances of the
label<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.149> uitextfield<00:01:54.930> up<00:01:55.409> here<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.829> of

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
label and a uitextfield up here and of

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.789 
label and a uitextfield up here and of
course<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:56.880> me<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.420> will<00:01:57.810> be<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.320> late

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
course just me this will be a late

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.410 
course just me this will be a late
reference<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.310> label<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.820> will<00:01:59.969> just<00:02:00.180> be<00:02:00.299> the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
reference to label this will just be the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.600 
reference to label this will just be the
reference<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.930> uitextfield

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
reference to a uitextfield

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.390 
reference to a uitextfield
in<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.660> viewdidload<00:02:03.960> method<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.710> went<00:02:05.340> ahead

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
in the viewdidload method I went ahead

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.490 
in the viewdidload method I went ahead
and<00:02:05.520> created<00:02:05.700> these<00:02:06.060> label<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.050> a<00:02:07.110> text<00:02:07.380> field

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
and created these label and a text field

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.469 
and created these label and a text field
and<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.190> do<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.460> in<00:02:08.640> basic<00:02:09.000> way<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.179> can<00:02:09.360> use

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
and you do that in basic way you can use

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.150 
and you do that in basic way you can use
interface<00:02:09.840> builder<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.229> do<00:02:10.350> this<00:02:10.470> or<00:02:10.740> I<00:02:10.770> use

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
interface builder to do this or I use

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.950 
interface builder to do this or I use
for<00:02:11.400> clarity<00:02:11.850> for<00:02:12.000> these<00:02:12.150> examples<00:02:12.450> i<00:02:12.690> like<00:02:12.870> to

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
for clarity for these examples i like to

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.960 
for clarity for these examples i like to
use<00:02:12.990> code<00:02:13.320> so<00:02:14.070> essentially<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:14.580> make<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.760> label

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
use code so essentially to make a label

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.900 
use code so essentially to make a label
you<00:02:15.300> allocate<00:02:15.840> in<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.230> edit<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:17.190> do<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.760> you

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
you allocate in and edit you do that you

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.670 
you allocate in and edit you do that you
assign<00:02:18.240> a<00:02:18.270> frame<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.500> is

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
assign a frame to it that this is

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.530 
assign a frame to it that this is
positions<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.400> on<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.580> surface<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.030> set<00:02:21.450> the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
positions it on the surface you set the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.990 
positions it on the surface you set the
properties<00:02:21.930> like<00:02:22.140> text<00:02:22.500> alignment<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:23.430> text

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
properties like text alignment the text

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.630 
properties like text alignment the text
label<00:02:24.810> text<00:02:25.050> it<00:02:25.260> starts<00:02:25.560> out<00:02:25.680> with<00:02:25.860> then<00:02:26.550> you

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
label text it starts out with then you

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.850 
label text it starts out with then you
add<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.180> sub<00:02:27.390> view<00:02:27.570> collection<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.740> do

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
add to the sub view collection you do

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.500 
add to the sub view collection you do
the<00:02:28.980> same<00:02:29.130> sorts<00:02:29.580> of<00:02:29.610> things<00:02:29.760> for<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.180> text

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
the same sorts of things for the text

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.970 
the same sorts of things for the text
view<00:02:30.540> itself<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.260> only<00:02:31.500> difference<00:02:31.680> really

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
view itself the only difference really

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.490 
view itself the only difference really
here<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:32.910> you'll<00:02:33.060> see<00:02:33.300> that<00:02:33.510> we<00:02:34.170> assign

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
here is that you'll see that we assign

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.280 
here is that you'll see that we assign
the<00:02:34.800> text<00:02:35.190> few<00:02:35.490> text<00:02:35.970> fields<00:02:36.270> delegate<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:37.260> the

the text few text fields delegate to the

the text few text fields delegate to the
self<00:02:37.860> which<00:02:38.250> means<00:02:38.550> that<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:39.480> code<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.840> see

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
self which means that this code you see

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.680 
self which means that this code you see
here<00:02:40.380> which<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.770> implementation<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.430> the

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
subclass of UI view controller I called

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.490 
subclass of UI view controller I called
text<00:02:44.400> field<00:02:44.610> is<00:02:44.790> going<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.630> act<00:02:45.810> as<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:46.020> delegate

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
text field is going to act as a delegate

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.310 
text field is going to act as a delegate
for<00:02:46.800> our<00:02:47.310> text<00:02:47.790> field<00:02:48.030> object<00:02:48.660> we<00:02:48.750> have<00:02:48.900> as<00:02:49.170> a

for our text field object we have as a

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
collection of this UI view controller so

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.560 
collection of this UI view controller so
you<00:02:53.010> could<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.459> mean<00:02:53.730> this<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.209> common

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
you could you I mean this is a common

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.150 
you could you I mean this is a common
pattern<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:54.930> tend<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.260> just<00:02:55.440> use<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.130> i

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
pattern you tend to just use the you i

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.340 
pattern you tend to just use the you i
can<00:02:56.459> just<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.730> overall<00:02:56.880> UI<00:02:57.330> control<00:02:57.900> or<00:02:58.080> UI

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
can just the overall UI control or UI

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.870 
can just the overall UI control or UI
view<00:02:58.560> controller<00:02:58.590> as<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.340> delegate<00:02:59.760> you

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
view controller as the delegate you

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.310 
view controller as the delegate you
could<00:03:00.030> also<00:03:00.150> assign<00:03:00.570> different<00:03:00.750> objects<00:03:01.200> that

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
could also assign different objects that

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.750 
could also assign different objects that
act<00:03:01.440> on<00:03:01.530> behalf<00:03:01.709> of<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.130> text<00:03:02.370> field<00:03:02.520> as<00:03:02.640> well

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
act on behalf of the text field as well

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.479 
act on behalf of the text field as well
if<00:03:02.880> you<00:03:02.970> if<00:03:03.239> you<00:03:03.360> want<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.660> do<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:03.900> instead

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
if you if you want to do that instead

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.949 
if you if you want to do that instead
down<00:03:05.489> here<00:03:05.850> is<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.300> D<00:03:06.450> lock<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:06.840> this

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
down here is the D lock and this

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.479 
down here is the D lock and this
essentially<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.590> release<00:03:07.830> as<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.040> text<00:03:08.400> field

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
essentially to release as a text field

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.229 
essentially to release as a text field

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
essentially a delegate method and this

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.199 
essentially a delegate method and this
is<00:03:16.350> going<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.890> be<00:03:17.100> executed<00:03:17.370> when<00:03:17.820> you<00:03:18.000> as<00:03:18.180> a
