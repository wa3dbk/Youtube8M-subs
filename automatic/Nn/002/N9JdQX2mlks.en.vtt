00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:08.290
 It is Yes Hello er typhoon information 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:11.679
 I would like to English Dayu Information Notice 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:18.740
 I want to notify you by a google earth 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:28.520
 Currently the typhoon No. 11 will someday be in the Philippines northeast latitude 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:30.740
 At 19 Â° 05 minutes east longitude 129 minutes 50 minutes travel north at a speed of approximately 15 kilometers per hour 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:38.180
 I understand that there 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:41.900
 I would like to see the eye of the typhoon This is the Philippine Sea Yes my eyes in such a state 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.290
 I'm getting firm and I'm getting a steady member of the rotation m 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:48.340
 From now on 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:53.240
 I think I will turn to go through a place where the water temperature is a little high 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:58.380
 The Chinese New Pressure is 950 hectopascal 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:01:05.909
 We are moving north at a speed of about 15 kilometers per hour 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:14.670
 Yes Maximum wind speed is 40 m maximum wind speed near the center 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:19.859
 Maximum wind velocity 40 meters near the center Maximum instantaneous wind velocity 60 meters from the center at a radius of 60 meters 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:25.930
 Within a kilometer there is a storm of wind speed over 25 meters 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:30.910
 The south of the center is less than 440 km and Kitagawa 303 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.650
 In 10 km or less, wind with a wind speed of 15 meters or more is blowing 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:42.090
 a 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:49.350
 24 hours 6 days 9 Sometimes the Japanese south of latitude 21 degrees 55 minutes east longitude 130 degrees 40 minutes of the typhoon center of 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:51.640
 It is expected to be a very strong tough reaching 160 km radius around the center of 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:59.050
 The pressure at the center is 940 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:02:00.580
 The maximum wind speed around the center of the Hectopascal is 45 meters, the maximum instantaneous wind speed is 65 meters 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:08.649
 Expected 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:10.119
 Within a radius of No. 3 310 km from the center of the forecast circle, it enters a storm water with a wind speed of 25 meters or more 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.630
 There is a risk 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.200
 48 hours 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:22.939
 It will be nine o'clock or not 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:31.159
 South Daito Island south about 109,120 km 24 degrees north latitude 131 degrees east longitude 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:34.170
 It is expected that it will reach a distant lightning of 300 radius around 20 minutes . 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:35.600
 The pressure is 945 hectopascal 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.870
 Ning 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:46.720
 I will be worried about the future movement a 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:49.410
 I want to post that twice and three times when approaching Kyushu along with the future movement 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.920
 This is strictly the Meteorological Agency 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:56.840
 It was-just read it 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.560
 Well everyone of the Meteorological Agency as much as possible 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:06.739
 Let's grasp weather information correctly 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:13.340
 And this is the only typhoon I'm going to Philippines and Okinawa now 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:14.360
 The water temperature is high, so the power is intensified up to here , and after 8 days of struggle, it flows after 8 days 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.860
 So much 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:26.000
 Because I think that high to say the water temperature of around here 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:26.000
 It is also a way Nde gradually do you think the right side of the Pacific Ocean high pressure is weak and to gradually north 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:36.170
 There is a possibility of going to the mainland of China or to the southeast sea when the Pacific high pressure bursts out 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.830
 But this is weak and I'm going to pull back like this 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.670
 Here a 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:48.290
 I think I will go to Shikoku Osaka Nagoya 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:55.909
 It is said that it is likely to be heading towards the direction of Kagoshima , which is the main force of Kyushu at present. 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:56.780
 Chapter 4 is out with such a feeling that there is a cloud on some parts of Kyushu and warm air now 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:01.939
 Because 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:06.109
 It 's raining. This is the current satellite of the nine states. 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:06.680
 I explain using satellite of google earth It is quite clouded 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:08.310
 I will 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.739
 a It has been raining since 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:19.049
 I think I will shake again, so I think I will shake or shake, so other places are swollen around 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:25.230
 It is Teru I agree, but it is Kyushu Yamaguchi Kitakyushu Kumamoto 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:27.530
 Well it seems that some part of the arm rain cloud is on the camera 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:31.970
 Now for this reason 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.660
 We show typhoon information and important point of cloud in google earth 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:39.170
 a 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:42.590
 The clouds are getting bigger and bigger. The size of the typhoon is quite clear . 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:45.950
 I can not see my eyes clearly yet, but it's almost time 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.250
 I think that I may see the eyes even though the deterioration 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:52.680
 It has been sent to the typhoon information for reasons that went so 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:59.150
 Or if still stronger is the 2nd 3rd and force 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.150
 In addition, in everyone in such a reason that I would like to video posting
