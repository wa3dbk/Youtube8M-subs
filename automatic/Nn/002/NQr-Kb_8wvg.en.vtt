bin to Iraq there's some like fine sand

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.920 
bin to Iraq there's some like fine sand
still<00:02:00.509> inside<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.020> holes<00:02:01.290> here<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:02.930> it

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
still inside of the holes here and it

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.539 
still inside of the holes here and it
seems<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.619> have<00:02:04.710> served<00:02:04.890> him<00:02:05.040> well<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.430> I'll

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
seems to have served him well and I'll

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.679 
seems to have served him well and I'll
go<00:02:05.670> into<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.939> kind<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.240> where<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.450> little

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
go into the kind of the where a little

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.960 
go into the kind of the where a little
bit<00:02:06.810> more<00:02:06.960> later<00:02:07.590> but<00:02:07.860> like<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.459> said<00:02:08.520> that's<00:02:08.819> a

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
bit more later but like I said that's a

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.850 
bit more later but like I said that's a
drop<00:02:09.149> attachment<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.200> then<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.530> just<00:02:10.679> use

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
drop attachment and then you just use

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.900 
drop attachment and then you just use
the<00:02:10.979> power<00:02:11.160> cord<00:02:11.400> down<00:02:11.520> here<00:02:11.730> at<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.849> bottom

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
the power cord down here at the bottom

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.880 
the power cord down here at the bottom
that

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
that

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.950 
that
through<00:02:13.160> these<00:02:13.250> two<00:02:13.430> grommets<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:14.180> tie<00:02:14.900> to

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
through these two grommets to tie to

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.720 
through these two grommets to tie to
your<00:02:15.110> leg<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.380> prevent<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:15.740> from<00:02:15.920> flopping

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
your leg to prevent it from flopping

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.730 
your leg to prevent it from flopping
around<00:02:16.910> too<00:02:17.090> much<00:02:17.260> let<00:02:18.260> me<00:02:18.350> pull<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.620> knife

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
around too much let me pull the knife

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.940 
around too much let me pull the knife
out<00:02:18.920> here<00:02:19.330> it's<00:02:20.330> got<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.540> 4.5<00:02:21.230> inch<00:02:21.440> blade<00:02:21.680> with

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
out here it's got a 4.5 inch blade with

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.500 
out here it's got a 4.5 inch blade with
serrations<00:02:22.490> on<00:02:22.610> here<00:02:22.850> but<00:02:23.030> I<00:02:23.120> think<00:02:23.150> are<00:02:23.390> about

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
serrations on here but I think are about

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.620 
serrations on here but I think are about
an<00:02:23.630> inch<00:02:23.780> it's<00:02:24.650> got<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:24.830> very<00:02:25.040> thick<00:02:25.459> spine<00:02:25.850> that

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
an inch it's got a very thick spine that

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.120 
an inch it's got a very thick spine that
comes<00:02:26.870> kind<00:02:27.140> of<00:02:27.230> down<00:02:27.380> a<00:02:27.410> little<00:02:27.680> bit<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.010> then

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
comes kind of down a little bit and then

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.890 
comes kind of down a little bit and then
gets<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.400> little<00:02:28.520> bit<00:02:28.700> thicker<00:02:28.880> again<00:02:29.209> the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
gets a little bit thicker again the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.470 
gets a little bit thicker again the
paint<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:31.250> coating<00:02:31.820> is<00:02:31.850> started<00:02:32.209> to<00:02:32.300> wear<00:02:32.450> a

I<00:04:01.010> would<00:04:01.549> definitely<00:04:01.700> purchase<00:04:02.630> this<00:04:02.989> as<00:04:03.260> I

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
I would definitely purchase this as I

I would definitely purchase this as I
would<00:04:04.130> maybe<00:04:04.310> a<00:04:04.459> rat<00:04:04.790> three<00:04:05.570> or<00:04:05.810> even<00:04:06.590> rat<00:04:07.220> for

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
would maybe a rat three or even rat for

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.310 
would maybe a rat three or even rat for
us<00:04:07.670> which<00:04:08.000> is<00:04:08.120> a<00:04:08.150> more<00:04:08.329> comparable<00:04:08.750> size<00:04:08.959> it

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
us which is a more comparable size it

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.349 
us which is a more comparable size it
might<00:04:09.829> be<00:04:09.950> a<00:04:09.980> slightly<00:04:10.340> more<00:04:10.579> expensive<00:04:10.670> but<00:04:11.299> I

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
might be a slightly more expensive but I

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.539 
might be a slightly more expensive but I
really<00:04:11.720> like<00:04:11.870> the<00:04:11.989> benchmade<00:04:12.350> as<00:04:12.560> it<00:04:13.190> is<00:04:13.340> not

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
really like the benchmade as it is not

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.740 
really like the benchmade as it is not
as<00:04:13.850> much<00:04:13.940> of<00:04:14.180> a<00:04:14.480> chubby<00:04:15.470> kind<00:04:16.340> of<00:04:16.459> blade<00:04:17.180> it's

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
as much of a chubby kind of blade it's

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.820 
as much of a chubby kind of blade it's
not<00:04:17.930> so<00:04:18.140> far<00:04:18.380> as<00:04:18.620> tall<00:04:20.109> if<00:04:21.109> this<00:04:21.380> dimension

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
not so far as tall if this dimension

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.040 
not so far as tall if this dimension
here<00:04:22.039> so<00:04:23.030> it<00:04:23.150> provides<00:04:23.510> like<00:04:23.720> a<00:04:23.750> slimmer

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
here so it provides like a slimmer

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.350 
here so it provides like a slimmer
profile<00:04:24.530> so<00:04:24.740> it<00:04:24.830> rides<00:04:25.010> a<00:04:25.099> little<00:04:25.280> bit<00:04:25.370> lower

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
profile so it rides a little bit lower

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.260 
profile so it rides a little bit lower

local<00:04:43.069> pawnshop<00:04:43.460> I<00:04:43.639> could<00:04:44.150> not<00:04:44.270> believe<00:04:44.389> the

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
local pawnshop I could not believe the

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:47.200 
local pawnshop I could not believe the
deal<00:04:44.750> I<00:04:44.780> got<00:04:44.990> on<00:04:45.139> it<00:04:45.289> the<00:04:46.039> it<00:04:46.699> also<00:04:46.969> has<00:04:47.090> the

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
deal I got on it the it also has the

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.390 
deal I got on it the it also has the
option<00:04:47.240> for<00:04:47.840> a<00:04:47.870> plastic<00:04:48.560> molded<00:04:48.860> sheath<00:04:49.099> that

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
option for a plastic molded sheath that

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.999 
option for a plastic molded sheath that
I<00:04:49.669> think<00:04:49.939> is<00:04:50.030> another<00:04:50.530> thirty<00:04:51.530> or<00:04:51.710> forty

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:52.009 
I think is another thirty or forty

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:54.369 
I think is another thirty or forty
dollars<00:04:52.370> I'm<00:04:52.610> not<00:04:52.969> totally<00:04:53.150> sure<00:04:53.330> on<00:04:53.509> that<00:04:53.539> but

00:04:54.369 --> 00:04:54.379 
dollars I'm not totally sure on that but

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:55.629 
dollars I'm not totally sure on that but
it<00:04:54.500> kind<00:04:54.650> of<00:04:54.680> allows<00:04:54.860> for<00:04:55.129> that<00:04:55.250> little<00:04:55.400> more

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
it kind of allows for that little more

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.100 
it kind of allows for that little more
form-fitting<00:04:55.939> option<00:04:56.419> if<00:04:56.509> that's<00:04:56.689> sort<00:04:57.080> of

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
form-fitting option if that's sort of

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.649 
form-fitting option if that's sort of
your<00:04:57.259> style<00:04:57.530> it<00:04:58.069> comes<00:04:58.370> in<00:04:58.610> tanto<00:04:59.090> or<00:04:59.360> drop
