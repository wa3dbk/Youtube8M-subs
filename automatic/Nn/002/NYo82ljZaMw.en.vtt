 Christ not only spoke of love but 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:41.260
 he showed it every day of his life not only 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:44.590
 he taught but he also showed us 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:47.920
 how to help the weak raise the 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:51.520
 hands fall and strengthen the knees 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:55.480
 weakened Christ knows how to minister to 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:59.710
 others with perfection if we are their 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:01.660
 hands we should not do the same 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.190
 every time we go to see a family 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.560
 we carry the saint with us 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.850
 priesthood in the name of the Lord as 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.910
 representatives of our savior 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:13.000
 Jesus Christ and he acts by means of 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:16.300
 we and who receive you there 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.420
 I will be also because I will go in front of 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.240

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.700
 your sinister and my spirit will be 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.600

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:31.180

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:35.169
 this promise brings a lot 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:39.160
 peace to the one who is going to visit someone not 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:42.340
 we have to be perfect nor do we have to 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.190
 know everything we just have to do the best 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.410
 that we can in the name of the lord and he 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:51.240
 will give us the power we need and 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.240
 I felt almost that it was my place 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.540
 and I know that this is an answer to my 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.540
 prayers 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:03.660
 and I have no doubt I will not repeat 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.660
 the priesthood is true 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.720
 I feel an immense love that takes me to 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:14.660
 visit them and share my testimony 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:18.440
 God the father and his son Jesus Christ 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:20.470
 I know that God lives and that we can hear his 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.470
 voice 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.680
 and that he helps us know how to 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.360
 minister to people to take care of them and 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.000
 love has shown them now I love 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.300
 come out and feel how beautiful it is to serve 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.389
 others and share my testimony by 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:39.440
 means of atonement every human being 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:41.849
 can be elevated blessed and 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.590

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:54.990
 humanity I know it's true and I share it
