defeats<00:02:17.700> was<00:02:18.700> not<00:02:18.910> good<00:02:19.120> because<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.720> think<00:02:20.280> we

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
defeats was not good because I think we

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.750 
defeats was not good because I think we
didn't<00:02:21.580> play<00:02:21.730> well<00:02:22.019> we<00:02:23.019> didn't<00:02:23.380> deserve<00:02:24.130> a

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
didn't play well we didn't deserve a

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.170 
didn't play well we didn't deserve a
better<00:02:25.030> result<00:02:25.600> in<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.620> last<00:02:26.800> two<00:02:27.010> games<00:02:27.180> but

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
better result in the last two games but

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.460 
better result in the last two games but
we<00:02:28.360> know<00:02:29.040> our<00:02:30.040> situation<00:02:30.840> we<00:02:31.840> play<00:02:32.080> at<00:02:32.260> home

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
we know our situation we play at home

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.910 
we know our situation we play at home
our<00:02:32.830> last<00:02:33.220> home<00:02:33.790> game<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:35.410> course<00:02:35.709> the

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
our last home game and of course the

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.350 
our last home game and of course the
defense<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:38.200> shaft<00:02:38.500> at<00:02:39.489> least<00:02:39.790> a<00:02:39.940> good<00:02:40.090> game

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
defense the shaft at least a good game

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.650 
defense the shaft at least a good game
but<00:02:40.390> most<00:02:41.290> important<00:02:41.830> three<00:02:42.010> points<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.660> in

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
but most important three points and in

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.650 
but most important three points and in
my<00:02:43.840> opinion<00:02:44.019> it's<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.860> must-win<00:02:45.550> game<00:02:46.150> this

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
my opinion it's a must-win game this

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.970 
my opinion it's a must-win game this

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
determination not just to get the right

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.300 
determination not just to get the right
result<00:02:49.989> but<00:02:50.170> also<00:02:50.320> putting<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:51.130> right

not<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:55.170> tactical<00:02:56.170> equality<00:02:56.950> question<00:02:58.320> the

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
not a tactical equality question the

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.070 
not a tactical equality question the

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.150 
that one what can you expect from Aston
Villa<00:03:52.030> this<00:03:52.240> weekend<00:03:52.599> I<00:03:52.860> think<00:03:53.860> they<00:03:53.950> changed

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
Villa this weekend I think they changed

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.960 
Villa this weekend I think they changed
a<00:03:55.000> little<00:03:55.360> bit<00:03:55.510> of<00:03:55.690> style<00:03:55.990> when<00:03:56.410> when<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.550> new

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
a little bit of style when when the new

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.080 
a little bit of style when when the new
manager<00:03:58.480> came<00:03:58.750> in<00:03:59.340> they<00:04:00.340> play<00:04:00.550> more<00:04:00.819> football

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
manager came in they play more football

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.350 
manager came in they play more football
I<00:04:01.360> think<00:04:01.660> they<00:04:01.780> play<00:04:01.959> more<00:04:02.200> offensive<00:04:02.800> and<00:04:03.360> a

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
I think they play more offensive and a

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.320 
I think they play more offensive and a
difference<00:04:04.810> that<00:04:05.080> different<00:04:05.470> style<00:04:05.770> then

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
difference that different style then

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.430 
difference that different style then

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
always important because that that makes

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.170 
always important because that that makes
a<00:04:47.200> lot<00:04:47.349> in<00:04:47.530> the<00:04:47.620> game<00:04:47.650> and<00:04:48.070> if<00:04:48.550> you<00:04:48.669> start<00:04:48.880> will

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
a lot in the game and if you start will

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.330 
a lot in the game and if you start will
which<00:04:50.550> which<00:04:51.550> very<00:04:52.770> aggressive<00:04:53.770> and<00:04:54.039> then

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
which which very aggressive and then

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.950 
which which very aggressive and then
then<00:04:54.820> it's<00:04:54.970> more<00:04:55.210> difficult<00:04:55.360> for<00:04:55.870> the

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
then it's more difficult for the

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.310 
then it's more difficult for the
opponent<00:04:56.500> and<00:04:56.820> we<00:04:57.820> didn't<00:04:58.150> start<00:04:58.390> well<00:04:58.690> in<00:04:59.169> the

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320
