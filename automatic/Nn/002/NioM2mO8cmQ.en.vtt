00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
Facebook if you're into that kind of

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.490 
Facebook if you're into that kind of
thing<00:05:22.490> I<00:05:22.640> would<00:05:22.940> argue<00:05:23.300> that<00:05:23.510> the<00:05:23.750> ps3<00:05:24.260> has<00:05:24.320> got

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
thing I would argue that the ps3 has got

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.610 
thing I would argue that the ps3 has got
the<00:05:24.590> more<00:05:24.770> useful<00:05:25.070> version<00:05:25.780> of<00:05:26.780> the<00:05:27.230> add-ons

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
the more useful version of the add-ons

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.190 
the more useful version of the add-ons
because<00:05:28.040> the<00:05:28.160> ps3<00:05:28.610> allows<00:05:29.090> you<00:05:29.360> to<00:05:29.540> record<00:05:29.930> a

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
because the ps3 allows you to record a
