okay<00:00:00.539> here's<00:00:01.050> another<00:00:01.490> little<00:00:02.490> trick<00:00:03.419> when

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
okay here's another little trick when

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.130 
okay here's another little trick when
you<00:00:04.350> want<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.770> mount<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.609> template<00:00:06.120> you<00:00:06.720> tape

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
you want to mount the template you tape

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.709 
you want to mount the template you tape
up<00:00:07.350> your<00:00:07.820> panel<00:00:08.820> with<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.000> blue<00:00:09.210> tape<00:00:09.480> to

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
up your panel with a blue tape to

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.999 
up your panel with a blue tape to
protect<00:00:09.900> it<00:00:10.320> okay<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:11.130> use<00:00:11.969> some<00:00:12.559> very<00:00:13.559> strong

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
protect it okay and use some very strong

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.230 
protect it okay and use some very strong
double<00:00:14.610> sided<00:00:14.820> tape<00:00:16.340> now<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.400> can<00:00:17.609> use<00:00:17.850> foam

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
double sided tape now you can use foam

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.480 
double sided tape now you can use foam
tape<00:00:18.570> depends<00:00:19.170> on<00:00:19.260> how<00:00:19.439> precise<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:19.980> really

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
tape depends on how precise you really

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.759 
tape depends on how precise you really
want<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.760> be<00:00:20.910> foam<00:00:21.600> tape<00:00:21.900> sits<00:00:22.199> up<00:00:22.380> about<00:00:22.619> an

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
want to be foam tape sits up about an

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.109 
want to be foam tape sits up about an
eighth<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.070> an<00:00:23.189> inch<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:23.580> it's<00:00:23.730> hard<00:00:24.000> to

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
eighth of an inch so it's hard to

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.070 
eighth of an inch so it's hard to
determine<00:00:24.650> if<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:26.039> are<00:00:26.359> exactly<00:00:27.359> where<00:00:27.900> you

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
determine if you are exactly where you

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.420 
determine if you are exactly where you
want<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.380> be<00:00:28.500> when<00:00:28.970> you're<00:00:29.970> using<00:00:30.210> foam<00:00:30.630> tape

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
want to be when you're using foam tape

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.479 
want to be when you're using foam tape
this<00:00:32.430> stuff's<00:00:32.730> real<00:00:33.059> strong<00:00:34.280> don't<00:00:35.280> need<00:00:35.460> a

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
this stuff's real strong don't need a

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.250 
this stuff's real strong don't need a
whole<00:00:35.730> lot<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.600> I'm<00:00:36.690> just<00:00:36.840> going<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.050> put

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
whole lot of it so I'm just going to put

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:47.330 
whole lot of it so I'm just going to put
a<00:00:37.290> couple<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.620> strips<00:00:37.890> on<00:00:38.100> there

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.150 

idea<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.330> this<00:00:48.540> take<00:00:49.080> one<00:00:49.650> of<00:00:49.740> the<00:00:49.830> things<00:00:50.070> that

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
idea of this take one of the things that

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.270 
idea of this take one of the things that
does<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:50.760> really<00:00:51.120> good<00:00:51.330> for<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.010> process<00:00:53.010> is

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
does it's really good for the process is

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.000 
does it's really good for the process is
that<00:00:53.310> it<00:00:53.640> keeps<00:00:54.330> the<00:00:54.630> panel<00:00:55.110> from<00:00:55.320> deflecting

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
that it keeps the panel from deflecting

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.970 
that it keeps the panel from deflecting
keeps<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.059> from<00:00:57.180> vibrating<00:00:57.800> when<00:00:58.800> it's

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
keeps it from vibrating when it's

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.299 
keeps it from vibrating when it's
getting<00:00:59.250> machined<00:00:59.700> by<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.080> blade<00:01:01.080> and<00:01:01.380> it

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
getting machined by the blade and it

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.440 
getting machined by the blade and it
also<00:01:02.720> keeps<00:01:03.720> it<00:01:03.870> from<00:01:03.989> working<00:01:05.119> because<00:01:06.119> it

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
also keeps it from working because it

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.340 
also keeps it from working because it
gets<00:01:06.630> hot<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:08.340> also<00:01:08.520> under<00:01:08.970> force<00:01:09.840> side

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
gets hot and it's also under force side

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.170 
gets hot and it's also under force side
loads<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.920> stuff<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.490> could<00:01:11.700> make<00:01:11.970> it

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
loads and stuff and it could make it

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.930 
loads and stuff and it could make it
buckle<00:01:12.570> ripple<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.890> putting<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.550> little<00:01:14.729> bit<00:01:14.820> of

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
buckle ripple so putting a little bit of

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.750 
buckle ripple so putting a little bit of
tape<00:01:15.210> right<00:01:15.420> around<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.900> perimeter<00:01:16.050> of<00:01:16.770> what

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
tape right around the perimeter of what

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.999 
tape right around the perimeter of what
you<00:01:17.910> want<00:01:19.130> to<00:01:20.130> get<00:01:20.840> now<00:01:21.840> before<00:01:22.290> hand<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.800> laid

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
you want to get now before hand I laid

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.280 
you want to get now before hand I laid
out<00:01:23.220> markers<00:01:23.759> here<00:01:24.030> with<00:01:24.509> blue<00:01:24.720> tank<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.229> I

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
out markers here with blue tank so I

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.930 
out markers here with blue tank so I
know<00:01:25.380> exactly<00:01:25.560> what<00:01:26.070> my<00:01:26.190> panel<00:01:26.550> to<00:01:26.640> those<00:01:26.790> it

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
know exactly what my panel to those it

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.440 
know exactly what my panel to those it
goes<00:01:27.090> flush<00:01:27.420> against<00:01:27.840> here<00:01:29.270> but<00:01:30.270> there's

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
goes flush against here but there's

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.030 
goes flush against here but there's
always<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> chance<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.350> screw<00:01:31.710> up<00:01:31.740> when

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
always a chance you can screw up when

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.440 
always a chance you can screw up when
you're<00:01:32.160> setting<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.580> down<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:33.060> don't<00:01:33.180> freak

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
you're setting it down so don't freak

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.230 
you're setting it down so don't freak
out<00:01:33.660> you<00:01:33.899> can<00:01:34.080> just<00:01:34.290> pop<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.770> loose<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.280> give

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
out you can just pop it loose and give

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.830 
out you can just pop it loose and give
it<00:01:36.270> another<00:01:36.570> try<00:01:37.100> let's<00:01:38.100> take<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.550> up<00:01:38.880> got<00:01:39.810> a

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
it another try let's take this up got a

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.029 
it another try let's take this up got a
little<00:01:40.080> pink<00:01:40.640> player<00:01:42.410> stuff<00:01:43.410> on<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.680> that's

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
little pink player stuff on it that's

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.719 
little pink player stuff on it that's
really<00:01:44.700> fun<00:01:44.940> to<00:01:45.060> try<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.390> get<00:01:45.509> off<00:01:46.729> works

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
really fun to try and get off works

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.300 
really fun to try and get off works
great<00:01:47.970> also<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.110> use<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.440> to<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.770> melts<00:01:50.190> and

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
great also can use this to it melts and

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.040 
great also can use this to it melts and
windows<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.910> inside<00:01:51.330> two<00:01:51.509> panels<00:01:51.869> if<00:01:51.959> you

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
windows on the inside two panels if you

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.109 
windows on the inside two panels if you
don't<00:01:52.200> already<00:01:52.350> screws<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.369> really<00:01:53.910> really

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
don't already screws it's really really

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.109 
don't already screws it's really really
strong<00:01:57.229> it's<00:01:58.229> not<00:01:58.410> really<00:01:58.619> tape<00:01:59.459> that's<00:01:59.759> just

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
strong it's not really tape that's just

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.469 
strong it's not really tape that's just
pure<00:02:00.569> adhesive<00:02:02.090> basically<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> strip<00:02:03.450> of

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
pure adhesive basically a strip of

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.460 
pure adhesive basically a strip of
adhesive<00:02:04.789> okay<00:02:05.789> so<00:02:06.300> see<00:02:06.929> if<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.080> can<00:02:07.229> do<00:02:07.319> this

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
adhesive okay so see if I can do this

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.860 
adhesive okay so see if I can do this
without<00:02:07.619> totally<00:02:08.160> screwing<00:02:08.490> it<00:02:08.640> up<00:02:09.979> plan<00:02:11.870> he

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
without totally screwing it up plan he

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:31.869 
without totally screwing it up plan he
did<00:02:13.440> this<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.920> go<00:02:14.280> exactly<00:02:14.730> let's<00:02:15.569> go

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.190 

once<00:02:32.879> you're<00:02:33.030> happy<00:02:33.209> with<00:02:33.540> where<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:34.019> you

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
once you're happy with where it is you

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.619 
once you're happy with where it is you
just<00:02:35.750> press<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.780> down<00:02:39.379> and<00:02:40.379> now<00:02:40.890> you've<00:02:41.280> got<00:02:41.549> a

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
just press it down and now you've got a

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.860 
just press it down and now you've got a
panel<00:02:42.629> attached<00:02:43.049> to<00:02:43.349> your<00:02:44.060> board<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.450> you're

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
panel attached to your board and you're
