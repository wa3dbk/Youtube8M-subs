00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.249 

and<00:01:18.960> let's<00:01:19.140> go<00:01:19.259> ahead<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.530> save<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:21.259> we'll

and let's go ahead and save and we'll

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.429 
and let's go ahead and save and we'll
call<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.560> index<00:01:25.670> so<00:01:26.670> with<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> PHP<00:01:27.899> document

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
call this index so with a PHP document

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.630 
call this index so with a PHP document
it's<00:01:28.530> no<00:01:28.649> different<00:01:28.950> than<00:01:29.009> an<00:01:29.130> HTML<00:01:29.610> document

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
it's no different than an HTML document

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.520 
it's no different than an HTML document
except<00:01:30.420> for<00:01:30.539> the<00:01:30.600> fact<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.929> it's<00:01:31.049> got<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.229> PHP

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
except for the fact that it's got a PHP

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.999 
except for the fact that it's got a PHP
extension<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.439> allows<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.649> browser<00:01:34.799> to

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
extension and that allows the browser to

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.800 
extension and that allows the browser to
know<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:35.700> are<00:01:35.880> planning<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.299> use<00:01:36.569> some

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.950 
know that we are planning to use some
PHP<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:37.380> here<00:01:37.590> other<00:01:37.740> than<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.069> it's<00:01:38.960> pretty

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
PHP in here other than that it's pretty

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.270

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
the hostname and the database password

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.610 
the hostname and the database password
we'll<00:03:24.430> put<00:03:24.700> in<00:03:24.819> your<00:03:24.940> password<00:03:25.410> I'm<00:03:26.410> gonna

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
we'll put in your password I'm gonna

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.370 
we'll put in your password I'm gonna
keep<00:03:27.190> that<00:03:27.250> hidden<00:03:27.640> here<00:03:28.140> which<00:03:29.140> you<00:03:29.260> guys

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
keep that hidden here which you guys

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.979 
keep that hidden here which you guys
getting<00:03:30.040> into<00:03:30.190> my<00:03:30.310> database<00:03:30.489> and<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.780> host

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
getting into my database and the host

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:41.210 
getting into my database and the host
name<00:03:32.200> is<00:03:32.500> going<00:03:32.680> to<00:03:32.739> be<00:03:32.799> localhost

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.600 

and<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.880> database<00:03:43.300> name<00:03:43.540> in<00:03:43.780> this<00:03:43.930> case<00:03:44.140> is

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
and the database name in this case is

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.830 
and the database name in this case is
vid<00:03:45.610> basics<00:03:48.060> alright<00:03:49.060> so<00:03:49.270> now<00:03:49.390> we<00:03:49.450> have<00:03:49.540> these

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
vid basics alright so now we have these

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.830 
vid basics alright so now we have these
variables<00:03:50.530> define<00:03:50.920> and<00:03:51.570> we're<00:03:52.570> going<00:03:52.690> to<00:03:52.720> get

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
variables define and we're going to get

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.920 
variables define and we're going to get
into<00:03:53.020> if<00:03:53.710> you<00:03:53.860> know<00:03:54.040> if<00:03:54.130> you<00:03:54.190> don't<00:03:54.720> know<00:03:55.720> what

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
into if you know if you don't know what

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.620 
into if you know if you don't know what
we're<00:03:56.050> doing<00:03:56.200> here<00:03:56.560> we'll<00:03:57.390> probably<00:03:58.390> make

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
we're doing here we'll probably make

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.360 
we're doing here we'll probably make
some<00:03:58.810> tutorials<00:03:58.960> here<00:03:59.530> later<00:03:59.830> that<00:04:00.130> go

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
some tutorials here later that go

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.850 
some tutorials here later that go
through<00:04:00.550> the<00:04:00.670> very<00:04:00.970> basics<00:04:01.480> of<00:04:01.660> PHP<00:04:02.410> this

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
through the very basics of PHP this

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.800 
through the very basics of PHP this
tutorial<00:04:03.370> is<00:04:03.550> is<00:04:03.820> for<00:04:04.150> somebody<00:04:04.360> who<00:04:04.570> has<00:04:04.690> at

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
least a little bit of knowledge in PHP

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.290 
least a little bit of knowledge in PHP
the<00:04:09.220> next<00:04:09.430> thing<00:04:09.520> we're<00:04:09.640> going<00:04:09.730> to<00:04:09.820> do<00:04:10.000> is

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
the next thing we're going to do is

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.900 
the next thing we're going to do is
create<00:04:10.660> a<00:04:11.140> variable<00:04:11.740> that's<00:04:12.490> going<00:04:12.700> to<00:04:12.760> hold

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
create a variable that's going to hold

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.640 
create a variable that's going to hold
the<00:04:13.240> entire<00:04:13.870> connection<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:16.540> call<00:04:16.810> it<00:04:16.989> DBC

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
the entire connection and call it DBC

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.530 
the entire connection and call it DBC
for<00:04:17.950> database<00:04:18.340> connection<00:04:19.080> equals<00:04:20.850> and<00:04:21.850> I'm

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
for database connection equals and I'm

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.930 
for database connection equals and I'm
just<00:04:23.350> going<00:04:23.500> to<00:04:23.530> copy<00:04:23.770> paste<00:04:23.920> this<00:04:24.370> chunk<00:04:24.730> here

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
just going to copy paste this chunk here

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.980 
just going to copy paste this chunk here
so<00:04:25.090> I'm<00:04:25.180> going<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.360> type<00:04:25.510> it<00:04:25.630> out<00:04:29.700> and<00:04:30.990> what

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
so I'm going to type it out and what

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.320 
so I'm going to type it out and what
this<00:04:32.110> is<00:04:32.350> is<00:04:32.500> it's<00:04:32.650> going<00:04:32.770> to<00:04:32.830> call<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.520> MySQL

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
this is is it's going to call the MySQL

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.100 
this is is it's going to call the MySQL
I<00:04:34.480> underscore<00:04:35.440> connect<00:04:35.740> function<00:04:36.810> and<00:04:37.810> it's

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
I underscore connect function and it's

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.660 
I underscore connect function and it's
going<00:04:38.170> to<00:04:38.260> toss<00:04:38.500> in<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:39.040> four<00:04:39.430> parameters

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
going to toss in the four parameters

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.790 
going to toss in the four parameters
it's<00:04:40.150> looking<00:04:40.420> for<00:04:40.600> which<00:04:40.780> is<00:04:40.810> our<00:04:41.260> database

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
it's looking for which is our database

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.580 
it's looking for which is our database
host<00:04:42.220> user<00:04:43.050> password<00:04:44.050> and<00:04:44.970> database<00:04:45.970> name<00:04:46.180> and

host user password and database name and

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.220 
host user password and database name and
it's<00:04:47.590> saying<00:04:47.770> or<00:04:48.010> Die<00:04:48.330> and<00:04:49.330> this<00:04:49.450> is<00:04:49.570> if<00:04:49.690> in

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
it's saying or Die and this is if in

it's saying or Die and this is if in
case<00:04:50.710> anything<00:04:51.400> is<00:04:51.669> wrong<00:04:51.820> here<00:04:52.210> with<00:04:52.480> our

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
case anything is wrong here with our

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.210 
case anything is wrong here with our
connection<00:04:54.130> it's<00:04:54.820> going<00:04:54.970> to<00:04:55.110> output<00:04:56.220> this

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
connection it's going to output this

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.990 
connection it's going to output this
message<00:04:57.700> to<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.210> browser<00:04:59.730> along<00:05:00.730> with

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
message to the browser along with

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.420 
message to the browser along with
whatever<00:05:01.300> the<00:05:01.570> actual<00:05:01.870> MySQL<00:05:02.530> error<00:05:02.770> is<00:05:03.010> which

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
whatever the actual MySQL error is which

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.770 
whatever the actual MySQL error is which
is<00:05:03.580> what<00:05:03.730> this<00:05:03.850> function<00:05:04.090> does<00:05:04.300> here<00:05:06.540> go<00:05:07.540> ahead

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
is what this function does here go ahead

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:14.150 
is what this function does here go ahead
and<00:05:07.900> save<00:05:08.140> and<00:05:12.150> now<00:05:13.150> we<00:05:13.210> have<00:05:13.510> our<00:05:13.660> connection

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
and save and now we have our connection

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.250 
and save and now we have our connection
so<00:05:15.160> we<00:05:15.550> can<00:05:15.700> actually<00:05:15.910> start<00:05:16.360> pulling<00:05:17.010> results

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
so we can actually start pulling results

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.050 
so we can actually start pulling results
before<00:05:20.260> we<00:05:20.530> do<00:05:20.680> so<00:05:20.860> let's<00:05:21.280> go<00:05:21.460> ahead<00:05:21.760> and

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.190 

create<00:05:25.169> do<00:05:26.169> some<00:05:26.320> HTML<00:05:26.669> to<00:05:27.669> house<00:05:28.150> our<00:05:28.540> results

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
create do some HTML to house our results

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.120 
create do some HTML to house our results
in<00:05:29.380> a<00:05:30.660> digestible<00:05:31.660> format<00:05:32.140> so<00:05:32.830> we're<00:05:33.070> all

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
in a digestible format so we're all

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.960 
in a digestible format so we're all
we're<00:05:33.250> going<00:05:33.340> to<00:05:33.400> do<00:05:33.550> is<00:05:33.669> we're<00:05:33.790> going<00:05:33.820> to

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.590 
we're going to do is we're going to
create<00:05:34.150> a<00:05:34.210> table<00:05:34.419> that<00:05:35.050> lists<00:05:36.010> the<00:05:36.600> our

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
create a table that lists the our

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.590 
create a table that lists the our
different<00:05:38.190> authors<00:05:39.190> on<00:05:39.460> the<00:05:39.490> site<00:05:39.790> so<00:05:40.570> let's

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
different authors on the site so let's

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:46.790 
different authors on the site so let's
go<00:05:40.840> ahead<00:05:40.990> and<00:05:41.140> start<00:05:41.560> the<00:05:41.650> table

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.770 

and<00:05:47.800> we're<00:05:48.010> gonna<00:05:48.100> add<00:05:48.310> a<00:05:48.340> row<00:05:48.580> and<00:05:51.600> if<00:05:52.600> you

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
and we're gonna add a row and if you

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.290 
and we're gonna add a row and if you
don't<00:05:53.320> know<00:05:53.500> anything<00:05:53.800> about<00:05:54.040> what<00:05:54.940> I'm<00:05:55.030> doing

HTML tutorial on tags we're gonna create
a<00:06:02.520> table<00:06:03.520> column<00:06:04.060> here<00:06:04.360> and<00:06:05.370> let's<00:06:06.370> flip<00:06:06.610> over

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
a table column here and let's flip over

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.810 
a table column here and let's flip over
to<00:06:06.940> our<00:06:07.030> database<00:06:07.420> really<00:06:07.600> quick<00:06:08.190> we<00:06:09.190> have<00:06:09.340> one

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
to our database really quick we have one

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
to our database really quick we have one
two<00:06:10.090> three<00:06:10.120> four<00:06:10.510> five<00:06:11.050> six<00:06:11.320> seven<00:06:15.570> so<00:06:16.570> let's

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
two three four five six seven so let's

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:25.470 
two three four five six seven so let's
create<00:06:17.080> seven<00:06:17.530> columns<00:06:17.860> here<00:06:23.730> and<00:06:24.730> we're

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.480 
create seven columns here and we're

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:58.909 
create seven columns here and we're
gonna<00:06:25.540> title<00:06:26.200> these<00:06:26.320> columns<00:06:26.770> here

00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:03.210 

and<00:07:00.659> I<00:07:01.659> did<00:07:02.139> not<00:07:02.379> make<00:07:02.590> these<00:07:02.740> in<00:07:02.919> the<00:07:02.979> exact

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:03.220 
and I did not make these in the exact

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.469 
and I did not make these in the exact
same<00:07:03.400> order<00:07:03.610> that<00:07:03.759> we<00:07:03.970> put<00:07:04.150> them<00:07:04.300> in<00:07:04.419> the

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:04.479 
same order that we put them in the

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:09.659 
same order that we put them in the
database<00:07:04.659> and<00:07:05.370> that's<00:07:06.370> okay<00:07:08.250> and<00:07:09.250> you'll<00:07:09.490> see
