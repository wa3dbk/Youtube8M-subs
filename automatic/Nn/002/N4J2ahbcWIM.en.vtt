that's<00:02:02.450> it<00:02:02.600> this<00:02:02.750> is<00:02:02.810> gonna<00:02:03.080> be<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.290> base<00:02:03.470> of

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
that's it this is gonna be the base of

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.950 
that's it this is gonna be the base of
my<00:02:03.800> vanilla<00:02:03.979> ice<00:02:04.369> cream<00:02:04.640> I<00:02:04.850> just<00:02:05.060> need<00:02:05.570> to<00:02:05.810> let

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
it to cool down completely before we can

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.999 
it to cool down completely before we can
churn<00:02:08.360> it<00:02:08.509> in<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.810> ice<00:02:08.929> cream<00:02:09.140> machine<00:02:09.319> pour

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
churn it in the ice cream machine pour

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.979 
churn it in the ice cream machine pour
the<00:02:10.160> cooled<00:02:10.369> custard<00:02:10.940> into<00:02:11.180> your<00:02:11.510> ice<00:02:11.690> cream

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
the cooled custard into your ice cream

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.800 
the cooled custard into your ice cream
machine<00:02:12.380> I<00:02:14.050> should<00:02:15.050> take<00:02:15.230> 45<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:16.160> 50<00:02:16.550> minutes

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
machine I should take 45 to 50 minutes

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.270 
machine I should take 45 to 50 minutes
for<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.930> ice<00:02:18.050> cream<00:02:18.319> to<00:02:18.440> be<00:02:18.470> publicly<00:02:18.890> churn

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
for the ice cream to be publicly churn

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.120 
for the ice cream to be publicly churn
so<00:02:19.670> not<00:02:20.390> completely<00:02:20.540> sets<00:02:21.140> on<00:02:21.440> frozen<00:02:21.680> but<00:02:22.070> it

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
so not completely sets on frozen but it

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.009 
so not completely sets on frozen but it
would<00:02:22.220> be<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:22.550> know<00:02:22.580> creamy<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.269> thick<00:02:23.330> after

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
would be you know creamy and thick after

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.360 
would be you know creamy and thick after
that<00:02:24.320> we'll<00:02:24.530> have<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.739> move<00:02:24.830> it<00:02:24.980> back<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.160> the

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
that we'll have to move it back to the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.979 
that we'll have to move it back to the
freezer<00:02:25.670> to<00:02:26.000> set<00:02:26.209> from<00:02:26.420> Philly<00:02:31.540> try<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.600> resist
