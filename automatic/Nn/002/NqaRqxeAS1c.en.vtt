thank you for having interest in the

solution<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:16.320> your<00:00:16.410> burrowing<00:00:16.650> pest<00:00:17.010> problems

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
solution to your burrowing pest problems

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.849 
solution to your burrowing pest problems
essentially<00:00:18.750> what<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.050> road<00:00:19.199> meter<00:00:19.380> Pro<00:00:19.619> does

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
essentially what the road meter Pro does

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.550 
essentially what the road meter Pro does
is<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.789> takes<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.270> calibrated<00:00:21.990> mixture<00:00:22.320> of

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
is it takes a calibrated mixture of

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.920 
is it takes a calibrated mixture of
propane<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.130> oxygen<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:24.480> injects<00:00:24.810> it

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
propane and oxygen and it injects it

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.230 
propane and oxygen and it injects it
down<00:00:25.080> in<00:00:25.289> through<00:00:25.590> any<00:00:26.310> burrowing<00:00:26.789> animals

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
down in through any burrowing animals

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.599 
down in through any burrowing animals
tunnel<00:00:27.570> system<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.080> then<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.769> ignites<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.310> it

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
tunnel system and then it ignites it it

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.870 
tunnel system and then it ignites it it
creates<00:00:30.269> an<00:00:30.390> anonymous<00:00:30.929> underground

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
creates an anonymous underground

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.060 
creates an anonymous underground
concussive<00:00:32.880> force<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.770> expansion<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.860> gases

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
concussive force and expansion of gases

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.819 
concussive force and expansion of gases
that<00:00:35.489> instantly<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.210> humanely<00:00:36.829> eliminates

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
that instantly and humanely eliminates

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.380 
that instantly and humanely eliminates
any<00:00:38.010> burrowing<00:00:38.489> pests<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.940> may<00:00:39.030> experience

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
any burrowing pests you may experience

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.380 
any burrowing pests you may experience
oh<00:00:40.820> that<00:00:41.820> was<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> deep<00:00:42.210> one<00:00:42.920> that<00:00:43.920> was<00:00:44.010> nice

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
oh that was a deep one that was nice

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.240 
oh that was a deep one that was nice
that<00:00:45.390> enclosed<00:00:45.690> tunnel<00:00:46.020> system<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.890> holding

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
that enclosed tunnel system is holding

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.740 
that enclosed tunnel system is holding
the<00:00:47.309> gas<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.730> when<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.000> goes<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.390> doesn't<00:00:48.539> have

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
the gas and when it goes it doesn't have

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.630 
the gas and when it goes it doesn't have
an<00:00:48.899> open<00:00:49.289> hole<00:00:49.469> for<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.860> gas<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.190> fly<00:00:50.370> out<00:00:50.520> of

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
an open hole for the gas to fly out of

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.130 
an open hole for the gas to fly out of
so<00:00:50.760> it'll<00:00:50.910> naturally<00:00:51.030> lift<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.870> tunnel

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
so it'll naturally lift the tunnel

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.889 
so it'll naturally lift the tunnel
system<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.649> most<00:00:53.370> cases<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.030> then<00:00:54.510> collapse

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
system in most cases and then collapse

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.450 
system in most cases and then collapse
it<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.469> you're<00:00:55.710> getting<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.980> advantage<00:00:56.340> of

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
it so you're getting the advantage of

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.549 
it so you're getting the advantage of
one<00:00:56.699> terminating<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> animal<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.530> other

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
one terminating the animal and the other

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.170 
one terminating the animal and the other
is<00:00:58.890> you're<00:00:59.070> destroying<00:00:59.399> his<00:00:59.609> burrow<00:00:59.850> on

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
is you're destroying his burrow on

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.209 
is you're destroying his burrow on
enclosed<00:01:00.690> tunnel<00:01:01.020> systems<00:01:01.379> keeping<00:01:01.980> others

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
enclosed tunnel systems keeping others

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.380 
enclosed tunnel systems keeping others
from<00:01:02.370> moving<00:01:02.640> right<00:01:02.789> into<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.149> tunnel

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
from moving right into this tunnel

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.509 
from moving right into this tunnel
system<00:01:03.899> there's<00:01:04.470> absolutely<00:01:04.920> no<00:01:05.040> chemicals

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
the same thing from these farmers around

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.569 
the same thing from these farmers around
the<00:01:36.900> country<00:01:37.200> because<00:01:37.350> these<00:01:37.439> guys<00:01:37.680> their

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
the country because these guys their

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.280 
the country because these guys their
farm<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:38.970> their<00:01:39.090> life<00:01:39.299> it's<00:01:39.630> their<00:01:39.840> baby<00:01:39.990> and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
farm is their life it's their baby and

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.870 
farm is their life it's their baby and
they<00:01:40.350> put<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.740> much<00:01:40.860> effort<00:01:41.310> into<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.610> piece

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
they put so much effort into this piece

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.060 
they put so much effort into this piece
of<00:01:42.030> property<00:01:42.150> as<00:01:42.630> well<00:01:43.259> as<00:01:43.350> your<00:01:43.500> yard<00:01:43.799> and

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
of property as well as your yard and

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.550 
of property as well as your yard and
it's<00:01:45.060> their<00:01:45.240> love<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.780> then<00:01:46.229> you'll<00:01:46.409> get

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
it's their love and then you'll get

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.889 
it's their love and then you'll get
something<00:01:46.860> burrowing<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.670> there<00:01:47.880> eating<00:01:48.869> the
