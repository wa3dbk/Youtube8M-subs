00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
how you look in the game I like that the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
game is pretty cool and I think as far

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.890 
game is pretty cool and I think as far
as<00:00:20.460> my<00:00:20.609> minutes<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.300> game<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.510> think<00:00:21.689> it's

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
as my minutes in the game I think it's

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.750 
as my minutes in the game I think it's
pretty<00:00:22.109> spot-on<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:23.279> know<00:00:23.369> they<00:00:23.519> could<00:00:23.730> have

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
pretty spot-on you know they could have

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.150 
pretty spot-on you know they could have
they<00:00:24.330> could<00:00:24.359> have<00:00:24.660> made<00:00:25.529> me<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> little<00:00:25.949> a

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
they could have made me a little a

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.679 
they could have made me a little a
little<00:00:26.400> more<00:00:26.550> jacked<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.300> think<00:00:27.480> would<00:00:27.599> have

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
little more jacked I think would have

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.870 
little more jacked I think would have
been<00:00:27.810> more<00:00:28.019> realistic<00:00:28.650> if<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.920> my<00:00:29.460> muscles

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
been more realistic if I my muscles

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.130 
been more realistic if I my muscles
they're<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> little<00:00:30.300> smaller<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.960> game

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
they're a little smaller in the game

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.200 
they're a little smaller in the game
than<00:00:31.349> they<00:00:31.470> are<00:00:31.500> in<00:00:31.769> real<00:00:32.009> life<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:33.059> I'm<00:00:33.180> a

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
than they are in real life so I'm a

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.819 
than they are in real life so I'm a
little<00:00:33.420> upset<00:00:33.809> about<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.050> but<00:00:34.380> as<00:00:34.500> far<00:00:34.559> as

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829
