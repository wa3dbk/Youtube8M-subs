 users of that form in terms of notifications 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.430
 To speak together we will also could blog 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.960
 so write things like 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.399
 for example on the cancer stole as we 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.410
 write I write about gryce 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.579
 basically all aspects of fifa 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.469
 until it feels like something you don't know you can 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.329
 look it up for days so I'll link to it 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.219
 to the description it is free of 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.359
 next point en to the kite days in one 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.189
 you can just take a look 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.720
 take to what it looks like i am 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.310
 very happy with the design of the site 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.720
 looks really slick and over it 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.130
 I am generally very curious about what 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.689
 you will find it 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.040
 and finally if the video is still blue 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.689
 Thumbs up is that it is completely 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.340
 be fantastic if we can do it 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.290
 I want another content tomorrow 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.299
 delivery of course also me today 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.130
 somewhat earlier due to the Netherlands competition 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.810
 at 10 am because of course the Netherlands is 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.549
 against Costa Rica for the quarterfinals 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.259
 for the one who lived on their god and 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.579
 I still don't know a whole 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.960
 busy stock market was born 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.100
 only I hope that at the same time 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.140
 none went through the competition previous 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.180
 winter beach croma you are out of chances 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.799
 that costa rica is breaking out next time 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.570
 and I will park them on the bus for a while 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.340
 and what a very annoying match 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.869
 but as the Netherlands actually already in the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.430
 scored once in the first minute 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.079
 in my opinion a very interesting one 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.549
 contest and I am very curious about it 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.170
 but of course it will follow 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.000
 be another fun game 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.829
 argentina against belgium there i walk 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.540
 of course that all that you will win 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.430
 because I don't really like argentina 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.960
 play convincingly because you need a whole 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.210
 often they actually need their support 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.979
 from messi and found that maria for the rest 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.390
 I don't play the team too consistently 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.610
 but we'll just see it for it 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.320
 band lace I would like to roll and if 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.759
 watch this video after six hours between 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.060
 I could have some my piece to it 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.129
 say 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.720
 haha just who tom is on result I am 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.310
 look into the future 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.990
 and yes to that and looks at nothing to say 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.970
 so you are really the future viewers 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.170
 I keep going and then come to astro 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.910
 TV can work 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.740
 with this random passage 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.520
 So we went this first game 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.530
 still won 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.240
 he went falling and downloading and wanting 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.280
 I actually imperfect you for the film 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.600
 because no i big margins win that 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.250
 I have so I try this one 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.170
 opponent who has a very good team 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.060
 it also has the team precise but this 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.620
 is actually the best on a day goal 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.510
 first he goes from Jan snap and then draws 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.800
 goes from meaning to jansen again 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.720
 Jansen finally has one 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.370
 license plate and that makes him a finish 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.900
 very fast passage of all fast 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.580
 passes which ultimately leads to 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.830
 a goal and I like the best goals 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.450
 does not give me a long shot or other skill 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.270
 goals I think I filled it as normal 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.340
 very large sequence of basis gives as 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.840
 when I give him my opinion and therefore best 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.550
 maybe mine differs from that 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.110
 that of some others because I watched 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.580
 in the past always a lot of cabbage assembly 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.680
 with now side that actually look more 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.510
 but to score all the three zero and under 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.310
 I am a joint van in the first 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.750
 minutes and not leave come here again 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.580
 free with in a goal and and shoot 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.680
 already know four zero in it she really wants to live 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.450
 rampage who no one came to hand 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.070
 but I look back without singles 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.050
 the end of the first half he gets 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.550
 another goal here with brunni who shoots 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.290
 him very nicely beyond the goalkeeper because of me 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.090
 so only to be returned 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.980
 here i am a fantastic doctor with 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.570
 mean against and probably not what 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.560
 you can come to us and shoot 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.060
 into a pond 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.010
 towards the end of the 2nd half 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.209
 so just not a lot happened in it 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.190
 that in the meantime to the score 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.989
 I finally like it and 6 a to the pie 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.760
 stood cheated and he had to be a Turkish 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.620
 colt score to be 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.000
 increase the number of goals and that 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.680
 happens eventually stop wisdom 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.570
 with a 6 inside because a great one 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.519
 result is this i eat on then in the 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.320
 previous game moda went in mornings and 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.180
 all never because this was just a great one 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.650
 profit and colon cancer say nothing about it and 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.690
 that also means having to come inside 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.040
 and then we have the title as the title 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.630
 I have him buy some players again 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.910
 because have no purchases yet 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.410
 act the beginning of this episode 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.000
 have beans shortly before the rest 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.230
 we bought still own nothing and 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.430
 must of course change and that goes 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.680
 appears this is delivery happening 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.720
 but one this match completely on this 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.130
 toes 442 premier league team nobody 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.950
 pretty good that you help of course 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.299
 louis suarez i have a rattata and that can 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.310
 very good dribbling and there I had 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.720
 often bother when I defend because I 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.250
 think it did defend vincent 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.959
 against players who have high doubling 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.580
 that's why I personally never mind 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.030
 if ticket is a take-off, that's how it should be 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.470
 which really turn to drug me where you pop 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.030
 it but if you really have one that is small 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.130
 playfully, I personally have a lot there 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.660
 more effort to stand we do have 2 0 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.760
 and you come in more role as well as one 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.040
 free and dico really fantastic casting 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.960
 not hot so he is the three emergency brake and 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.550
 then I give my opponents that I 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.150
 it actually this wisdom with 3 0 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.470
 min 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.419
 that is also the end of this episode 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.860
 coach liked him that way I have 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.810
 also always a like leave 8 not 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.860
 hey, because it wasn't huge on a helmet 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.690
 go whenever possible of course 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.730
 hatching path follows nothing in winter 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.320
 ashamed of it is from hoaxes and 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.320
 until before the video is later
