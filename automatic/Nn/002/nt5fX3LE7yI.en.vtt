00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:19.030
 [music] 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:31.090
 [music] 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.360
 [music] 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.940
 I 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.000
 brevity 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.130
 obvious question 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.560
 the clouds 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.560
 what 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.500
 as 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.280
 . 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.030
 five 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.980
 sofas 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.190
 model 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.430
 I 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.810
 and 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.350
 So what 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.360
 panda 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.099
 speak 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.910
 may be 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.080
 10 meters 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.170
 custom 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:38.209
 So 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:35.330
 cube then this is not the exit
