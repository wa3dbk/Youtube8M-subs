00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.270 

I<00:00:00.089> happen<00:00:00.570> to<00:00:00.599> have<00:00:00.719> this<00:00:01.050> older<00:00:01.439> Panasonic

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
I happen to have this older Panasonic

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.300 
I happen to have this older Panasonic
standard<00:00:02.820> definition<00:00:03.419> camcorder<00:00:03.980> which<00:00:04.980> came

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
standard definition camcorder which came

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.220 
standard definition camcorder which came
with<00:00:05.339> a<00:00:05.640> high-capacity<00:00:06.089> battery<00:00:06.990> that<00:00:07.200> I

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
with a high-capacity battery that I

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.860 
with a high-capacity battery that I
wanted<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.740> use<00:00:07.980> with<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.550> v1<00:00:08.940> 10<00:00:09.240> because<00:00:09.750> the

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
wanted to use with the v1 10 because the

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.509 
wanted to use with the v1 10 because the
one<00:00:10.019> that<00:00:10.170> this<00:00:10.500> one<00:00:10.710> comes<00:00:10.920> with<00:00:11.010> is<00:00:11.280> pretty

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
one that this one comes with is pretty

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.910 
one that this one comes with is pretty
much<00:00:11.759> useless<00:00:12.179> barely<00:00:12.900> even<00:00:13.049> lasts<00:00:13.530> half<00:00:13.769> an

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
much useless barely even lasts half an

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.310 
much useless barely even lasts half an
hour<00:00:14.210> and<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.269> discovered<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:15.839> while<00:00:16.139> the

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
hour and I discovered that while the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.349 
hour and I discovered that while the
small<00:00:16.650> one<00:00:16.859> fits<00:00:17.190> fine<00:00:17.520> on<00:00:17.850> this<00:00:18.029> camcorder

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
small one fits fine on this camcorder

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.810 
small one fits fine on this camcorder
the<00:00:18.810> high-capacity<00:00:19.410> battery<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:20.640> one

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
the high-capacity battery that this one

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.090 
the high-capacity battery that this one
came<00:00:21.090> with<00:00:21.289> even<00:00:22.289> though<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.500> has<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.890> same

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
came with even though it has the same

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.920 
came with even though it has the same
pin<00:00:23.400> out<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.820> voltages<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.480> everything

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
pin out and voltages and everything

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.470 
pin out and voltages and everything
would<00:00:25.560> not<00:00:25.800> fit<00:00:26.160> on<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.580> camcorder<00:00:26.849> and

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
would not fit on this camcorder and

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.050 
would not fit on this camcorder and
there's<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.260> reason<00:00:28.650> for<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:29.029> it's<00:00:30.029> because

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
there's a reason for that it's because

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.939 
there's a reason for that it's because
there<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.630> tab<00:00:31.080> in<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.439> middle<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.859> the

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
there is this tab in the middle of the

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.830 
there is this tab in the middle of the
right<00:00:32.130> side<00:00:32.430> as<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.880> have<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.210> label<00:00:33.660> facing

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
right side as you have this label facing

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.459 
right side as you have this label facing
up<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.530> see<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.579> low<00:00:35.940> capacity<00:00:36.540> one<00:00:37.050> does<00:00:37.320> not

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
up I see this low capacity one does not

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.130 
up I see this low capacity one does not
have<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> tab<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.309> middle<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.870> can<00:00:39.899> see

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
have a tab in the middle and you can see

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.920 
have a tab in the middle and you can see
this<00:00:40.320> one<00:00:40.530> had<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> tab<00:00:41.100> until<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.850> broke<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.780> off

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
this one had a tab until I broke it off

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.400 
this one had a tab until I broke it off
and<00:00:43.260> then<00:00:43.350> filed<00:00:43.710> down<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.280> edge<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:45.410> that's

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
and then filed down the edge and that's

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.110 
and then filed down the edge and that's
the<00:00:46.649> trick<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.010> can<00:00:47.129> do<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.550> get<00:00:47.730> one<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.030> these

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
the trick you can do to get one of these

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.389 
the trick you can do to get one of these
high-capacity<00:00:48.570> batteries<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.559> work<00:00:49.800> with<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
high-capacity batteries to work with the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.420 
high-capacity batteries to work with the
v1<00:00:50.760> 10<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.539> instead<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.079> needing<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.559> buy<00:00:52.920> one

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
v1 10 so instead of needing to buy one

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.790 
v1 10 so instead of needing to buy one
of<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.640> new<00:00:53.820> model<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.629> Panasonic<00:00:55.379> batteries

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
of the new model of Panasonic batteries

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.310 
of the new model of Panasonic batteries
in<00:00:56.070> case<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.399> have<00:00:56.520> an<00:00:56.610> older<00:00:56.969> camcorder<00:00:57.629> with

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
in case you have an older camcorder with

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.189 
in case you have an older camcorder with
a<00:00:58.440> battery<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.890> should<00:00:59.399> be<00:00:59.550> compatible<00:01:00.199> all

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
a battery that should be compatible all

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.799 
a battery that should be compatible all
you<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.559> do<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.829> break<00:01:02.010> off<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.460> tab

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
you have to do is break off that tab

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:10.310 
you have to do is break off that tab
this<00:01:03.809> happens<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.470> be<00:01:04.909> VW<00:01:05.960> v<00:01:06.960> BK<00:01:07.850> 180<00:01:09.170> graded<00:01:10.170> at

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
this happens to be VW v BK 180 graded at

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.850 
this happens to be VW v BK 180 graded at
three<00:01:11.130> point<00:01:11.340> six<00:01:11.520> volts<00:01:11.939> 1790<00:01:12.860> milliamp

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
three point six volts 1790 milliamp

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.609 
three point six volts 1790 milliamp
hours<00:01:14.330> well<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.479> one<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.170> one<00:01:16.380> came

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
hours well the one that this one came

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.719 
hours well the one that this one came
with<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:17.479> only<00:01:18.740> 970<00:01:19.740> million<00:01:19.950> powers<00:01:20.520> so

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
with is only 970 million powers so

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.149 
with is only 970 million powers so
pretty<00:01:21.270> much<00:01:21.420> double<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> capacity<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:23.040> it

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
pretty much double the capacity so it

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.969 
pretty much double the capacity so it
should<00:01:23.340> last<00:01:23.520> about<00:01:23.729> twice<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.330> long<00:01:24.979> so

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
should last about twice as long so

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.800 
should last about twice as long so
that's<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.490> trick<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.820> can<00:01:26.970> do<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.360> use<00:01:27.570> one

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
that's the trick you can do to use one

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.560 
that's the trick you can do to use one
of<00:01:27.840> these<00:01:27.990> batteries<00:01:28.530> with<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.130> camcorder

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
of these batteries with this camcorder

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.660 
of these batteries with this camcorder
so<00:01:30.570> now<00:01:30.720> if<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.079> tab<00:01:31.380> broken<00:01:31.829> off<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.520> a

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
so now if that tab broken off it's a

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.700 
so now if that tab broken off it's a
little<00:01:32.939> bit<00:01:33.090> rough<00:01:33.509> going<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.110> because<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
little bit rough going on because of the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.969 
little bit rough going on because of the
residue<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.729> tab<00:01:36.090> but<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.229> little<00:01:37.619> bit<00:01:37.860> of

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
residue of that tab but a little bit of

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.980 
residue of that tab but a little bit of
extra<00:01:38.220> force<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.909> can<00:01:39.060> get<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.420> fit<00:01:39.659> right<00:01:39.869> on

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
extra force you can get to fit right on

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.819 
extra force you can get to fit right on
there<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:41.270> there<00:01:42.270> goes<00:01:42.509> it's<00:01:42.750> clicked<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.290> we

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
there and there goes it's clicked in we

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.760 
there and there goes it's clicked in we
hit<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.070> power<00:01:44.280> button<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:46.320> camcorder

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
hit the power button and the camcorder

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.030 
hit the power button and the camcorder
powers<00:01:47.189> up<00:01:47.540> it's<00:01:48.540> also<00:01:48.780> useful<00:01:49.290> keeping<00:01:49.890> one

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
powers up it's also useful keeping one

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.710 
powers up it's also useful keeping one
of<00:01:50.130> these<00:01:50.250> older<00:01:50.610> models<00:01:50.759> on<00:01:51.060> hand<00:01:51.420> because

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
of these older models on hand because

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.710 
of these older models on hand because
they<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.320> DC<00:01:52.799> 5<00:01:53.100> volt<00:01:53.369> input<00:01:53.850> for

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
they have the DC 5 volt input for

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.139 
they have the DC 5 volt input for
charging<00:01:55.369> whereas<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:56.790> can<00:01:57.000> only

charging whereas this one can only

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.350 
charging whereas this one can only
charge<00:01:57.509> through<00:01:58.020> USB<00:01:58.909> because<00:01:59.909> there<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.180> no

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
charge through USB because there is no

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.020 
charge through USB because there is no
DC<00:02:00.840> input<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.619> which<00:02:01.920> unfortunately<00:02:02.759> also

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
DC input on it which unfortunately also

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.050 
DC input on it which unfortunately also
means<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.659> cannot<00:02:03.899> run<00:02:04.259> on<00:02:04.530> AC<00:02:05.280> power<00:02:05.490> when

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
means it cannot run on AC power when

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.800 
means it cannot run on AC power when
it's<00:02:06.210> recording<00:02:07.250> because<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.429> USB<00:02:08.910> will<00:02:09.479> only

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
it's recording because the USB will only

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.280 
it's recording because the USB will only
charge<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.470> battery<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:11.069> will<00:02:11.280> not<00:02:11.489> power<00:02:11.790> the

charge the battery it will not power the
a<00:02:12.319> quarter<00:02:12.739> so<00:02:13.640> you're<00:02:13.849> limited<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.629> battery

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
a quarter so you're limited to battery

a quarter so you're limited to battery
life<00:02:15.260> when<00:02:15.890> using<00:02:16.129> this<00:02:16.400> camcorder<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:18.200> if<00:02:18.319> you

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:18.439 
life when using this camcorder so if you

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.770 
life when using this camcorder so if you
want<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.680> record<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.189> long<00:02:19.400> video<00:02:19.670> you<00:02:20.269> have<00:02:20.750> to

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
want to record a long video you have to

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.959 
want to record a long video you have to
stop<00:02:21.260> recording<00:02:21.500> when<00:02:22.099> the<00:02:22.189> battery<00:02:22.519> runs<00:02:22.549> out

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:22.969 
stop recording when the battery runs out

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:25.000 
stop recording when the battery runs out
and<00:02:23.209> then<00:02:23.689> either<00:02:23.930> wait<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.469> recharge<00:02:24.859> the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
and then either wait to recharge the

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.589 
and then either wait to recharge the
battery<00:02:25.430> or<00:02:25.609> if<00:02:25.640> you<00:02:26.090> happen<00:02:26.359> to<00:02:26.390> have<00:02:26.569> another

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
battery or if you happen to have another

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.770 
battery or if you happen to have another
battery<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.260> can<00:02:27.439> swap<00:02:27.709> it<00:02:27.790> but<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:29.390> really

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
battery you can swap it but that really

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.750 
battery you can swap it but that really
limits<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.319> ability<00:02:30.530> of<00:02:30.980> one<00:02:31.189> of<00:02:31.310> these<00:02:31.430> to

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
limits the ability of one of these to

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.270 
limits the ability of one of these to
record<00:02:32.150> long<00:02:32.420> videos<00:02:32.870> well<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:33.739> turns<00:02:33.980> out<00:02:34.099> the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
record long videos well it turns out the

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.280 
record long videos well it turns out the
same<00:02:34.489> thing<00:02:34.519> applies<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.390> low<00:02:35.659> capacity

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
same thing applies to the low capacity

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.589 
same thing applies to the low capacity
batteries<00:02:36.739> as<00:02:36.980> well<00:02:37.060> because<00:02:38.060> I<00:02:38.180> just<00:02:38.209> got

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
batteries as well because I just got

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.300 
batteries as well because I just got
this<00:02:38.840> Panasonic<00:02:39.650> HC<00:02:40.370> v10<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.420> HC<00:02:42.170> v10<00:02:42.799> will<00:02:43.129> be

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
this Panasonic HC v10 the HC v10 will be

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.270 
this Panasonic HC v10 the HC v10 will be
the<00:02:43.459> subject<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:44.060> a<00:02:44.209> future<00:02:44.620> review<00:02:45.620> video<00:02:45.980> but

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
the subject of a future review video but

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.920 
the subject of a future review video but
in<00:02:46.370> case<00:02:46.579> you're<00:02:46.760> wondering<00:02:47.000> why<00:02:47.359> I<00:02:47.389> got<00:02:47.720> it

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
in case you're wondering why I got it

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.259 
in case you're wondering why I got it
when<00:02:48.200> I<00:02:48.230> already<00:02:48.409> have<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:49.129> technically<00:02:49.909> much

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
when I already have a technically much

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.140 
when I already have a technically much
better<00:02:50.599> camcorder<00:02:51.409> the<00:02:51.620> reason<00:02:52.519> is<00:02:52.639> because

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
better camcorder the reason is because

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.800 
better camcorder the reason is because
this<00:02:53.510> is<00:02:53.689> a<00:02:53.720> 720p<00:02:54.549> camcorder<00:02:55.549> which<00:02:56.359> is<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.569> much

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
this is a 720p camcorder which is a much

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.349 
this is a 720p camcorder which is a much
easier<00:02:56.989> format<00:02:57.919> for<00:02:58.189> me<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.489> edit<00:02:58.879> then<00:02:59.209> the

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
easier format for me to edit then the

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.379 
easier format for me to edit then the
1080i<00:02:59.930> interlaced<00:03:00.829> video<00:03:01.040> which<00:03:01.489> the<00:03:01.730> v1<00:03:02.150> 10

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:02.389 
1080i interlaced video which the v1 10

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.409 
1080i interlaced video which the v1 10
records<00:03:02.989> and<00:03:03.470> also<00:03:04.010> this<00:03:04.220> one<00:03:04.459> has<00:03:04.489> optical

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:05.419 
records and also this one has optical

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:06.759 
records and also this one has optical
image<00:03:05.810> stabilization

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
image stabilization

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.339 
image stabilization
while<00:03:07.069> the<00:03:07.280> v1<00:03:07.609> 10<00:03:07.849> only<00:03:08.180> has<00:03:08.359> electronic

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
while the v1 10 only has electronic

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.559 
while the v1 10 only has electronic
image<00:03:09.829> stabilization<00:03:10.370> which<00:03:10.909> does<00:03:11.180> not<00:03:11.359> work

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
image stabilization which does not work

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.710 
image stabilization which does not work
very<00:03:11.870> well<00:03:11.959> it's<00:03:12.709> a<00:03:12.829> 2012<00:03:13.340> model<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:14.120> came

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
very well it's a 2012 model and came

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.809 
very well it's a 2012 model and came
with<00:03:14.900> this<00:03:15.019> little<00:03:15.349> battery<00:03:15.709> which<00:03:16.040> is<00:03:16.069> the

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
with this little battery which is the

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.719 
with this little battery which is the
same<00:03:17.060> voltage<00:03:17.329> in<00:03:17.810> size<00:03:18.079> as<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:19.250> one<00:03:19.280> that<00:03:19.430> the

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:19.729 
same voltage in size as the one that the

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:23.020 
same voltage in size as the one that the
v1<00:03:20.060> 10<00:03:20.329> came<00:03:20.629> with<00:03:20.870> but<00:03:21.620> if<00:03:21.680> you<00:03:21.769> look<00:03:21.949> at<00:03:22.159> it<00:03:22.340> it

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
v1 10 came with but if you look at it it

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.869 
v1 10 came with but if you look at it it
has<00:03:23.239> an<00:03:23.479> extra<00:03:23.900> tab<00:03:24.169> in<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:24.769> middle<00:03:25.069> just<00:03:25.729> like

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
has an extra tab in the middle just like

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.629 
has an extra tab in the middle just like
the<00:03:26.000> high-capacity<00:03:26.510> one<00:03:27.199> did<00:03:27.500> so<00:03:27.530> Nora<00:03:28.310> to<00:03:28.489> get

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
the high-capacity one did so Nora to get

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.300 
the high-capacity one did so Nora to get
this<00:03:28.790> one<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:29.030> work<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.629> V<00:03:30.379> 110<00:03:30.829> I<00:03:30.859> would<00:03:31.159> also

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
this one to work and V 110 I would also

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.330 
this one to work and V 110 I would also
need<00:03:31.609> to<00:03:31.790> break<00:03:32.540> off<00:03:32.720> this<00:03:32.930> tab<00:03:33.260> on<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:34.159> right

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
need to break off this tab on the right

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.509 
need to break off this tab on the right
so<00:03:35.060> it<00:03:35.359> was<00:03:35.510> quite<00:03:36.229> clearly<00:03:36.859> a<00:03:36.889> deliberate

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
so it was quite clearly a deliberate

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.399 
so it was quite clearly a deliberate
change<00:03:37.909> in<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.239> batteries<00:03:38.690> to<00:03:38.959> force<00:03:39.229> you<00:03:39.379> to

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
change in the batteries to force you to

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.520 
change in the batteries to force you to
buy<00:03:39.680> new<00:03:40.010> batteries<00:03:40.599> with<00:03:41.599> the<00:03:41.629> new<00:03:42.019> model<00:03:42.349> of

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
buy new batteries with the new model of

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.550 
buy new batteries with the new model of
camcorder<00:03:43.310> and<00:03:43.569> the<00:03:44.569> printer<00:03:44.900> companies<00:03:45.349> do

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
camcorder and the printer companies do

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.500 
camcorder and the printer companies do
the<00:03:45.650> same<00:03:45.889> exact<00:03:46.250> thing<00:03:46.340> like<00:03:46.819> Hewlett

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
the same exact thing like Hewlett

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.719 
the same exact thing like Hewlett
Packard<00:03:47.959> with<00:03:48.349> every<00:03:48.709> new<00:03:48.859> model<00:03:49.280> they<00:03:49.519> make<00:03:49.549> a

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:49.729 
Packard with every new model they make a

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:52.629 
Packard with every new model they make a
trivial<00:03:50.389> change<00:03:50.840> in<00:03:51.079> the<00:03:51.169> toner<00:03:51.639> cartridges

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
trivial change in the toner cartridges

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.179 
trivial change in the toner cartridges
to<00:03:52.940> force<00:03:53.269> you<00:03:53.449> to<00:03:53.479> buy<00:03:53.750> new<00:03:54.049> ones<00:03:54.260> because

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:55.189 
to force you to buy new ones because

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.969 
to force you to buy new ones because
they<00:03:55.459> either<00:03:56.090> add<00:03:56.419> a<00:03:56.449> tab<00:03:56.930> or<00:03:57.229> remove<00:03:57.590> a<00:03:57.739> tab

00:03:57.969 --> 00:03:57.979 
they either add a tab or remove a tab

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:00.729 
they either add a tab or remove a tab
which<00:03:58.400> makes<00:03:58.699> the<00:03:58.879> older<00:03:59.209> ones<00:03:59.739> unusable

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
which makes the older ones unusable

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.719 
which makes the older ones unusable
unless<00:04:01.010> you<00:04:01.189> modify<00:04:01.699> them<00:04:02.019> so<00:04:03.019> a<00:04:03.699> lot<00:04:04.699> of

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:04.729 
unless you modify them so a lot of

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:07.689 
unless you modify them so a lot of
companies<00:04:05.000> are<00:04:05.389> doing<00:04:05.510> this<00:04:05.810> and<00:04:06.699> thankfully

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:07.699 
companies are doing this and thankfully

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:09.819 
companies are doing this and thankfully
in<00:04:08.060> this<00:04:08.419> case<00:04:08.689> is<00:04:08.930> pretty<00:04:09.169> easy<00:04:09.379> you<00:04:09.590> just

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
in this case is pretty easy you just

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.589 
in this case is pretty easy you just
break<00:04:10.009> off<00:04:10.220> this<00:04:10.430> tab<00:04:10.699> and<00:04:11.060> then<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.299> battery

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
break off this tab and then the battery

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.960 
break off this tab and then the battery
will<00:04:11.870> work<00:04:12.019> fine<00:04:12.349> and<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:13.280> same<00:04:13.519> thing<00:04:13.790> is

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
will work fine and the same thing is

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.270 
will work fine and the same thing is
true<00:04:14.239> of<00:04:14.329> aftermarket<00:04:14.870> batteries<00:04:15.680> the<00:04:15.919> only
