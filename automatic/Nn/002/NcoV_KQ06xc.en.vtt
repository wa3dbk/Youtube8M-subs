the<00:02:32.840> launcher<00:02:33.230> doesn't<00:02:33.530> work<00:02:33.739> properly<00:02:34.690> let's

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
the launcher doesn't work properly let's

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:49.210 
the launcher doesn't work properly let's
try<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:35.989> see

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.270 

well<00:02:49.850> TW<00:02:50.600> launch<00:02:50.780> of<00:02:50.990> work<00:02:51.140> so<00:02:51.530> i<00:02:51.740> guess<00:02:52.130> i'll

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
well TW launch of work so i guess i'll

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.080 
well TW launch of work so i guess i'll
just<00:02:52.310> stick<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.760> that<00:02:52.880> at<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.120> moment

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
just stick to that at the moment
