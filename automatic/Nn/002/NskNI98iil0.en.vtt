00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:20.329 
huge time waster for them and so one

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:22.690 
huge time waster for them and so one
person<00:01:20.509> in<00:01:21.109> the<00:01:21.289> office<00:01:21.409> sends<00:01:22.009> the<00:01:22.130> game<00:01:22.310> to

his spring program isn't hungry and by

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.139 
his spring program isn't hungry and by

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
happenstance of person from England came

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.899 
happenstance of person from England came
saw<00:01:29.599> the<00:01:29.659> game<00:01:29.959> inside<00:01:30.920> we<00:01:31.340> need<00:01:31.459> to<00:01:31.579> happen

00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:35.029 
and so thus begins the long difficult

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:37.449 
and so thus begins the long difficult
process<00:01:35.329> of<00:01:35.990> negotiating<00:01:36.829> the<00:01:37.009> rights<00:01:37.249> to

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:37.459 
process of negotiating the rights to

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:39.839 
process of negotiating the rights to
sell<00:01:38.029> the<00:01:38.179> game<00:01:38.359> outside<00:01:38.659> Soviet<00:01:39.380> Union<00:01:39.619> and

00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:39.849 
sell the game outside Soviet Union and

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:43.449 
sell the game outside Soviet Union and
this<00:01:40.849> was<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.240> first<00:01:41.529> software<00:01:42.529> electronic

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
this was the first software electronic

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:45.249 
this was the first software electronic
software<00:01:43.819> can<00:01:43.939> be<00:01:43.969> exported<00:01:44.270> from<00:01:44.569> the<00:01:44.749> USSR

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
software can be exported from the USSR

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.969 
software can be exported from the USSR
so<00:01:45.529> is<00:01:45.679> all<00:01:46.399> new<00:01:47.209> territory<00:01:47.419> for<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:48.049> USSR<00:01:48.649> and

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
so is all new territory for the USSR and

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.909 
so is all new territory for the USSR and
so<00:01:49.669> people<00:01:50.659> didn't<00:01:51.049> know<00:01:51.079> who<00:01:51.469> they<00:01:51.679> had<00:01:51.829> to

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:51.919 
so people didn't know who they had to

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:53.889 
so people didn't know who they had to
negotiate<00:01:52.039> when<00:01:52.609> they<00:01:52.909> who<00:01:53.299> had<00:01:53.479> she<00:01:53.719> had

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
negotiate when they who had she had

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.589 
negotiate when they who had she had
right<00:01:54.399> eventually<00:01:55.399> one<00:01:56.119> person<00:01:56.450> got<00:01:56.539> the

00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:56.599 
right eventually one person got the

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:58.859 
right eventually one person got the
licensing<00:01:57.139> rights<00:01:57.289> to<00:01:57.739> the<00:01:57.950> game<00:01:58.609> boy<00:01:58.789> version

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
Russia look how unique it is but the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.250 
Russia look how unique it is but the
thing<00:02:59.700> is<00:02:59.880> you<00:03:00.209> could<00:03:00.360> package<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:01.080> a

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
thing is you could package it a

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.290 
thing is you could package it a
different<00:03:01.920> way<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.459> nobody<00:03:02.970> would<00:03:03.120> know<00:03:03.150> the

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
different way and nobody would know the

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.660 
different way and nobody would know the
difference<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:04.110> but<00:03:04.800> they<00:03:05.010> really<00:03:05.250> want<00:03:05.550> to

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
difference and but they really want to

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.690 
difference and but they really want to
latch<00:03:06.000> onto<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.510> Soviets<00:03:07.010> skory<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.520> this

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
latch onto the Soviets skory and this

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.449 
latch onto the Soviets skory and this
was<00:03:08.880> a<00:03:08.910> time<00:03:09.209> when<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.810> Cold<00:03:10.020> War<00:03:10.260> was<00:03:10.860> not
