00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.240
 and I wanted to tell you right now 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.100
 happened to upload this video because 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.829
 researched lately regarding the 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.049
 the hardest tongue twisters in the world and 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:14.449
 personally, it occurred to me 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.339
 to mention some like these the one that well 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.949
 more complex according to what I had on the internet 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:21.769
 he was the otorhinolaryngologist 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.349
 Parangaricutiro but esteban and other more or 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.419
 less the otorhinolaryngologist 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.759
 parangaricutiro is wanted from its author and 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.259
 I do not have it to equalize and equalize 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.699
 that of soto realm of link or to 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.129
 cheat and to discuss an equalizer 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.230
 that achieves're otolaryngologist 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.340
 discuss and visualize it will be a good 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.520
 soto rhythm link or parangaricutiro 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.530
 equalizer and other tongue twister plus or 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.620
 least as you wish, it is that of 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.539
 Archbishop of Constantinople says the 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.210
 Archbishop of Constantinople is even 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.550
 archbishop constantino polarize and whoever 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.859
 it is and that of bishop constantino sars 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.019
 settler who can leave his bishop with 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:59.370
 santi will not polarize what will be a good leave 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.860
 his constantine polarizing bishop 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.470
 but then I was thinking how to make a 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.950
 tongue twister harder to the other mind 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.650
 the challenge and I said oh well you can be 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.310
 can join because not among those are I 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.110
 it happens this would say something like that more or less 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.460
 the archbishop of Constantinople was with 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.229
 the otorhinolaryngologist 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.780
 parangaricutiro and my choir because he wants 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.580
 leave your constantino bishop 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.770
 otorhinolaryngologist discriminate and se 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.000
 that one des archbishop constantino nephew 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.860
 I come for it in glory cutrÃ­n 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.020
 equalizer that he achieves from is archbishop 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.000
 constantin otolaryngologist discuss 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.039
 my hoist what will be a good sars 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.710
 bishop constantin otolaryngologist 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.170
 discuss and my which hoisted and then I 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.080
 I was thinking that it's easy to also 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.810
 you count more or less good and I said 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.780
 otherwise you can increase more 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.950
 difficulty and then you can add the 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.050
 words that we like one can 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.569
 add for example the word that 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.130
 people suffer the disease or the 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.810
 phobia suffered by people who do not 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.899
 they can pronounce the long words 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.180
 this word is called hippopotamus 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.190
 monsters ski pedal and or phobia 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.380
 If they look for it on the Internet, it appears there 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.090
 this disease is real the words that 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.480
 the people who can not pronounce it 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.580
 in the end they have this disease 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.920
 and that's why I say we can add it 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.080
 together with deoxyribonucleic acid 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.780
 because it can be something inherited by the 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.940
 adn and ultimately left so the 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.090
 tongue twisters of this magnitude is not for 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.790
 imagine that the archbishop of 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.709
 constantinopla is wanted from sars or the 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.959
 archbishop of constantinople who has and 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.660
 poto monsters skiing pedaling phobia 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.220
 your deoxyribonucleic acid will go with 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.380
 the other link wine or parana logo 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.209
 discuss and me but because he wants to leave 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.060
 his little monstrous constantino bishop 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.890
 ski pedal yo csy ribonucleico 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.380
 rich otolaryngologist used and the 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.910
 that and aldesa is archbishop constantino 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.680
 poto monsters ski pedal i csy 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.959
 otorhinolaryngologist ribonucleic 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.940
 discuss and mechanized that I achieved from sars 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.190
 bishop constantino poto monsters ski 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.880
 pedal and csy ribonucleic 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.920
 otorhinolaryngologist discuss and memorize 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.780
 it will be a good development bishop 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.580
 constantino popo took his old skip the 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.630
 oxide replicated tower I do not come for in 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.590
 gary cooper mycorrhiza dor 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.000
 and so this coming doing to me 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.460
 way of thinking one of the most 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.900
 complicated if you like I can leave you the 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.210
 tongue twisters written in case they want 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.860
 learn it and well it 's all says in your 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.690
 comments and put the like if you
