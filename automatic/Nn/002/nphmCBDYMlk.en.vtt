00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.879
 ah 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.519
 do not 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.140
 with the columns of chocolates today 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.130
 I bring a video to show you how to 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.410
 open a vanilla bean 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.890
 as you can see in the video is a super 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.890
 vanilla bean 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.090
 once a vanilla expert told me 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.220
 that if you can say hello a vanilla in your 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.000
 finger and then remove it without problem is 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.000
 which is a good pod 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.420
 to cut our vanilla pod 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.990
 we need a cutting board and a 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.990
 sharp knife 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.950
 I have seen people who usually put 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.590
 knife by the side of the pod and then 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.659
 they pull out but 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.520
 it is quite complicated to do so 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.140
 and then there are people who open it as 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.429
 if it was a baguette and the problem is 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.670
 that if the knife is very sharp you 

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:13.950
 you can cut 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.009
 my way is to hold the sheath for a 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.060
 end and cut it in the middle but of 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.060
 this way that I'm seeing 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.590
 here I open it so you can see where it has 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.520
 the seed a vanilla pod for 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.520
 all those who never 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.240
 Here you can see where the seeds are 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.240
 of the pod 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.140
 and now to get the seeds well what 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.210
 what we do is put your face up 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.270
 the knife is important that it is not 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.220
 saw but be smooth 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.050
 because if it's saw many times a 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.170
 scrape it may be that we break the pod 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.170
 vanilla 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.280
 look at what easier way to get the 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.020
 vanilla pod seeds 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.030
 here I do it in a close up so that 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.610
 you see it better this pod we've already 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.130
 taken out and now we take out the other part of 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.610
 the spider remember that you have to put 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.610
 face up 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.490
 and we do the same thing that we have done 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.490
 Done before 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.400
 if you only want the seed of the pod 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.860
 you have to scrape more I is that in all 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.170
 my creams use both the pod and the 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.630
 seeds 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.600
 why in this video do not throw them 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.400
 when a lot 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.590
 in my way of opening the pod of 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.480
 vanilla if you realize I have not 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.160
 whole party in half but that is 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.470
 a little bit above 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.970
 so that they do not separate and that is that as 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.940
 they know my creams is much easier 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.860
 then when it comes to getting it out, just take it out 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.320
 a pod that is open in the middle 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.720
 that you have to take half and half 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.960
 when is one is fine but when I do 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.100
 5 liters of cream or 10 or 20 and they are a lot 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.360
 Vanilla page is much more 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.130
 complicated voucher 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.130
 Well this is all I hope you have 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.510
 liked to like I share it and 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.280
