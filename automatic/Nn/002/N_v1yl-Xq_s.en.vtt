00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
one thick wire all right and then when

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.090 
one thick wire all right and then when
it<00:01:15.820> comes<00:01:16.030> to<00:01:16.180> this<00:01:16.270> control<00:01:16.720> box<00:01:16.750> here<00:01:17.350> it's<00:01:18.010> a

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
it comes to this control box here it's a

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
rounded wire which means it twists and

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.190 
rounded wire which means it twists and
turns<00:01:21.550> unlike<00:01:22.300> this<00:01:22.450> one<00:01:22.630> which<00:01:22.810> kind<00:01:23.110> of

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
turns unlike this one which kind of

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.990

came<00:01:52.450> out<00:01:52.660> of<00:01:52.780> here<00:01:52.990> just<00:01:53.440> popped<00:01:53.679> right<00:01:53.830> out

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
came out of here just popped right out

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.950 
came out of here just popped right out
and<00:01:54.250> a<00:01:54.729> little<00:01:54.910> bit<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.149> copper<00:01:55.360> showing

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
and a little bit of copper showing

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.719 
and a little bit of copper showing
basically<00:01:56.770> I<00:01:56.800> could<00:01:56.979> only<00:01:57.070> hear<00:01:57.310> out<00:01:57.460> of<00:01:57.490> one

that<00:03:49.010> buckled<00:03:49.420> so<00:03:50.420> now<00:03:50.630> what<00:03:50.900> I<00:03:50.960> had<00:03:51.170> to<00:03:51.200> do<00:03:51.410> is

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
that buckled so now what I had to do is

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.470 
that buckled so now what I had to do is
use<00:03:51.740> some<00:03:51.890> gorilla<00:03:52.280> glue<00:03:52.610> and<00:03:52.820> a<00:03:53.150> little<00:03:53.360> bit

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
use some gorilla glue and a little bit

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.170 
use some gorilla glue and a little bit
of<00:03:53.570> tape<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:54.110> hold<00:03:54.710> it<00:03:54.860> stationary<00:03:55.430> but<00:03:56.060> as

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
of tape and hold it stationary but as

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.090 
of tape and hold it stationary but as
you<00:03:56.270> can<00:03:56.360> see<00:03:56.630> it's<00:03:56.780> not<00:03:56.900> perfectly<00:03:57.380> lined<00:03:57.860> up

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
you can see it's not perfectly lined up

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.460 
you can see it's not perfectly lined up
with<00:03:58.430> your<00:03:58.700> head<00:03:59.000> it's<00:03:59.240> kind<00:03:59.480> of<00:03:59.570> off<00:03:59.810> so<00:04:00.320> it's

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
with your head it's kind of off so it's

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.070 
with your head it's kind of off so it's
uncomfortable<00:04:01.120> needless<00:04:02.120> to<00:04:02.270> say<00:04:02.540> this<00:04:02.840> is<00:04:02.900> a

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
uncomfortable needless to say this is a

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.100 
uncomfortable needless to say this is a
great<00:04:03.380> idea<00:04:03.590> for<00:04:04.040> a<00:04:04.100> headset<00:04:04.660> but<00:04:05.660> it<00:04:05.780> needs<00:04:05.960> a

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
great idea for a headset but it needs a

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.570 
great idea for a headset but it needs a
lot<00:04:06.230> of<00:04:06.290> improvements<00:04:07.010> in<00:04:07.100> order<00:04:07.310> for<00:04:07.460> me<00:04:07.550> to

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
lot of improvements in order for me to

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.010 
lot of improvements in order for me to
want<00:04:07.820> to<00:04:07.880> spend<00:04:08.270> a<00:04:08.360> hundred<00:04:08.540> dollars<00:04:08.870> on

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
want to spend a hundred dollars on

want to spend a hundred dollars on
another<00:04:09.260> one<00:04:09.440> of<00:04:09.530> these<00:04:10.810> just<00:04:11.810> first<00:04:12.440> thing<00:04:12.650> I

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
another one of these just first thing I

another one of these just first thing I
would<00:04:12.800> do<00:04:13.010> is<00:04:13.040> make<00:04:13.670> the<00:04:13.820> entire<00:04:14.620> length<00:04:15.620> of

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
would do is make the entire length of

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.950 
would do is make the entire length of
the<00:04:16.100> cord<00:04:16.400> from<00:04:16.640> here<00:04:16.910> to<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.120> headset<00:04:17.510> like

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:20.300 
this so it can't get twisted up you see

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.660

this nice strong connection here you
know<00:04:22.790> it's<00:04:22.970> not<00:04:23.120> going<00:04:23.300> to<00:04:23.390> break<00:04:23.570> at<00:04:23.810> the

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
know it's not going to break at the

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.270 
know it's not going to break at the
point<00:04:24.230> of<00:04:24.550> where<00:04:25.550> it<00:04:25.640> comes<00:04:25.850> in<00:04:26.060> unlike<00:04:26.900> this

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280

the other thing would be who cares if

like<00:04:40.430> that<00:04:40.640> it's<00:04:40.880> not<00:04:41.230> it's<00:04:42.230> not<00:04:42.320> a<00:04:42.440> big<00:04:42.710> deal

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
like that it's not it's not a big deal

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.400 
like that it's not it's not a big deal
like<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.880> headsets<00:04:44.300> not<00:04:44.510> that<00:04:44.720> big<00:04:44.960> anyway<00:04:45.290> I

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
like the headsets not that big anyway I

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.630 
like the headsets not that big anyway I
worry<00:04:45.680> about<00:04:45.890> that<00:04:46.010> loose<00:04:46.250> that<00:04:46.460> it<00:04:46.550> would

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
worry about that loose that it would

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.910 
worry about that loose that it would
comfortably<00:04:47.000> fit<00:04:47.330> around<00:04:47.420> my<00:04:47.600> neck<00:04:47.900> so<00:04:48.740> that's

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
comfortably fit around my neck so that's

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.610 
comfortably fit around my neck so that's
a<00:04:49.010> stupid<00:04:49.400> idea<00:04:49.640> make<00:04:50.090> these<00:04:50.330> stationary<00:04:51.140> or

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
a stupid idea make these stationary or

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.050 
a stupid idea make these stationary or
maybe<00:04:51.950> give<00:04:52.160> them<00:04:52.280> a<00:04:52.340> little<00:04:52.550> bit<00:04:52.760> of<00:04:52.850> wiggle

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
maybe give them a little bit of wiggle

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.270 
maybe give them a little bit of wiggle
room<00:04:53.180> but<00:04:54.050> nothing<00:04:54.410> like<00:04:54.620> that<00:04:54.860> that's<00:04:55.160> just

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
room but nothing like that that's just

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.920 
room but nothing like that that's just
too<00:04:55.550> much<00:04:55.580> that's<00:04:56.090> just<00:04:56.300> too<00:04:56.510> much<00:04:56.540> you<00:04:56.840> don't

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
too much that's just too much you don't

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.390 
too much that's just too much you don't
need<00:04:57.080> that<00:04:57.760> I<00:04:58.760> mean<00:04:59.450> the<00:04:59.540> other<00:04:59.660> thing<00:04:59.720> is<00:05:00.080> like

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
need that I mean the other thing is like

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.280 
need that I mean the other thing is like
maybe<00:05:01.400> make<00:05:01.640> this<00:05:01.880> whole<00:05:02.180> band<00:05:02.480> thinner<00:05:02.930> you

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
maybe make this whole band thinner you

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.580 
maybe make this whole band thinner you
don't<00:05:03.470> need<00:05:03.650> this<00:05:03.830> thick<00:05:04.960> it's<00:05:05.960> just<00:05:06.170> you

your head you don't need it it's a waste
of<00:05:10.730> money<00:05:10.790> and<00:05:11.470> finally<00:05:12.470> I<00:05:12.650> would<00:05:12.920> even<00:05:13.280> go<00:05:13.730> so

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
of money and finally I would even go so

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.250 
of money and finally I would even go so
far<00:05:14.600> as<00:05:14.840> to<00:05:15.370> minimize<00:05:16.370> this<00:05:16.670> big<00:05:17.000> box<00:05:17.240> here<00:05:17.660> you

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
far as to minimize this big box here you

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.980 
far as to minimize this big box here you
