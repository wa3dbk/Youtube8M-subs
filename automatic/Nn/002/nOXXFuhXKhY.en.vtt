even<00:03:08.220> if<00:03:08.280> they're<00:03:08.460> the<00:03:08.550> same<00:03:08.580> kind<00:03:10.730> so

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.620 

now<00:03:19.710> let's<00:03:19.980> just<00:03:20.250> try<00:03:20.430> drinking<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:21.060> potion

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630

knave<00:03:22.220> weakness

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.619 

no<00:03:27.110> effect<00:03:27.470> this<00:03:27.799> is<00:03:27.950> creative<00:03:28.370> mode<00:03:28.549> but<00:03:29.420> you

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
no effect this is creative mode but you

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:30.819 
no effect this is creative mode but you
get<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:29.780> point<00:03:30.019> this<00:03:30.200> is<00:03:30.379> how<00:03:30.500> you<00:03:30.560> make

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
get the point this is how you make

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.660 
get the point this is how you make
potions<00:03:31.220> potion<00:03:32.180> stands<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.519> there<00:03:34.519> doesn't

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
potions potion stands and there doesn't

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.780 
potions potion stands and there doesn't
seem<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:34.939> be<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.120> full<00:03:35.390> effect<00:03:35.780> for<00:03:36.110> all<00:03:36.379> the

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
seem to be a full effect for all the

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.110 
seem to be a full effect for all the
ingredients<00:03:37.790> yet<00:03:39.459> but<00:03:40.459> this<00:03:40.939> is<00:03:41.090> a

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
ingredients yet but this is a

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.610 
ingredients yet but this is a
pre-release<00:03:41.629> so<00:03:41.870> it's<00:03:42.110> probably<00:03:42.319> going<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:42.560> be

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
pre-release so it's probably going to be

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.380 
pre-release so it's probably going to be
sorted<00:03:42.950> out<00:03:43.069> once<00:03:43.310> they<00:03:43.549> officially<00:03:43.849> release

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
sorted out once they officially release

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.520 
sorted out once they officially release
it<00:03:44.739> but<00:03:45.739> if<00:03:45.859> you<00:03:45.890> found<00:03:46.159> this<00:03:46.310> video<00:03:46.459> helpful<00:03:46.670> I
