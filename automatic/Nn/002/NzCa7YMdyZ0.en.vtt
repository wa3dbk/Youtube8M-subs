00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
let's check out these sodium there is

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.279 
let's check out these sodium there is
like<00:00:54.329> where<00:00:54.719> every<00:00:55.170> 40<00:00:56.690> going<00:00:57.690> who<00:00:57.960> was<00:00:58.140> it

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
like where every 40 going who was it

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.590 
like where every 40 going who was it
like<00:00:58.530> gram<00:00:59.129> forever<00:00:59.520> 40<00:00:59.820> grams<00:01:00.030> there's<00:01:00.329> like

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
like gram forever 40 grams there's like

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.479 
like gram forever 40 grams there's like
800<00:01:01.370> like<00:01:02.539> milligrams<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:03.920> 818<00:01:04.920> milligrams<00:01:05.309> of

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
800 like milligrams so 818 milligrams of

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.969 
800 like milligrams so 818 milligrams of
sodium<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.210> yummy<00:01:06.840> right<00:01:07.080> first<00:01:07.530> let's<00:01:07.799> check

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
sodium and yummy right first let's check

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.460 
sodium and yummy right first let's check
out<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> packaging<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.720> known<00:01:09.990> for<00:01:10.290> like

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
out the packaging so it's known for like

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.550 
out the packaging so it's known for like
all<00:01:10.770> these<00:01:11.189> like<00:01:11.520> scientific<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:13.170> seems

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
all these like scientific but seems

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.640 
all these like scientific but seems
amiss<00:01:13.950> plate<00:01:14.369> tacitly<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.540> where<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.380> one

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
amiss plate tacitly so where this one

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.300 
amiss plate tacitly so where this one
you've<00:01:16.799> got<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.450> wizard<00:01:18.450> or<00:01:18.720> whatever

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
you've got this like wizard or whatever

alchemist<00:01:20.310> scientists<00:01:21.090> for<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.720> guy<00:01:21.930> try

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
alchemist scientists for this guy try

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.320 
alchemist scientists for this guy try
reading<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:23.250> flipping<00:01:23.640> through<00:01:23.850> pages<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.270> a
