00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.769
 hello friends welcome to another tuto 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.320
 Tuesday 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:17.860
 I am leonardo pÃ©rez grandson and today we are going 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.009
 to make a 3d drawing 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.840
 specifically we will make a horse with 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:26.050
 a more or less triangular shape 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.599
 we turn our heads around the neck and 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.930
 we started to give a better shape to the 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.110
 details 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.560
 the body trying to do all this 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.060
 with loose movements for the legs 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.720
 I do up to my knees with a 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.840
 movement and then the bottom part 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.300
 we correct the forms on the fly the 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.760
 eye I think it goes a little higher and the 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.760
 snout shorter and thinner 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.660
 all right 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.700
 I'm going to remove the body 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.160
 because I think he had made a horse 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.180
 paunchy 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.130
 that's better 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.120
 correct some final details before 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.120
 start to shadow 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.030
 well and now with a black pencil 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.490
 we started to do the parts more 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.040
 dark 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.470
 the graphite pencil does not give a black tone 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.439
 black why I used the pencils 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.790
 of colors and now with the white of the 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:33.680
 same fire we make the light tones by 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.570
 supposed to highlight the white 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.270
 you must draw on paper or 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.880
 cardboard with some shade like gray 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.130
 that I am using on this occasion 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.630
 because white on white just for a 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:50.530
 secret drawing was joke 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.070
 now let's make a notebook or book of 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.009
 that the horse is going to be coming out 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.340
 this is fun, I love it 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.340
 to draw 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.049
 the shadow 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.250
 with graphite powder and a chamois 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.710
 we can darken the background 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.380
 I have the white paper to do 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.380
 tests and I also use it as a mask 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.260
 by the way the list of materials is 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.260
 in the information under the video 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.060
 all right 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:33.010
 I think this line should be more 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.010
 for here we are going to correct it 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.799
 with the pencil we define the edges 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.670
 with the eraser and with the pencil we make 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.420
 the central part 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.420
 very well 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:55.160
 there are some horse muscles that 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.160
 it would be worth highlighting with more light 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.670
 Excellent 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.370
 I want to make the effect as if I were 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:11.060
 pulling out a cloud of dust 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.630
 and that is even surpass the book 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.120
 A) Yes 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.960
 his shadow is very important to give the 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.960
 3d effect 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:27.880
 we give the last details to our 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.880
 beautiful white horse and ready 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.140
 yes 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.819
