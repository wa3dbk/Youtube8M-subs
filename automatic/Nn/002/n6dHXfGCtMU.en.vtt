00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.429 

I<00:00:00.060> think<00:00:00.450> some<00:00:00.750> people<00:00:00.989> might<00:00:01.290> have<00:00:01.350> been

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
I think some people might have been

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.200 
I think some people might have been
surprised<00:00:01.920> the<00:00:02.129> fact<00:00:02.340> that<00:00:02.429> tens<00:00:02.879> of

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
surprised the fact that tens of

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.999 
surprised the fact that tens of
thousands<00:00:03.750> turned<00:00:03.990> up<00:00:04.200> now<00:00:04.620> I<00:00:04.650> wasn't

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
thousands turned up now I wasn't

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.680 
thousands turned up now I wasn't
surprised<00:00:05.580> by<00:00:05.790> that<00:00:05.940> and<00:00:06.089> I'm<00:00:06.150> sure<00:00:06.330> you<00:00:06.480> feel

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
surprised by that and I'm sure you feel

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:07.490 
surprised by that and I'm sure you feel
the<00:00:06.720> same<00:00:06.870> way

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
the same way

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.640 
the same way
not<00:00:08.490> really<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:08.820> mean<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.420> we<00:00:09.840> just<00:00:10.019> expected

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
not really I mean and we just expected

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.129 
not really I mean and we just expected
lots<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:11.759> lots<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.090> people<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.450> be<00:00:12.660> there<00:00:12.900> and

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
lots and lots of people to be there and

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.890 
lots and lots of people to be there and
it<00:00:13.710> was<00:00:13.830> just<00:00:14.040> where<00:00:14.849> that<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.030> ended<00:00:15.330> like<00:00:15.719> what

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
it was just where that I ended like what

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.870 
it was just where that I ended like what
figure<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:17.100> it<00:00:17.190> wasn't<00:00:17.520> really<00:00:17.850> a

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
figure and so it wasn't really a

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.700 
figure and so it wasn't really a
surprise<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.630> see<00:00:18.779> fifty<00:00:19.140> thousand<00:00:19.529> people

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
surprise to see fifty thousand people

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.920
