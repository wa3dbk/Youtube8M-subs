really good and I've got a serious

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.359 
really good and I've got a serious
infestation<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.720> wolves<00:00:31.680> and<00:00:31.830> pigs<00:00:32.129> at<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
infestation of wolves and pigs at the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.760 
infestation of wolves and pigs at the
moment<00:00:32.879> so<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.930> was<00:00:34.050> just<00:00:34.110> kind<00:00:34.289> of<00:00:34.500> dealing

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
moment so I was just kind of dealing

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.340 
moment so I was just kind of dealing
with<00:00:34.980> those<00:00:35.129> and<00:00:35.520> like<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.449> like<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.930> view<00:00:37.109> so<00:00:37.289> I

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
with those and like I like the view so I

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.599 
with those and like I like the view so I

first<00:01:30.750> video<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.170> was<00:01:31.470> tired<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.860> shit<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.939> some

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
first video I was tired of shit so some

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.289 
first video I was tired of shit so some
of<00:01:33.689> my<00:01:34.010> numbers<00:01:35.010> that<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.369> was<00:01:35.580> giving<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:35.970> was

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
of my numbers that I was giving you was

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.050 
of my numbers that I was giving you was
whoa<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:37.080> know<00:01:37.200> was<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> little<00:01:37.619> off<00:01:37.850> many<00:01:38.850> ways

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
whoa you know was a little off many ways

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.020 
whoa you know was a little off many ways
the<00:01:39.210> outside<00:01:39.689> dimensions<00:01:40.350> are<00:01:40.820> actually<00:01:41.820> it

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
the outside dimensions are actually it

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.950 
the outside dimensions are actually it
so<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.479> 113<00:01:43.820> it's<00:01:44.820> missing<00:01:45.270> somewhere<00:01:45.750> and

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
so it's a 113 it's missing somewhere and

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.700 
so it's a 113 it's missing somewhere and
I'm<00:01:46.049> not<00:01:46.200> exactly<00:01:46.710> sure<00:01:46.920> where<00:01:47.400> it's<00:01:47.549> at<00:01:48.710> but

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
I'm not exactly sure where it's at but

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.880 
I'm not exactly sure where it's at but
if<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.579> put<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.030> block<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.900> see<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.409> pushes

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
if I put that block in it see it pushes

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.130 
if I put that block in it see it pushes
everything<00:01:53.159> off<00:01:53.400> one<00:01:53.729> block<00:01:54.000> by<00:01:54.689> time<00:01:54.900> it<00:01:55.020> gets

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
everything off one block by time it gets

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.410 
everything off one block by time it gets
around<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.560> other<00:01:55.590> side<00:01:55.770> it's<00:01:56.400> it's<00:01:57.060> off

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
around to the other side it's it's off

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.120 
around to the other side it's it's off
two<00:01:57.630> or<00:01:57.659> three<00:01:57.960> blocks<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.799> kept

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
two or three blocks and I just kept

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.800 
two or three blocks and I just kept
pissing<00:01:59.490> me<00:01:59.610> off<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.970> I<00:02:00.000> rip<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.210> out<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.479> put

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
pissing me off and I rip it out and put

finally<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.600> got<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.140> everything<00:02:04.409> lines<00:02:04.619> up

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
finally I got and everything lines up

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.469 
finally I got and everything lines up
really<00:02:05.280> really<00:02:05.549> good<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:07.579> so<00:02:08.579> then<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:08.909> start

working on the middle and I laid out the
blue<00:02:12.239> section<00:02:12.810> for<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.470> inside<00:02:13.769> arena<00:02:14.159> area

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:14.719 
blue section for the inside arena area

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:20.870 
blue section for the inside arena area
and<00:02:15.719> that's<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:16.430> 37<00:02:17.959> let's<00:02:18.959> see

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
and that's a 37 let's see

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.240 
and that's a 37 let's see
63<00:02:21.560> 63<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:23.070> then<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.580> orange<00:02:23.970> is<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.210> 71<00:02:25.250> the

the other shit just organized where it

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.980 
the other shit just organized where it
needed<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.810> be<00:02:52.460> the<00:02:53.460> only<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:54.450> only<00:02:54.480> problem

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
like i said that i had was the one block

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.740 
like i said that i had was the one block
variants<00:02:57.930> on<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.440> on<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:58.800> 113<00:02:59.580> it's<00:02:59.850> 113<00:03:00.510> on

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750

right here it comes in one block there's
one<00:03:05.760> block<00:03:05.970> difference<00:03:06.540> between<00:03:07.140> this

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
one block difference between this

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.480 
one block difference between this

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
real quick how I'm laying the blocks how

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.090 
real quick how I'm laying the blocks how
I'm<00:03:35.880> using<00:03:36.410> everything's<00:03:37.410> on<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.650> outside

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
I'm using everything's on the outside

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.670 
I'm using everything's on the outside
and<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.850> inside<00:03:38.880> are<00:03:39.810> all<00:03:40.020> set<00:03:40.320> up<00:03:40.500> and

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
and the inside are all set up and

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.760 
and the inside are all set up and
they're<00:03:41.220> used<00:03:41.400> for<00:03:41.520> stepping<00:03:42.030> stones<00:03:42.330> and

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
they're used for stepping stones and

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.650 
they're used for stepping stones and
just<00:03:43.770> I'm<00:03:44.040> just<00:03:44.190> going<00:03:44.550> to<00:03:44.610> fill<00:03:44.820> it<00:03:44.970> in<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.360> it

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
just I'm just going to fill it in and it

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.450 
just I'm just going to fill it in and it
should<00:03:45.960> really<00:03:46.200> it<00:03:46.650> should<00:03:46.830> really<00:03:46.980> take<00:03:47.220> off

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
should really it should really take off

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.610 
should really it should really take off
now<00:03:47.670> I<00:03:47.700> figure<00:03:48.360> I<00:03:48.570> can<00:03:48.960> probably<00:03:49.350> have<00:03:49.470> this

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
now I figure I can probably have this

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.940 
now I figure I can probably have this
outside<00:03:50.100> done<00:03:50.430> probably<00:03:50.880> tonight<00:03:51.709> and<00:03:52.709> then<00:03:52.920> I

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
outside done probably tonight and then I

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.990 
outside done probably tonight and then I
can<00:03:53.190> start<00:03:53.310> putting<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:55.680> top<00:03:56.490> part<00:03:56.850> on

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
can start putting the the top part on

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.300 
can start putting the the top part on
top<00:03:57.270> of<00:03:57.450> that<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:57.990> hopefully<00:03:58.620> another<00:03:59.010> day<00:03:59.190> or

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
top of that and hopefully another day or

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.250 
top of that and hopefully another day or
