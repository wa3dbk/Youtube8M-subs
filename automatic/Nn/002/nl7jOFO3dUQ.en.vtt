new<00:00:13.070> to<00:00:13.099> raw<00:00:13.429> honey<00:00:13.670> and<00:00:14.059> I<00:00:14.510> am<00:00:14.690> a<00:00:14.900> big<00:00:15.200> big<00:00:15.380> fan

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
new to raw honey and I am a big big fan

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.050 
new to raw honey and I am a big big fan
raw<00:00:16.369> honey<00:00:16.550> has<00:00:16.880> its<00:00:17.090> benefits<00:00:17.240> because<00:00:18.080> it<00:00:18.590> is

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
raw honey has its benefits because it is

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.359 
raw honey has its benefits because it is
unprocessed<00:00:20.060> and<00:00:20.240> unheated<00:00:20.869> so<00:00:21.350> it's<00:00:21.710> unlike

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
unprocessed and unheated so it's unlike

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:23.769 
unprocessed and unheated so it's unlike
the<00:00:22.520> honey<00:00:22.699> that<00:00:22.910> you<00:00:23.029> buy<00:00:23.210> in<00:00:23.270> the<00:00:23.480> stores

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
the honey that you buy in the stores

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.679 
the honey that you buy in the stores
that<00:00:24.109> is<00:00:24.230> clear<00:00:24.740> and<00:00:24.980> really<00:00:25.449> sticky<00:00:26.449> and

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
that is clear and really sticky and

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.509 
that is clear and really sticky and
thick<00:00:28.930> this<00:00:29.930> is<00:00:30.140> what<00:00:30.349> it<00:00:30.560> looks<00:00:30.890> like<00:00:31.099> this<00:00:31.369> is

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:31.519 
thick this is what it looks like this is

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.820 
thick this is what it looks like this is
a<00:00:31.550> 22<00:00:32.180> ounce<00:00:32.210> jar<00:00:32.900> which<00:00:33.170> is<00:00:33.320> a<00:00:33.350> pretty<00:00:33.590> good

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:33.830 
a 22 ounce jar which is a pretty good

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.240 
a 22 ounce jar which is a pretty good
sized<00:00:34.010> jar<00:00:34.400> and<00:00:34.670> as<00:00:35.600> you<00:00:35.930> can<00:00:36.079> see<00:00:36.320> it's<00:00:36.590> not<00:00:36.860> it

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
sized jar and as you can see it's not it

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.160 
sized jar and as you can see it's not it
doesn't<00:00:37.550> look<00:00:37.670> like<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:37.940> kind<00:00:38.149> that<00:00:38.960> you<00:00:39.050> get

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
doesn't look like the kind that you get

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.819 
doesn't look like the kind that you get
in<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:39.410> store<00:00:39.700> and<00:00:40.700> if<00:00:41.059> you<00:00:41.180> open<00:00:41.420> it<00:00:41.829> it's

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
in the store and if you open it it's

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.069 
in the store and if you open it it's
like<00:00:43.100> a<00:00:43.129> jar<00:00:43.430> of<00:00:43.460> peanut<00:00:43.760> butter<00:00:44.030> and<00:00:44.360> it<00:00:44.899> has<00:00:45.050> a

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
like a jar of peanut butter and it has a

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.400 
like a jar of peanut butter and it has a
very<00:00:45.440> smooth<00:00:46.070> buttery<00:00:46.879> consistency<00:00:47.379> which<00:00:48.379> is

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
very smooth buttery consistency which is

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.020 
very smooth buttery consistency which is
great<00:00:49.039> that's<00:00:49.309> one<00:00:49.460> of<00:00:49.520> the<00:00:49.610> reasons<00:00:49.910> that<00:00:49.969> I

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
great that's one of the reasons that I

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.540 
great that's one of the reasons that I
love<00:00:50.270> it<00:00:50.450> because<00:00:50.739> you<00:00:51.739> can<00:00:51.890> spread<00:00:52.250> it<00:00:52.309> on

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
love it because you can spread it on

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.020 
love it because you can spread it on
bread<00:00:52.579> and<00:00:53.980> what<00:00:54.980> I<00:00:55.010> like<00:00:55.250> to<00:00:55.370> do<00:00:55.460> is<00:00:55.640> take<00:00:55.820> a

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
bread and what I like to do is take a

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.760 
bread and what I like to do is take a
piece<00:00:56.210> of<00:00:56.239> bread<00:00:56.480> and<00:00:56.809> toast<00:00:57.079> it<00:00:57.289> and<00:00:57.530> then

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
piece of bread and toast it and then

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.799 
piece of bread and toast it and then
take<00:00:58.129> a<00:00:58.160> knife<00:00:58.399> and<00:00:58.670> spread<00:00:58.940> this<00:00:59.180> on<00:00:59.360> and<00:00:59.690> it

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
take a knife and spread this on and it

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.200 
take a knife and spread this on and it
just<00:01:00.020> melts<00:01:00.320> over<00:01:00.860> it<00:01:00.980> and<00:01:01.190> is<00:01:01.309> so<00:01:01.340> nice<00:01:02.090> so<00:01:03.129> if

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
just melts over it and is so nice so if

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:11.649 
just melts over it and is so nice so if
you<00:01:05.210> can<00:01:05.390> see<00:01:07.150> it's<00:01:08.150> a<00:01:08.450> very<00:01:10.659> creamy

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
you can see it's a very creamy

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.780 
you can see it's a very creamy
consistency<00:01:13.900> and<00:01:14.900> it's<00:01:15.770> very<00:01:16.100> sweet<00:01:16.490> it

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
consistency and it's very sweet it

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.120 
consistency and it's very sweet it
tastes<00:01:17.600> different<00:01:17.750> than<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:18.320> regular<00:01:18.740> store

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
tastes different than the regular store

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.999 
tastes different than the regular store
honey<00:01:19.759> that<00:01:20.060> you<00:01:20.180> would<00:01:20.330> buy<00:01:20.450> like<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:21.830> ones

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
honey that you would buy like the ones

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.260 
honey that you would buy like the ones
that<00:01:22.100> are<00:01:22.189> in<00:01:22.369> the<00:01:22.460> little<00:01:22.670> jar<00:01:22.880> that's<00:01:23.090> shaped

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
that are in the little jar that's shaped

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.960 
that are in the little jar that's shaped
like<00:01:23.360> a<00:01:23.479> bear<00:01:23.780> but<00:01:24.590> it's<00:01:24.920> really<00:01:25.460> really<00:01:25.790> good

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
like a bear but it's really really good

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.969 
like a bear but it's really really good
it's<00:01:26.119> really<00:01:26.420> sweet<00:01:26.689> and<00:01:26.960> I<00:01:27.409> will<00:01:27.560> probably

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
it's really sweet and I will probably

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.950 
it's really sweet and I will probably
never<00:01:28.159> go<00:01:28.430> back<00:01:28.580> to<00:01:28.759> using<00:01:28.880> regular<00:01:29.420> honey<00:01:29.689> any

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
never go back to using regular honey any

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.069 
never go back to using regular honey any
more<00:01:30.290> um<00:01:31.159> it<00:01:32.119> says<00:01:32.360> here<00:01:32.540> that's<00:01:32.659> pure

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
more um it says here that's pure

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.679 
more um it says here that's pure
unpasteurized<00:01:33.890> unfiltered<00:01:34.579> so<00:01:34.939> it's<00:01:35.150> fresh

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
unpasteurized unfiltered so it's fresh

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.140 
unpasteurized unfiltered so it's fresh
and<00:01:35.930> straight<00:01:36.200> from<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.470> hive<00:01:36.650> so<00:01:37.640> that<00:01:37.909> means

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
and straight from the hive so that means

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.300 
and straight from the hive so that means
that<00:01:38.360> all<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.810> enzymes<00:01:39.259> and<00:01:39.560> stuff<00:01:39.799> are<00:01:40.040> still

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
that all the enzymes and stuff are still

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.969 
that all the enzymes and stuff are still
alive<00:01:40.520> which<00:01:40.880> in<00:01:41.259> normal<00:01:42.259> honey<00:01:42.590> they<00:01:42.799> get

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
alive which in normal honey they get

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.429 
alive which in normal honey they get
killed<00:01:43.220> when<00:01:43.490> it's<00:01:43.670> processed<00:01:43.939> and<00:01:44.509> it<00:01:45.229> says

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
killed when it's processed and it says

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.139 
killed when it's processed and it says
that<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:45.650> provides<00:01:46.250> a<00:01:46.369> maximum<00:01:46.579> level<00:01:47.119> of

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
that it provides a maximum level of

creamy<00:01:58.250> or<00:01:58.430> spreadable<00:01:58.880> so<00:01:59.450> it's<00:01:59.719> just

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
creamy or spreadable so it's just

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.600 
creamy or spreadable so it's just
naturally<00:02:00.380> like<00:02:00.409> that<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:01.009> it<00:02:01.130> is<00:02:01.280> really

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
naturally like that and it is really

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.420 
naturally like that and it is really
really<00:02:01.850> great<00:02:02.149> so<00:02:02.570> it<00:02:03.020> is<00:02:03.350> a<00:02:03.500> healthier<00:02:04.070> as

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
really great so it is a healthier as

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.880 
really great so it is a healthier as
well<00:02:04.759> as<00:02:04.939> a<00:02:04.969> very<00:02:05.329> tasty<00:02:05.840> alternative<00:02:06.469> to<00:02:06.740> the
