while<00:02:36.390> I'm<00:02:36.540> at<00:02:36.660> sea<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.740> think<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.370> interesting

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
while I'm at sea I think the interesting

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.740 
while I'm at sea I think the interesting
time<00:02:38.910> would<00:02:39.030> come<00:02:39.060> along<00:02:39.300> when<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.570> had

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
time would come along when I had

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.820 
time would come along when I had
children<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.290> then<00:02:40.440> I'd<00:02:40.530> have<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.710> think

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
children and then I'd have to think

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.350 
children and then I'd have to think
about<00:02:41.280> whether<00:02:41.460> I<00:02:41.580> wanted<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:41.910> be<00:02:42.030> at<00:02:42.120> sea<00:02:42.330> for

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
about whether I wanted to be at sea for

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.190 
about whether I wanted to be at sea for
such<00:02:43.350> extended<00:02:43.950> periods<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.340> time<00:02:44.490> or<00:02:44.880> not<00:02:45.200> but

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
such extended periods of time or not but

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.480 
such extended periods of time or not but
that's<00:02:46.320> a<00:02:46.470> decision<00:02:46.740> I've<00:02:46.950> not<00:02:47.100> got<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.310> make

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
that's a decision I've not got to make

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.160 
that's a decision I've not got to make
yet<00:02:47.790> but<00:02:48.630> I<00:02:48.660> will<00:02:48.720> one<00:02:49.020> day<00:02:49.200> hopefully<00:02:51.170> going
