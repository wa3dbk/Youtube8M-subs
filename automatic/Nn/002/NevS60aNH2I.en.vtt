going<00:05:02.850> out<00:05:03.120> of<00:05:03.240> your<00:05:03.270> way<00:05:03.450> I<00:05:03.900> just<00:05:03.990> realized

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
going out of your way I just realized

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.620 
going out of your way I just realized
that<00:05:04.590> was<00:05:04.800> a<00:05:04.830> really<00:05:05.220> strange<00:05:05.639> explanation

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
that was a really strange explanation

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.600 
that was a really strange explanation

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
but basically I mean you don't have to

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.040 
but basically I mean you don't have to
go<00:05:08.729> out<00:05:08.850> of<00:05:08.970> your<00:05:09.000> way<00:05:09.150> to<00:05:09.270> find<00:05:09.450> healthy

go out of your way to find healthy
feelings<00:05:10.470> they're<00:05:10.680> accessible<00:05:11.520> you<00:05:12.030> don't

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
feelings they're accessible you don't

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.210 
feelings they're accessible you don't
have<00:05:12.419> to<00:05:12.600> just<00:05:12.900> find<00:05:13.169> what<00:05:13.530> you<00:05:13.740> can<00:05:13.979> find

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
have to just find what you can find

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.879 
have to just find what you can find
don't<00:05:14.729> cry<00:05:15.030> and<00:05:15.090> go<00:05:15.270> out<00:05:15.479> of<00:05:15.600> your<00:05:15.780> way<00:05:15.900> to<00:05:16.260> find

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
don't cry and go out of your way to find

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:18.950 
don't cry and go out of your way to find
healthy<00:05:17.310> foods<00:05:17.520> it's<00:05:17.760> not<00:05:17.940> that<00:05:18.120> difficult<00:05:18.360> so

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
healthy foods it's not that difficult so
