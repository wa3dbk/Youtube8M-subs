00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.650
 bad format namely reissue in 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.290
 houses under paperback and this 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.720

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.150
 materials 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.500
 drawing is excellent as in single 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.290
 chambers and in the collection 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.600
 I like this hero and I will 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.030
 follow his adventures further 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.120

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:46.400
 read collect good comics i Vlad 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.810
 so far may be cooler scuffle 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.810
 heroes and villains 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.900
 only scuffle between hero and hero 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.240
 monk and without a torus and iron man 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:01.870
