trying to make knives wormies tung oil
finish<00:02:51.099> and<00:02:52.099> I<00:02:52.129> believe<00:02:52.430> it's<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:52.700> finish

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
finish and I believe it's a finish

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.270 
finish and I believe it's a finish
that's<00:02:53.269> been<00:02:53.480> used<00:02:53.750> for<00:02:53.959> many<00:02:54.260> many<00:02:54.530> years<00:02:54.620> so

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
that's been used for many many years so

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.830 
that's been used for many many years so
I<00:02:55.310> would<00:02:55.580> imagine<00:02:55.849> it<00:02:56.180> could<00:02:56.330> have<00:02:56.420> possibly

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
I would imagine it could have possibly

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.500 
I would imagine it could have possibly
been<00:02:56.930> used<00:02:57.379> on<00:02:57.620> in<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:58.370> manufacturer<00:02:59.330> of<00:02:59.360> the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
been used on in the manufacturer of the

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.240 
been used on in the manufacturer of the

cuts<00:03:11.660> very<00:03:11.840> well<00:03:12.140> a<00:03:12.440> few<00:03:13.099> blade<00:03:13.400> is<00:03:13.579> easy<00:03:13.760> to

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
cuts very well a few blade is easy to

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.140 
cuts very well a few blade is easy to
sharpen<00:03:14.329> a<00:03:14.450> thick<00:03:14.629> blade<00:03:14.870> is<00:03:15.049> hard<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.410> sharp

so<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:17.629> a<00:03:17.959> good<00:03:18.140> piece<00:03:18.319> of<00:03:18.379> Steel<00:03:18.739> pulls<00:03:19.430> in

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
so and a good piece of Steel pulls in

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.630 
so and a good piece of Steel pulls in
the<00:03:19.670> edge<00:03:19.849> for<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.239> long<00:03:20.420> time<00:03:20.720> a<00:03:21.640> well
