00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.049
 good day while driving point ru and 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:11.219
 connect to macbook from external 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:15.920
 monitor here is an external monitor on it like 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.740
 already noticeable too now magician 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.480
 operating system are output and 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.119
 it is derived from here through this one 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.130
 cable bought put them on with three for 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.199
 Something about 6 8 bucks to someone as lucky 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.780
 sometimes up to 10 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:37.850
 your thunderbolt is connected to the output 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.850
 has three options 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:52.620
 9 and not sure what third year of it 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:54.210
 buying displayport hdmi and delay and here 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.210
 mini displayport the same as 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.660
 Thunderbolt are backwards compatible. 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.149
 what we have here and so 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.900
 all connected immediately decided all 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.310
 Immediately it remains to configure 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.470
 configured set up this way 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.900
 go monitor setting and select them 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.549
 location and with immediately appear on 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.100
 the second monitor is a window where you can 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.840
 calibrate for example now well obviously 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:28.710
 In general, not that color transmission goes and 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:35.520
 so my calibrate in expert 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:38.810
 mode, continue here until I tell you about 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.530
 calibration then it is necessary to ensure that 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.110
 apple roughly speaking 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.610
 disappeared and as I record 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.909
 video from the phone screen , then I even 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:53.780
 It will probably show you this 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.780
 Effect
