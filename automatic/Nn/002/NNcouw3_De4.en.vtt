then decided that I do it on an

industrial basis and production basis
the<00:00:46.350> obvious<00:00:46.770> thing<00:00:47.039> was<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.430> -<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:48.360> make<00:00:48.539> a

the obvious thing was to - can make a

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.139 
the obvious thing was to - can make a
decision<00:00:49.110> as<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.379> what<00:00:49.710> material<00:00:50.340> at<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.879> time

the<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.840> new<00:00:52.559> technology<00:00:53.430> was<00:00:53.640> fibreglass

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
the the new technology was fibreglass

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.189 
the the new technology was fibreglass
and<00:00:54.620> they<00:00:55.620> were<00:00:55.680> already<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.640> few<00:00:57.539> yards<00:00:57.989> in

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
and they were already a few yards in

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.689 
and they were already a few yards in
different<00:00:58.649> parts<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.010> world<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.340> we're

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
different parts of the world that we're

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.439 
different parts of the world that we're
building<00:01:00.410> fiberglass<00:01:01.410> yachts<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.180> size

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
building fiberglass yachts of this size

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.530 
building fiberglass yachts of this size
and<00:01:03.949> so<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.250> thought<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.760> have<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.150> go<00:01:06.299> with

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
and so I thought that I have to go with

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.800 
and so I thought that I have to go with
me<00:01:06.689> with<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> technology<00:01:07.790> it<00:01:08.790> made<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.659> boat

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
me with the technology it made the boat

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.960 
me with the technology it made the boat
much<00:01:10.049> lighter<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.740> lighter

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
much lighter a lighter

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.460 
much lighter a lighter
it<00:01:12.659> means<00:01:12.869> faster<00:01:13.400> so<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.610> was<00:01:15.170> easier<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.229> win

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
it means faster so it was easier to win

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.789 
it means faster so it was easier to win
the<00:01:16.619> races<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.939> course<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.960> racing<00:01:19.560> rules

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
the races and of course the racing rules

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.980 
the races and of course the racing rules
tried<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.790> follow<00:01:21.060> up<00:01:21.299> but<00:01:21.509> even<00:01:21.630> they<00:01:21.869> were

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
tried to follow up but even they were

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.530 
tried to follow up but even they were
always<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.439> little<00:01:22.650> bit<00:01:22.830> after<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:23.909> development

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
always a little bit after in development

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.740 
always a little bit after in development
and<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.320> we<00:01:25.619> had<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.850> know<00:01:26.909> distinct

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
and so we had a you know distinct

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.560 
and so we had a you know distinct
advantage<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:29.490> combination<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.240> style

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
advantage the combination of style

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.660 
advantage the combination of style
craftsmanship<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.799> likeness<00:01:32.250> took<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
craftsmanship and likeness took the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.240
