00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.400
 welcome to unfortunately today with rain 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:14.620
 but that is not a problem 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.200
 that does not help us from the training and 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.060
 if you want to shape your body then and 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.180
 not only build muscle but also 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.880
 then reduce their fat content reduce 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.520
 is the so-called kit training that 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.640
 This is called high intensity 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:33.430
 Interval training the appropriate method 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.960
 reducing the environment and muscle mass 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.970
 anyway to receive 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.530
 and today I will show you how 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.140
 a hit training with the spring cord 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.930
 The whole thing can be dreamed of looking like this 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.180
 that I have a minute load 30 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.200
 have a break of a second and the whole in 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.970
 that means about eight to ten 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.630
 twelve passes that's what it means there 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.640
 between 10 and 15 minutes the whole and 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.870
 I use an interval again 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.239
 timer here phone at iphone world shortly 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.880
 demonstrate 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.450
 there are, for example, the so-called 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.869
 training part his app for example or 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:17.049
 that I used now is so -called 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:20.079
 see konz pro where you are then 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.819
 can set certain intervals so 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.880
 if you then need to workout the 

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:27.759
 and that's perfect for him 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.840
 to divide this interval correctly because 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.369
 if you always look at the clock 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.609
 would would jump sprint is 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.649
 of course ok so a hit 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:36.999
 Training can be done in a variety of ways 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.799
 be performed wisely 

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:41.170
 I'll show you this today with the spring 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.759
 just look at us 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.759
 okay let's go 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.720
 minute 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:16.659
 yes the whole effort and important 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:19.999
 then you will always be full on the 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:24.499
 highest intensity yesterday means high 

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:26.599
 intensity interval training and the 

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:30.729
 great advantage when the rear old 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:33.919
 So with this program is that in 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:36.469
 relatively short time that is in about 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:38.929
 twelve minutes 15 minutes so ten to 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:43.249
 15 minutes can be performed 

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:45.979
 and the effect is much better than 

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:48.499
 if we now build muscle body fat 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:49.969
 wants to reduce and eg 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:51.649
 basic endurance because now it is 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:54.519
 problem the basics endurance training 

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:59.539
 It is about a longer period of time 

00:06:54.519 --> 00:07:04.099
 35 minutes up and there partner 

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:06.919
 Muscle mass that means heat high 

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:08.629
 intensity short break where the 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:11.659
 body can not completely recover 

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:13.459
 the advantage is also that the that of the 

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:15.969
 metabolism stimulated much much longer 

00:07:13.459 --> 00:07:18.399
 will last for a long time after the training 

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:21.039
 okay that's it for today from time to 

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:23.259
 ship if you have any questions just here 

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:24.849
 below below the videos a 

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:27.039
 Question left the video 

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:29.919
 I liked facebooks 

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:32.049
 youtube thumbs up or just one 

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:35.849
 leave a cool comment 

00:07:32.049 --> 00:07:35.849
 I 'm looking forward to see you next time
