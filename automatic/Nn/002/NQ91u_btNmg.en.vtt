00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.319
 Today I show what's in my bag 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.780
 my bag is that high says that 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:15.089
 I have on ebay one and a half years ago 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:17.880
 bought for 20 euros this is imitation leather 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.529
 And he is amazed at the quality of the product 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.010
 no quirks or anything though I am 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.980
 Every day use in every situation 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.420
 work to uni to sport when i enter 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.150
 go away for a few days 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.340
 yes, I really wanted to get in one then 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.800
 have backpack because that's easy 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.410
 is more practical when cycling and 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.910
 It is not the most beautiful at all 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.610
 Backpack that I can imagine 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.730
 but I'm against all right and 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.719
 I like to use it for the size 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.940
 is good for me 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.890
 I'll just say something today 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.210
 on the one hand reminds my headphones 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:01:01.710
 I always have it with me 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:03.500
 on the way music can hear my 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.150
 calendar and a pen 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.060
 I also do all my services there 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:15.330
 local and to-do lists everything 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:17.070
 somehow still needs to be done and 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.780
 Finally, my purse 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.640
 my mother did that a few years ago 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.979
 bought on a flea market and since then 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.840
 I use the one in the back there 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.840
 An advice decision for money small 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.900
 and in the front I still have mine 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.610
 student card and my driving license 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.740
 and a recent study certificate 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.130
 they have to be done recently 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.259
 otherwise have the semesterticket 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.600
 That's it, that's it 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.040
 I usually always the 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.710
 lipstick I on the day hail 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.960
 but I have friends 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:57.080
 rausgeholt and my house key 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.340
 is currently in the front door what it is 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.080
 in this video it works 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.170
 less what I have in my bag 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.299
 rather, it's about that 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.009
 minimalism not necessarily just something 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.410
 has to do with how it is with you 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:14.170
 Home looks like it's just starting 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.170
 so that you carry around with you 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.920
 although I'm not very neat 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.000
 human being is my bag always very much 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.830
 neat and i have the habit 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.530
 Always before I leave the house to 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.299
 look what else is in there what you need 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.930
 I in the situation and I limit 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.000
 me there on the essential and 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.040
 That's how I would feel internally 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.599
 have tidied up and organized and 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.030
 that makes me happier and happier 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:46.370
 happier collecting in my purse 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.260
 For example, never any old 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.470
 ticket to the sort I always 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.970
 just off and ec cards namely only with 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.730
 if I know exactly that I am one 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.989
 will need 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.519
 and who is branding why I have such a 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.950
 take the whole backpack with me 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.230
 anyway so little while then got the 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.790
 It's just because I am when I am 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.340
 without 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.739
 on the way back a few 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.659
 shopping for food and i can 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.049
 then simply do not have to get in there and 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:16.719
 use any plastic bags 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.609
 yes, that's about it 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:21.430
 that would want to say something to me 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:24.909
 Interested if other people that 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:28.290
 make a project like that and otherwise 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.290
 That would be a tip from me
