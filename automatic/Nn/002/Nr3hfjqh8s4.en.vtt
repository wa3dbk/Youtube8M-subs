00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
say in Conroe comprar conditions you

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.930 
say in Conroe comprar conditions you
know<00:01:23.940> when<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:24.869> quiet<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.709> the<00:01:26.550> fish<00:01:26.759> are

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
know when it's quiet and the fish are

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.639 
know when it's quiet and the fish are
just<00:01:27.179> chomping<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.780> mean<00:01:27.959> run<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.289> thing<00:01:28.500> on<00:01:28.619> a

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
just chomping I mean run that thing on a

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.529 
just chomping I mean run that thing on a
finesse<00:01:29.039> deal<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.759> other<00:01:29.789> thing<00:01:30.149> I<00:01:30.270> would<00:01:30.330> say

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
finesse deal the other thing I would say

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.050 
finesse deal the other thing I would say
is<00:01:30.989> is<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.709> mean<00:01:32.009> don't<00:01:32.190> just<00:01:32.280> leave<00:01:32.580> it<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:32.819> all

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
is is I mean don't just leave it on all

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.660 
is is I mean don't just leave it on all
day<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.569> mean<00:01:34.319> I<00:01:34.410> like<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.739> plug<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.220> if<00:01:35.489> I'm

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
day I mean I like to plug it in if I'm

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.820 
day I mean I like to plug it in if I'm
fishing<00:01:35.849> one<00:01:36.270> area<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:37.380> know<00:01:37.470> let's<00:01:37.649> say<00:01:37.800> I

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
fishing one area you know let's say I

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.859 
fishing one area you know let's say I
have<00:01:38.069> a<00:01:38.099> school<00:01:38.459> of<00:01:38.489> fish<00:01:38.789> that<00:01:39.479> I'm<00:01:39.630> fishing

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
have a school of fish that I'm fishing

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.699 
have a school of fish that I'm fishing
when<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.890> pull<00:01:41.190> in<00:01:41.369> there<00:01:41.869> I'm<00:01:42.869> going<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.590> have

00:01:43.699 --> 00:01:43.709 
when I pull in there I'm going to have
