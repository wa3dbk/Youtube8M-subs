00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.660 
sides as well so nothing like I said
this<00:06:45.080> one<00:06:45.260> is<00:06:45.320> the<00:06:45.440> Rio<00:06:45.590> Grande<00:06:45.980> which<00:06:46.340> is<00:06:46.520> the

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:46.670 
this one is the Rio Grande which is the

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.010 
this one is the Rio Grande which is the
zero<00:06:46.880> floor<00:06:47.240> they<00:06:48.230> also<00:06:48.380> have<00:06:48.620> lace<00:06:48.890> wood

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.020 
zero floor they also have lace wood

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.200

rosewood and flame maple

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.180

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.190 
so with those you'll get slightly

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.230 
so with those you'll get slightly
