00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
side we did shocks and springs is the

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.459 
side we did shocks and springs is the
springs<00:00:08.480> that's<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.660> old<00:00:09.840> spring<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:12.469> here's

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
springs that's the old spring and here's

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.320 
springs that's the old spring and here's
the<00:00:13.650> old<00:00:13.769> shock<00:00:14.040> which<00:00:14.370> didn't<00:00:14.940> really<00:00:15.000> seem

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
the old shock which didn't really seem

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.720 
the old shock which didn't really seem
shot<00:00:15.710> the<00:00:16.710> vans<00:00:16.920> got<00:00:17.100> about<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.369> hundred<00:00:17.699> and

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
shot the vans got about a hundred and

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.970 
shot the vans got about a hundred and
thirty<00:00:17.850> thousand<00:00:18.390> miles<00:00:18.539> on<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.500> back<00:00:19.740> was

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
thirty thousand miles on it the back was

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.529 
thirty thousand miles on it the back was
sagging<00:00:20.720> so<00:00:21.720> we're<00:00:21.990> replacing<00:00:22.199> both<00:00:23.359> we<00:00:24.359> did

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
sagging so we're replacing both we did

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.029 
sagging so we're replacing both we did
this<00:00:24.660> side<00:00:24.869> already<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.529> can<00:00:25.650> see<00:00:25.800> it's<00:00:25.920> much

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
this side already you can see it's much

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.160 
this side already you can see it's much
higher<00:00:26.250> up<00:00:26.460> than<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.640> was<00:00:26.820> before<00:00:27.269> you

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
higher up than it was before you

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.210 
higher up than it was before you
couldn't<00:00:28.380> even<00:00:28.439> get<00:00:28.590> your<00:00:28.710> hand<00:00:28.949> underneath

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
couldn't even get your hand underneath

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.490 
couldn't even get your hand underneath
it<00:00:29.580> that's<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.660> lug<00:00:30.840> pattern

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
it that's the lug pattern

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.119 
it that's the lug pattern
the<00:00:31.679> cameraman<00:00:32.520> thinks<00:00:32.790> that's<00:00:32.910> before<00:00:33.230> okay

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.200 

we're<00:00:38.129> going<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.309> chop<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.730> wheels<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
we're going to chop the wheels on the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.889 
we're going to chop the wheels on the
other<00:00:39.360> side

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
other side

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.959 
other side
Jack<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.770> other<00:00:40.920> side<00:00:41.129> up<00:00:41.340> pull<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.700> other

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
Jack the other side up pull the other

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.470 
Jack the other side up pull the other
tire<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:43.730> then<00:00:44.730> we'll<00:00:44.940> stuff<00:00:45.090> Emily<00:00:45.360> again

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
tire and then we'll stuff Emily again

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.389 
tire and then we'll stuff Emily again
after<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.780> all<00:00:46.559> right<00:00:46.770> we<00:00:46.890> got<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.219> wheel

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
after that all right we got in the wheel

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.690 
after that all right we got in the wheel
off<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.440> no<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.620> emergency<00:00:50.039> brakes<00:00:50.250> not<00:00:50.489> on

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
off so no the emergency brakes not on

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.729 
off so no the emergency brakes not on
but<00:00:50.879> we<00:00:51.000> already<00:00:51.090> chopped<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> front<00:00:51.780> car

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
but we already chopped the front car

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.910 
but we already chopped the front car
jacked<00:00:53.070> up<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.370> two<00:00:53.550> places

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
jacked up in two places

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.459 
jacked up in two places
underneath<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.690> support<00:00:57.690> arm<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> arm

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
underneath the support arm of the a arm

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.529 
underneath the support arm of the a arm
I<00:00:58.590> guess<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.550> got<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> jack<00:00:59.940> stand<00:01:00.210> under

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
I guess and it's got a jack stand under

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.540 
I guess and it's got a jack stand under
it<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:01.410> got<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.649> get<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.800> jack<00:01:01.980> stand<00:01:02.250> on<00:01:02.340> here

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
it you got to get the jack stand on here

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.860 
it you got to get the jack stand on here
to<00:01:02.640> hold<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.879> body<00:01:03.030> up<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.359> whole<00:01:03.510> time<00:01:03.690> and

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
to hold the body up the whole time and

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.240 
to hold the body up the whole time and
then<00:01:03.960> you'll<00:01:04.110> screw<00:01:04.379> around<00:01:04.530> lowering<00:01:05.159> and

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
then you'll screw around lowering and

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.469 
then you'll screw around lowering and
raising<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.670> jack<00:01:05.850> depending<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:06.330> what

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
raising the jack depending on what

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.109 
raising the jack depending on what

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
well as you can see in here back behind

well as you can see in here back behind
the<00:01:24.780> air<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.860> bolt<00:01:26.220> you're<00:01:26.939> going<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.150> take

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
the air this bolt you're going to take

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.950 
the air this bolt you're going to take
this<00:01:27.600> off<00:01:28.040> in<00:01:29.040> order<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.640> lower<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.150> spring<00:01:30.450> so

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
this off in order to lower the spring so

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.179 
this off in order to lower the spring so
we're<00:01:31.079> going<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.259> be<00:01:31.320> taking<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.740> off<00:01:31.979> and

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
we're going to be taking this off and

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.960 
we're going to be taking this off and
this<00:01:32.880> which<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.270> think<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.680> I'm<00:01:35.490> guessing

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
this which I think is the I'm guessing

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.640 
this which I think is the I'm guessing
could<00:01:36.450> be<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.659> cable<00:01:36.869> for<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.170> emergency

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
could be the cable for the emergency

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.800 
could be the cable for the emergency
brake<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.369> got<00:01:38.579> two<00:01:38.790> bolts<00:01:39.450> holding<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
brake it's got two bolts holding the

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.120 
brake it's got two bolts holding the
bracket<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.259> we're<00:01:40.409> going<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.560> take<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.920> off

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
bracket on we're going to take this off

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.160 
bracket on we're going to take this off
and<00:01:41.340> wire<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.970> up<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> next<00:01:42.630> time<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.960> see

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
and wire it up so the next time you see

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.740 
and wire it up so the next time you see
it<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.439> will<00:01:43.619> be<00:01:43.770> wired<00:01:44.009> up<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:45.210> both<00:01:45.540> will

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
it this will be wired up this both will

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.160 
it this will be wired up this both will
be<00:01:45.869> off<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.950> will<00:01:47.130> be<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> lot<00:01:47.490> lower<00:01:47.729> the

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
be off and this will be a lot lower the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:59.380 
be off and this will be a lot lower the
entire<00:01:49.700> drum<00:01:50.700> that's<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.630> for<00:01:51.780> now

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.940 

okay

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
okay

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.840 
okay
this<00:02:02.340> brackets<00:02:03.000> off<00:02:03.150> wire<00:02:03.900> it<00:02:04.110> out<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.380> way

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
this brackets off wire it out of the way

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.180 
this brackets off wire it out of the way
we<00:02:05.850> put<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.030> bolt<00:02:06.270> off<00:02:06.479> down<00:02:06.690> here

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
we put the bolt off down here

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.309 
we put the bolt off down here
so<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.310> Aon<00:02:08.580> swings<00:02:08.910> down<00:02:09.119> with<00:02:09.990> your<00:02:10.140> foot

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
so the Aon swings down with your foot

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.340 
so the Aon swings down with your foot
give<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.709> good<00:02:10.830> ramp<00:02:11.100> and<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:13.020> spring

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
give it a good ramp and the spring

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.570 
give it a good ramp and the spring
should<00:02:14.900> be<00:02:15.900> pretty<00:02:16.140> loose<00:02:16.350> at<00:02:16.620> this<00:02:17.040> point<00:02:17.340> is

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
should be pretty loose at this point is

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.449 
should be pretty loose at this point is
you<00:02:17.790> want<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.060> do<00:02:18.920> when<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:19.950> get<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.130> piece<00:02:20.280> of

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
you want to do when I get a piece of

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.190 
you want to do when I get a piece of
tape<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.700> just<00:02:20.970> mark<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.480> spring<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.080> put

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
tape and just mark the spring and put

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.270 
tape and just mark the spring and put
another<00:02:22.319> little<00:02:22.620> piece<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:22.860> tape<00:02:23.010> on<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.190> a

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
another little piece of tape on the a

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.190 
another little piece of tape on the a
arm<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.850> we<00:02:23.970> you<00:02:24.060> know<00:02:24.180> wishes<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.870> top<00:02:25.050> and

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
arm that we you know wishes the top and

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.420 
arm that we you know wishes the top and
bottom<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.590> spring<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:26.069> you<00:02:26.160> can<00:02:26.280> match

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
bottom of the spring so you can match

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.120 
bottom of the spring so you can match
that<00:02:26.640> up<00:02:26.760> when<00:02:26.850> you<00:02:26.940> put<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.150> back<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:28.130> which

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
that up when you put it back and which

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.830 
that up when you put it back and which
way<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.370> spring<00:02:29.610> should<00:02:29.730> kind<00:02:29.940> of<00:02:29.970> be<00:02:30.060> turned

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.800 

we've<00:02:33.840> already<00:02:34.610> lowered<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.700> jack<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.209> moved

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
we've already lowered the jack and moved

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
we've already lowered the jack and moved
it<00:02:36.989> out<00:02:37.080> of<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.260> way<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.560> that's<00:02:37.680> what's

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
it out of the way and that's what's

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.530 
it out of the way and that's what's
letting<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:38.130> swing<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:38.640> low<00:02:38.850> you<00:02:39.300> really

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
letting this swing so low you really

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.500 
letting this swing so low you really
want<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.750> look<00:02:39.840> for<00:02:39.900> damage<00:02:40.350> on<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:41.330> if<00:02:42.330> you

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
want to look for damage on this if you

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.449 
want to look for damage on this if you
can<00:02:42.660> see<00:02:42.690> in<00:02:42.959> here<00:02:43.230> there's<00:02:43.860> usually<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.220> rubber

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
can see in here there's usually a rubber

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.979 
can see in here there's usually a rubber
cup<00:02:45.590> this<00:02:46.590> is<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.830> one<00:02:46.950> from<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.160> old<00:02:47.370> side

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
cup this is the one from the old side

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.420 
cup this is the one from the old side
ideally<00:02:48.989> like<00:02:49.530> everybody<00:02:49.980> else<00:02:50.160> on<00:02:50.340> the

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
ideally like everybody else on the

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.310 
ideally like everybody else on the
internet<00:02:50.790> they<00:02:51.690> said<00:02:51.870> they<00:02:51.959> found<00:02:52.110> them

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
internet they said they found them

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.420 
internet they said they found them
shredded<00:02:52.709> in<00:02:52.800> there<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.130> they<00:02:53.190> would<00:02:53.310> have

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
shredded in there and they would have

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.830 
shredded in there and they would have
gotten<00:02:53.580> new<00:02:53.760> ones<00:02:53.940> if<00:02:54.060> they'd<00:02:54.209> known<00:02:54.360> I<00:02:54.660> fall

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
gotten new ones if they'd known I fall

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.540 
gotten new ones if they'd known I fall
into<00:02:55.019> that<00:02:55.110> same<00:02:55.170> category<00:02:55.560> would<00:02:56.430> have

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
into that same category would have

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.670 
into that same category would have
gotten<00:02:56.760> any<00:02:56.940> one<00:02:57.120> if<00:02:57.300> I'd<00:02:57.690> known<00:02:57.900> didn't<00:02:58.530> now

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
gotten any one if I'd known didn't now

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.390 
gotten any one if I'd known didn't now
so<00:02:59.300> put<00:03:00.300> back<00:03:00.450> nothing<00:03:00.720> on<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.709> top<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.250> one

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
so put back nothing on the top the one

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.100 
so put back nothing on the top the one
on<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.610> top<00:03:02.790> similar<00:03:03.480> thing<00:03:03.720> but<00:03:03.930> it's<00:03:04.049> in

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
on the top similar thing but it's in

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.170 
on the top similar thing but it's in
much<00:03:04.260> better<00:03:04.440> shape<00:03:04.590> I<00:03:05.070> cleaned<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.880> up<00:03:05.970> threw

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
much better shape I cleaned it up threw

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.000 
much better shape I cleaned it up threw
on<00:03:06.299> some<00:03:06.329> silicon<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.200> put<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.680> back<00:03:07.769> up<00:03:07.980> there

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
on some silicon and put it back up there

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.270 
on some silicon and put it back up there
these<00:03:09.200> we're<00:03:10.200> about<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.560> take<00:03:10.739> this<00:03:10.920> spring

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
these we're about to take this spring

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.330 
these we're about to take this spring
out<00:03:12.049> it's<00:03:13.049> loose<00:03:13.350> I'm<00:03:13.620> just<00:03:13.799> going<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:13.980> mark<00:03:14.160> it

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
out it's loose I'm just going to mark it

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.060 
out it's loose I'm just going to mark it
first<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:15.140> by<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.200> time<00:03:16.410> video<00:03:16.590> comes<00:03:16.890> back

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
first and by the time video comes back

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.110 
first and by the time video comes back
on<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:18.060> spring<00:03:18.600> will<00:03:18.750> be<00:03:18.840> out<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.910> I'll<00:03:20.910> be

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
on the spring will be out and I'll be

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:29.930 
on the spring will be out and I'll be
getting<00:03:21.269> ready<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.540> put<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.780> next<00:03:21.959> spring<00:03:22.170> in

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.000 

okay<00:03:30.940> Springs<00:03:31.720> out<00:03:31.959> this<00:03:32.410> is<00:03:32.530> what<00:03:32.680> sits<00:03:32.890> on

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
okay Springs out this is what sits on

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.270 
okay Springs out this is what sits on
the<00:03:33.099> top<00:03:34.050> it's<00:03:35.050> got<00:03:35.200> a<00:03:35.260> little<00:03:35.470> cutout<00:03:35.709> not<00:03:36.250> a

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
the top it's got a little cutout not a

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.070 
the top it's got a little cutout not a
cutout<00:03:36.550> but<00:03:36.849> a<00:03:36.880> notch<00:03:37.390> out<00:03:37.660> I<00:03:37.720> don't<00:03:37.870> know<00:03:38.020> if

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
cutout but a notch out I don't know if

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.690 
cutout but a notch out I don't know if
it<00:03:38.170> originally<00:03:38.620> came<00:03:38.770> that<00:03:39.010> way<00:03:39.160> or<00:03:39.430> if<00:03:39.520> that's

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
it originally came that way or if that's

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.920 
it originally came that way or if that's
just<00:03:39.849> how<00:03:39.940> it<00:03:40.000> got<00:03:40.150> over<00:03:40.300> there<00:03:40.540> but<00:03:40.660> I<00:03:40.720> tried

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
just how it got over there but I tried

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.479 
just how it got over there but I tried
to<00:03:40.959> match<00:03:41.200> up<00:03:41.410> onto<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.770> new<00:03:41.890> spring<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.280> same

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
to match up onto the new spring the same

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.750 
to match up onto the new spring the same
way<00:03:42.720> if<00:03:43.720> you<00:03:43.900> can<00:03:44.050> see<00:03:44.230> in<00:03:44.380> here<00:03:44.670> there's<00:03:45.670> a

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
way if you can see in here there's a

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.030 
way if you can see in here there's a
little<00:03:46.480> bit<00:03:46.630> of<00:03:46.660> wear<00:03:46.900> indicating<00:03:47.739> this<00:03:47.890> is

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
little bit of wear indicating this is

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.690 
little bit of wear indicating this is
hit<00:03:48.250> but<00:03:48.880> nothing<00:03:49.450> monumental<00:03:50.170> this<00:03:51.010> is<00:03:51.489> one

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
hit but nothing monumental this is one

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.550 
hit but nothing monumental this is one
out<00:03:51.880> I<00:03:51.910> sprayed<00:03:52.360> this<00:03:52.510> out<00:03:52.690> just<00:03:52.989> to<00:03:53.080> clean<00:03:53.410> it

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
out I sprayed this out just to clean it

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.690 
out I sprayed this out just to clean it
out<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:53.830> now<00:03:54.130> I'm<00:03:54.220> just<00:03:54.250> going<00:03:54.459> to<00:03:54.520> throw<00:03:54.610> a

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
out and now I'm just going to throw a

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.390 
out and now I'm just going to throw a
little<00:03:54.790> bit<00:03:54.940> of<00:03:54.970> silicon<00:03:55.360> on<00:03:55.600> here<00:03:56.500> and<00:03:56.650> all

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
little bit of silicon on here and all

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.009 
little bit of silicon on here and all
over<00:03:57.550> here<00:03:57.880> just<00:03:58.180> because<00:03:58.330> I<00:03:58.480> think<00:03:58.540> silicon

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
over here just because I think silicon

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.630 
over here just because I think silicon
some<00:03:59.200> magic<00:03:59.560> that<00:03:59.709> kind<00:04:00.250> of<00:04:00.280> protects<00:04:00.610> a

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
some magic that kind of protects a

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.080 
some magic that kind of protects a
rubber<00:04:00.819> a<00:04:00.910> little<00:04:01.150> bit<00:04:02.610> next<00:04:03.610> time<00:04:03.819> you<00:04:03.940> see

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
rubber a little bit next time you see

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.870 
rubber a little bit next time you see
the<00:04:04.209> video<00:04:04.510> I<00:04:04.810> will<00:04:05.019> take<00:04:05.260> in<00:04:05.470> this<00:04:06.010> put<00:04:06.670> it<00:04:06.790> on

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
the video I will take in this put it on

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.850 
the video I will take in this put it on
the<00:04:07.030> new<00:04:07.150> spring<00:04:07.510> and<00:04:07.750> slid<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.410> new<00:04:08.560> spring

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
the new spring and slid the new spring

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.860 
the new spring and slid the new spring
up<00:04:09.069> you're<00:04:09.519> going<00:04:09.640> to<00:04:09.730> push<00:04:09.880> it<00:04:10.030> up<00:04:10.209> first<00:04:10.540> into

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
up you're going to push it up first into

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.580 
up you're going to push it up first into
the<00:04:10.989> car<00:04:11.170> then<00:04:12.209> push<00:04:13.209> that<00:04:13.390> bottom<00:04:13.569> a<00:04:13.900> arm<00:04:14.140> down

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
the car then push that bottom a arm down

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.670 
the car then push that bottom a arm down
with<00:04:15.489> your<00:04:15.640> foot<00:04:15.790> push<00:04:16.479> this<00:04:16.630> down<00:04:16.840> just<00:04:17.410> grab

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
with your foot push this down just grab

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.250 
with your foot push this down just grab
it<00:04:17.709> with<00:04:17.859> your<00:04:18.070> foot<00:04:18.190> along<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.579> edge<00:04:18.700> and

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
it with your foot along the edge and

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.599 
it with your foot along the edge and
force<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.380> new<00:04:20.500> spring<00:04:20.739> up<00:04:20.919> into<00:04:21.190> there<00:04:21.340> it

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
force the new spring up into there it

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.610 
force the new spring up into there it
can<00:04:21.850> be<00:04:22.000> a<00:04:22.060> one-person<00:04:22.540> job<00:04:22.570> it's<00:04:23.050> easier<00:04:23.410> as<00:04:23.560> a

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
can be a one-person job it's easier as a

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.590 
can be a one-person job it's easier as a
two-person<00:04:24.190> job<00:04:25.470> okay<00:04:26.470> is<00:04:26.979> what<00:04:27.160> we've<00:04:27.280> done

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
two-person job okay is what we've done

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.420 
two-person job okay is what we've done
over<00:04:28.600> here<00:04:28.960> we<00:04:29.380> put<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:29.620> new<00:04:29.800> spring<00:04:30.130> in<00:04:30.280> and

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
over here we put the new spring in and

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.740 
over here we put the new spring in and
again<00:04:30.910> it<00:04:31.030> was<00:04:31.120> just<00:04:31.270> a<00:04:31.330> matter<00:04:31.450> of<00:04:31.540> pushing

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
again it was just a matter of pushing

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.870 
again it was just a matter of pushing
this<00:04:32.020> down<00:04:32.260> with<00:04:32.560> your<00:04:32.710> foot<00:04:32.919> slide<00:04:33.729> the

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
this down with your foot slide the

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.420 
this down with your foot slide the
spring<00:04:34.120> up<00:04:34.390> and<00:04:34.780> you<00:04:35.560> see<00:04:35.710> I<00:04:35.740> put<00:04:35.919> tape<00:04:36.160> on<00:04:36.310> the

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
spring up and you see I put tape on the

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.070 
spring up and you see I put tape on the
new<00:04:36.550> spring<00:04:36.820> so<00:04:37.030> that<00:04:37.150> way<00:04:37.270> I<00:04:37.300> know<00:04:37.450> one<00:04:37.840> what's

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
new spring so that way I know one what's

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.270 
new spring so that way I know one what's
top<00:04:38.289> and<00:04:38.500> bottom<00:04:38.740> because<00:04:38.919> it<00:04:39.039> makes<00:04:39.190> a

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
top and bottom because it makes a

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.060 
top and bottom because it makes a
difference<00:04:39.610> until<00:04:40.270> it<00:04:40.390> helps<00:04:40.630> me<00:04:40.780> just<00:04:41.070> orient

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
difference until it helps me just orient

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.250 
difference until it helps me just orient
it<00:04:42.220> properly<00:04:42.580> in<00:04:42.760> there<00:04:43.000> there's<00:04:43.870> actually<00:04:44.229> a

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
it properly in there there's actually a

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.529 
it properly in there there's actually a
little<00:04:44.440> like<00:04:44.620> dip<00:04:45.580> down<00:04:45.820> for<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.240> end<00:04:46.360> of<00:04:46.450> the

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
little like dip down for the end of the

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.110 
little like dip down for the end of the
spring<00:04:46.810> goes<00:04:47.020> I've<00:04:47.950> loosened<00:04:48.280> this<00:04:48.640> because<00:04:49.030> I

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
spring goes I've loosened this because I

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.180 
spring goes I've loosened this because I
had<00:04:49.270> to<00:04:49.360> tie<00:04:49.570> it<00:04:49.630> up<00:04:49.780> that's<00:04:49.990> high<00:04:50.169> I<00:04:50.470> loosened

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
had to tie it up that's high I loosened

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.650 
had to tie it up that's high I loosened
it<00:04:51.280> you<00:04:51.610> can<00:04:51.760> see<00:04:51.940> where<00:04:52.090> the<00:04:52.180> jack<00:04:52.419> is

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
it you can see where the jack is

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.750 
it you can see where the jack is
supporting<00:04:53.470> this<00:04:53.680> I<00:04:53.890> also<00:04:54.250> have<00:04:54.430> a<00:04:54.460> jack<00:04:54.729> stand

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
supporting this I also have a jack stand

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.570 
supporting this I also have a jack stand
holding<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:55.419> body<00:04:55.600> up<00:04:55.900> so<00:04:56.169> our<00:04:56.740> next<00:04:57.130> step<00:04:57.370> is

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
holding the body up so our next step is

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.300 
holding the body up so our next step is
we're<00:04:57.910> taking<00:04:58.030> this<00:04:58.300> out<00:04:58.950> because<00:04:59.950> we're<00:05:00.160> done

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
we're taking this out because we're done

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.159 
we're taking this out because we're done
with<00:05:00.460> that<00:05:00.610> and<00:05:00.850> we're<00:05:01.690> going<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:01.840> take<00:05:01.990> this

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
with that and we're going to take this

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.180 
with that and we're going to take this
bracket<00:05:02.580> secure<00:05:03.580> it<00:05:03.789> again<00:05:04.060> and<00:05:05.039> after<00:05:06.039> that

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
bracket secure it again and after that

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.969 
bracket secure it again and after that
I'll<00:05:06.430> probably<00:05:06.640> lower<00:05:07.330> the<00:05:07.630> shock<00:05:07.960> lower<00:05:08.800> the

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
I'll probably lower the shock lower the

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.740 
I'll probably lower the shock lower the
jack<00:05:09.220> so<00:05:09.940> that<00:05:10.060> I<00:05:10.090> can<00:05:10.300> get<00:05:10.419> at<00:05:10.539> the<00:05:10.630> bottom

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
jack so that I can get at the bottom

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.120 
jack so that I can get at the bottom
shock<00:05:11.169> bolt<00:05:11.470> and<00:05:11.650> I'm<00:05:11.710> going<00:05:11.830> to<00:05:11.860> take<00:05:12.010> the

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
shock bolt and I'm going to take the

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.500 
shock bolt and I'm going to take the
shocks<00:05:12.370> off<00:05:12.580> then<00:05:12.820> or<00:05:13.030> at<00:05:13.270> least<00:05:13.390> this

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
shocks off then or at least this

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.200 
shocks off then or at least this
particular<00:05:13.840> side<00:05:14.260> after<00:05:15.010> I<00:05:15.039> get<00:05:15.160> the<00:05:15.400> bolts

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
particular side after I get the bolts

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.240 
particular side after I get the bolts
out<00:05:16.360> for<00:05:16.600> the<00:05:16.660> shock<00:05:16.900> compress<00:05:17.860> the<00:05:18.039> shock

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
out for the shock compress the shock

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.560 
out for the shock compress the shock
with<00:05:18.430> your<00:05:18.580> hand<00:05:18.729> it<00:05:18.880> makes<00:05:19.000> it<00:05:19.150> a<00:05:19.180> lot<00:05:19.300> easier

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
with your hand it makes it a lot easier

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.930 
with your hand it makes it a lot easier
to<00:05:19.960> get<00:05:20.080> it<00:05:20.229> out<00:05:20.350> so<00:05:20.740> you<00:05:20.800> can<00:05:21.039> press<00:05:21.280> it<00:05:21.460> and

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
to get it out so you can press it and

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.850 
to get it out so you can press it and
him<00:05:22.180> you<00:05:22.690> know<00:05:22.780> rush<00:05:22.990> like<00:05:23.140> a<00:05:23.229> lunatic<00:05:23.560> to<00:05:23.710> get

him you know rush like a lunatic to get

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
him you know rush like a lunatic to get
it<00:05:23.950> out<00:05:24.070> of<00:05:24.190> there<00:05:24.280> because<00:05:24.370> it's<00:05:24.580> us<00:05:24.729> to

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
it out of there because it's us to

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.270

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
way the bolt for the shock so you can

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.650 
way the bolt for the shock so you can

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
or you can find a better position to put

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.220 
or you can find a better position to put
the<00:05:54.470> jack<00:05:54.650> in<00:05:54.890> since<00:05:55.790> I<00:05:55.940> have<00:05:56.210> a<00:05:56.240> helper<00:05:56.900> and<00:05:57.080> I

the jack in since I have a helper and I

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.600 
the jack in since I have a helper and I
don't<00:05:57.590> care<00:05:57.800> how<00:05:57.920> many<00:05:57.980> times<00:05:58.130> he<00:05:58.400> has<00:05:58.520> to

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
don't care how many times he has to

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.010 
don't care how many times he has to
raise<00:05:58.760> and<00:05:58.940> lower<00:05:58.970> the<00:05:59.180> jack<00:05:59.210> I<00:05:59.600> went<00:05:59.810> with<00:05:59.930> the

raise and lower the jack method the
added<00:06:02.120> advantage<00:06:02.210> is<00:06:02.630> raising<00:06:02.960> lowering<00:06:03.260> jack

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
added advantage is raising lowering jack

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.650 
added advantage is raising lowering jack
you<00:06:04.070> can<00:06:04.280> raise<00:06:04.640> Jack<00:06:05.000> a<00:06:05.030> little<00:06:05.330> bit<00:06:05.480> and

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.660 
you can raise Jack a little bit and

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.560 
you can raise Jack a little bit and
position<00:06:06.410> the<00:06:06.820> shock<00:06:07.820> exactly<00:06:08.330> where<00:06:08.510> you

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
position the shock exactly where you

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:09.880 
position the shock exactly where you
want<00:06:08.780> it<00:06:08.870> so<00:06:09.020> it's<00:06:09.170> pointing<00:06:09.500> three<00:06:09.680> to<00:06:09.770> get

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:09.890 
want it so it's pointing three to get

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.820 
want it so it's pointing three to get
