programming well you better think on
that<00:03:48.200> ahead<00:03:48.380> of<00:03:48.590> time<00:03:48.709> and<00:03:49.190> set<00:03:49.730> aside<00:03:49.880> some

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
that ahead of time and set aside some

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.250 
that ahead of time and set aside some
time<00:03:50.390> to<00:03:51.320> do<00:03:51.500> some<00:03:51.530> positive<00:03:53.260> reprogramming

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
time to do some positive reprogramming

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.410 
time to do some positive reprogramming
to<00:03:54.709> counteract<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.519> negative<00:03:55.670> program<00:03:56.300> you

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
to counteract the negative program you

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.900 
to counteract the negative program you
might<00:03:56.570> get<00:03:56.810> so<00:03:57.440> do<00:03:57.650> that<00:03:57.830> love<00:03:58.220> them<00:03:58.550> let<00:03:58.880> them

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
might get so do that love them let them

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.120 
might get so do that love them let them
grow<00:03:59.239> and<00:03:59.600> hopefully<00:03:59.840> they<00:04:00.410> will<00:04:00.650> grow<00:04:00.950> out<00:04:01.070> of

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
grow and hopefully they will grow out of

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.930 
grow and hopefully they will grow out of
it<00:04:01.310> remember<00:04:01.880> as<00:04:02.209> you<00:04:02.690> change<00:04:03.940> everything

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
it remember as you change everything

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.449 
it remember as you change everything
changes<00:04:05.450> even<00:04:05.720> the<00:04:06.200> people<00:04:06.530> around<00:04:06.769> you<00:04:07.010> so

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
changes even the people around you so

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.280 
changes even the people around you so
the<00:04:07.580> more<00:04:07.850> you<00:04:07.970> grow<00:04:08.209> your<00:04:08.510> consciousness<00:04:09.260> the

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
the more you grow your consciousness the

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.590 
the more you grow your consciousness the
more<00:04:09.680> you<00:04:09.800> develop<00:04:09.980> I<00:04:10.400> think<00:04:10.700> you'll<00:04:11.180> see<00:04:11.390> that
