it up so that I can have a little bit

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:51.139 
it up so that I can have a little bit
more<00:01:48.600> room<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.200> my<00:01:49.259> collection<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.850> used

more room in my collection I have used
it<00:01:51.420> before<00:01:51.959> and<00:01:52.590> quite<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.889> bit<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.340> don't<00:01:53.609> know

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
it before and quite a bit I don't know

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.699

good<00:03:34.340> to<00:03:35.340> kind<00:03:35.610> of<00:03:35.930> use<00:03:36.930> up<00:03:37.170> basically<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.250> also

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
good to kind of use up basically I also

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.410 
good to kind of use up basically I also
love<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.690> bhcosmetics<00:03:41.000> automatic<00:03:42.000> eyebrow

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420

pencil<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:42.959> blonde<00:03:43.200> but<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:43.590> already<00:03:44.010> have<00:03:44.160> a

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549
