about how to improve your clean and jerk

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.269 
about how to improve your clean and jerk
which<00:00:15.900> means<00:00:16.139> improving<00:00:16.560> your<00:00:16.710> strength<00:00:17.070> and

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
which means improving your strength and

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.730 
which means improving your strength and
improving<00:00:17.699> your<00:00:17.910> repetitions<00:00:18.539> as<00:00:18.690> far<00:00:19.619> as

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
improving your repetitions as far as

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.580 
improving your repetitions as far as
endurance<00:00:20.160> wise<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:21.210> improving<00:00:22.080> your

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
endurance wise so improving your

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.429 
endurance wise so improving your
strength<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.480> endurance<00:00:24.480> as<00:00:25.170> far<00:00:25.350> as

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
strength and endurance as far as

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.670 
strength and endurance as far as
repetitions<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.490> have<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.880> be<00:00:27.650> really<00:00:28.650> aware

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
repetitions you have to be really aware

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.529 
repetitions you have to be really aware
of<00:00:29.250> your<00:00:29.429> technique<00:00:29.880> because<00:00:30.269> that's<00:00:30.449> going

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
of your technique because that's going

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.080 
of your technique because that's going
to<00:00:30.630> make<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.500> much<00:00:31.740> simpler<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.460> it's<00:00:32.850> also

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
to make it so much simpler and it's also

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.569 
to make it so much simpler and it's also
going<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.510> make<00:00:33.780> sure<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.559> reduce<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.340> risk

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
going to make sure you reduce the risk

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.090 
going to make sure you reduce the risk
of<00:00:35.730> injury<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.360> one<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.260> primary<00:00:37.559> things

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
of injury and one of the primary things

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.770 
of injury and one of the primary things
that<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.340> need<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.640> focus<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:39.090> when<00:00:39.750> you're

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
that you need to focus on when you're

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.319 
that you need to focus on when you're
training<00:00:40.200> for<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.700> keep<00:00:41.910> everything

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
training for this is to keep everything

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.889 
training for this is to keep everything
perfectly<00:00:43.140> aligned<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:45.210> technique<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.870> I

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
perfectly aligned so a technique that I

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.729 
perfectly aligned so a technique that I
like<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.379> do<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.890> make<00:00:47.789> sure<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.059> get<00:00:48.289> either<00:00:49.289> a

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
like to do is make sure you get either a

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.770 
like to do is make sure you get either a
bar<00:00:50.010> if<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.550> have<00:00:50.670> weight<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.239> or<00:00:51.360> not<00:00:51.510> or

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
bar if you have weight on it or not or

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.150 
bar if you have weight on it or not or
just<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:52.110> straight<00:00:52.289> bar<00:00:52.699> and<00:00:53.719> do<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.930> right<00:00:55.860> in

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
just a straight bar and do it right in

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.250 
just a straight bar and do it right in
front<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.670> wall<00:00:56.940> hopefully<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> brick<00:00:58.079> wall

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
front of a wall hopefully a brick wall

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.389 
front of a wall hopefully a brick wall
or<00:00:58.320> something<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.890> don't<00:00:58.920> care<00:00:59.280> about

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
or something you don't care about

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.299 
or something you don't care about
chipping<00:00:59.910> or<00:01:00.210> hitting<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:02.039> what<00:01:02.219> that's

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
chipping or hitting and so what that's

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.460 
chipping or hitting and so what that's
going<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.609> do<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:03.000> going<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.180> teach<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.750> not

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
going to do it's going to teach you not

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.609 
going to do it's going to teach you not
to<00:01:04.880> swing<00:01:05.880> out<00:01:06.180> because<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.140> takes<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.439> lot<00:01:07.560> of

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
to swing out because that takes a lot of

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.920 
to swing out because that takes a lot of
energy<00:01:07.850> when<00:01:08.850> when<00:01:09.180> when<00:01:09.479> you're<00:01:09.630> doing<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
energy when when when you're doing the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.800 
energy when when when you're doing the
movement<00:01:10.380> anytime<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.070> can<00:01:11.250> not<00:01:12.180> swing<00:01:12.600> out

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
movement anytime you can not swing out

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.990 
movement anytime you can not swing out
and<00:01:13.200> keep<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> plane<00:01:13.950> nice<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.490> even<00:01:14.790> as<00:01:14.939> far

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
and keep the plane nice and even as far

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.630 
and keep the plane nice and even as far
as<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> way<00:01:15.479> cone<00:01:15.720> nice<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.500> straight<00:01:16.890> it's

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
as the way cone nice and straight it's

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.719 
as the way cone nice and straight it's
going<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.880> be<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.330> lot<00:01:18.930> faster<00:01:19.799> as<00:01:20.250> far<00:01:20.280> as

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
going to be a lot faster as far as

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.330 
going to be a lot faster as far as
getting<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> weight<00:01:21.869> moving<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:23.100> going<00:01:23.280> to

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
getting the weight moving it's going to

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.429 
getting the weight moving it's going to
be<00:01:23.460> safer<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.509> gonna<00:01:24.600> take<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> lot<00:01:25.200> less

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
be safer and it's gonna take a lot less

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.469 
be safer and it's gonna take a lot less
energy<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.130> if<00:01:26.490> you're<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.820> front<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.210> wall

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
energy so if you're in front of a wall

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.480 
energy so if you're in front of a wall
it's<00:01:27.990> gonna<00:01:28.110> prevent<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.369> also

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
it's gonna prevent you and it's also

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.520 
it's gonna prevent you and it's also
going<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.729> show<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.030> how<00:01:30.750> much<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:30.990> hit<00:01:31.320> that

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
going to show you how much you hit that

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.499 
going to show you how much you hit that
law<00:01:31.799> shows<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.670> your<00:01:32.820> technique<00:01:33.240> isn't

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
law shows that your technique isn't

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.960 
law shows that your technique isn't
really<00:01:34.350> spot-on<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.070> if<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.640> do<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:35.939> front

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
really spot-on so if you do it in front

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.429 
really spot-on so if you do it in front
of<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.270> wall<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.570> get<00:01:36.689> kind<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:36.930> close<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.350> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
of a wall and get kind of close to the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.170 
of a wall and get kind of close to the
wall<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> better<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.400> get<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.939> closer

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
wall and the better you get the closer

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.289 
wall and the better you get the closer
to<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.509> wall<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.840> can<00:01:39.990> actually<00:01:40.380> get<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.299> let

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
to the wall you can actually get and let

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.999 
to the wall you can actually get and let
yourself<00:01:42.689> feel<00:01:42.899> feel<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> freedom<00:01:43.829> of

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
yourself feel feel the freedom of

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.010 
yourself feel feel the freedom of
hitting<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.820> wall<00:01:45.060> which<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.360> fine<00:01:45.689> and

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
hitting that wall which is fine and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.620 
hitting that wall which is fine and
letting<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.409> ride<00:01:46.740> up<00:01:46.950> along<00:01:47.310> there<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.360> if

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
letting it ride up along there and so if

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.819 
letting it ride up along there and so if
you<00:01:48.840> get<00:01:48.960> against<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.350> wall

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
you get against the wall

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.740 
you get against the wall
or<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.610> can<00:01:50.729> use<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> smith<00:01:51.270> machine<00:01:51.299> there's

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
or you can use a smith machine there's

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.120 
or you can use a smith machine there's
another<00:01:51.960> good<00:01:52.200> training<00:01:52.560> technique<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.100> I

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
another good training technique that I

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.889 
another good training technique that I
use<00:01:53.430> because<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.970> on<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.149> track<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.780> it'll

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
use because it's on a track and it'll

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.780 
use because it's on a track and it'll
keep<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.200> perfectly<00:01:55.649> straight<00:01:56.430> up<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.759> down

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
keep you perfectly straight up and down

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.310 
keep you perfectly straight up and down
and<00:01:57.060> it'll<00:01:57.180> train<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.869> keep<00:01:58.079> that

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
and it'll train you to keep that

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.410 
and it'll train you to keep that
straight<00:01:58.829> up<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.159> down<00:01:59.310> which<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.850> know<00:02:00.240> like

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
straight up and down which you know like

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.160 
straight up and down which you know like
I<00:02:00.540> said<00:02:00.619> minimizes<00:02:01.969> looping<00:02:02.969> out<00:02:03.119> like<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:03.960> lot

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
I said minimizes looping out like a lot

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.050 
I said minimizes looping out like a lot
of<00:02:04.200> people<00:02:04.350> tend<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.799> do<00:02:04.979> they<00:02:05.189> like<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.490> loop

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
of people tend to do they like to loop

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.919 
of people tend to do they like to loop
out<00:02:06.299> on<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:07.649> movement<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.720> it's<00:02:09.720> gonna

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
out on the movement and it's gonna

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.470 
out on the movement and it's gonna
create<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.319> lot<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.830> lot<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.459> energy<00:02:11.849> wasted

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
create a lot of a lot of energy wasted

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.300 
create a lot of a lot of energy wasted
and<00:02:12.800> also<00:02:13.800> risk

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
and also risk

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.040 
and also risk
especially<00:02:15.030> when<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.270> get<00:02:15.390> tired<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:15.870> make

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
especially when you get tired and make

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.930 
especially when you get tired and make
sure<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.319> don't<00:02:16.620> train<00:02:16.920> doing<00:02:17.849> the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
sure you don't train doing the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.250 
sure you don't train doing the
clean-and-jerk<00:02:18.150> when<00:02:18.569> you're<00:02:18.690> tired<00:02:18.930> because

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
clean-and-jerk when you're tired because

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.860 
clean-and-jerk when you're tired because
you're<00:02:19.620> gonna<00:02:19.849> start<00:02:20.849> instilling<00:02:21.480> bad

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
you're gonna start instilling bad

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.870 
you're gonna start instilling bad
technique<00:02:22.500> into<00:02:23.069> your<00:02:23.190> brain<00:02:23.400> because<00:02:23.730> your

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
technique into your brain because your

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.150 
technique into your brain because your
brain<00:02:24.090> has<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.599> muscle<00:02:24.959> brain<00:02:25.620> connection

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
brain has that muscle brain connection

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.940 
brain has that muscle brain connection
the<00:02:26.640> memory<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.319> repetition<00:02:28.319> doing<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.680> over

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
the memory of repetition doing it over

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.710 
the memory of repetition doing it over
and<00:02:29.130> over<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.370> over<00:02:29.520> so<00:02:29.730> if<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.120> can<00:02:30.390> make

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
and over and over so if you can make

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.630 
and over and over so if you can make
sure<00:02:30.750> you're<00:02:30.989> doing<00:02:31.080> when<00:02:31.349> you're<00:02:31.470> fresh<00:02:31.769> okay

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
sure you're doing when you're fresh okay

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.699 
sure you're doing when you're fresh okay
so<00:02:33.180> make<00:02:33.599> sure<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.810> do<00:02:33.900> what<00:02:33.989> we<00:02:34.050> do<00:02:34.170> fresh<00:02:34.440> and

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
so make sure you do what we do fresh and

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.259 
so make sure you do what we do fresh and
make<00:02:34.890> sure<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.130> keep<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.430> straight<00:02:35.670> alignment

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
make sure you keep it straight alignment

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.600 
make sure you keep it straight alignment
and<00:02:36.420> also<00:02:36.989> it's<00:02:37.230> three<00:02:37.560> components<00:02:38.190> it's

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
and also it's three components it's

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.000 
and also it's three components it's
basically<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.269> slight<00:02:39.750> deadlift<00:02:40.380> with<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.560> squat

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
basically a slight deadlift with a squat

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.570 
basically a slight deadlift with a squat
with<00:02:41.569> both<00:02:42.569> arms<00:02:42.930> both<00:02:43.560> hands<00:02:43.950> straight<00:02:44.430> on

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
with both arms both hands straight on

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.250 
with both arms both hands straight on
the<00:02:44.670> bar<00:02:44.849> shoulder-width<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.630> you're<00:02:46.050> going

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
the bar shoulder-width and you're going

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.320 
the bar shoulder-width and you're going
straight<00:02:46.530> up<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.100> then<00:02:47.700> you're<00:02:47.850> doing<00:02:48.000> a

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
straight up and then you're doing a

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.930 
straight up and then you're doing a
squat<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.959> power<00:02:49.170> squat<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.890> you're<00:02:50.459> thrusting

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
squat a power squat and you're thrusting

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.360 
squat a power squat and you're thrusting
up<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.330> your<00:02:51.540> shoulder<00:02:52.049> and<00:02:52.260> then<00:02:53.040> all<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.190> a

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
up to your shoulder and then all of a

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.729 
up to your shoulder and then all of a
sudden<00:02:53.730> you're<00:02:54.150> doing<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.540> shoulder<00:02:54.810> press<00:02:55.350> and

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
sudden you're doing a shoulder press and

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.309 
sudden you're doing a shoulder press and
at<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.340> top<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:56.819> switch<00:02:57.180> your<00:02:57.660> foot<00:02:57.900> position

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
at the top you switch your foot position

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.740 
at the top you switch your foot position
so<00:02:58.739> you<00:02:58.799> want<00:02:59.099> to<00:02:59.190> practice<00:02:59.370> that<00:02:59.760> with<00:03:00.150> really

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
so you want to practice that with really

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.600 
so you want to practice that with really
light<00:03:00.989> weight<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.500> good<00:03:01.769> technique<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.519> you

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
light weight and good technique and you

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.240 
light weight and good technique and you
do<00:03:02.730> over<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.420> over<00:03:03.690> again<00:03:04.049> and<00:03:04.590> what<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.040> can

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
do over and over again and what you can

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.720 
do over and over again and what you can
do<00:03:05.430> is<00:03:06.019> do<00:03:07.019> them<00:03:07.140> together<00:03:07.410> with<00:03:08.250> very<00:03:08.489> light

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
do is do them together with very light

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.820 
do is do them together with very light
weight<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.209> do<00:03:09.690> them<00:03:09.780> separately<00:03:10.110> all<00:03:10.470> those

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
weight and do them separately all those

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.370 
weight and do them separately all those
three<00:03:11.069> components<00:03:11.360> with<00:03:12.360> heavier<00:03:12.900> weight<00:03:13.170> and

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
three components with heavier weight and

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.449 
three components with heavier weight and
you're<00:03:13.590> going<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:13.799> find<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.190> you're<00:03:14.340> going

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
you're going to find that you're going

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.420 
you're going to find that you're going
to<00:03:14.549> increase<00:03:15.030> your<00:03:15.269> repetition<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.430> you're

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
to increase your repetition and you're

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.940 
to increase your repetition and you're
