it's how you're going to get the armor
by<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.190> way<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.460> can't<00:03:17.820> actually<00:03:18.060> craft<00:03:18.690> it

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
by the way you can't actually craft it

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.449 
by the way you can't actually craft it
but<00:03:19.320> you<00:03:19.410> can<00:03:19.530> get<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.770> and<00:03:19.890> you<00:03:19.950> can<00:03:20.100> prepare

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.450 
if you're sitting there helping them I
mean<00:04:51.260> you're<00:04:51.440> going<00:04:51.620> to<00:04:51.800> just<00:04:51.950> like<00:04:52.160> kill

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
mean you're going to just like kill

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.580 
mean you're going to just like kill
things<00:04:52.700> so<00:04:52.970> easily<00:04:53.180> look<00:04:53.690> cool<00:04:53.930> it's<00:04:54.230> not<00:04:54.410> you

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
things so easily look cool it's not you

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:55.990

can't<00:04:54.800> even<00:04:54.920> hit<00:04:55.070> them<00:04:55.310> so<00:04:55.490> if<00:04:55.580> they<00:04:55.700> get<00:04:55.880> in

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
can't even hit them so if they get in

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.040 
can't even hit them so if they get in
front<00:04:56.180> of<00:04:56.270> your<00:04:56.330> face<00:04:56.390> you<00:04:56.810> can't

accidentally like deliverables them

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.680 
accidentally like deliverables them
which<00:04:59.000> I<00:04:59.090> think<00:04:59.270> that's<00:04:59.390> really<00:04:59.570> awesome

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
which I think that's really awesome

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.020 
which I think that's really awesome
because<00:04:59.990> you<00:05:00.290> know<00:05:00.410> friendly<00:05:01.250> fires<00:05:01.490> pretty

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
because you know friendly fires pretty

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
because you know friendly fires pretty
much<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:02.300> worst<00:05:02.420> thing<00:05:02.720> that<00:05:02.840> could

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
much the worst thing that could

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.860 
much the worst thing that could
basically<00:05:03.410> happen<00:05:04.070> so<00:05:04.730> yeah<00:05:04.940> this<00:05:05.210> is<00:05:05.480> the<00:05:05.720> IRA

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
basically happen so yeah this is the IRA

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.410 
basically happen so yeah this is the IRA

invaded<00:05:38.750> with<00:05:38.840> the<00:05:38.990> store<00:05:39.110> actually<00:05:39.260> hit

really really hard they I think they do

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.070 
really really hard they I think they do
more<00:05:41.990> damage<00:05:42.230> than<00:05:42.620> the<00:05:42.860> actual<00:05:43.070> defenders

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
more damage than the actual defenders

good lead generation and a lot more help

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.070 
good lead generation and a lot more help
the<00:05:49.310> invaders<00:05:49.700> only<00:05:50.000> have<00:05:50.180> 20<00:05:50.540> out<00:05:50.690> and<00:05:50.930> not

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
the invaders only have 20 out and not

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.930 
the invaders only have 20 out and not
for<00:05:51.290> that<00:05:51.440> the<00:05:52.130> invaders<00:05:52.490> would<00:05:52.610> actually

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
for that the invaders would actually

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.120 
for that the invaders would actually
probably<00:05:53.120> kill<00:05:53.600> the<00:05:53.720> defenders<00:05:54.230> but<00:05:54.470> it's

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
probably kill the defenders but it's

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.470 
probably kill the defenders but it's
basically<00:05:55.400> what<00:05:55.580> the<00:05:55.640> defender<00:05:56.000> does<00:05:56.150> i<00:05:56.300> just

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
basically what the defender does i just

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.720
