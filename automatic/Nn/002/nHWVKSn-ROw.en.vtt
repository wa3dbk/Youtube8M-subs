00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
player but we have also new features

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.890 
player but we have also new features
it's<00:02:14.260> like<00:02:14.580> safety<00:02:15.580> maximum<00:02:16.270> so<00:02:16.480> like<00:02:16.600> auntie

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
it's like safety maximum so like auntie

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.600 
it's like safety maximum so like auntie
crashes<00:02:17.320> then<00:02:17.530> we<00:02:17.740> have<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:18.130> system<00:02:18.370> which

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
crashes then we have a system which

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.090 
crashes then we have a system which

you'll<00:02:28.659> be<00:02:28.720> able<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:29.140> get<00:02:29.379> behind<00:02:29.650> your<00:02:29.739> target

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
you'll be able to get behind your target

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.640 
you'll be able to get behind your target
and<00:02:30.129> destroy<00:02:30.400> it

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650

to<00:02:35.780> dodge<00:02:35.959> a<00:02:36.079> missile<00:02:36.379> and<00:02:36.560> finally<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:36.980> can

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
to dodge a missile and finally you can

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.280
