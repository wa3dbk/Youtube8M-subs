 solo fragments for example in rock music 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:42.219

 and in blues and in jazz and you can play 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:54.749
 and improvise something in this 

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:54.749
 year and 

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:04.419

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:07.689
 exercise that will help you not only 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:09.310
 develop your playing technique but you 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:12.699
 can use it as a musical 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:24.930
 phrase in improvisation and so we start 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:27.860
 play from note to 8 varnish then note la 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:31.969
 first string 5 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:35.479
 salt on the second string 8 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:38.499
 then we go back one step to 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:38.499
 that step back 

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:51.879
 every time some tunic each with 

00:06:47.299 --> 00:07:00.009
 return and so share solo 

00:06:51.879 --> 00:07:00.009
 then salt and salt this is our 8 5 8 fret 

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:05.049
 then solo to me 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.040
 in this way and also 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:31.270
 enter the attention that the first finger i am not 

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:31.270
 raise 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:41.919
 I don't need extra movement while I play a note 

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:55.050
 do raise then when you will 

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:59.050
 accelerate the pace so we have considered 

00:07:55.050 --> 00:08:02.740
