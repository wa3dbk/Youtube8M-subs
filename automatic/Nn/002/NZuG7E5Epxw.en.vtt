being<00:00:27.330> driven<00:00:27.480> out<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.869> display<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:29.960> now

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
being driven out to the display so now

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.659 
being driven out to the display so now
you<00:00:31.019> get<00:00:31.140> things<00:00:31.380> started<00:00:31.619> just<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.460> give<00:00:32.610> you

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
you get things started just to give you

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.610 
you get things started just to give you
a<00:00:32.730> sense<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.059> what<00:00:33.270> baton<00:00:33.960> with<00:00:34.079> Thunderbolt

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
a sense of what baton with Thunderbolt

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.440 
a sense of what baton with Thunderbolt
can<00:00:34.829> actually<00:00:35.160> provide<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:36.030> consumers

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
can actually provide to the consumers

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.270 
can actually provide to the consumers
we're<00:00:36.989> going<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.200> copy<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.590> file<00:00:37.890> that's

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
we're going to copy a file that's

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.650 
we're going to copy a file that's
actually<00:00:38.579> sitting<00:00:38.790> out<00:00:38.969> here<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.450> array

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
actually sitting out here on the array

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.869 
actually sitting out here on the array
and<00:00:40.110> just<00:00:40.260> duplicate<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.890> fun<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.579> in<00:00:41.700> doing

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
and just duplicate that fun and in doing

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.209 
and just duplicate that fun and in doing
so<00:00:41.969> you'll<00:00:42.270> see<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.570> traffic<00:00:42.840> speed<00:00:43.710> back<00:00:44.010> and

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
so you'll see the traffic speed back and

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.029 
so you'll see the traffic speed back and
forth<00:00:44.460> between<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:45.000> over<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> link<00:00:45.539> itself

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
forth between the over the link itself

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.340 
forth between the over the link itself
that'll<00:00:47.039> be<00:00:47.100> shown<00:00:47.129> here<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.700> speedometer

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.930 

so<00:00:52.350> what<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.860> see<00:00:53.070> here<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.370> phenomena

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
so what you see here is phenomena

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.130 
so what you see here is phenomena
hitting<00:00:54.719> 700<00:00:55.760> 750<00:00:56.760> pushing<00:00:57.690> eight<00:00:57.870> hundred

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
hitting 700 750 pushing eight hundred

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.799 
hitting 700 750 pushing eight hundred
megabytes<00:00:58.559> per<00:00:58.770> second<00:00:59.160> other<00:01:00.059> technologies

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
megabytes per second other technologies

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.229 
megabytes per second other technologies
we<00:01:01.680> stop<00:01:01.890> somewhere<00:01:02.070> around<00:01:02.340> 100<00:01:02.850> megabytes

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
we stop somewhere around 100 megabytes

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.390 
we stop somewhere around 100 megabytes
per<00:01:03.449> second<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.470> what<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.739> can<00:01:04.830> see<00:01:05.040> here<00:01:05.070> is

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
per second so what you can see here is

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.070 
per second so what you can see here is
four<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.970> half<00:01:06.030> gigabyte<00:01:06.510> file<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.930> now

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
four and a half gigabyte file is now

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.080 
four and a half gigabyte file is now
done<00:01:07.380> we've<00:01:07.740> already<00:01:07.890> duplicated<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.640> which

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
done we've already duplicated it which

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.580 
done we've already duplicated it which
means<00:01:09.240> copying<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.930> back<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.290> writing<00:01:10.500> it

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
means copying it back and writing it

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.980 
means copying it back and writing it
back<00:01:10.710> out<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.040> disk<00:01:11.250> again<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.330> pretty

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
back out to the disk again so pretty

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.050 
back out to the disk again so pretty
with<00:01:13.170> your<00:01:13.200> speed<00:01:13.530> already<00:01:13.680> for<00:01:14.549> one<00:01:14.729> example

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
with your speed already for one example

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.230 
with your speed already for one example
now<00:01:15.960> put<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.860> some<00:01:16.979> context<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.759> why

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
now put this in some context of why

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.120 
now put this in some context of why
using<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:18.960> speed<00:01:19.229> might<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.530> useful

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.969 

I'll<00:01:25.130> pull<00:01:25.280> a<00:01:25.310> Final<00:01:25.700> Cut<00:01:25.880> Pro<00:01:26.590> project<00:01:27.590> file

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
I'll pull a Final Cut Pro project file

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.370 
I'll pull a Final Cut Pro project file
we're<00:01:28.399> actually<00:01:28.520> stitching<00:01:29.060> together<00:01:29.380> four

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
we're actually stitching together four

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.380 
we're actually stitching together four
different<00:01:30.829> video<00:01:31.219> files<00:01:31.549> if<00:01:31.789> you<00:01:31.880> very<00:01:32.240> much

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
different video files if you very much

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.709 
different video files if you very much
so<00:01:32.810> what<00:01:33.500> you're<00:01:33.649> going<00:01:33.770> to<00:01:33.860> see<00:01:34.630> him<00:01:35.630> actually

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719 
so what you're going to see him actually

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:38.709 
so what you're going to see him actually
pulling<00:01:36.170> video<00:01:36.409> files<00:01:36.799> from<00:01:37.159> the<00:01:38.149> array<00:01:38.329> over

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
pulling video files from the array over

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:40.539 
pulling video files from the array over
the<00:01:38.810> Thunderbolt<00:01:39.259> cable<00:01:39.469> UI<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.340> then<00:01:40.429> I'm

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
the Thunderbolt cable UI and then I'm

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.639 
the Thunderbolt cable UI and then I'm
actually<00:01:40.700> displaying<00:01:41.539> them<00:01:41.899> back<00:01:42.229> over<00:01:42.560> the

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
actually displaying them back over the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:43.990 
actually displaying them back over the
Thunderbolt<00:01:43.069> cable<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:43.610> over<00:01:43.880> the
