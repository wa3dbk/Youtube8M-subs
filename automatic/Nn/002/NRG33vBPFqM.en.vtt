 style and black salts and ingredients 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.389
 what we are going to need are the following 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.969
 250 grams of wheat flour in my case 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.029
 of force 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.730
 75 milliliters of olive oil 75 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.900
 milliliters of water 2 tablespoons 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.289
 of sugar 2 tablespoons of sugar 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.420
 Brown 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:33.820
 a tablespoon of aniseed grain 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.720
 a tablespoon of sesame 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:41.110
 half a teaspoon of cinnamon powder 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:45.380
 a heaped teaspoon of dry yeast 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:48.320
 or if it is fresh 9 grams 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:52.829
 a quarter teaspoon of salt 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:57.899
 a tablespoon of anise liqueur 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.699
 and for decoration oil and sugar what 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.920
 first thing we're going to do is put the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.839
 oil in a pan over a high heat and 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.750
 we'll wait until it's hot once 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:11.310
 that is the hot oil we throw the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.439
 aniseed in grain and it separates and we will wait 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.049
 to cool down now let's mix 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.270
 the dry ingredients we have put in 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:24.590
 a bowl the flour 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.590
 we will throw the sugar the brown sugar 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.460
 cinnamon 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.130
 the yeast 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.150
 the salt 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.299
 and sesame will mix everything well 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.990
 once we have all the 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:50.990
 well mixed dry ingredients and the 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.190
 oil with the ali has cooled what 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.190
 we will mix everything well 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.810
 and we will also add water 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.140
 and the anise 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.819
 and we mix everything very well 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.010
 and now we will finish kneading it with 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.099
 hands or with the jacket with what 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.640
 we want but it's very easy to knead it 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.640
 hands 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.200
 once it is well kneaded 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:29.550
 we will be very useful 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.550
 above 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:36.010
 and we will leave it at room temperature 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.440
 until doubled its size has passed a 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.360
 hour and we see how the mass has increased 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.980
 its size and we have put the oven to 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.860
 preheat with heat above and by 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.720
 down to 220 degrees and now we're going to 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.590
 knead the dough again to 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.590
 disqualify her 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.090
 once we have gasified the 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.950
 we will put dough in a baking tray 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.530
 a vegetal paper so that we do not get 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.950
 paste the cakes and now let's make 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.910
 the cakes for this we will take a 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:13.620
 piece of dough more or less than about 345 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.790
 to 50 grams and with the help of hands 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.540
 the network where we will do 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.540
 A) Yes 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:27.690
 and now with a roller we will extend the 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.590
 mass so that it becomes more finite like this 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.590
 redondita 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:40.980
 and we have it ready to put it 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.910
 in the vegetable paper with the help of 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.550
 we catch hands 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.550
 and we round them the edges 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.620
 and so we will do with the following 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.490
 once we have made the cake that 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.820
 they fit us in the tray we will put the 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:03.730
 sugar on top well we miss the 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:07.570
 sugar and crush it with your hands or 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:11.220
 putting oil with a brush and then 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.220
 putting the sugar on top 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.380
 blue 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.710
 once we have put the sugar 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.260
 We're going to put the cake in the oven 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:32.030
 with heat above and below 220 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.030
 degrees with turbofan 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.280
 we must be very careful not to 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.180
 burn us meanwhile we will do the 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.180
 rest of the pancakes 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.110
 six minutes have passed this cake 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.380
 is ready and we are going to take it out they have 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:58.780
 eggs 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.780
 we will only add sugar to these 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.180
 and so now only with the sugar and 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.860
 now we are going to spend the 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.470
 ingredients that we have used have not 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.870
