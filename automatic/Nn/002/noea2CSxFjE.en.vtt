well<00:00:06.669> um<00:00:07.029> well<00:00:07.990> here's<00:00:08.140> an<00:00:08.260> example<00:00:12.690> this<00:00:13.690> is

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:13.929 
well um well here's an example this is

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.310 
well um well here's an example this is
this<00:00:14.349> is<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:16.330> guitar<00:00:16.480> on<00:00:16.810> the<00:00:16.900> sound<00:00:17.140> that<00:00:17.260> I

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
this is the guitar on the sound that I

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.390 
this is the guitar on the sound that I
would<00:00:17.470> use<00:00:17.619> for<00:00:17.650> where<00:00:17.890> the<00:00:17.980> streets<00:00:18.220> have<00:00:18.310> no

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
would use for where the streets have no

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.529 
would use for where the streets have no
name<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.740> this<00:00:21.369> is<00:00:21.580> this<00:00:21.820> is<00:00:21.880> basically<00:00:22.300> what

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:22.539 
name so this is this is basically what

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:30.330 
name so this is this is basically what
I'm<00:00:22.689> playing<00:00:28.019> simple<00:00:29.019> part<00:00:29.230> but<00:00:29.949> when<00:00:30.099> I<00:00:30.130> add

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
I'm playing simple part but when I add

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:38.330 
I'm playing simple part but when I add
the<00:00:30.519> air<00:00:30.609> codes<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:37.600> that's<00:00:37.780> all<00:00:37.960> about

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
the air codes so that's all about

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.640 
the air codes so that's all about
knowing<00:00:39.390> how<00:00:40.390> to<00:00:40.420> get<00:00:40.840> that<00:00:41.080> sound<00:00:41.290> out<00:00:41.500> of<00:00:41.530> the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
knowing how to get that sound out of the

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.200 
knowing how to get that sound out of the
echo<00:00:41.770> because<00:00:42.070> if<00:00:42.190> I<00:00:42.340> you<00:00:42.400> know<00:00:42.700> if<00:00:42.910> I'm<00:00:43.090> not

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
echo because if I you know if I'm not

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.180 
echo because if I you know if I'm not
playing<00:00:43.540> the<00:00:44.260> right<00:00:44.410> tempo<00:00:44.770> wherever<00:00:45.010> you<00:00:45.070> get

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
playing the right tempo wherever you get

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.120 
playing the right tempo wherever you get
a<00:00:45.220> totally<00:00:45.640> different<00:00:45.700> result<00:00:46.030> so<00:00:46.480> it's<00:00:47.130> the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
a totally different result so it's the

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.240 
a totally different result so it's the
to<00:00:48.400> work<00:00:49.270> off<00:00:49.540> each<00:00:49.720> other<00:00:49.960> totally<00:00:50.380> and<00:00:50.800> and

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
to work off each other totally and and

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.700 
to work off each other totally and and
it's<00:00:51.550> it's<00:00:51.910> you<00:00:52.780> know<00:00:52.900> it's<00:00:53.020> something<00:00:53.080> I

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
it's it's you know it's something I

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.910 
it's it's you know it's something I
figured<00:00:54.340> out<00:00:54.460> quite<00:00:54.700> early<00:00:54.850> on<00:00:55.000> you<00:00:55.600> know

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
figured out quite early on you know

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.110 
figured out quite early on you know
playing<00:00:56.920> rhythmically<00:00:57.310> with<00:00:57.610> echo<00:00:58.650> gives<00:00:59.650> you

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
playing rhythmically with echo gives you

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.650 
playing rhythmically with echo gives you
the<00:01:01.380> opportunity<00:01:02.380> to<00:01:02.760> almost<00:01:03.760> like<00:01:03.970> be

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
the opportunity to almost like be

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.930 
the opportunity to almost like be
playing<00:01:04.930> off<00:01:05.050> a<00:01:05.080> second<00:01:05.610> musician<00:01:06.610> you<00:01:06.910> know

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
playing off a second musician you know

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.660 
playing off a second musician you know
it's<00:01:07.210> almost<00:01:07.480> like<00:01:07.690> a<00:01:07.720> kind<00:01:08.080> of<00:01:08.170> a

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
it's almost like a kind of a

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.430 
it's almost like a kind of a
conversation<00:01:09.670> but<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.810> conversation<00:01:10.840> in

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
conversation but the conversation in

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.130 
conversation but the conversation in
this<00:01:11.560> case<00:01:11.770> is<00:01:11.920> between<00:01:12.280> me<00:01:12.460> and<00:01:12.490> and<00:01:12.940> and<00:01:13.390> the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
this case is between me and and and the

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.450 
this case is between me and and and the
echo<00:01:15.300> so<00:01:16.300> that's<00:01:16.510> so<00:01:17.260> this<00:01:17.500> this<00:01:17.770> sound<00:01:18.100> gave

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
echo so that's so this this sound gave

00:01:18.460 --> 00:02:09.880 
echo so that's so this this sound gave
me<00:01:18.670> like

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.670 

not<00:02:10.890> all<00:02:11.070> came<00:02:11.310> out<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:12.810> know<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.260> the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
not all came out of you know the the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.100 
not all came out of you know the the
right<00:02:13.860> echo<00:02:14.160> setting<00:02:14.490> for<00:02:14.760> for<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.450> song<00:02:15.900> if

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
right echo setting for for that song if

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.480 
right echo setting for for that song if
I<00:02:16.230> that's<00:02:16.440> how<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.710> song<00:02:16.950> started<00:02:17.370> was

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
I that's how the song started was

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.370 
I that's how the song started was
through<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.240> guitar<00:02:18.570> part<00:02:18.870> in<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.170> yet<00:02:20.160> code
