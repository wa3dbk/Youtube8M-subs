00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.850 

I<00:00:00.120> mean<00:00:00.599> that<00:00:00.719> doesn't<00:00:00.870> mean<00:00:01.110> anything<00:00:01.199> to<00:00:01.800> us

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
I mean that doesn't mean anything to us

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.220 
I mean that doesn't mean anything to us
I<00:00:02.399> think<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.090> fact<00:00:03.270> that<00:00:03.419> we<00:00:03.570> finally<00:00:03.959> pulled

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
I think the fact that we finally pulled

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.590 
I think the fact that we finally pulled
out<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:04.770> big<00:00:05.279> win<00:00:05.460> my<00:00:05.609> case<00:00:05.670> we<00:00:06.000> needed<00:00:06.390> this

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
out a big win my case we needed this

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.770 
out a big win my case we needed this
it's<00:00:07.170> about<00:00:07.259> time<00:00:07.560> it<00:00:07.710> happened<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.690> you<00:00:09.690> know

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
it's about time it happened to you know

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.419 
it's about time it happened to you know
you<00:00:09.840> know<00:00:10.050> last<00:00:10.230> year<00:00:10.410> was<00:00:10.800> rough<00:00:11.010> with<00:00:11.070> some

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
you know last year was rough with some

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.830 
you know last year was rough with some
games<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:11.790> didn't<00:00:12.360> go<00:00:12.450> our<00:00:12.540> way<00:00:12.570> in<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.809> end

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
games that didn't go our way in the end

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.620 
games that didn't go our way in the end
and<00:00:13.400> you<00:00:14.400> know<00:00:14.490> this<00:00:14.670> year<00:00:14.910> we<00:00:15.030> had<00:00:15.389> a

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
and you know this year we had a

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.050 
and you know this year we had a
heartbreaker<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.260> Stanford<00:00:17.010> but<00:00:17.220> but<00:00:17.789> we've

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
heartbreaker to Stanford but but we've

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.060 
heartbreaker to Stanford but but we've
always<00:00:18.210> seemed<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.539> kind<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.840> pull<00:00:19.050> out<00:00:19.230> some

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
always seemed to kind of pull out some

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.500 
always seemed to kind of pull out some
big<00:00:20.250> wins<00:00:20.400> but<00:00:20.609> but<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:20.939> think<00:00:21.180> this<00:00:21.330> was<00:00:21.480> a

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
big wins but but I think this was a

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.140 
big wins but but I think this was a
defining<00:00:21.840> game<00:00:22.170> pros<00:00:22.550> where<00:00:23.550> we<00:00:23.699> kind<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:23.970> set

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
defining game pros where we kind of set

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.330 
defining game pros where we kind of set
ourselves<00:00:24.269> apart<00:00:24.680> on<00:00:25.680> both<00:00:25.890> sides<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
ourselves apart on both sides of the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.740 
ourselves apart on both sides of the
ball<00:00:26.519> but<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.730> can't<00:00:26.910> really<00:00:26.970> single<00:00:27.269> out<00:00:27.449> one

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
ball but you can't really single out one

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.849 
ball but you can't really single out one
player<00:00:28.650> but<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.519> specialties<00:00:30.859> defense
