people who don't want it there is a

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.110 
people who don't want it there is a
chance<00:02:10.899> they<00:02:11.140> will<00:02:11.409> get<00:02:11.860> banned<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.549> that's

chance they will get banned and that's

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.940 
chance they will get banned and that's
totally<00:02:13.689> not<00:02:13.959> their<00:02:14.169> fault<00:02:14.439> at<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.709> end<00:02:14.859> up

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
totally not their fault at the end up

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.200 
totally not their fault at the end up
getting<00:02:15.189> banned<00:02:15.400> that

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
getting banned that

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.670 
getting banned that
got<00:02:16.330> nothing<00:02:16.600> to<00:02:16.720> do<00:02:16.810> with<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.050> then<00:02:17.440> they

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
got nothing to do with you then they

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.770 
got nothing to do with you then they
didn't<00:02:18.040> want<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.400> money<00:02:18.550> at<00:02:18.760> all<00:02:18.970> so<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:19.480> think

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
didn't want the money at all so I think

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.570 
didn't want the money at all so I think
that's<00:02:20.140> wrong<00:02:20.320> going<00:02:20.620> into<00:02:20.800> a<00:02:20.830> public<00:02:21.250> session

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
that's wrong going into a public session

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.920 
that's wrong going into a public session
and<00:02:21.700> giving<00:02:21.940> money<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.180> everyone<00:02:22.570> who<00:02:22.720> doesn't

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
and giving money to everyone who doesn't

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.480 
and giving money to everyone who doesn't
want<00:02:23.200> it<00:02:23.380> but<00:02:23.410> like<00:02:23.740> I<00:02:23.770> said<00:02:24.010> if<00:02:24.130> you<00:02:24.160> want<00:02:24.370> it

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
want it but like I said if you want it

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.250 
want it but like I said if you want it
for<00:02:24.520> yourself<00:02:24.640> for<00:02:25.030> people<00:02:25.330> who<00:02:25.780> wanted<00:02:26.200> to

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
for yourself for people who wanted to

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.020 
for yourself for people who wanted to
give<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.770> him<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:27.010> really<00:02:27.430> don't<00:02:27.550> care<00:02:27.700> it's

give it to him I really don't care it's
totally<00:02:28.360> up<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.600> do<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:28.900> think<00:02:28.990> this<00:02:29.470> will

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
totally up to you do I think this will

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.540 
totally up to you do I think this will
affect<00:02:30.100> GTA<00:02:30.970> 5<00:02:31.330> online<00:02:31.660> I<00:02:32.230> kind<00:02:32.890> of<00:02:33.010> do<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:33.430> I

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
affect GTA 5 online I kind of do and I

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.460 
affect GTA 5 online I kind of do and I
kind<00:02:33.910> of<00:02:34.090> them<00:02:34.240> to<00:02:34.420> think<00:02:34.570> big<00:02:34.840> money<00:02:35.110> lobbies

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
kind of them to think big money lobbies

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.800 
kind of them to think big money lobbies
like<00:02:35.650> this<00:02:35.860> big<00:02:36.130> mods<00:02:36.400> can<00:02:37.030> actually<00:02:37.510> affect

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
like this big mods can actually affect

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.200 
like this big mods can actually affect
DLC<00:02:38.470> whereas<00:02:38.860> good<00:02:39.070> cheese<00:02:39.370> money<00:02:39.610> glitches<00:02:39.880> I

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
DLC whereas good cheese money glitches I

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.600 
DLC whereas good cheese money glitches I
really<00:02:40.990> don't<00:02:41.140> think<00:02:41.290> they<00:02:41.590> can<00:02:41.860> they<00:02:42.070> come<00:02:42.460> up

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
really don't think they can they come up

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.610 
really don't think they can they come up
with<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.760> new<00:02:43.000> patch<00:02:43.300> every<00:02:43.990> time<00:02:44.170> they<00:02:44.350> release

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
with a new patch every time they release

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.470 
with a new patch every time they release
a<00:02:44.800> DLC<00:02:45.370> anyway<00:02:45.730> although<00:02:45.970> I<00:02:46.090> do<00:02:46.240> think

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
a DLC anyway although I do think

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.810 
a DLC anyway although I do think
possibly<00:02:47.320> these<00:02:47.860> money<00:02:48.160> lobbies<00:02:48.490> because

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
possibly these money lobbies because

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.610 
possibly these money lobbies because
they<00:02:48.970> are<00:02:49.150> so<00:02:49.450> big<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:49.870> quite<00:02:50.110> difficult<00:02:50.350> to

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
they are so big and quite difficult to

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.590 
they are so big and quite difficult to
get<00:02:50.800> rid<00:02:51.040> of<00:02:51.070> and<00:02:51.430> they're<00:02:51.940> like<00:02:52.120> I<00:02:52.150> said<00:02:52.420> it<00:02:52.540> is

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
get rid of and they're like I said it is

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.630 
get rid of and they're like I said it is
such<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:53.110> big<00:02:53.320> problem<00:02:53.620> if<00:02:53.980> you're<00:02:54.280> given<00:02:54.580> you

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
such a big problem if you're given you

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.370 
such a big problem if you're given you
two<00:02:54.790> other<00:02:55.000> players<00:02:55.300> and<00:02:55.690> they're<00:02:56.110> getting

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
two other players and they're getting

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.370 
two other players and they're getting
banned<00:02:56.800> it's<00:02:57.040> not<00:02:57.250> their<00:02:57.400> fault<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:58.380> possibly

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
banned it's not their fault and possibly

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.590 
banned it's not their fault and possibly
this<00:02:59.650> could<00:02:59.710> be<00:03:00.100> delaying<00:03:00.460> the<00:03:00.670> DLC<00:03:01.210> so<00:03:01.390> I'm

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
this could be delaying the DLC so I'm

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.000 
this could be delaying the DLC so I'm
not<00:03:01.810> going<00:03:01.960> to<00:03:02.020> be<00:03:02.080> doing<00:03:02.200> any<00:03:02.440> lobbies<00:03:02.830> like

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
not going to be doing any lobbies like

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.650 
not going to be doing any lobbies like
this<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:03.400> just<00:03:03.790> thought<00:03:03.970> I<00:03:04.150> should<00:03:04.180> tell<00:03:04.420> you

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
this I just thought I should tell you

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.390 
this I just thought I should tell you
guys<00:03:04.990> what<00:03:05.320> is<00:03:05.410> happening<00:03:05.830> if<00:03:05.920> you<00:03:06.040> don't<00:03:06.250> want

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400
