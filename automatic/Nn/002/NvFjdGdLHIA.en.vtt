10<00:01:06.540> kills<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.020> match<00:01:07.260> if<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.040> add<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.369> up<00:01:08.490> and

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
10 kills that match if you add it up and

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.760 
10 kills that match if you add it up and
it<00:01:09.030> was<00:01:09.119> actually<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.510> kill<00:01:09.780> then<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.590> would

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
it was actually a kill then it would

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.330 
it was actually a kill then it would
actually<00:01:10.920> be<00:01:11.159> 20<00:01:11.880> kills<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:13.049> game<00:01:13.260> holy<00:01:13.830> crap

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
actually be 20 kills in a game holy crap

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.520 
actually be 20 kills in a game holy crap
so<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.210> best<00:01:15.420> killstreaks<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.020> get<00:01:16.140> assists

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
so the best killstreaks to get assists

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.460 
so the best killstreaks to get assists
is<00:01:16.710> probably<00:01:17.220> UAV<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.060> guardian<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.229> I'll<00:01:19.350> be

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
is probably UAV and guardian so I'll be

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.890 
is probably UAV and guardian so I'll be
going<00:01:19.500> through<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.979> UAV<00:01:20.460> first<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.210> then<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
going through the UAV first and then the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.530 
going through the UAV first and then the
Guardian<00:01:22.320> second<00:01:23.009> now<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.430> UAV<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.390> could

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
Guardian second now the UAV you could

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.330 
Guardian second now the UAV you could
just<00:01:24.689> keep<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:25.080> getting<00:01:25.380> score<00:01:25.680> after<00:01:25.890> score

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
just keep on getting score after score

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.710 
just keep on getting score after score

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
switch on the other gun that's what I

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.660 
switch on the other gun that's what I
find<00:01:49.409> interesting<00:01:49.649> about<00:01:50.040> call<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.399> duty<00:01:50.640> and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
find interesting about call of duty and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.340 
find interesting about call of duty and
that's<00:01:50.880> what<00:01:51.000> people<00:01:51.240> get<00:01:51.420> that's<00:01:51.960> how<00:01:52.049> people

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
that's what people get that's how people

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.840 
that's what people get that's how people
get<00:01:52.470> interested<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.189> call<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.460> duty<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.759> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
get interested in call of duty in the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.179 
get interested in call of duty in the
first<00:01:54.090> place<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.600> let's<00:01:55.200> head<00:01:55.320> into<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.619> UAV

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
first place so let's head into the UAV

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.999 
first place so let's head into the UAV
sort<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.820> subject<00:01:57.450> now<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.020> UAV<00:01:58.530> once<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.829> get

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
sort of subject now the UAV once you get

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.649 
sort of subject now the UAV once you get
it<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.340> get<00:01:59.610> enough<00:01:59.880> score<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.240> get<00:02:00.509> it

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
it and you get enough score to get it

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.300 
it and you get enough score to get it
you<00:02:01.020> could<00:02:01.170> just<00:02:01.350> keep<00:02:01.469> on<00:02:01.649> rotating<00:02:01.860> and

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
you could just keep on rotating and

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.609 
you could just keep on rotating and
rotating<00:02:02.729> rotating<00:02:03.119> with<00:02:03.299> just<00:02:03.600> one<00:02:03.899> UAV<00:02:04.409> but

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
rotating rotating with just one UAV but

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.139 
rotating rotating with just one UAV but
I<00:02:04.649> suggest<00:02:05.219> Guardian<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.790> I'll<00:02:05.850> get<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.119> that

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
I suggest Guardian and I'll get to that

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.449 
I suggest Guardian and I'll get to that
in<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.420> second<00:02:06.840> but<00:02:07.350> UAV<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:07.979> probably<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.429> most

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
in a second but UAV is probably the most

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.940 
in a second but UAV is probably the most
useful<00:02:08.879> kill<00:02:09.569> streak<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:10.050> black<00:02:10.289> ops<00:02:10.470> 2<00:02:10.619> at<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
useful kill streak in black ops 2 at the

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.460 
useful kill streak in black ops 2 at the
time<00:02:11.370> now<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.000> say<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.510> because<00:02:12.660> is

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
time now I say that because is

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.200 
time now I say that because is
there's<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:14.010> bunch<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.490> different<00:02:14.610> perch<00:02:14.970> for

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
there's a bunch of different perch for

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.000 
there's a bunch of different perch for
ghosts<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.810> they<00:02:15.870> split<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.350> up<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.620> little<00:02:16.770> bit

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
ghosts and they split it up a little bit

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.590 
ghosts and they split it up a little bit
an<00:02:17.190> assassin<00:02:17.820> or<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.240> could<00:02:18.390> call<00:02:18.570> it

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
an assassin or you could call it

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.630 
an assassin or you could call it
assassin<00:02:19.200> or<00:02:19.380> ghost<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.890> really<00:02:20.310> doesn't

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
assassin or ghost it really doesn't

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.790 
assassin or ghost it really doesn't
matter<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.270> put<00:02:21.570> them<00:02:21.690> into<00:02:21.810> cold-blooded

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
matter and it put them into cold-blooded

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.040 
matter and it put them into cold-blooded
assassin<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.030> ghost<00:02:24.300> or<00:02:24.540> something<00:02:24.720> like

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
assassin and ghost or something like

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.810 
assassin and ghost or something like
that<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.290> it's<00:02:25.590> pretty<00:02:25.740> cool<00:02:26.040> but<00:02:26.430> people

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
that and it's pretty cool but people

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.490 
that and it's pretty cool but people
don't<00:02:26.970> get<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.300> into<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.540> last<00:02:27.900> rank<00:02:28.290> of<00:02:28.440> the

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
don't get it into the last rank of the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.190 
don't get it into the last rank of the
game<00:02:28.710> most<00:02:29.010> likely<00:02:29.490> somewhat<00:02:30.330> near<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.990> end

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
game most likely somewhat near the end

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.170

of<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.800> ranking<00:02:32.130> system<00:02:32.550> so<00:02:32.850> you<00:02:32.910> could

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
of the ranking system so you could

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.230 
of the ranking system so you could
absolutely<00:02:33.630> spam<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.920> crap<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.640> living<00:02:35.970> crap

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
absolutely spam the crap the living crap

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.300 
absolutely spam the crap the living crap
out<00:02:36.450> of<00:02:36.480> them<00:02:36.660> with<00:02:36.870> UAVs<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.680> they<00:02:38.100> have
