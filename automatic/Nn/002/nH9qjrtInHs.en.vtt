00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.290
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.200
 and you want to see the safe comparison of 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.820
 this real madrid with madrid 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.260
 'galactic' which is the best which is 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.389
 better the one of the supercopa the one that won 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.389
 this week to Seville or the galactic 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.050
 there was a time when the best 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.240
 players of the world gathered in a 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.820
 same team was the real madrid of the 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.529
 galactic figo zidane ronaldo and for 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.560
 last David Beckham formed the 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.910
 attack of a total football project 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.010
 a decade later the story was 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.350
 repeat a collection of cracks 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.900
 defending the same shield are cross 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.699
 james bailey christian but who 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.070
 I would win in an imaginary confrontation 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.650
 the elegance of zidane the snatch of 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.960
 begging the precision of figo and the touch 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.900
 of beckham against the fast caribbean 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.180
 cross passes the triple of james and 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.040
 the power of a Christian who prefers 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.530
 amateur me the galactic era 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.140
 the graph was very good but the 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.559
 now has better template 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.860
 important but the current 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.290
 more strength because now there are 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.440
 they are much better I prefer the template 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.670
 now I prefer the galactic 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.200
 ronaldo beckham and all these because 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.600
 they were more consecrated players are 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.130
 good but now with christian james and 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.720
 cross is reinforced fairly good 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.750
 real madrid and I think he has a team 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.090
 to win everything 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.470
 and I liked the staff of 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.880
 before but I will give it I like it much more 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.310
 because also sergio de andalusia like 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.290
 we precisely the defense with the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.690
 then the center's curse was makes 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.729
 ten years a less solid line now 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.050
 pepe ramos and with no discussion on 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.180
 left lateral keeps talking 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.979
 Portuguese by Roberto Carlos to Marcelo 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.320
 Coentrao two teams built 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.060
 meticulously Real Madrid won the 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.460
 ninth and came ronaldo and then 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.200
 Beckham with the tenth lands in Jamis 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.330
 and cross a global selection of 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.740
 then a global selection of now 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.740
 choose your favorite 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.869
 ah
