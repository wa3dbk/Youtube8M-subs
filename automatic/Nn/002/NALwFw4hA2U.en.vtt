famous piece Asturias or legenda which
was<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.670> first<00:01:02.850> piece<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.269> heard<00:01:03.479> by<00:01:03.960> Segovia

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:04.469 
was the first piece I heard by Segovia

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:08.539 
was the first piece I heard by Segovia
and<00:01:04.969> piece<00:01:05.969> that<00:01:06.180> inspired<00:01:06.570> me<00:01:06.780> very<00:01:06.990> much<00:01:07.920> but

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
and piece that inspired me very much but

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.240 
and piece that inspired me very much but
it's<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.969> very<00:01:09.180> very<00:01:09.450> famous<00:01:09.630> piece<00:01:10.130> at<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
it's a very very famous piece at the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.800 
it's a very very famous piece at the
same<00:01:11.460> time<00:01:11.670> very<00:01:11.909> complicated<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.719> it

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
same time very complicated so it

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.310 
same time very complicated so it
requires<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.320> lot<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:14.990> very<00:01:15.990> thorough

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
requires a lot of very thorough

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.050 
requires a lot of very thorough
preparation<00:01:17.420> to<00:01:18.420> play<00:01:18.600> but<00:01:19.229> then<00:01:19.759> once<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.909> do

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
preparation to play but then once you do

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.090 
preparation to play but then once you do
that<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.450> have<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.719> forget<00:01:22.020> about<00:01:22.100> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
that you have to forget about the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.929 
that you have to forget about the
technique<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.670> just<00:01:23.750> go<00:01:24.750> for<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.350> see

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
technique and just go for it and see

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:44.210 
technique and just go for it and see
find<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.060> flamenco<00:01:27.390> guitarist<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:28.110> you

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.910 

you

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:03:04.850 

you

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.820 

and<00:03:05.860> so<00:03:06.070> it<00:03:06.700> just<00:03:06.880> continues<00:03:07.300> from<00:03:07.480> there<00:03:07.830> no

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
and so it just continues from there no

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.010 
and so it just continues from there no
it's<00:03:09.100> not<00:03:09.190> really<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.490> tremolo<00:03:09.910> it's<00:03:10.450> just<00:03:10.750> very

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
it's not really a tremolo it's just very

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.820 
it's not really a tremolo it's just very
very<00:03:11.170> fast<00:03:13.050> articulation<00:03:14.050> between<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.590> thumb

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
very fast articulation between the thumb

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.050 
very fast articulation between the thumb
and<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:15.070> fingers<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:17.520> alternation<00:03:18.520> yes<00:03:18.730> so

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
and the fingers and alternation yes so

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.660 
and the fingers and alternation yes so
when<00:03:19.440> basically<00:03:20.440> these<00:03:20.950> it's<00:03:21.460> just

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.690 

not<00:03:26.240> really<00:03:26.480> fast<00:03:29.050> and<00:03:30.220> then<00:03:31.220> it<00:03:31.340> gets<00:03:31.460> into

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
not really fast and then it gets into

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.160 
not really fast and then it gets into
triplet

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.210 

and<00:03:39.170> then<00:03:40.040> when<00:03:40.160> you<00:03:40.220> get<00:03:40.310> to

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.310 

on<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.730> same<00:03:44.940> string<00:03:45.240> so<00:03:45.420> it's<00:03:45.690> not<00:03:45.780> tremolo

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
on the same string so it's not tremolo

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:57.520 
on the same string so it's not tremolo
it's<00:03:46.410> like<00:03:46.970> two<00:03:47.970> nodes<00:03:48.210> instead<00:03:48.510> of<00:03:48.630> three<00:03:48.870> so

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.260 

so<00:03:58.530> what<00:03:59.070> is<00:03:59.220> what<00:03:59.520> is<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.790> biggest<00:04:00.090> challenge

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
so what is what is the biggest challenge

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.750 
so what is what is the biggest challenge
in<00:04:00.570> this<00:04:00.690> piece<00:04:00.930> is<00:04:01.110> that<00:04:01.290> you<00:04:01.890> have<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.580> do

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
in this piece is that you have to do

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.050 
in this piece is that you have to do
such<00:04:03.210> fine<00:04:03.930> finger<00:04:04.260> work<00:04:04.620> in<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.580> right<00:04:05.760> hand

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
such fine finger work in the right hand

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.360 
such fine finger work in the right hand
and<00:04:06.380> there<00:04:07.380> are<00:04:07.440> many<00:04:07.590> jumps<00:04:07.950> in<00:04:08.070> the<00:04:08.160> left

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
and there are many jumps in the left

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.810 
and there are many jumps in the left
hand<00:04:08.610> and<00:04:08.850> there<00:04:09.090> are<00:04:09.180> really<00:04:09.450> forced<00:04:09.840> chords

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
hand and there are really forced chords

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.250 
hand and there are really forced chords
which<00:04:11.820> happen<00:04:12.330> really<00:04:12.510> fast<00:04:12.630> while

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
which happen really fast while
