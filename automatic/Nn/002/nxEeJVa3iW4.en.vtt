00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.279
 case 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.279
 Earth 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:16.789
 in the same month 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:18.259
 20 years old 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.999
 and the sides talk a little about the situation what I learned 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:26.729
 this sentence years when he left the essential is invisible to the eyes that the 

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:28.230
 two are visible 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.489
 ii is that the community action 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.150
 social intervention 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.970
 make a difference in our community 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.220
 our world 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.950
 people who studied 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.210
 ef 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.030
 This difference we have to make 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.130
 it our world the people that surround us 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.550
 in all that is around us 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.560
 there is not much 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.330
 of the transit issue 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.210
 after pressure from youth to avoid even making changes in 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.600
 criteria 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.300
 and so it should be 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.300
 I always did as the priority of mine 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.070
 with the social entrepreneurship holiday 'this was one of the highlights is unique 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.070
 is lacking 2010 quantiq in the world economic forum 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.560
 as the world economic forum is that I inadvertently discovered that the message 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.830
 of which young people create broadcast all three long postava 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.150
 and this was the most comical one has to hold and spend the same amount 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.880
 I'm still there, arms in the air. 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.880
 he is still far 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.240
 is that what most shocked me was to see that they have cities 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.200
 changing the world and what would help is well deserving of the 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.210
 responded to this survey 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.330
 and so 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.249
 with all this pomegranate citizen novel we only have land with sites 

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:47.799
 things like social entrepreneurship social innovation things like action 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.250
 should only give 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.350
 in the sky has to be more than one word has to be more than one day 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.620
 to be finished at the front with anemia 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.000
 there has to be an action title 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.990
 and attitudes 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.080
 attitude that we can all make purchases and clear subsidies to use 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.890
 but there is another kind of attitude 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.069
 which ties him with a volunteer program in Tegucigalpa

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:19.659
 at the time when I asked the founder of this project what it is I do 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.780
 tobi are included are workshops nobody cold 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.179
 and if you do not want 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:29.369

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:36.980
 and that this defender that each one can do sells needy age 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.949
 techniques and knowledge 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:42.809
 Faced highlighted the committee - 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:46.009
 we are all almost 14 years old to drive

 we all have to use 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.510
 but I do not know that we can use the pretext of doing the 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.649
 difference 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:54.629

 in the background 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:07.809
 we started doing the defense doing what we did best 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.879
 and this origin to the training project as well as the investments

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:23.469
 for us jobson young team of trained with the formalities the port 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.109
 that I needed 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.719
 and that the United States is in munich that presides at random that the thefts and that 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:30.639
 refer to your community 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:35.180

 as rubens convey technical knowledge 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:01.509
 the highlights were injuries in the people smoking procedures in the 

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:03.549
 communicated 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.769
 something with original 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.040
 such as tell us

 our readers who are represented here 

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:16.340
 has unique capabilities hence you have graphite 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.719
 but the same happens to this same audience 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:21.719
 which shifts have unique capabilities 

00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:24.099
 originality 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:26.870

 every number we have it faces the other 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:39.620
 and at that time we start today in iraq and other forms our criteria 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.809
 it is the greatest potential to make a difference. 

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:47.169
 the things we can do more than 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.430
 unique features 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.039
 are graphite that was made as 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.129
 In this house sink on graphite with the we transform 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.900
 this stratifying civil defect by conflicts that were signed knowledge 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.349
 for what were children with experience that technique 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:05.589
 that's why it would end state 

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:08.210
 this entry is what i believe 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.669
 is a craic 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.949
 in this world all day the vix which consists that sometimes we speak in what 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.210
 we are more important to give 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.810
 is that what is invisible to our eyes so hot our experiences 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.379
 technical skills
