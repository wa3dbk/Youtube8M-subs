one<00:01:02.879> peptides<00:01:03.879> no<00:01:04.390> we<00:01:04.509> probably<00:01:04.719> talked<00:01:05.110> about

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
one peptides no we probably talked about

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.920 
one peptides no we probably talked about
peptides<00:01:05.740> before<00:01:06.250> a<00:01:06.490> little<00:01:06.700> bit<00:01:06.820> or<00:01:07.750> you<00:01:07.840> guys

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
peptides before a little bit or you guys

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.090 
peptides before a little bit or you guys
have<00:01:08.110> heard<00:01:08.289> about<00:01:08.409> this<00:01:08.619> is<00:01:08.770> like<00:01:08.829> a<00:01:08.890> buzz

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
have heard about this is like a buzz

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.190 
have heard about this is like a buzz
word<00:01:09.400> but<00:01:09.640> peptides<00:01:10.360> have<00:01:10.450> chains<00:01:10.810> of<00:01:11.049> amino

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
word but peptides have chains of amino

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.539 
word but peptides have chains of amino
acid<00:01:11.920> and<00:01:12.010> they're<00:01:12.100> kind<00:01:12.280> of<00:01:12.310> like<00:01:12.400> the

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
acid and they're kind of like the

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:13.800 
acid and they're kind of like the
building<00:01:12.909> blocks<00:01:13.119> of<00:01:13.270> your<00:01:13.330> skin<00:01:13.659> but

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
building blocks of your skin but

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.600 
building blocks of your skin but
topically<00:01:14.290> on<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:14.530> skin<00:01:14.710> they<00:01:15.070> act<00:01:15.250> like<00:01:15.460> a

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
topically on the skin they act like a

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.060 
topically on the skin they act like a
messenger<00:01:16.150> and<00:01:16.270> communicate<00:01:16.869> and<00:01:17.080> cause<00:01:17.619> the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
messenger and communicate and cause the

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.859 
messenger and communicate and cause the
skin<00:01:18.100> to<00:01:18.700> do<00:01:18.850> something<00:01:19.210> else<00:01:19.360> or<00:01:19.479> stimulate

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
skin to do something else or stimulate

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.510 
skin to do something else or stimulate
the<00:01:20.020> skin<00:01:20.200> to<00:01:20.320> do<00:01:20.439> something<00:01:20.710> else<00:01:20.860> you<00:01:21.430> have

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
the skin to do something else you have

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.940 
the skin to do something else you have
different<00:01:21.790> types<00:01:21.909> of<00:01:22.150> peptides<00:01:22.330> to<00:01:22.950> neuro

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
different types of peptides to neuro

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.920 
different types of peptides to neuro
peptides<00:01:24.280> are<00:01:24.820> going<00:01:25.030> to<00:01:25.119> kind<00:01:25.270> of<00:01:25.330> like<00:01:25.450> have

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
peptides are going to kind of like have

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.410 
peptides are going to kind of like have
an<00:01:26.170> effect<00:01:26.680> to<00:01:26.770> kind<00:01:26.979> of<00:01:27.040> chill<00:01:27.340> out<00:01:27.549> the<00:01:27.909> the

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
an effect to kind of chill out the the

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.780 
an effect to kind of chill out the the
muscle<00:01:28.780> reaction<00:01:29.439> on<00:01:29.619> the<00:01:30.070> skin<00:01:30.369> so<00:01:30.580> it<00:01:30.700> has

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
muscle reaction on the skin so it has

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.820 
muscle reaction on the skin so it has
like<00:01:30.939> a<00:01:31.000> topical<00:01:31.330> Botox<00:01:31.869> effect<00:01:32.380> do<00:01:32.560> you<00:01:32.619> have

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
like a topical Botox effect do you have

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.990 
like a topical Botox effect do you have
a<00:01:32.860> signal<00:01:33.280> peptide<00:01:33.640> that's<00:01:33.790> gonna

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
a signal peptide that's gonna

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.480 
a signal peptide that's gonna
communicate<00:01:34.540> to<00:01:34.780> heal<00:01:35.439> and<00:01:35.920> stimulate

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
communicate to heal and stimulate

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.510 
communicate to heal and stimulate
collagen<00:01:36.729> or<00:01:37.240> even<00:01:37.450> an<00:01:37.540> enzyme<00:01:37.900> inhibitor

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
collagen or even an enzyme inhibitor

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.039 
collagen or even an enzyme inhibitor
peptide<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:40.060> what<00:01:40.180> that's<00:01:40.330> going<00:01:40.540> to<00:01:40.630> do<00:01:40.840> is

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
peptide and what that's going to do is

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.780 
peptide and what that's going to do is
help<00:01:41.290> to<00:01:41.439> you<00:01:41.650> know<00:01:41.740> reduce<00:01:41.920> breakouts<00:01:42.670> so

on<00:01:52.180> peptides<00:01:52.930> alone<00:01:53.229> because<00:01:53.470> there's

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
on peptides alone because there's

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.350 
on peptides alone because there's
differently<00:01:54.040> copper<00:01:54.759> based<00:01:54.909> peptides

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360

is that does tend to be a little bit

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.199 
is that does tend to be a little bit
progessive<00:04:18.129> so<00:04:18.250> people<00:04:18.489> can<00:04:18.639> be<00:04:18.759> a<00:04:18.789> little<00:04:19.090> bit

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
progessive so people can be a little bit

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.059 
progessive so people can be a little bit
sensitive<00:04:19.449> to<00:04:19.959> it<00:04:20.109> and<00:04:20.229> have<00:04:20.349> a<00:04:20.379> little<00:04:20.919> bit<00:04:21.009> of

reaction<00:04:21.549> cause<00:04:22.120> little<00:04:22.300> sensitivity<00:04:22.720> so<00:04:23.410> if

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
reaction cause little sensitivity so if

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.670

when your skin gets older that turnover
slows<00:05:03.970> down<00:05:04.389> so<00:05:04.659> that's<00:05:04.870> why<00:05:05.169> it's<00:05:05.380> important
