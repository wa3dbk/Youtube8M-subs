00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
worried if I teleport from one console

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.389 
worried if I teleport from one console
to<00:02:04.350> another<00:02:04.590> without<00:02:04.890> going<00:02:05.130> through<00:02:05.160> the

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
to another without going through the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.430 
to another without going through the
scanner<00:02:05.729> it's<00:02:06.330> gonna<00:02:06.600> screw<00:02:07.050> up<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.259> game<00:02:07.410> a

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
bit so that's the only reason I'm saying

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.680

a scanner no we don't scanner so there's

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.230 
a scanner no we don't scanner so there's

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
I can't member his name but there was a

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.750 
I can't member his name but there was a
person<00:03:20.930> on<00:03:20.990> the<00:03:21.110> forms<00:03:21.410> it<00:03:21.590> was<00:03:21.680> making<00:03:22.580> oh

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
person on the forms it was making oh

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.040 
person on the forms it was making oh
that's<00:03:23.180> beautiful

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
that's beautiful

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.820 
that's beautiful
he<00:03:24.410> was<00:03:24.530> making<00:03:24.709> a<00:03:24.890> console<00:03:25.310> like<00:03:25.400> this<00:03:25.610> and<00:03:26.830> it

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
he was making a console like this and it

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.580 
he was making a console like this and it
was<00:03:28.040> very<00:03:28.760> very<00:03:29.030> high<00:03:29.360> quality<00:03:29.420> and<00:03:29.990> then<00:03:30.170> I

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
was very very high quality and then I

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.650 
was very very high quality and then I
don't<00:03:31.280> think<00:03:31.340> Fallout<00:03:31.730> New<00:03:31.940> Vegas<00:03:32.240> could

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
don't think Fallout New Vegas could

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.570 
don't think Fallout New Vegas could
handle<00:03:32.930> it<00:03:33.050> so<00:03:33.530> we've<00:03:33.709> tried<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.130> release<00:03:34.430> it

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
handle it so we've tried to release it

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.420 
handle it so we've tried to release it
in<00:03:34.670> his<00:03:34.760> own<00:03:34.910> mod<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:36.110> just<00:03:36.830> the<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.280> game

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
in his own mod and just the the game

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.620 
in his own mod and just the the game
couldn't<00:03:37.700> handle<00:03:37.910> that<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.090> think<00:03:38.300> so<00:03:38.390> he<00:03:38.480> just

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
couldn't handle that I think so he just

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.140 
couldn't handle that I think so he just
stopped<00:03:38.959> already<00:03:39.410> just<00:03:39.739> got<00:03:40.580> too<00:03:40.730> busy<00:03:41.000> and

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
stopped already just got too busy and

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.420 
stopped already just got too busy and
couldn't<00:03:41.450> do<00:03:41.690> it<00:03:41.810> but<00:03:42.470> is<00:03:43.070> there<00:03:43.220> a<00:03:43.280> way<00:03:43.400> to

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
couldn't do it but is there a way to

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.750 
couldn't do it but is there a way to
change<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:43.970> colors<00:03:44.660> so<00:03:45.230> what<00:03:45.440> was<00:03:46.130> this<00:03:46.280> radio

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
change the colors so what was this radio

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.660 
change the colors so what was this radio
dial<00:03:47.000> no<00:03:47.870> and<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.709> minute<00:03:48.950> is<00:03:49.040> just<00:03:49.459> in

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
dial no and the minute is just in

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.090

the orange but Archer on banks looking
down<00:03:55.190> mechanism<00:03:55.660> lever<00:03:56.769> was<00:03:57.769> a<00:03:57.890> soft<00:03:58.400> pair

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
down mechanism lever was a soft pair

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.140 
down mechanism lever was a soft pair
system<00:03:59.110> okay<00:04:00.140> right<00:04:00.620> as<00:04:01.400> I<00:04:01.640> said<00:04:01.850> it's<00:04:02.120> still

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
system okay right as I said it's still

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.040 
system okay right as I said it's still
in<00:04:02.390> development

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
in development

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.860 
in development
so<00:04:03.650> no<00:04:04.400> not<00:04:04.760> a<00:04:04.790> lot<00:04:04.970> of<00:04:05.030> this<00:04:05.300> is<00:04:05.450> gonna<00:04:05.570> work

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
so no not a lot of this is gonna work

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.600 
so no not a lot of this is gonna work
but<00:04:07.300> wow<00:04:08.300> this<00:04:08.600> is<00:04:08.750> kind<00:04:08.930> of<00:04:08.989> cool<00:04:09.459> I'm<00:04:10.459> gonna

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
but wow this is kind of cool I'm gonna

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.819 
but wow this is kind of cool I'm gonna
just<00:04:10.910> go<00:04:11.209> and<00:04:11.269> see<00:04:11.510> if<00:04:11.630> there<00:04:12.019> are<00:04:12.200> corridors

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
just go and see if there are corridors

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.819 
just go and see if there are corridors
for<00:04:13.100> this<00:04:13.570> and<00:04:14.570> if<00:04:14.660> there<00:04:14.810> are<00:04:14.840> no<00:04:15.380> there's<00:04:15.680> no

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
for this and if there are no there's no

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.080 
for this and if there are no there's no
corridors<00:04:16.280> for<00:04:16.489> and<00:04:16.790> this<00:04:16.880> would<00:04:17.000> probably

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
corridors for and this would probably

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.920 
corridors for and this would probably
return<00:04:17.510> me<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:18.970> yes<00:04:19.970> my<00:04:20.209> normal<00:04:20.510> console

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
return me to the yes my normal console

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.680 
return me to the yes my normal console
so<00:04:21.169> all<00:04:21.410> is<00:04:21.680> fixed<00:04:22.580> there<00:04:23.030> you<00:04:23.150> go<00:04:23.330> that<00:04:23.510> was<00:04:23.540> a

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
so all is fixed there you go that was a

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.659 
so all is fixed there you go that was a
quick<00:04:23.930> preview<00:04:24.169> of<00:04:24.410> what's<00:04:24.650> to<00:04:24.740> come<00:04:24.919> in<00:04:25.070> 2.2

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
quick preview of what's to come in 2.2

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.300 
quick preview of what's to come in 2.2
along<00:04:25.940> with<00:04:26.120> probably<00:04:26.390> more<00:04:26.540> quests<00:04:26.840> and<00:04:27.310> an

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
along with probably more quests and an

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.700 
along with probably more quests and an
advanced<00:04:28.850> TARDIS<00:04:29.390> mode<00:04:29.630> I<00:04:29.660> think<00:04:29.870> which<00:04:30.590> is

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
advanced TARDIS mode I think which is

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.630 
advanced TARDIS mode I think which is
going<00:04:30.830> to<00:04:30.890> be<00:04:31.010> quite<00:04:31.220> cool<00:04:31.460> so<00:04:32.650> yes<00:04:33.650> I<00:04:33.950> hope<00:04:34.250> you

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
going to be quite cool so yes I hope you

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.190 
going to be quite cool so yes I hope you

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.909 
about the console and how to get to the
new<00:04:38.180> TARDIS<00:04:38.450> please<00:04:39.080> check<00:04:39.290> out<00:04:39.410> yourself

new TARDIS please check out yourself

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.050 
new TARDIS please check out yourself
obviously<00:04:40.340> just<00:04:40.490> a<00:04:40.580> question<00:04:40.880> game

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
obviously just a question game

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.000
