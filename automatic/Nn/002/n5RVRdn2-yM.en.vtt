00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:02.620
 singer themselves belyaev evgenia and we 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.200
 continue the course on the repair of cellular 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.250
 phones in the previous video i 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.040
 said that the main diagnostic 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.210
 electronics repair tool is 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.339
 eyes 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.509
 the water in the picture is faulty and its 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:15.129
 now you can see 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.119
 identify the problem and I after a few 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.529
 seconds tell where she can click 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.980
 pause 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.740
 in this case, the breakage between points 1 and 2 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.210
 breakage diagnostic 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.800
 points 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.420
 repairing flooded phones 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.619
 be sure to check these 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:31.560
 largest 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.290
 there most often there is a break sometimes they are not 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.280
 visible to the eye 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.060
 use korea 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.070
 now take a multimeter cross it 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.520
 call mode 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.760
 checking out 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.880
 in the first case of resistance 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.340
 endlessly and he will not replace 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.340
 right now 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.020
 in the second case of resistance 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.790
 zero and multimeter makes a sound 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.740
 accordingly we need to recover 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.930
 contacts 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.110
 between 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.300
 leg transistors and 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.540
 this is the contact pad 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.540
 charted scheme 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.110
 first put plus 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.780
 then you can slightly scratch this 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.000
 contact pad with needle 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.010
 for a better desire hall 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.010
 and put on her 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.080
 Vova solder 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.680
 we have a solder soldering iron 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.470
 further we take suitable under sochi 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.590
 wrong dock 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.590
 Kiev connect two points 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.270
 again we put a plus because 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.940
 will be plus us 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.210
 evaporated 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.240
 we take right doc 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.240
 so 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.150
 after about the debt but the Poles 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.540
 we delete the extra video 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.810
 and I showed you how to steam the contacts. 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.400
 with soldering grease so here it is 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.550
 transistor and i pre 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.870
 all three legs will sing 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.020
 thank you for your attention subscribe to 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.700
 channel 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.789
 watch and video and all the best
