00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 all great hello with you vika in this 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.799
 video i want to talk to you about 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.860
 perfumes you often asked me to get 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.830
 do it and now i'm finally 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.500
 in general the theme of perfume is very individual 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.689
 But as you know, even one drop 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.000
 Perfume can take you completely to 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.840
 another dimension 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.059
 may bring you gone possible 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.570
 will be able to come down some memories 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.540
 so this is all very individual and 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.079
 let's probably share some 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.210
 my preferences tell about my 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:49.050
 several favorite flavors with what they 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:53.610
 I am associated as I perceive them 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:57.030
 and so on let's start the first thing i'm 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.629
 i want to show you this fragrance from jo 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.850
 malone 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.830
 blackberry and in my bay leaf mine 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.439
 latest purchase 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.689
 I am very pleased with this fragrance 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.810
 the only thing I can say is that this 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.720
 the flavor so let's say sits very close to 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.270
 therefore there will be no body from him 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.729
 such a plume on the other hand it and 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.850
 well the aroma becomes so let's say 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:30.890
 more intimate i feel and freshness and 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:34.560
 some sweetness and spice is 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.720
 multilateral very fragrance and first 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.990
 all he reminds me of my 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.090
 some childhood memories of how 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:47.509
 I went to the cottage to pick blueberries 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:51.720
 currant here is the first thing that immediately 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:54.420
 This is the smell of some blueberries 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.700
 and blackberry straight carries in childhood very 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.360
 I like reminds some a 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:04.430
 grandmother's jam but smell later 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.750
 time transformed in delight and 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.369
 Here I try to mix it with others. 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.069
 jo malone flavors 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.260
 same well it all turns out but 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.060
 every time and the smell goes different 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.150
 because it all depends on the proportions in 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.690
 what proportions add smash it 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.970
 the scent but I really like jo 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.620
 malone their concept of them here it is 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.290
 Huge selection when I come to the store 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.879
 and there are 50 flavors at least to me 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.330
 immediately offers several 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.830
 and want to take this one and that is 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.500
 there is so cool really 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.500
 aromas but the only thing 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.000
 You know that they are not all resistant 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:51.060
 and I almost forgot of course I can't but 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.420
 to celebrate a very beautiful orderly 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.769
 can you say gift wrapping 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.769
 the next fragrance that I would like 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:02.099
 note this here is such a fragrance from 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.200
 living angel and demon 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.409
 in my opinion he is called lexer he 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.760
 I was in the gift set and this 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.940
 the fragrance won me over 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.060
 and after I apply it passes 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.390
 some time i start 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.060
 There is some sort of retro smell here 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.370
 powder 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.870
 Yes, you know how here before was powder 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.410
 our grandmothers 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:32.280
 so that's a sponge that's the smell of a 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.640
 here is dusty kudrin and here is very very 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.530
 pleasant i don't like the aroma very 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.790
 mysterious so enveloping therefore 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.519
 also try 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.190
 maybe you will like it if you like 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.410
 powdery aromas come to your senses some 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.890
 I showed it back a while ago 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.380
 you do not get the fragrance from mac then 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:57.080
 I'm probably impressed because 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:59.489
 the street was autumn and accordingly 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:03.690
 he just did not come to this time 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.989
 years, but now when it's summer on the street 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.450
 fragrance from mac i find it very so 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:12.120
 refreshing invigorating feeling that you 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.959
 somewhere near the ocean 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.180
 or a waterfall i.e. 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:21.720
 hot days so i have a little bit here in 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:27.380
 the only thing left is that he is not very 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:31.050
 resistant what can be periodically his 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:34.229
 re-apply the next flavor he me 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.380
 still in the package because it is 2 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:39.450
 packaging soon I'll reveal to you too 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.410
 use when a finished the previous 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:46.860
 and the kind of flavor is selected which is called 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:49.440
 let me tell you what the fragrance is at first 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:53.370
 very sharp but I like it through 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.580
 30 minutes when he becomes so 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:01.020
 more natural i feel in it 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.880
 any notes of peach wormwood therefore 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.669
 the aroma becomes so interesting and 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.070
 by the way here is this too some kind of retro 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.810
 packaging is very cute when I 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.560
 I use these perfumes I get 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.780
 aesthetic pleasure really 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.820
 that wrapping so beautiful reminds 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.960
 I might even have some kind of ice 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:23.630
 further aroma which is called barbara 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.410
 The bride will immediately say that this fragrance is very 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.360
 persistent 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:30.980
 this fragrance really leaves 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:34.730
 train, so let's see, and then immediately me 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:38.050
 impressed of course the packaging is this 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:45.380
 famous cell of barbara 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:51.100
 the aroma is very very beautiful girl that 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:54.350
 whether feels some pear citrus 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:57.560
 next flavor is fragrance from icm laurent 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.669
 called on the risen, I hope 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.030
 I pronounce correctly 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:04.190
 he is so unusual he is sweet and yet 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.540
 time is refreshing very much i like it 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:12.530
 combination feel 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:15.410
 rose petals some sourness can 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:19.669
 be cranberries are very very nice too 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:21.440
 by the way the aroma is powdery like aroma 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:24.590
 who showed you from lively 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:29.000
 I left you favorite scent at last 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:31.039
 this is hermes un jardin sur le nil 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.270
 in Russian style and so I pronounce on 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:35.450
 creepy accent 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:38.120
 but that's not the main point i want 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:41.210
 you understand my attitude to this fragrance 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:44.000
 Firstly, it is suitable for unisex and 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:49.340
 girls and and young people secondly he 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:53.570
 very heavy and original he me already 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:55.880
 for many years he was absolutely not tired of me 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:58.100
 like something natural 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.100
 some organic cosmetics some 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:04.060
 lotion from l'oxitan 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.060
 which I prefer to use 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:10.910
 you know that's no synthetics here 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:14.690
 such is some kind of organic 

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:17.930
 the grass I do not know here the aroma is very heavy 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:21.229
 so many ingredients mixed hard 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:23.840
 to describe him but the only thing I can 

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:25.870
 say either you like it or not 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.430
 he is very much 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:31.610
 immediately cause a storm of emotions 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:33.409
 he is not so easy 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:36.400
 gravity can you pro like do you like 

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:38.900
