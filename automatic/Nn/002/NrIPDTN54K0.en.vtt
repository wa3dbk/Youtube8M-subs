00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.980
 I'll tell you here such radios 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.100
 I have already bought them for half a year 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:27.599
 backwards 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:31.710
 I already had time to use it. 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:36.270
 I can say in the city not directly 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.390
 worked seven hundred nine hundred meters 400 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:44.910
 meters worked when the man himself in 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:47.309
 ground floor all these 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.989
 parameters I do not know it makes no sense 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.260
 tell look not in Euroset 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.969

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.309
 given such a 1 year mountain of guarantees 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.289

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:07.680
 very pleased well all gathered 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:09.900
 done here is the quality of communication is normal well 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.810
 Of course, does anyone want to carry there 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.390
 any installer or anyone in there 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.250
 basement you will hear her only if 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.380
 in direct line of sight you will be in the basement 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:25.100
 be checked this too recently 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.100
 regarding 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:37.530
 working means on the clips is removed 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:41.100
 work on a little pinky battery that 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:46.710
 The most interesting here is also 8 8 channels 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:49.980
 some on standard call there is in 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.560
 Generally the cheapest battery that 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:58.980
 We found I put in March is impregnated 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:04.880
 120 rubles 6 6 pieces just available 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:08.130
 and I donâ€™t know if this can be removed 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:12.980
 Why is this function necessary if you can 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:18.960
 so do also type incomprehensible cause 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:25.040
 channel and volume for wella trips and 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:28.290
 for hiking or there even some 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.840
 forays into nature it will be quite 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:35.100
 quite a direct line of sight too i'm still 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:39.410
 I did not check that they just start 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:44.390
 telling that lanyard is so powerful 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:48.780
 made specially ordered emerson a 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:52.709
 mean I liked you so much 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.200
 did not talk much shorter than batteries 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:59.489
 missing something very long just 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.800
 can talk without a shortcut u not like this 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.130
 it was remembered with some throw 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.580
 walkie talkies will not compare this lessons 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.820
 such 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:12.810
 it was husky or whatever it says 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:18.980
 mono fashionable slang these soap cases are quite 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:20.459
 that's what I need can not cope here 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.290
 what else 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.330
 the battery holds the game for a long time 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.660
 little batteries I changed everything 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:31.110
 the second time they still worked just 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.980
 they already it happens that one hears 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.110
 another they do not hear here when the batteries 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.830
 sat down shows charge indicator 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.130
 but 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.750
 displays changed on battery and here I am 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.910
 just like bought left these batteries 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.080
 so half a year noah of course not every 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.820
 the day they talked there but no matter 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:58.200
 a lot of them seem to me very long 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:00.480
 so did not last long for those who 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.460
 wants and think to buy some kind of radio 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.300
 fucking wise there some boffin 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:12.560
 hypoxen gi 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:17.060
 there argut and fucking right and 5 about work 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.060
 boffin hypoxen gi just available 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:26.520
 power 0 5 watts and stated in 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.760
 open area three kilometers but 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.960
 accordingly it can be twice 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.580
 less or even less here 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:40.290
 I can not pump the type here 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:42.270
 does it even do the wire tries 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:49.500
 solder in my opinion so everything is fine 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:52.650
 It works like price-quality 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.140
 heavy niche and I think not worth it 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.490
 bother for those who are just not 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:02.310
 some kind of amateur radio signalman 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.840
 radio technician and just come eat on 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.950

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.330
