is something kinda interesting here

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.010 
is something kinda interesting here
because<00:01:08.880> people<00:01:09.240> magazine<00:01:09.600> put<00:01:09.720> out<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
because people magazine put out the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.480 
because people magazine put out the
tweet<00:01:10.229> obviously<00:01:10.680> they<00:01:10.799> didn't<00:01:10.979> ask<00:01:11.159> for

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
tweet obviously they didn't ask for

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.160 
tweet obviously they didn't ask for
permission<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.119> say<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.570> she<00:01:12.720> was<00:01:12.840> having<00:01:13.020> a
