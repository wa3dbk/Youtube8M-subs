00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.670 

and<00:00:14.639> so<00:00:14.820> we've<00:00:15.000> got<00:00:15.150> three<00:00:15.600> techniques<00:00:16.410> we're

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
and so we've got three techniques we're

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.570 
and so we've got three techniques we're
going<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.980> try<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:18.140> demonstrate<00:00:19.140> today<00:00:19.369> two<00:00:20.369> of

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
going to try to demonstrate today two of

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.349 
going to try to demonstrate today two of
them<00:00:20.789> are<00:00:20.880> sort<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.210> do-it-yourself

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
them are sort of do-it-yourself

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.550 
them are sort of do-it-yourself
techniques<00:00:22.970> and<00:00:23.970> both<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.750> them<00:00:24.990> involve<00:00:25.259> this

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
techniques and both of them involve this

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.499 
techniques and both of them involve this
sticky<00:00:25.949> stuff<00:00:26.009> called<00:00:26.460> tanglefoot<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.330> you

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509 
sticky stuff called tanglefoot and you

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:29.419 
sticky stuff called tanglefoot and you
just<00:00:27.689> put<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:27.990> on<00:00:28.140> something<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.249> goes<00:00:29.400> a

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
just put it on something that goes a

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.680 
just put it on something that goes a
band<00:00:29.820> around<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.269> tree

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.770 

the<00:00:34.530> tanglefoot<00:00:35.220> meant<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.940> do<00:00:36.210> have<00:00:36.600> to

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
the tanglefoot meant that you do have to

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.670 
the tanglefoot meant that you do have to
be<00:00:36.960> careful<00:00:37.230> about<00:00:38.690> you<00:00:39.690> want<00:00:39.900> to<00:00:39.960> try<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.290> wait

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
be careful about you want to try to wait

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.530 
be careful about you want to try to wait
until<00:00:41.310> the<00:00:41.430> most<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.880> leaves<00:00:42.120> are<00:00:42.330> down

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
until the most the leaves are down

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.420 
until the most the leaves are down
because<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.170> leaves<00:00:43.380> do<00:00:43.590> blow<00:00:43.830> a<00:00:43.860> lot<00:00:44.130> and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
because the leaves do blow a lot and

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.460 
because the leaves do blow a lot and
they<00:00:44.610> will<00:00:44.880> get<00:00:45.270> stuck<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.810> this<00:00:45.960> stuff<00:00:46.230> and

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
they will get stuck on this stuff and

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.020 
they will get stuck on this stuff and
they'll<00:00:46.590> make<00:00:46.740> a<00:00:46.800> bridge<00:00:47.130> for<00:00:47.490> the<00:00:47.610> insects<00:00:48.000> to

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
they'll make a bridge for the insects to

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.020 
they'll make a bridge for the insects to
crawl<00:00:48.300> over<00:00:48.560> so<00:00:49.560> we're<00:00:50.400> trying<00:00:50.640> really<00:00:50.910> hard

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
crawl over so we're trying really hard

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.850 
crawl over so we're trying really hard
to<00:00:51.270> wait<00:00:51.600> until<00:00:52.020> most<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.410> leaves<00:00:52.620> at

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
to wait until most of the leaves at

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.450 
to wait until most of the leaves at
following<00:00:53.600> becomes<00:00:54.600> what<00:00:54.870> triggers<00:00:55.460> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
following becomes what triggers the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.640 
following becomes what triggers the
first<00:00:56.730> adults<00:00:57.150> to<00:00:57.240> come<00:00:57.420> out<00:00:57.630> from<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> fall

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
first adults to come out from the fall

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.610 
first adults to come out from the fall
cankerworm<00:00:59.100> is<00:01:00.290> freezing<00:01:01.290> weather

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
cankerworm is freezing weather

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.549 
cankerworm is freezing weather
now<00:01:02.220> that<00:01:02.610> sounds<00:01:02.880> weird<00:01:03.090> but<00:01:03.960> that's<00:01:04.110> that's

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
now that sounds weird but that's that's

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:14.840 
now that sounds weird but that's that's
way<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.129> insect<00:01:05.640> operates

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.200 

that<00:01:15.850> put<00:01:16.060> your<00:01:16.210> band<00:01:16.360> down<00:01:16.689> and<00:01:18.000> that's<00:01:19.000> what

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
that put your band down and that's what

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.490 
that put your band down and that's what
your<00:01:19.420> you<00:01:19.899> know<00:01:19.990> that's<00:01:20.200> where<00:01:20.350> lawyer<00:01:20.619> we<00:01:20.770> got

this song just a little bit okay so back

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.540 
this song just a little bit okay so back
just<00:01:35.000> down<00:01:35.210> a<00:01:35.240> hair<00:01:38.860> you<00:01:39.860> should<00:01:40.010> able<00:01:40.130> through

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
just down a hair you should able through

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:47.469 
just down a hair you should able through
the<00:01:42.610> slice<00:01:43.610> and<00:01:44.890> yeah<00:01:45.890> it's<00:01:46.520> it's<00:01:46.909> good<00:01:47.210> to<00:01:47.360> get

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
the slice and yeah it's it's good to get

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.850 
the slice and yeah it's it's good to get
through<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:47.840> insulation<00:01:48.110> but<00:01:48.440> if<00:01:48.560> you<00:01:48.680> got<00:01:48.800> a

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
through the insulation but if you got a

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.190 
through the insulation but if you got a
nice<00:01:49.130> tree<00:01:49.430> like<00:01:49.610> this<00:01:49.820> it's<00:01:50.509> not<00:01:50.720> so<00:01:50.960> critical

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
nice tree like this it's not so critical

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.800 
nice tree like this it's not so critical
because<00:01:51.530> it's<00:01:51.800> gonna<00:01:52.009> pitch<00:01:52.280> it<00:01:52.780> make<00:01:53.780> sure

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
because it's gonna pitch it make sure

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.100 
because it's gonna pitch it make sure
you're<00:01:54.170> sealed<00:01:54.530> in<00:01:54.740> that<00:01:54.890> Valley<00:01:55.130> okay<00:01:55.990> if<00:01:56.990> you

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
you're sealed in that Valley okay if you

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.900 
you're sealed in that Valley okay if you
get<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.259> high<00:01:57.470> spot<00:01:59.140> over<00:02:00.140> there<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:01.580> you<00:02:01.759> can

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
get a high spot over there and you can

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.820 
get a high spot over there and you can
always<00:02:02.119> add<00:02:02.450> some<00:02:02.690> more<00:02:02.869> staples<00:02:03.410> if<00:02:03.500> you<00:02:03.590> want

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
always add some more staples if you want

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:21.580 
always add some more staples if you want
later<00:02:17.860> Ryan<00:02:18.860> tree<00:02:19.370> when<00:02:19.880> you<00:02:19.910> remove<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.630> band

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
later Ryan tree when you remove the band

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:29.740 
later Ryan tree when you remove the band
in<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.040> spring<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:22.519> also<00:02:28.120> now<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.180> can<00:02:29.480> go<00:02:29.600> in

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
in the spring you also now you can go in

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.220 
in the spring you also now you can go in
there<00:02:29.870> you<00:02:30.019> know<00:02:30.440> that<00:02:31.060> that's<00:02:32.060> fiberglass<00:02:33.019> in

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
there you know that that's fiberglass in

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.259 
there you know that that's fiberglass in
there<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:33.769> you<00:02:34.370> gotta<00:02:34.519> remember<00:02:34.820> one<00:02:35.120> thing

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
there and you gotta remember one thing

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.729 
there and you gotta remember one thing
about<00:02:35.390> an<00:02:35.630> insect<00:02:36.049> you<00:02:36.140> know<00:02:36.320> what<00:02:36.410> they<00:02:36.530> love

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
about an insect you know what they love

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.000 
about an insect you know what they love
to<00:02:36.769> do<00:02:37.040> hi<00:02:38.110> so<00:02:39.110> when<00:02:39.260> they<00:02:39.380> come<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.799> something

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
to do hi so when they come to something

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.720 
to do hi so when they come to something
like<00:02:40.190> this

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
like this

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.880 
like this
their<00:02:41.209> initial<00:02:41.450> instinct<00:02:42.079> if<00:02:42.260> they<00:02:42.410> come<00:02:42.620> come

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
their initial instinct if they come come

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.530 
their initial instinct if they come come
on<00:02:42.950> resistance<00:02:43.610> is<00:02:43.760> they're<00:02:44.030> gonna<00:02:44.150> want<00:02:44.450> to

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
on resistance is they're gonna want to

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.750 
on resistance is they're gonna want to
go<00:02:44.630> under<00:02:45.140> they're<00:02:45.920> not<00:02:46.130> going<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.370> want<00:02:46.549> to<00:02:46.610> go

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
go under they're not going to want to go

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.550 
go under they're not going to want to go
over<00:02:46.790> they're<00:02:47.480> gonna<00:02:47.600> want<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.049> go<00:02:48.140> under

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
over they're gonna want to go under

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.490 
over they're gonna want to go under
that's<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.430> way<00:02:49.549> an<00:02:49.670> insect<00:02:50.060> works<00:02:50.329> so<00:02:51.170> if

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
that's the way an insect works so if

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.860 
that's the way an insect works so if

get<00:05:03.250> your<00:05:03.460> banding<00:05:03.850> up<00:05:04.000> and<00:05:04.240> then<00:05:04.389> when<00:05:04.630> the

get your banding up and then when the

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.620 
get your banding up and then when the
mobs<00:05:05.650> emerge<00:05:06.160> you<00:05:06.910> don't<00:05:07.090> there<00:05:07.300> and<00:05:07.419> put<00:05:07.540> all

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
mobs emerge you don't there and put all

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.060 
mobs emerge you don't there and put all
your<00:05:07.660> tangles<00:05:08.200> without<00:05:08.380> so<00:05:08.500> you<00:05:08.560> just<00:05:08.770> go<00:05:08.919> over

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
your tangles without so you just go over

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.830 
your tangles without so you just go over
one<00:05:09.280> tree<00:05:09.580> to<00:05:09.639> the<00:05:09.729> next<00:05:09.790> tree<00:05:10.150> which<00:05:10.810> is

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
one tree to the next tree which is

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.810 
one tree to the next tree which is
applying<00:05:11.470> entangle<00:05:11.979> put<00:05:12.130> I<00:05:12.280> wouldn't<00:05:12.639> try<00:05:12.790> to

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
applying entangle put I wouldn't try to

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.610 
applying entangle put I wouldn't try to
do<00:05:13.030> them<00:05:13.150> together<00:05:13.300> I<00:05:13.780> don't<00:05:14.289> think<00:05:14.410> it's

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
do them together I don't think it's

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.900 
do them together I don't think it's
going<00:05:14.740> to<00:05:14.830> be<00:05:14.919> really<00:05:15.160> efficient<00:05:15.580> to<00:05:15.669> do<00:05:15.789> them

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
going to be really efficient to do them

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.290 
going to be really efficient to do them
together<00:05:16.350> so<00:05:17.350> we<00:05:18.220> have<00:05:18.460> two<00:05:18.729> species<00:05:19.030> of

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
together so we have two species of

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.250 
together so we have two species of
categories<00:05:20.130> we<00:05:21.130> have<00:05:21.160> spring<00:05:22.090> cankerworm<00:05:22.960> and

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
categories we have spring cankerworm and

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.560 
categories we have spring cankerworm and
fall<00:05:23.440> kind<00:05:23.710> of<00:05:23.890> worm<00:05:24.010> but<00:05:24.910> you<00:05:25.120> might<00:05:25.360> as<00:05:25.479> well

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
fall kind of worm but you might as well

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.360 
fall kind of worm but you might as well
just<00:05:25.930> lump<00:05:26.200> them<00:05:26.350> together<00:05:26.470> and<00:05:26.860> call<00:05:27.100> them

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
just lump them together and call them

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.080 
just lump them together and call them
cankerworm<00:05:27.729> right<00:05:28.150> now<00:05:28.390> both<00:05:29.380> species<00:05:29.820> are<00:05:30.820> in

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
cankerworm right now both species are in

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.580 
cankerworm right now both species are in
the<00:05:31.210> pupil<00:05:31.539> stage<00:05:31.780> underneath<00:05:32.320> the<00:05:32.410> ground

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
the pupil stage underneath the ground

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.950 
the pupil stage underneath the ground
which<00:05:33.039> is<00:05:33.190> where<00:05:33.400> they've<00:05:33.610> been<00:05:33.910> since<00:05:34.419> they

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
which is where they've been since they

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.900 
which is where they've been since they
tormented<00:05:35.710> as<00:05:35.830> this<00:05:36.039> spring<00:05:37.800> in<00:05:38.800> the<00:05:39.580> in<00:05:39.729> the

an adult and you know you've got several

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.480 
an adult and you know you've got several

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
stages in the life cycle they lay eggs

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.520 
stages in the life cycle they lay eggs
they<00:05:49.120> hatch<00:05:49.330> out<00:05:49.570> when<00:05:49.780> they<00:05:49.870> hatch<00:05:50.050> out<00:05:50.320> their

they hatch out when they hatch out their
infants<00:05:51.720> the<00:05:52.720> male<00:05:52.990> moth<00:05:53.410> has<00:05:53.770> wings<00:05:54.039> and<00:05:54.400> it's

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
infants the male moth has wings and it's

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.370 
infants the male moth has wings and it's
just<00:05:54.760> sort<00:05:54.910> of<00:05:54.970> a<00:05:55.060> nondescript<00:05:55.750> little<00:05:56.020> brown

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
just sort of a nondescript little brown

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.850 
just sort of a nondescript little brown
loss<00:05:56.740> the<00:05:57.700> female<00:05:58.060> moth<00:05:58.360> is<00:05:58.710> really<00:05:59.710> unusual

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
loss the female moth is really unusual

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.500 
loss the female moth is really unusual
as<00:06:00.280> she<00:06:00.490> doesn't<00:06:00.669> have<00:06:00.880> any<00:06:01.060> wings

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
as she doesn't have any wings

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.890 
as she doesn't have any wings
so<00:06:02.169> she<00:06:02.229> crawls<00:06:02.590> everywhere<00:06:03.190> and<00:06:03.460> her<00:06:04.450> mission

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
so she crawls everywhere and her mission

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.440 
so she crawls everywhere and her mission
is<00:06:05.050> to<00:06:05.200> get<00:06:05.380> to<00:06:05.590> the<00:06:05.710> top<00:06:05.919> of<00:06:06.100> the<00:06:06.190> tree<00:06:06.430> to<00:06:07.270> lay

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
is to get to the top of the tree to lay

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.990 
is to get to the top of the tree to lay
eggs<00:06:07.720> and<00:06:08.139> they<00:06:08.889> they<00:06:09.220> need<00:06:09.430> to<00:06:09.639> lay<00:06:09.789> their

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
eggs and they they need to lay their

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.310 
eggs and they they need to lay their
eggs<00:06:10.030> close<00:06:10.630> to<00:06:10.930> the<00:06:11.710> leaves<00:06:11.979> because

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
eggs close to the leaves because

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.860 
eggs close to the leaves because
that's<00:06:13.920> why<00:06:14.070> they<00:06:14.220> climb<00:06:14.460> up<00:06:14.750> and<00:06:15.750> they're

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
that's why they climb up and they're

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.420 
that's why they climb up and they're
hardwired<00:06:16.320> to<00:06:16.350> do<00:06:16.650> this<00:06:16.830> they'll<00:06:17.040> climb<00:06:17.220> up

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
hardwired to do this they'll climb up

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.860 
hardwired to do this they'll climb up
they<00:06:17.550> need<00:06:17.670> to<00:06:17.730> go<00:06:17.880> into<00:06:18.180> the<00:06:18.300> ground<00:06:18.540> and<00:06:18.810> turn

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
they need to go into the ground and turn

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.010

themselves into a pupa where they sit

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.460 
themselves into a pupa where they sit
all<00:06:22.560> so<00:06:22.920> long<00:06:23.330> until<00:06:24.330> they<00:06:24.510> come<00:06:24.750> out<00:06:24.780> they

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.470 
all so long until they come out they

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.530 
all so long until they come out they
