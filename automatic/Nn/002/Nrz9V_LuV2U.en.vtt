my students actually over here one on
one<00:00:13.309> basically<00:00:14.309> what<00:00:14.610> I<00:00:14.639> teach<00:00:14.759> is<00:00:15.120> creative

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
one basically what I teach is creative

one basically what I teach is creative
wax<00:00:15.780> carving<00:00:16.230> what<00:00:17.070> I've<00:00:17.160> done<00:00:17.369> here<00:00:17.580> I'm

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
wax carving what I've done here I'm

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.120 
wax carving what I've done here I'm
going<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.940> demonstrate<00:00:18.270> for<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.619> process

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
going to demonstrate for you the process

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.820 
going to demonstrate for you the process
of<00:00:20.430> lost<00:00:20.670> wax<00:00:20.910> casting<00:00:21.119> which<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.289> final

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
of lost wax casting which is the final

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.269 
of lost wax casting which is the final
step<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.310> your<00:00:23.640> wax<00:00:23.850> carving<00:00:24.269> lesson<00:00:25.279> you

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
step of your wax carving lesson you

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.620 
step of your wax carving lesson you
would<00:00:26.400> basically<00:00:26.519> take<00:00:27.060> your<00:00:27.210> wax<00:00:27.449> that

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
would basically take your wax that

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.920 
would basically take your wax that
you've<00:00:27.779> carved<00:00:29.330> exactly<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.929> size<00:00:31.230> and

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
you've carved exactly to size and

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.420 
you've carved exactly to size and
proportion<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.020> what<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.410> want<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.100> make<00:00:35.250> in

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
proportion of what you want to make in

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.479 
proportion of what you want to make in
silver<00:00:35.910> gold<00:00:36.210> platinum<00:00:36.950> we<00:00:37.950> don't<00:00:38.129> actually

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
silver gold platinum we don't actually

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.979 
silver gold platinum we don't actually
cast<00:00:38.730> platinum<00:00:39.270> here<00:00:39.629> it's<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.870> different

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
cast platinum here it's a different

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.840 
cast platinum here it's a different
process<00:00:40.680> but<00:00:41.809> basically<00:00:43.070> this<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.309> what<00:00:44.760> you

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
process but basically this is a what you

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.430 
process but basically this is a what you
would<00:00:45.030> do<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.239> would<00:00:45.450> take<00:00:45.660> your<00:00:45.809> wax<00:00:46.050> and

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
would do you would take your wax and

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.950 
would do you would take your wax and
with<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> wax<00:00:47.399> pen<00:00:47.760> which<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.329> basically<00:00:48.660> like<00:00:48.930> a

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
with a wax pen which is basically like a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.130 
with a wax pen which is basically like a
soldering<00:00:49.440> iron<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.770> heated<00:00:50.100> heated<00:00:50.969> pen<00:00:51.480> you

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
soldering iron I heated heated pen you

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.970 
soldering iron I heated heated pen you
would<00:00:52.489> connect<00:00:53.489> your<00:00:53.670> wax<00:00:54.050> to<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> feed<00:00:55.710> line

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
would connect your wax to a feed line

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.970 
would connect your wax to a feed line
which<00:00:56.309> we<00:00:56.460> call<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> sprue<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:58.079> connect<00:00:58.829> that

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
which we call a sprue and connect that

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.160 
which we call a sprue and connect that
to<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.280> rubber<00:00:59.699> base<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.930> rubber

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
to a rubber base this is just a rubber

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.100 
to a rubber base this is just a rubber
base<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:02.030> that<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.059> have<00:01:03.329> different<00:01:03.750> sizes

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
base that that I have different sizes

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.780 
base that that I have different sizes
and<00:01:04.880> diameters<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.650> depending<00:01:07.650> on<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.890> size

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
and diameters of depending on the size

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.880 
and diameters of depending on the size
of<00:01:08.939> your<00:01:09.000> piece<00:01:09.439> you<00:01:10.439> would<00:01:10.560> use<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
of your piece you would use the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.179 
of your piece you would use the
appropriate<00:01:11.189> base<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.060> flask<00:01:12.680> the<00:01:13.680> flask<00:01:13.950> is

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
appropriate base and flask the flask is

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.010 
appropriate base and flask the flask is
basically<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:16.070> metal<00:01:17.070> pipe<00:01:17.600> that's<00:01:18.600> pretty

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
basically a metal pipe that's pretty

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.620 
basically a metal pipe that's pretty
thin<00:01:19.350> engaged<00:01:19.909> and<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.000> want<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.240> match<00:01:21.390> that

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
thin engaged and you want to match that

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.170 
thin engaged and you want to match that
up<00:01:21.810> with<00:01:22.080> your<00:01:22.110> rubber<00:01:22.799> base<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.820> basically

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
up with your rubber base so basically

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.719 
up with your rubber base so basically
this<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.479> how<00:01:24.600> we're<00:01:24.900> going<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.049> make<00:01:25.229> our<00:01:25.409> mold

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
this is how we're going to make our mold

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.440 
this is how we're going to make our mold
before<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:26.820> cast<00:01:27.259> once<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.439> have<00:01:28.619> your<00:01:28.770> wax

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
before we cast once you have your wax

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.960 
before we cast once you have your wax
screwed<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.170> base<00:01:31.430> you<00:01:32.430> would<00:01:32.579> put

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
screwed on to the base you would put

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.800 
screwed on to the base you would put
your<00:01:33.150> flask<00:01:33.420> over<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.400> insert<00:01:35.400> a

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
your flask over that and insert a

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.600 
your flask over that and insert a
plaster<00:01:36.810> type<00:01:36.990> material<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.740> call<00:01:37.920> investment

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
plaster type material we call investment

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.929 
plaster type material we call investment
it<00:01:39.420> works<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:40.020> lot<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.229> plaster<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.820> would

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
it works a lot like plaster you would

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.520 
it works a lot like plaster you would
get<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.180> liquid<00:01:42.659> it's<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.899> white<00:01:43.079> powdery

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
get that liquid it's a white powdery

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.039 
get that liquid it's a white powdery
substance<00:01:44.000> get<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.149> liquid<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.600> pour<00:01:45.899> it

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
substance get that liquid and pour it

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.429 
substance get that liquid and pour it
around<00:01:46.409> your<00:01:46.979> wax<00:01:47.299> into<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.509> flask<00:01:48.899> with<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
around your wax into the flask with the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.179 
around your wax into the flask with the
base<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:50.060> it<00:01:51.060> surrounds<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.899> wax<00:01:52.200> and

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
base on it surrounds that wax and

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.670 
base on it surrounds that wax and
captures<00:01:53.759> all<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:53.939> detail<00:01:54.450> then<00:01:55.229> basically

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
captures all the detail then basically

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.020 
captures all the detail then basically
you<00:01:55.950> would<00:01:56.070> let<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.340> sit<00:01:56.670> overnight

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
you would let that sit overnight

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.859 
you would let that sit overnight
preferably<00:01:57.869> or<00:01:58.170> at<00:01:58.409> least<00:01:58.649> an<00:01:58.860> hour<00:01:59.780> you<00:02:00.780> would

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
preferably or at least an hour you would

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.950 
preferably or at least an hour you would
then<00:02:01.079> once<00:02:01.680> it's<00:02:01.860> hard<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.399> ready<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.420> go

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
then once it's hard and ready to go

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.830 
then once it's hard and ready to go
you<00:02:04.439> would<00:02:04.590> take<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.829> base<00:02:05.250> off<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.939> put<00:02:06.750> it

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
you would take that base off and put it

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.300 
you would take that base off and put it
aside<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.560> would<00:02:07.710> basically<00:02:07.799> have<00:02:08.129> an

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
aside and you would basically have an

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.669

going<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.560> show<00:02:52.800> you<00:02:52.860> today<00:02:53.069> is<00:02:53.519> how<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.090> take

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
going to show you today is how to take

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.559 
going to show you today is how to take
that<00:02:54.860> heat<00:02:55.860> your<00:02:56.069> your<00:02:56.459> metal<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:57.000> insert<00:02:57.390> it

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
that heat your your metal and insert it

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.649 
that heat your your metal and insert it
into<00:02:57.920> your<00:02:58.920> mold<00:02:59.099> using<00:02:59.640> centrifugal<00:03:00.269> force

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
into your mold using centrifugal force

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.660 
into your mold using centrifugal force
and<00:03:01.500> this<00:03:01.709> is<00:03:01.890> here<00:03:02.099> is<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.220> centrifugal

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
and this is here is a centrifugal

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.220 
and this is here is a centrifugal
casting<00:03:02.940> machine<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:03.690> we're<00:03:03.780> going<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:03.930> use

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
casting machine that we're going to use

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.009 
casting machine that we're going to use
to<00:03:04.830> do<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.099> today<00:03:05.330> there<00:03:06.330> are<00:03:06.450> other<00:03:06.690> types

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
to do that today there are other types

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.380 
to do that today there are other types
of<00:03:07.319> machines<00:03:08.159> you<00:03:08.310> can<00:03:08.340> use<00:03:08.700> there's<00:03:08.940> vacuum

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
of machines you can use there's vacuum

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.600 
of machines you can use there's vacuum
casting<00:03:09.659> the<00:03:10.409> main<00:03:10.590> one<00:03:10.769> that<00:03:10.950> I<00:03:10.980> work<00:03:11.190> with<00:03:11.430> is

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
casting the main one that I work with is

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.020 
casting the main one that I work with is
centrifugal<00:03:12.060> casting<00:03:12.890> so<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:14.700> is<00:03:14.879> what

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
centrifugal casting so that is what

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.420 
centrifugal casting so that is what
we're<00:03:15.120> going<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.269> do
