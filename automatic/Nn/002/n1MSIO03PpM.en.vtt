why<00:01:20.390> I<00:01:20.420> chose<00:01:20.600> that<00:01:20.780> belt<00:01:21.020> was<00:01:21.200> because<00:01:21.560> it<00:01:22.069> was

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
why I chose that belt was because it was

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.880 
why I chose that belt was because it was
the<00:01:22.640> flat<00:01:23.090> matte<00:01:23.690> kind<00:01:24.020> of<00:01:24.110> plastic<00:01:24.619> and<00:01:24.799> not

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
the flat matte kind of plastic and not

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.499 
the flat matte kind of plastic and not
the<00:01:25.069> shiny<00:01:25.280> plastic<00:01:25.940> that<00:01:26.090> a<00:01:26.149> lot<00:01:26.360> of<00:01:26.420> the

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
the shiny plastic that a lot of the

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.719 
the shiny plastic that a lot of the
other<00:01:26.630> belts<00:01:26.960> are<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:27.890> I<00:01:27.920> just<00:01:28.340> figured<00:01:28.610> this

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
other belts are so I just figured this

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:29.770 
other belts are so I just figured this
would<00:01:28.880> paint<00:01:29.149> better<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.539> you<00:01:29.600> know<00:01:29.659> the

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
would paint better the you know the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.389 
would paint better the you know the
paint<00:01:29.960> would<00:01:30.049> adhere<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.530> it<00:01:30.649> much<00:01:30.830> better<00:01:31.069> I

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
paint would adhere to it much better I

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:32.859 
paint would adhere to it much better I
haven't<00:01:32.060> tried<00:01:32.179> to<00:01:32.299> paint<00:01:32.479> one<00:01:32.690> of<00:01:32.780> those

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
haven't tried to paint one of those

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.830 
haven't tried to paint one of those
belts<00:01:33.140> yet<00:01:33.409> so<00:01:34.270> like<00:01:35.270> I<00:01:35.360> said<00:01:35.420> it's<00:01:35.630> just<00:01:35.750> a

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
belts yet so like I said it's just a

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.359 
belts yet so like I said it's just a
theory<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:36.319> but<00:01:36.649> it<00:01:36.799> worked<00:01:37.009> out<00:01:37.159> really

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
theory so but it worked out really

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.289 
theory so but it worked out really
really<00:01:37.459> great<00:01:38.709> let's<00:01:39.709> get<00:01:40.490> this<00:01:40.759> off<00:01:41.000> of<00:01:41.179> him

game and WWE 2k14 but and so yeah this
is<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.240> overall<00:02:05.570> design<00:02:05.960> I<00:02:06.259> really<00:02:06.350> did<00:02:07.219> like

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
is the overall design I really did like

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.289 
is the overall design I really did like
the<00:02:08.079> the<00:02:09.079> plate<00:02:09.440> shape<00:02:09.799> from<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.549> spinner

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
the the plate shape from the spinner

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.509 
the the plate shape from the spinner
belt<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.780> way<00:02:11.900> it<00:02:11.959> had<00:02:12.200> like<00:02:12.350> these<00:02:12.530> pointed

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
belt the way it had like these pointed

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.120 
belt the way it had like these pointed
edges<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:14.090> how<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.359> curved<00:02:14.660> inward<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.470> really

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
edges and how it curved inward I really

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.080 
edges and how it curved inward I really
liked<00:02:16.250> that<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.459> thought<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.760> was<00:02:16.850> a<00:02:16.910> cool

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
liked that I thought it was a cool

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.870 
liked that I thought it was a cool
design<00:02:17.299> even<00:02:17.870> though<00:02:18.049> I<00:02:18.410> did<00:02:18.859> get<00:02:19.070> really<00:02:19.459> sick

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
design even though I did get really sick

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.470 
design even though I did get really sick
of<00:02:20.170> how<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.230> spinner<00:02:21.709> belt<00:02:21.950> looked<00:02:22.450> after<00:02:23.450> a

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
of how the spinner belt looked after a

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.970 
of how the spinner belt looked after a
while<00:02:23.630> but<00:02:23.959> I<00:02:24.140> think<00:02:24.170> this<00:02:24.470> actually<00:02:24.650> looked

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
while but I think this actually looked

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.759 
while but I think this actually looked
pretty<00:02:25.160> cool<00:02:25.609> once<00:02:25.850> I<00:02:25.970> redesigned<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:26.769> first

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
pretty cool once I redesigned it first

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.259 
pretty cool once I redesigned it first
thing<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:28.040> wanted<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.340> do<00:02:28.489> was<00:02:28.700> I<00:02:28.790> got<00:02:28.970> rid<00:02:29.239> of

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
thing I wanted to do was I got rid of

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.660 
thing I wanted to do was I got rid of
the<00:02:29.540> weird<00:02:29.959> looking<00:02:30.470> eagle<00:02:31.040> that<00:02:31.250> was<00:02:31.400> on<00:02:31.549> the

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
the weird looking eagle that was on the

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.330 
the weird looking eagle that was on the
top<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:34.540> original<00:02:35.540> design<00:02:35.930> I<00:02:36.319> drew<00:02:37.190> out<00:02:37.250> some

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
top and original design I drew out some

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.180 
top and original design I drew out some
sketches<00:02:37.940> for<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.350> I<00:02:39.350> was<00:02:39.739> either<00:02:39.829> gonna<00:02:39.980> have

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
sketches for it I was either gonna have

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.610 
sketches for it I was either gonna have
like<00:02:40.370> a<00:02:40.609> dragon<00:02:41.329> on<00:02:41.480> top<00:02:41.720> of<00:02:41.870> it<00:02:42.019> instead<00:02:42.380> of<00:02:42.530> an

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
like a dragon on top of it instead of an

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.650 
like a dragon on top of it instead of an
eagle<00:02:42.920> or<00:02:43.130> maybe<00:02:43.430> like<00:02:43.670> some<00:02:43.940> black<00:02:44.180> flames

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
coming off the top of the belt like I'd

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.400 
coming off the top of the belt like I'd
actually<00:02:46.609> mold<00:02:46.880> them<00:02:47.060> using<00:02:47.329> epoxy<00:02:47.630> or<00:02:47.900> milla

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
actually mold them using epoxy or milla

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.280 
actually mold them using epoxy or milla
putty<00:02:48.760> but<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:50.030> just<00:02:50.510> decided<00:02:50.870> not<00:02:50.989> to<00:02:51.079> do<00:02:51.260> that

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
putty but I just decided not to do that

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.539 
putty but I just decided not to do that
be<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.560> little<00:02:51.709> bit<00:02:51.799> too<00:02:51.950> much<00:02:52.100> work<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.370> I

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
be a little bit too much work and I

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.390 
be a little bit too much work and I
didn't<00:02:52.760> want<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:52.940> screw<00:02:53.120> it<00:02:53.239> up<00:02:53.420> so<00:02:54.379> instead<00:02:55.190> I

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
didn't want to screw it up so instead I

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.039 
didn't want to screw it up so instead I
just<00:02:55.640> basically<00:02:55.790> wiped<00:02:56.269> it<00:02:56.420> out<00:02:56.480> made<00:02:56.810> it<00:02:56.930> look

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
just basically wiped it out made it look

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.880 
just basically wiped it out made it look
like<00:02:57.110> one<00:02:57.590> huge<00:02:57.980> header

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
like one huge header

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.610 
like one huge header

them in red and yeah all the little
jewel<00:03:06.060> pieces<00:03:06.300> I<00:03:06.660> just<00:03:06.690> decided<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.260> keep<00:03:07.590> and

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980

colored<00:03:12.150> in<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.480> gold<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.350> be<00:03:13.500> silver<00:03:14.010> because

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
colored in the gold to be silver because

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.300 
colored in the gold to be silver because
I<00:03:14.820> think<00:03:14.880> it's<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.240> cool<00:03:15.480> design<00:03:15.660> for<00:03:15.990> a<00:03:16.020> belt

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
I think it's a cool design for a belt

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.700 
I think it's a cool design for a belt
even<00:03:17.310> though<00:03:17.430> I<00:03:17.490> wasn't<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.820> big<00:03:17.970> fan<00:03:18.000> of<00:03:18.330> how

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710

even though I wasn't a big fan of how
WWE<00:03:19.710> to<00:03:19.770> DCW<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.700> thought<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.090> black<00:03:21.330> and

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570

silver<00:03:21.780> belt<00:03:22.290> that<00:03:22.560> they<00:03:22.590> had<00:03:22.860> that<00:03:23.190> was

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
silver belt that they had that was

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.660 
silver belt that they had that was
really<00:03:23.580> cool<00:03:24.140> okay<00:03:25.140> so<00:03:25.890> moving<00:03:26.130> on<00:03:26.280> from<00:03:26.459> that

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
really cool okay so moving on from that

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.150 
really cool okay so moving on from that

better going into the center plate right
now<00:03:38.790> this<00:03:39.239> looks<00:03:39.570> like<00:03:39.800> CM<00:03:40.800> Punk's<00:03:41.220> little<00:03:41.489> you

know flag symbol what the fist and the
lightning<00:03:44.160> bolt<00:03:44.480> because<00:03:45.590> I'm<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.650> big<00:03:47.100> fan<00:03:47.400> of

the<00:03:49.650> current<00:03:50.070> deputy<00:03:50.220> belt<00:03:50.760> allows<00:03:51.209> for<00:03:51.510> the

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
the current deputy belt allows for the

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.800 
the current deputy belt allows for the
side<00:03:51.840> plates<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.350> change<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:53.360> think<00:03:54.360> that's<00:03:54.720> a

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
side plates to change I think that's a

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.510 
side plates to change I think that's a
cool<00:03:54.959> design<00:03:55.140> a<00:03:55.290> lot<00:03:55.530> of<00:03:55.650> people<00:03:55.920> prefer<00:03:56.130> more

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
cool design a lot of people prefer more

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.229 
cool design a lot of people prefer more
traditional<00:03:57.090> belts<00:03:57.450> but<00:03:57.720> not<00:03:58.560> me<00:03:58.739> man

traditional belts but not me man

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.430 
traditional belts but not me man
anything<00:04:00.239> that<00:04:00.540> could<00:04:00.660> change<00:04:00.870> something<00:04:01.200> up

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
anything that could change something up

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.229 
anything that could change something up
or<00:04:01.620> just<00:04:01.830> give<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.130> a<00:04:02.310> different<00:04:02.910> look<00:04:02.940> a

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
or just give it a different look a

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.759 
or just give it a different look a
different<00:04:03.269> edge<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.080> I<00:04:04.230> think<00:04:04.440> it's<00:04:04.560> cool

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
different edge to it I think it's cool

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.210 
different edge to it I think it's cool
so<00:04:05.750> with<00:04:06.750> my<00:04:06.959> wrestling<00:04:07.440> organization<00:04:08.100> I

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
so with my wrestling organization I

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.280 
so with my wrestling organization I
thought<00:04:08.489> it<00:04:08.549> would<00:04:08.640> be<00:04:08.730> cool<00:04:08.940> to<00:04:08.970> wear<00:04:09.330> anytime

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
thought it would be cool to wear anytime

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.120 
thought it would be cool to wear anytime
a<00:04:10.799> wrestler<00:04:11.220> wins<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:11.730> belt<00:04:11.940> his<00:04:12.799> logo<00:04:13.799> back

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
a wrestler wins the belt his logo back

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.380 
a wrestler wins the belt his logo back
is<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.239> logo<00:04:15.720> or<00:04:16.140> design<00:04:16.280> or<00:04:17.280> whatever<00:04:17.640> would<00:04:18.359> be

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
is a logo or design or whatever would be

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.580 
is a logo or design or whatever would be
in<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.720> center<00:04:18.930> plate

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
in the center plate

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.860 
in the center plate
I<00:04:19.620> think<00:04:20.160> that's<00:04:20.340> was<00:04:20.910> just<00:04:21.209> a<00:04:21.269> unique<00:04:21.540> idea

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
I think that's was just a unique idea

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.890 
I think that's was just a unique idea
and<00:04:21.989> I<00:04:22.049> wanted<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.380> do<00:04:22.620> that<00:04:22.800> I<00:04:23.100> thought<00:04:23.669> about

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
and I wanted to do that I thought about

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.159 
and I wanted to do that I thought about
using<00:04:25.190> decal<00:04:26.190> paper<00:04:26.490> or<00:04:26.940> just<00:04:27.450> cutting<00:04:27.930> up<00:04:28.020> a

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
using decal paper or just cutting up a

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.840 
using decal paper or just cutting up a
piece<00:04:28.350> of<00:04:28.380> paper<00:04:28.560> or<00:04:28.830> printing<00:04:29.190> something<00:04:29.460> and
