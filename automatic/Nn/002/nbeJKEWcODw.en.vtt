00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
type of work that they particularly are

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.110 
type of work that they particularly are
really<00:01:25.750> drawn<00:01:26.080> to<00:01:26.380> if<00:01:27.310> they<00:01:27.490> haven't<00:01:27.820> had<00:01:27.940> any

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
really drawn to if they haven't had any

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.390 
really drawn to if they haven't had any
design<00:01:28.450> background<00:01:28.780> is<00:01:29.470> to<00:01:29.740> get<00:01:29.950> them<00:01:30.190> to

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
design background is to get them to

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.270 
design background is to get them to
think<00:01:30.640> like<00:01:31.120> designers<00:01:31.890> obviously<00:01:32.890> I<00:01:32.920> laid<00:01:33.250> on

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
think like designers obviously I laid on

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.440 
think like designers obviously I laid on
the<00:01:33.490> ground

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
the ground

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.609 
the ground
draw<00:01:35.079> the<00:01:35.890> drew<00:01:36.130> my<00:01:36.280> back<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.689> that's<00:01:37.899> that's

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
draw the drew my back and that's that's

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.149 
draw the drew my back and that's that's
the<00:01:39.149> kind<00:01:40.149> of<00:01:40.240> wood<00:01:40.479> he's<00:01:40.930> gonna<00:01:41.110> curve<00:01:41.409> so

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
the kind of wood he's gonna curve so

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.340 
the kind of wood he's gonna curve so
then<00:01:42.250> I<00:01:42.340> made<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.549> jig<00:01:43.000> and<00:01:43.299> we're<00:01:44.110> steam

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
then I made a jig and we're steam

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.690 
then I made a jig and we're steam
bending<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.829> wood<00:01:45.039> we<00:01:45.219> were<00:01:45.280> putting<00:01:45.520> into

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
bending the wood we were putting into

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.990 
bending the wood we were putting into
this<00:01:45.880> jig<00:01:46.240> it's<00:01:47.140> all<00:01:47.289> clamped<00:01:47.770> in<00:01:47.890> there<00:01:48.130> so

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
this jig it's all clamped in there so

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.719 
this jig it's all clamped in there so
I'm<00:01:49.060> getting<00:01:49.390> like<00:01:49.539> almost<00:01:49.929> like<00:01:50.520> close<00:01:51.520> to<00:01:51.549> my

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
I'm getting like almost like close to my

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.749 
I'm getting like almost like close to my
best<00:01:51.939> pair<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:53.229> spend<00:01:53.500> a<00:01:53.560> lot<00:01:53.770> of<00:01:53.799> time<00:01:54.130> just

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
best pair you spend a lot of time just

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.399 
best pair you spend a lot of time just
teaching<00:01:55.210> me<00:01:55.240> for<00:01:55.450> how<00:01:55.569> to<00:01:55.630> use<00:01:55.960> the<00:01:56.140> equipment

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
teaching me for how to use the equipment

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.850 
teaching me for how to use the equipment
and<00:01:56.799> how<00:01:57.429> to<00:01:57.490> layout<00:01:57.939> things<00:01:58.689> you<00:01:59.619> know<00:01:59.710> how

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
and how to layout things you know how

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.709 
and how to layout things you know how
does<00:01:59.979> one<00:02:00.189> piece<00:02:00.429> relate<00:02:00.759> to<00:02:00.939> the<00:02:01.060> other<00:02:01.240> and

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 
does one piece relate to the other and

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.789 
does one piece relate to the other and
then<00:02:02.170> try<00:02:02.590> to<00:02:03.719> expose<00:02:04.719> them<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.200> several<00:02:05.469> ways

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
then try to expose them to several ways

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.620 
then try to expose them to several ways
it<00:02:06.069> might<00:02:06.280> do<00:02:06.459> the<00:02:06.490> same<00:02:06.580> thing<00:02:07.090> one<00:02:07.479> of<00:02:07.509> the

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
it might do the same thing one of the

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.169 
it might do the same thing one of the
things<00:02:07.899> that<00:02:08.080> I'm<00:02:08.170> noticing<00:02:08.200> is<00:02:08.890> that<00:02:09.179> people

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
things that I'm noticing is that people

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.880 
things that I'm noticing is that people
coming<00:02:10.450> into<00:02:10.569> school<00:02:10.899> these<00:02:11.170> days<00:02:11.440> don't<00:02:11.769> have

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
coming into school these days don't have

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.930 
coming into school these days don't have
much<00:02:12.160> tactile<00:02:12.790> experience<00:02:13.480> in<00:02:13.750> making<00:02:14.200> things

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
much tactile experience in making things
