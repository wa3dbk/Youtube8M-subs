00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
lower aperture level that way you can

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.410 
lower aperture level that way you can
open<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.339> aperture<00:01:05.520> all<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.119> way<00:01:06.210> up

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
you'll notice the shutter speed of em

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.300 
you'll notice the shutter speed of em
125<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.670> then<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.119> have<00:01:24.299> an<00:01:24.450> f-stop<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.530> 3.5

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
125 and then you have an f-stop of 3.5

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.660 
125 and then you have an f-stop of 3.5
and<00:01:26.549> an<00:01:26.640> ISO<00:01:27.180> setting<00:01:27.540> up<00:01:27.720> 1250<00:01:28.530> now<00:01:29.369> we're

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
and an ISO setting up 1250 now we're

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.240 
and an ISO setting up 1250 now we're
going<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.850> take<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> photo<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.420> Maddie<00:01:30.780> here

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.860 

and<00:01:36.370> you'll<00:01:36.910> notice<00:01:37.060> that<00:01:37.180> it's<00:01:37.450> still<00:01:37.690> really

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870

dark so we're going to adjust our

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.370 
dark so we're going to adjust our
settings<00:01:42.970> I'm<00:01:43.780> going<00:01:43.810> to<00:01:43.960> drop<00:01:44.110> it<00:01:44.260> all<00:01:44.350> the

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
settings I'm going to drop it all the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.850 
settings I'm going to drop it all the
way<00:01:44.590> down<00:01:44.800> to<00:01:45.010> 1.8<00:01:45.790> keep<00:01:46.510> it<00:01:46.630> at<00:01:46.720> 1250<00:01:47.470> and<00:01:47.650> keep

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
way down to 1.8 keep it at 1250 and keep

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:48.600 
way down to 1.8 keep it at 1250 and keep
it<00:01:47.980> at<00:01:48.070> one<00:01:48.250> point

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
it at one point

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:57.330 
it at one point
125<00:01:50.100> let's<00:01:51.100> try<00:01:51.340> that<00:01:51.490> one<00:01:51.730> more<00:01:51.760> time

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340

and already you see an improvement in

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.510 
and already you see an improvement in
the<00:01:59.380> lighting<00:02:01.710> you'll<00:02:02.710> notice<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.159> lens<00:02:03.340> that
