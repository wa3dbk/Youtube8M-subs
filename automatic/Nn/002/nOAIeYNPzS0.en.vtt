this day I was really working on keeping
my<00:01:14.300> elbows<00:01:15.050> tucked<00:01:15.470> a<00:01:15.770> lot<00:01:15.979> of<00:01:16.130> you<00:01:16.280> guys

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
pointed out in my earlier videos that my

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.230 
pointed out in my earlier videos that my
elbows<00:01:20.000> flare<00:01:20.479> out<00:01:21.130> like<00:01:22.130> up<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:22.610> back<00:01:22.880> a<00:01:22.909> lot

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
elbows flare out like up and back a lot

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.810 
elbows flare out like up and back a lot
on<00:01:23.600> my<00:01:23.900> squat<00:01:24.380> and<00:01:24.620> it's<00:01:25.310> something<00:01:25.490> that<00:01:25.610> I'd

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
on my squat and it's something that I'd

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.110 
on my squat and it's something that I'd
noticed<00:01:26.240> in<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:26.479> past<00:01:26.630> but<00:01:26.900> I<00:01:26.960> never<00:01:27.140> really

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
noticed in the past but I never really

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.430 
noticed in the past but I never really
worked<00:01:29.120> on<00:01:29.330> fixing<00:01:29.930> that<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:30.560> I<00:01:31.450> did<00:01:32.450> try<00:01:33.229> that

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
worked on fixing that so I did try that

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.560 
worked on fixing that so I did try that
today<00:01:33.619> and<00:01:33.860> I<00:01:33.950> found<00:01:34.159> that<00:01:34.369> it<00:01:34.520> really<00:01:35.150> helped

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
today and I found that it really helped

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.050 
today and I found that it really helped
me<00:01:35.720> stay<00:01:35.960> more<00:01:36.229> upright<00:01:36.590> on<00:01:36.979> my<00:01:37.850> squad

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
me stay more upright on my squad

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.100 
me stay more upright on my squad
especially<00:01:38.659> out<00:01:38.810> of<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.020> bottom<00:01:39.409> instead<00:01:40.310> of

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
especially out of the bottom instead of

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.929 
especially out of the bottom instead of
once<00:01:42.110> I<00:01:42.229> hit<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.500> bottom<00:01:42.890> I<00:01:43.040> kinda<00:01:44.560> lose<00:01:45.560> my

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
once I hit the bottom I kinda lose my

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.969 
once I hit the bottom I kinda lose my
tension<00:01:46.939> in<00:01:47.060> my<00:01:47.180> back<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.450> little<00:01:47.810> bit<00:01:48.049> and<00:01:48.290> lean

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
tension in my back a little bit and lean

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.010 
tension in my back a little bit and lean
forward<00:01:49.580> a<00:01:49.760> bit<00:01:49.909> more<00:01:50.210> than<00:01:50.420> I<00:01:50.510> should<00:01:50.810> and

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
forward a bit more than I should and

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.410 
forward a bit more than I should and
really<00:01:51.920> thinking<00:01:52.250> about<00:01:52.340> tucking<00:01:52.760> my<00:01:53.030> elbows

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
really thinking about tucking my elbows

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.500 
really thinking about tucking my elbows
down<00:01:53.950> helps<00:01:54.950> me<00:01:55.100> keep<00:01:55.280> my<00:01:55.340> torso<00:01:55.790> upright<00:01:56.270> so

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
down helps me keep my torso upright so

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.250 
down helps me keep my torso upright so
you<00:01:56.600> can<00:01:56.720> even<00:01:56.960> see<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:57.380> here<00:01:57.909> from<00:01:58.909> this<00:01:59.030> angle

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
you can even see it here from this angle

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.719 
you can even see it here from this angle
once<00:02:00.260> I<00:02:00.380> hit<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.650> bottom<00:02:01.009> I'm<00:02:01.130> really<00:02:01.520> working

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
once I hit the bottom I'm really working

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.700 
once I hit the bottom I'm really working
on<00:02:02.060> pulling<00:02:02.450> my<00:02:02.750> elbows<00:02:03.140> down<00:02:03.409> you<00:02:03.560> can<00:02:03.680> see

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.790 
start feeling a little bit tighter
especially<00:02:26.360> after<00:02:26.510> doing<00:02:26.840> deadlifts<00:02:27.290> which<00:02:27.590> i

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
especially after doing deadlifts which i

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.619 
especially after doing deadlifts which i
will<00:02:27.860> be<00:02:28.280> hitting<00:02:28.430> later<00:02:28.849> today

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
will be hitting later today

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.289 
will be hitting later today
but<00:02:31.629> form<00:02:32.379> felt<00:02:32.590> good<00:02:32.890> just<00:02:33.219> gonna<00:02:33.790> have<00:02:34.060> to

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
but form felt good just gonna have to

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.119 
but form felt good just gonna have to
start<00:02:34.719> working<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.290> little<00:02:35.319> bit<00:02:35.590> more<00:02:35.920> on

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
start working a little bit more on

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.940 
start working a little bit more on
mobility<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:36.939> recovery<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:37.599> think<00:02:38.019> from<00:02:38.920> now

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
mobility and recovery I think from now

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.660 
mobility and recovery I think from now
on<00:02:39.129> my<00:02:39.639> weight<00:02:39.849> is<00:02:40.060> still<00:02:40.900> at<00:02:41.319> this<00:02:41.560> point<00:02:41.920> kind

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
on my weight is still at this point kind

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.879 
on my weight is still at this point kind
of<00:02:43.260> maintaining<00:02:45.629> so<00:02:46.629> once<00:02:46.900> my<00:02:47.079> calories<00:02:47.590> start

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:47.889 
of maintaining so once my calories start

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:49.500 
of maintaining so once my calories start
getting<00:02:48.159> a<00:02:48.250> little<00:02:48.280> bit<00:02:48.700> higher<00:02:48.909> and<00:02:49.120> I<00:02:49.239> get<00:02:49.420> in

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
getting a little bit higher and I get in

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.720 
getting a little bit higher and I get in
a<00:02:49.599> slight<00:02:49.900> surplus<00:02:50.500> I'm<00:02:50.680> sure<00:02:50.859> recovery<00:02:51.340> will

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
a slight surplus I'm sure recovery will

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.009 
a slight surplus I'm sure recovery will
be<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:52.120> little<00:02:52.359> bit<00:02:52.599> easier<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:54.599> so<00:02:55.599> here<00:02:55.810> one

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
be a little bit easier to so here one

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.050 
be a little bit easier to so here one
more<00:02:56.200> time<00:02:56.439> you<00:02:56.709> can<00:02:56.739> see<00:02:57.459> it<00:02:57.579> from<00:02:57.669> the<00:02:57.849> back

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
more time you can see it from the back

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.330 
more time you can see it from the back
angle<00:02:58.569> still<00:02:58.989> going<00:02:59.260> beltless<00:02:59.680> at<00:02:59.889> this<00:03:00.040> point

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
angle still going beltless at this point

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.039 
angle still going beltless at this point
going<00:03:00.549> to<00:03:00.669> try<00:03:00.849> to<00:03:00.909> push<00:03:01.209> that<00:03:01.419> as<00:03:01.599> much<00:03:01.780> as<00:03:01.810> I

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
going to try to push that as much as I

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.129 
going to try to push that as much as I
can<00:03:02.849> think<00:03:03.849> eventually<00:03:04.120> i'll<00:03:04.599> be<00:03:04.750> able<00:03:04.900> to

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
can think eventually i'll be able to

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.470 
can think eventually i'll be able to
squat<00:03:05.919> beltless<00:03:06.340> at<00:03:06.549> least<00:03:06.730> on<00:03:06.879> Mondays<00:03:07.269> and

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
squat beltless at least on Mondays and

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.000 
squat beltless at least on Mondays and
Wednesdays<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:08.109> then<00:03:08.230> might<00:03:08.469> have<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:08.769> throw

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
Wednesdays and then might have to throw

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.300 
Wednesdays and then might have to throw
a<00:03:09.040> belt<00:03:09.370> on<00:03:09.549> on<00:03:09.760> Fridays<00:03:10.239> just<00:03:10.540> from<00:03:10.810> the

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
a belt on on Fridays just from the

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.679 
a belt on on Fridays just from the
accumulated<00:03:12.310> fatigue<00:03:12.609> throughout<00:03:13.329> the<00:03:13.480> week

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:13.689 
accumulated fatigue throughout the week

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:17.009 
accumulated fatigue throughout the week
but<00:03:14.579> lower<00:03:15.579> back<00:03:15.879> and<00:03:16.090> everything<00:03:16.510> still<00:03:16.780> felt

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
but lower back and everything still felt

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.830 
but lower back and everything still felt
fine<00:03:17.319> during<00:03:17.680> this<00:03:17.919> workout<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:19.480> you<00:03:19.569> can<00:03:19.689> see

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
fine during this workout so you can see

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.770 
fine during this workout so you can see
again<00:03:20.169> at<00:03:20.409> each<00:03:20.560> rep<00:03:20.889> on<00:03:21.150> at<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.329> top<00:03:22.540> I'm

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
again at each rep on at the top I'm

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.539 
again at each rep on at the top I'm
really<00:03:23.049> focusing<00:03:23.590> on<00:03:23.739> pulling<00:03:24.010> my<00:03:24.219> elbows

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
really focusing on pulling my elbows

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:30.839 
really focusing on pulling my elbows
down<00:03:24.790> before<00:03:25.209> i<00:03:25.239> start<00:03:26.199> the<00:03:26.230> rep<00:03:26.849> and<00:03:29.849> it's

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
down before i start the rep and it's

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.300 
down before i start the rep and it's
tough<00:03:31.209> it<00:03:31.419> definitely<00:03:31.900> adds<00:03:32.199> a<00:03:32.919> little<00:03:33.010> bit<00:03:33.159> of

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
tough it definitely adds a little bit of

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.099 
tough it definitely adds a little bit of
stress<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:34.030> your<00:03:34.150> shoulders<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:34.930> it's

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
stress to your shoulders and it's

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.890 
stress to your shoulders and it's
probably<00:03:35.879> another<00:03:36.879> thing<00:03:37.269> that<00:03:37.419> i<00:03:37.449> can<00:03:37.689> work

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
probably another thing that i can work

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.039 
probably another thing that i can work
on<00:03:38.139> with<00:03:38.919> mobility<00:03:39.370> work<00:03:39.819> is<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.599> get<00:03:40.780> more

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
on with mobility work is to get more

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.869 
on with mobility work is to get more
comfortable<00:03:41.349> in<00:03:41.799> this<00:03:41.919> position<00:03:41.979> with<00:03:42.699> my

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
comfortable in this position with my

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:50.850 
comfortable in this position with my
elbows<00:03:43.269> tucked

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.550 

so<00:03:51.520> after<00:03:51.670> squats<00:03:52.270> today<00:03:52.510> I<00:03:52.660> hit<00:03:53.020> bench<00:03:53.260> press

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
so after squats today I hit bench press

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.530 
so after squats today I hit bench press
today<00:03:53.770> was<00:03:54.040> actually<00:03:54.190> squat<00:03:54.850> bench<00:03:55.210> and

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
today was actually squat bench and

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.810 
today was actually squat bench and
deadlift<00:03:56.140> this<00:03:56.890> was<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.160> first<00:03:57.370> time<00:03:57.550> that<00:03:57.610> I

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
deadlift this was the first time that I

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.370 
deadlift this was the first time that I
hit<00:03:58.030> that<00:03:58.270> and<00:03:58.510> actually<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:59.080> first<00:03:59.230> time

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
hit that and actually the first time

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.080 
hit that and actually the first time
that<00:03:59.500> I've<00:03:59.740> ever<00:03:59.950> trained<00:04:00.520> all<00:04:00.760> three

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
that I've ever trained all three

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.680 
that I've ever trained all three
movements<00:04:01.360> in<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:02.590> same<00:04:02.830> day<00:04:03.070> aside<00:04:03.490> from<00:04:03.850> the

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
movements in the same day aside from the

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.540 
movements in the same day aside from the
two<00:04:04.720> powerlifting<00:04:05.560> meets<00:04:05.770> that<00:04:05.920> I've<00:04:06.070> done<00:04:06.280> so

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
two powerlifting meets that I've done so

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.070 
two powerlifting meets that I've done so
it<00:04:06.640> was<00:04:06.730> definitely<00:04:06.850> a<00:04:07.150> tough<00:04:07.360> workout<00:04:08.970> it

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
it was definitely a tough workout it

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.050 
it was definitely a tough workout it
just<00:04:11.080> wrecks<00:04:11.410> you<00:04:11.620> all<00:04:12.010> together<00:04:12.340> my<00:04:12.820> bench

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
just wrecks you all together my bench

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.840 
just wrecks you all together my bench
here<00:04:13.480> was<00:04:13.950> feeling<00:04:14.950> a<00:04:15.010> little<00:04:15.040> bit<00:04:15.370> heavy<00:04:15.580> I've

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
here was feeling a little bit heavy I've

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.479 
here was feeling a little bit heavy I've
noticed<00:04:16.269> that<00:04:16.570> my<00:04:17.440> first<00:04:17.769> set<00:04:18.100> of<00:04:18.130> bench

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
noticed that my first set of bench

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.730 
noticed that my first set of bench
usually<00:04:19.060> feels<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.540> worst<00:04:19.840> and<00:04:20.700> then<00:04:22.740> my

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
usually feels the worst and then my

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.250 
usually feels the worst and then my
second<00:04:24.160> set<00:04:24.430> and<00:04:24.610> third<00:04:24.720> set<00:04:25.720> actually<00:04:25.870> feel

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
second set and third set actually feel

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.870 
second set and third set actually feel
better<00:04:26.590> they<00:04:26.830> feel<00:04:27.040> lighter<00:04:27.340> i<00:04:27.460> don't<00:04:27.669> know<00:04:27.760> if

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
better they feel lighter i don't know if

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.940 
better they feel lighter i don't know if
it's<00:04:28.060> just<00:04:28.270> cuz<00:04:29.280> i'm<00:04:30.280> used<00:04:30.910> to<00:04:31.030> the<00:04:31.150> weight<00:04:31.330> or

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
it's just cuz i'm used to the weight or

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.530 
it's just cuz i'm used to the weight or
maybe<00:04:32.950> i<00:04:33.040> need<00:04:33.220> to<00:04:33.580> warm<00:04:33.850> up<00:04:34.030> a<00:04:34.150> little<00:04:34.180> bit

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
maybe i need to warm up a little bit

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.060 
maybe i need to warm up a little bit
more<00:04:34.750> spend<00:04:35.169> some<00:04:35.320> more<00:04:35.440> time<00:04:35.500> with<00:04:35.710> lighter

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
more spend some more time with lighter

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.180 
more spend some more time with lighter
weight<00:04:36.370> and<00:04:36.610> then<00:04:37.110> get<00:04:38.110> into<00:04:38.260> it<00:04:38.560> because<00:04:38.710> the

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
weight and then get into it because the

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.340 
weight and then get into it because the
first<00:04:39.430> step<00:04:39.610> might<00:04:39.640> actually<00:04:40.090> be<00:04:40.510> getting<00:04:41.080> me

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
first step might actually be getting me

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:47.130 
first step might actually be getting me
fully<00:04:41.620> warmed<00:04:41.919> up<00:04:45.240> so<00:04:46.240> here<00:04:46.450> you<00:04:46.540> can<00:04:46.570> see<00:04:46.930> I'm

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
fully warmed up so here you can see I'm

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.650 
fully warmed up so here you can see I'm
going<00:04:47.320> to<00:04:47.380> I'm<00:04:47.790> pausing<00:04:48.790> all<00:04:48.970> my<00:04:49.150> bench<00:04:49.390> work

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
going to I'm pausing all my bench work

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.550 
going to I'm pausing all my bench work
i'm<00:04:49.930> probably<00:04:50.230> going<00:04:50.650> to<00:04:50.740> be<00:04:50.860> doing<00:04:50.980> that<00:04:51.340> from

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
i'm probably going to be doing that from

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.090 
i'm probably going to be doing that from
for<00:04:53.560> a<00:04:54.010> while<00:04:54.360> just<00:04:55.360> because<00:04:55.630> i<00:04:55.720> am<00:04:56.100> focusing

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
for a while just because i am focusing

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.610 
for a while just because i am focusing
on<00:04:57.220> powerlifting<00:04:57.880> right<00:04:58.090> now<00:04:58.270> and<00:04:58.479> obviously

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
on powerlifting right now and obviously

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.040 
on powerlifting right now and obviously
at<00:04:59.620> powerlifting<00:05:00.250> meet<00:05:00.310> you<00:05:00.640> have<00:05:00.820> to<00:05:01.090> pause

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
at powerlifting meet you have to pause

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.740 
at powerlifting meet you have to pause
the<00:05:02.290> bar<00:05:02.470> on<00:05:02.680> your<00:05:02.890> chest<00:05:03.280> and<00:05:03.580> sometimes<00:05:04.540> it

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
the bar on your chest and sometimes it

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.330 
the bar on your chest and sometimes it
looks<00:05:05.050> like<00:05:05.290> i<00:05:05.410> might<00:05:05.560> not<00:05:05.740> be<00:05:05.860> pausing<00:05:06.310> for

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
looks like i might not be pausing for

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.240 
looks like i might not be pausing for
very<00:05:06.640> long<00:05:06.850> it<00:05:07.060> always<00:05:07.500> feels<00:05:08.500> like<00:05:08.950> you're

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
very long it always feels like you're

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.480 
very long it always feels like you're
pausing<00:05:09.700> it<00:05:09.850> for<00:05:10.390> like<00:05:11.110> an<00:05:11.260> hour<00:05:11.440> and<00:05:11.830> it's

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
pausing it for like an hour and it's

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.670 
pausing it for like an hour and it's
almost<00:05:13.270> a<00:05:13.479> touch-and-go<00:05:13.690> rep<00:05:14.229> so<00:05:14.500> that's

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
almost a touch-and-go rep so that's

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.960 
almost a touch-and-go rep so that's
something<00:05:14.860> else<00:05:15.070> that<00:05:15.190> I<00:05:15.310> need<00:05:15.370> to<00:05:15.520> work<00:05:15.790> on

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
something else that I need to work on

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.490 
something else that I need to work on
it's<00:05:16.180> always<00:05:16.419> tougher<00:05:16.780> to<00:05:16.990> when<00:05:17.229> you<00:05:17.320> don't

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
it's always tougher to when you don't

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.140 
it's always tougher to when you don't
have<00:05:17.590> someone<00:05:17.650> giving<00:05:18.100> you<00:05:18.280> commands<00:05:18.820> like<00:05:18.970> in

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
have someone giving you commands like in

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.480 
have someone giving you commands like in
a<00:05:19.240> meet<00:05:19.479> where<00:05:19.750> they'll<00:05:19.900> tell<00:05:20.169> you<00:05:20.320> to<00:05:21.190> press

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
a meet where they'll tell you to press

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.250 
a meet where they'll tell you to press
so<00:05:21.820> I'm<00:05:22.000> kind<00:05:22.240> of<00:05:22.330> trying<00:05:22.479> to<00:05:22.600> do<00:05:22.780> that<00:05:22.930> in<00:05:23.110> my

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
so I'm kind of trying to do that in my

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.020 
so I'm kind of trying to do that in my
head<00:05:23.470> but<00:05:24.190> here<00:05:24.400> I<00:05:24.430> think<00:05:24.669> it<00:05:24.790> looks<00:05:24.820> pretty

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
head but here I think it looks pretty

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.560 
head but here I think it looks pretty
good<00:05:25.450> and<00:05:25.720> also<00:05:26.590> in<00:05:27.130> some<00:05:27.850> past<00:05:28.090> videos<00:05:28.419> I

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
good and also in some past videos I

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.210 
good and also in some past videos I
talked<00:05:28.780> about<00:05:29.020> the<00:05:29.140> bar<00:05:29.320> path<00:05:29.590> on<00:05:29.860> my<00:05:30.040> bench

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
talked about the bar path on my bench

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.050 
talked about the bar path on my bench
press<00:05:30.550> and<00:05:30.790> that<00:05:31.570> I<00:05:31.600> thought<00:05:31.930> it<00:05:32.110> should<00:05:32.380> be<00:05:32.740> a

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
press and that I thought it should be a

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.120 
press and that I thought it should be a
little<00:05:34.060> bit<00:05:34.240> more<00:05:34.390> vertical<00:05:34.930> as<00:05:35.140> opposed<00:05:35.890> to

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
little bit more vertical as opposed to

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.040 
little bit more vertical as opposed to
this<00:05:36.250> kind<00:05:36.520> of<00:05:36.669> j-curve<00:05:37.180> that<00:05:37.510> you<00:05:37.600> see<00:05:37.810> here

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
this kind of j-curve that you see here

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.930 
this kind of j-curve that you see here
where<00:05:38.260> it's<00:05:38.380> lowering<00:05:38.860> down<00:05:39.100> to<00:05:39.310> my<00:05:39.430> chest<00:05:39.700> and

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
where it's lowering down to my chest and

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.730 
where it's lowering down to my chest and
then<00:05:40.000> pressing<00:05:40.510> back<00:05:40.720> up<00:05:40.990> towards<00:05:41.380> my<00:05:41.500> head

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
then pressing back up towards my head

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.280 
then pressing back up towards my head
and<00:05:41.979> a<00:05:42.850> lot<00:05:43.030> of<00:05:43.120> you<00:05:43.180> guys<00:05:43.210> said<00:05:43.750> that<00:05:43.990> it's

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
and a lot of you guys said that it's

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.430 
and a lot of you guys said that it's
actually<00:05:44.710> not<00:05:44.860> bad<00:05:45.220> form<00:05:46.210> to<00:05:46.300> do<00:05:46.570> that<00:05:46.750> so<00:05:47.410> I

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
actually not bad form to do that so I

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.350 
actually not bad form to do that so I
looked<00:05:47.680> a<00:05:47.770> little<00:05:47.919> bit<00:05:48.130> more<00:05:48.340> into<00:05:48.729> some<00:05:49.120> bench

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
looked a little bit more into some bench

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.650 
looked a little bit more into some bench
press<00:05:49.720> technique<00:05:50.550> videos<00:05:51.550> and<00:05:51.910> articles<00:05:52.090> and

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
press technique videos and articles and

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.480 
press technique videos and articles and
a<00:05:52.750> lot<00:05:53.200> of<00:05:53.290> people<00:05:53.410> actually<00:05:53.620> do<00:05:53.950> recommend

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
a lot of people actually do recommend

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.840 
a lot of people actually do recommend
this<00:05:54.700> kind<00:05:55.000> of<00:05:55.090> J<00:05:55.360> curve<00:05:55.750> path<00:05:56.200> so<00:05:57.130> it<00:05:57.610> does

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
this kind of J curve path so it does

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.750 
this kind of J curve path so it does
feel<00:05:58.120> the<00:05:58.300> most<00:05:58.510> powerful<00:05:58.870> for<00:05:59.560> me<00:05:59.590> and<00:05:59.950> I<00:06:00.610> was

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
feel the most powerful for me and I was

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.740 
feel the most powerful for me and I was
really<00:06:00.970> going<00:06:01.090> to<00:06:01.180> change<00:06:01.330> it<00:06:01.479> because<00:06:01.599> I

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
really going to change it because I

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.150 
really going to change it because I
thought<00:06:01.960> the<00:06:02.380> that<00:06:03.099> my<00:06:03.190> form<00:06:03.490> was<00:06:03.550> wrong

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
thought the that my form was wrong

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.210 
thought the that my form was wrong
but<00:06:04.720> seems<00:06:05.720> like<00:06:05.810> it's<00:06:06.080> okay<00:06:06.470> I<00:06:06.740> mean<00:06:07.040> I<00:06:07.070> never

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
but seems like it's okay I mean I never

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.350 
but seems like it's okay I mean I never
have<00:06:07.730> any<00:06:07.760> pain<00:06:08.240> and<00:06:08.480> my<00:06:08.630> shoulders<00:06:09.140> or<00:06:10.360> elbows

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
have any pain and my shoulders or elbows

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.320 
have any pain and my shoulders or elbows
or<00:06:11.630> anything<00:06:12.280> from<00:06:13.280> doing<00:06:13.640> it<00:06:13.760> this<00:06:13.910> way<00:06:13.970> and

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
or anything from doing it this way and

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.280 
or anything from doing it this way and
it<00:06:14.420> does<00:06:14.600> feel<00:06:14.810> the<00:06:14.960> most<00:06:15.110> powerful<00:06:17.140> so<00:06:18.140> those

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.290 
it does feel the most powerful so those

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.810 
it does feel the most powerful so those
were<00:06:18.440> my<00:06:18.590> event<00:06:18.890> that<00:06:19.100> was<00:06:19.190> my<00:06:19.310> bench<00:06:19.520> press

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
were my event that was my bench press

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.880 
were my event that was my bench press
there<00:06:20.120> that<00:06:20.690> was<00:06:20.840> a<00:06:20.870> five-pound<00:06:21.410> jump<00:06:21.710> from

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:21.890 
there that was a five-pound jump from

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.500 
there that was a five-pound jump from
the<00:06:22.010> previous<00:06:22.430> work<00:06:22.640> out<00:06:22.880> here's<00:06:23.360> my

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510 
the previous work out here's my

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.010 
the previous work out here's my
deadlifts<00:06:24.280> last<00:06:25.280> week<00:06:25.520> I<00:06:25.670> hit<00:06:25.850> 365<00:06:26.600> so<00:06:26.960> I'm

pace<00:06:31.820> with<00:06:31.850> my<00:06:32.300> squats<00:06:32.780> which<00:06:33.050> are<00:06:33.200> going<00:06:33.470> up

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590

to have my deadlift lag too far behind
the<00:06:40.480> deadlifts<00:06:41.480> definitely<00:06:41.930> felt<00:06:42.200> better

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
the deadlifts definitely felt better

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.050

than<00:06:42.680> they<00:06:42.830> did<00:06:42.890> last<00:06:43.040> week<00:06:43.550> I'm<00:06:43.730> getting<00:06:44.000> a

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
than they did last week I'm getting a

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.280 
than they did last week I'm getting a
little<00:06:44.180> bit<00:06:44.360> more<00:06:44.510> comfortable<00:06:45.050> with<00:06:45.200> the

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.290 
little bit more comfortable with the

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.130 
little bit more comfortable with the
form<00:06:45.560> again<00:06:45.890> but<00:06:46.640> I<00:06:46.670> still<00:06:46.970> feel<00:06:47.270> like<00:06:47.300> my<00:06:47.750> form

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:48.140 
form again but I still feel like my form

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.470 
form again but I still feel like my form
doesn't<00:06:48.740> look<00:06:49.010> too<00:06:49.310> great<00:06:49.730> there's<00:06:50.210> a<00:06:50.270> little

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:50.480 
doesn't look too great there's a little

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:56.200 
doesn't look too great there's a little
bit<00:06:50.690> of<00:06:50.750> background<00:06:53.650> injure<00:06:54.650> asst<00:06:54.830> but<00:06:55.790> it

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.210 
bit of background injure asst but it

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.710 
bit of background injure asst but it
definitely<00:06:58.000> could<00:06:59.000> be<00:06:59.060> a<00:06:59.240> little<00:06:59.480> bit

00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720 
definitely could be a little bit

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.810 
definitely could be a little bit
straighter<00:07:00.080> my<00:07:00.380> back<00:07:00.590> definitely<00:07:01.400> have<00:07:01.790> a

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:01.820 
straighter my back definitely have a

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.950 
straighter my back definitely have a
little<00:07:02.180> bit<00:07:02.330> of<00:07:02.360> rounding<00:07:02.960> they're<00:07:04.660> so<00:07:05.660> gonna

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 
little bit of rounding they're so gonna

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.450 
little bit of rounding they're so gonna
have<00:07:06.140> to<00:07:06.260> work<00:07:06.410> on<00:07:06.590> that<00:07:06.620> just<00:07:07.100> get<00:07:07.250> more

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:07.460 
have to work on that just get more

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.190 
have to work on that just get more
comfortable<00:07:07.730> with<00:07:08.090> the<00:07:08.390> form<00:07:08.690> i<00:07:08.900> think

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:09.200 
comfortable with the form i think

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.140 
comfortable with the form i think
especially<00:07:09.650> after<00:07:10.160> squatting<00:07:10.760> it's<00:07:10.910> pretty

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.150 
especially after squatting it's pretty

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.410 
especially after squatting it's pretty
difficult<00:07:11.890> so<00:07:12.890> i<00:07:13.340> might<00:07:13.700> have<00:07:13.880> to<00:07:14.030> spend<00:07:14.240> some

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:14.420 
difficult so i might have to spend some

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.180 
difficult so i might have to spend some
time<00:07:14.570> with<00:07:14.780> just<00:07:15.170> some<00:07:15.350> lighter<00:07:15.590> weight<00:07:15.920> maybe

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:16.190 
time with just some lighter weight maybe

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.330 
time with just some lighter weight maybe
even<00:07:16.430> like<00:07:16.700> 135<00:07:17.300> or<00:07:17.720> 225<00:07:18.200> just<00:07:18.770> getting<00:07:19.040> a<00:07:19.160> lot

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:19.340 
even like 135 or 225 just getting a lot

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.460 
even like 135 or 225 just getting a lot
more<00:07:19.610> rep<00:07:20.180> working<00:07:20.660> because<00:07:20.870> right<00:07:21.169> now<00:07:21.200> i'm

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:26.600 
and obviously just like a few sets of

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.060 
and obviously just like a few sets of
warm-up<00:07:27.080> reps<00:07:27.440> but<00:07:29.290> after<00:07:30.290> deadlifts<00:07:30.800> i<00:07:30.890> just

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:31.070 
warm-up reps but after deadlifts i just

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.710 
warm-up reps but after deadlifts i just
finished<00:07:31.400> up<00:07:31.550> with<00:07:31.700> some<00:07:31.850> cable<00:07:32.210> crunches<00:07:32.630> I

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 
finished up with some cable crunches I

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.070

did<00:07:32.870> four<00:07:33.169> sets<00:07:33.500> of<00:07:33.620> 10<00:07:33.890> so<00:07:34.190> this<00:07:34.310> is<00:07:34.460> just<00:07:35.080> one

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080

of the sets here I figured I'd throw it
in<00:07:37.760> there<00:07:38.030> but<00:07:38.870> that<00:07:39.020> was<00:07:39.200> it<00:07:39.320> for<00:07:39.350> this
