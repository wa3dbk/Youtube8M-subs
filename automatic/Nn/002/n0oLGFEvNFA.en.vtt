00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:06.840 
everybody today I'm going to review the

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.310 
everybody today I'm going to review the
master<00:00:07.470> lock<00:00:08.120> combination<00:00:09.120> padlock<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.660> this

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
master lock combination padlock and this

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.710 
master lock combination padlock and this
one<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.740> numbers<00:00:11.220> model<00:00:12.920> 653<00:00:13.920> d<00:00:14.220> and<00:00:14.720> the

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:15.720 
one is numbers model 653 d and the

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.779 
one is numbers model 653 d and the
reason<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.139> got<00:00:16.170> this<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.949> that<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.279> wanted

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
reason I got this is that I wanted

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.660 
reason I got this is that I wanted
something<00:00:18.060> very<00:00:18.359> simple<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.349> take<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.430> gym

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
something very simple to take to the gym

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.770 
something very simple to take to the gym
with<00:00:20.820> me<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.210> was<00:00:21.930> looking<00:00:22.260> online<00:00:22.440> and<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.460> was

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:23.780 
with me I was looking online and I was

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.830 
with me I was looking online and I was
researching<00:00:24.780> different<00:00:25.190> padlocks<00:00:26.190> and<00:00:26.840> I

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
researching different padlocks and I

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.769 
researching different padlocks and I
didn't<00:00:28.350> want<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.680> one<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:28.970> rotates<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.750> the

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
didn't want the one that rotates to the

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.299 
didn't want the one that rotates to the
left<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.500> right<00:00:31.590> because<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.009> always

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
left and to the right because I always

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.060 
left and to the right because I always
always<00:00:32.879> forget<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:34.020> numbers<00:00:34.379> at<00:00:34.590> some<00:00:34.800> point

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
always forget the numbers at some point

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.790 
always forget the numbers at some point
and<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.940> didn't<00:00:36.239> want<00:00:36.479> the<00:00:37.050> one<00:00:37.229> that<00:00:37.409> goes<00:00:37.559> like

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
and I didn't want the one that goes like

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.629 
and I didn't want the one that goes like
this<00:00:38.010> because<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:39.499> don't<00:00:40.499> know<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:41.190> just<00:00:41.339> seems

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:41.639 
this because I don't know it just seems

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:44.809 
this because I don't know it just seems
weird<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.600> cumbersome<00:00:43.589> and<00:00:43.889> I<00:00:44.309> also<00:00:44.489> didn't

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:44.819 
weird and cumbersome and I also didn't

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:47.149 
weird and cumbersome and I also didn't
want<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.149> one<00:00:45.329> with<00:00:45.359> the<00:00:45.629> letters<00:00:45.989> because<00:00:46.679> I

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159 
want the one with the letters because I

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:49.700 
want the one with the letters because I
just<00:00:47.940> prefer<00:00:48.239> numbers<00:00:48.659> it's<00:00:48.929> easier<00:00:49.440> for<00:00:49.499> me

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
just prefer numbers it's easier for me

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.759 
just prefer numbers it's easier for me
to<00:00:49.829> remember<00:00:50.249> the<00:00:51.179> other<00:00:51.329> criteria<00:00:52.109> that<00:00:52.710> I

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
to remember the other criteria that I

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:54.680 
to remember the other criteria that I
needed<00:00:53.100> was<00:00:53.460> something<00:00:53.729> small<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.479> not<00:00:54.629> too

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
needed was something small and not too

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.250 
needed was something small and not too
not<00:00:55.350> too<00:00:55.409> big<00:00:55.709> not<00:00:55.920> too<00:00:55.979> heavy<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:57.049> while<00:00:58.049> this

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
not too big not too heavy and while this

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.520 
not too big not too heavy and while this
is<00:00:58.499> kind<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.920> hefty<00:00:59.399> it's<00:01:00.120> not<00:01:00.420> too<00:01:00.719> heavy<00:01:00.929> now

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
is kind of hefty it's not too heavy now

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.770 
is kind of hefty it's not too heavy now
one<00:01:02.429> thing<00:01:02.639> I<00:01:02.819> have<00:01:02.909> to<00:01:03.089> say<00:01:03.119> is<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.659> really

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
one thing I have to say is that I really

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.510 
one thing I have to say is that I really
I<00:01:04.440> I<00:01:04.890> was<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.280> almost<00:01:05.760> did<00:01:06.180> not<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.840> this

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
I I was I almost did not get this

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.960 
I I was I almost did not get this
because<00:01:08.900> it<00:01:09.900> had<00:01:10.080> some<00:01:10.440> bad<00:01:10.620> reviews<00:01:10.970> on

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
because it had some bad reviews on

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.340 
because it had some bad reviews on
Amazon<00:01:13.430> people<00:01:14.430> had<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.880> hard<00:01:15.210> time<00:01:15.350> studying

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
Amazon people had a hard time studying

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.820 
Amazon people had a hard time studying
the<00:01:16.470> combination<00:01:17.190> or<00:01:17.550> they<00:01:17.880> were<00:01:17.940> saying<00:01:18.330> that

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
the combination or they were saying that

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.250 
the combination or they were saying that
somehow<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.010> combination<00:01:20.820> got<00:01:21.000> reset<00:01:21.480> well

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
somehow the combination got reset well

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.550 
somehow the combination got reset well
I've<00:01:22.620> had<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.400> one<00:01:23.760> now<00:01:24.060> for<00:01:24.090> almost<00:01:25.080> two

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
I've had this one now for almost two

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.190 
I've had this one now for almost two
months<00:01:25.590> now<00:01:25.980> and<00:01:26.430> have<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.360> say<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
months now and have to say this is the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.890 
months now and have to say this is the
simplest<00:01:28.740> easiest<00:01:29.390> way<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.420> set<00:01:30.870> a

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
simplest easiest way to set a

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.880 
simplest easiest way to set a
combination<00:01:31.710> I've<00:01:31.890> seen<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.910> any<00:01:33.840> lock<00:01:34.140> in

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
combination I've seen in any lock in

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.040 
combination I've seen in any lock in
fact<00:01:35.160> the<00:01:35.370> most<00:01:35.670> locks<00:01:35.970> use<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.420> same<00:01:36.660> kind<00:01:36.990> of

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
fact the most locks use the same kind of

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.880 
fact the most locks use the same kind of
method<00:01:37.440> but<00:01:38.190> it<00:01:38.400> really<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:39.080> stupid<00:01:40.080> simple<00:01:40.470> so

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
method but it really is stupid simple so

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.850 
method but it really is stupid simple so
let<00:01:41.070> me<00:01:41.160> demonstrate<00:01:41.310> how<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.480> works<00:01:42.510> so<00:01:42.990> right

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
let me demonstrate how it works so right

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.370 
let me demonstrate how it works so right
now<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.100> bet<00:01:44.550> of<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.960> combination<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.080> set<00:01:46.260> to

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
now the bet of the combination is set to

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.620 
now the bet of the combination is set to
one<00:01:46.530> two<00:01:46.680> three<00:01:46.890> four<00:01:47.190> one<00:01:47.970> two<00:01:48.030> three<00:01:48.360> four

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
one two three four one two three four

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.470 
one two three four one two three four
and<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.380> see<00:01:49.650> how<00:01:49.740> there's<00:01:50.010> a<00:01:50.070> little<00:01:50.480> notch

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
and you see how there's a little notch

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.780 
and you see how there's a little notch
right<00:01:51.510> there<00:01:54.560> you<00:01:55.560> have<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.860> rotate<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.520> to

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
right there you have to rotate this to

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.690 
right there you have to rotate this to
that<00:01:57.000> dot<00:01:58.610> press<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.380> rotate<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.700> like

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
that dot press it and rotate it like

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.810 
that dot press it and rotate it like
this<00:02:02.930> now<00:02:03.930> any<00:02:04.260> combination<00:02:05.220> you<00:02:05.250> put<00:02:05.640> here

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
this now any combination you put here

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.399 
this now any combination you put here
will<00:02:06.620> work<00:02:07.620> will<00:02:08.550> be<00:02:08.729> set<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.780> I'm<00:02:10.080> just<00:02:10.259> going

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:10.409 
will work will be set so I'm just going

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.369 
will work will be set so I'm just going
to<00:02:10.440> set<00:02:10.769> it<00:02:10.800> back<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.069> zero<00:02:11.489> zero<00:02:11.790> zero

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
to set it back to zero zero zero

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.459 
to set it back to zero zero zero
zero<00:02:14.379> and<00:02:14.680> all<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:15.549> have<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.760> do<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.989> pull<00:02:17.439> back

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:17.469 
zero and all you have to do is pull back

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:20.309 
zero and all you have to do is pull back
so<00:02:18.400> now<00:02:18.579> it's<00:02:18.819> at<00:02:19.000> zero<00:02:19.030> zero<00:02:19.359> zero<00:02:19.629> you<00:02:19.989> see<00:02:20.230> it

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
so now it's at zero zero zero you see it

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.809 
so now it's at zero zero zero you see it
goes<00:02:20.650> freely<00:02:21.219> if<00:02:21.879> I<00:02:22.090> changes<00:02:22.689> it<00:02:23.260> locks<00:02:23.819> now

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
goes freely if I changes it locks now

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.080 
goes freely if I changes it locks now
one<00:02:25.420> thing<00:02:25.599> I<00:02:25.689> would<00:02:25.870> recommend<00:02:26.049> is<00:02:26.939> when<00:02:27.939> you

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
one thing I would recommend is when you

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.410 
one thing I would recommend is when you
put<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.510> back<00:02:28.540> in<00:02:28.719> your<00:02:28.989> backpack<00:02:29.859> just<00:02:30.819> go

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
put it back in your backpack just go

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.199 
put it back in your backpack just go
like<00:02:31.569> this<00:02:31.599> and<00:02:32.049> lock<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:32.829> so<00:02:33.069> so<00:02:33.489> so<00:02:33.939> it<00:02:34.000> locks

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
like this and lock it so so so it locks

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.330 
like this and lock it so so so it locks
and<00:02:34.719> there's<00:02:34.959> no<00:02:37.019> freak<00:02:38.019> way<00:02:38.409> for<00:02:38.859> this<00:02:39.010> to

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
and there's no freak way for this to

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.379 
and there's no freak way for this to
actually<00:02:39.579> go<00:02:40.120> in<00:02:40.739> rotate<00:02:41.739> 180<00:02:42.609> or<00:02:42.939> 90<00:02:43.269> degrees

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:43.389 
actually go in rotate 180 or 90 degrees

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.349 
actually go in rotate 180 or 90 degrees
extra<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.500> set<00:02:45.159> it<00:02:45.280> someone<00:02:45.639> somehow<00:02:46.150> to

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
extra and set it someone somehow to

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.449 
extra and set it someone somehow to
something<00:02:46.870> else<00:02:47.079> I'm<00:02:47.769> not<00:02:48.010> seeing<00:02:48.310> that

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
something else I'm not seeing that

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.690 
something else I'm not seeing that
happening<00:02:49.060> but<00:02:49.269> you<00:02:49.480> know<00:02:49.629> what<00:02:49.840> if<00:02:50.549> you<00:02:51.549> if

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
happening but you know what if you if

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.780 
happening but you know what if you if
you<00:02:51.879> really<00:02:52.180> want<00:02:52.419> to<00:02:52.569> be<00:02:52.689> sure<00:02:52.959> just<00:02:53.790> just

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
you really want to be sure just just

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.539 
you really want to be sure just just
lock<00:02:55.419> it<00:02:55.450> by<00:02:55.840> moving<00:02:56.260> but<00:02:56.560> twisting<00:02:57.010> it<00:02:57.159> by<00:02:57.310> one

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
lock it by moving but twisting it by one

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.740 
lock it by moving but twisting it by one
and<00:02:57.879> you're<00:02:58.419> all<00:02:58.569> set<00:02:59.370> so<00:03:00.419> obviously<00:03:01.419> this<00:03:01.689> is

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
and you're all set so obviously this is

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.940 
and you're all set so obviously this is
not<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:02.319> most<00:03:02.909> secure<00:03:03.909> lock<00:03:04.569> on<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.469> planet

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
not the most secure lock on the planet

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.300 
not the most secure lock on the planet
but<00:03:06.790> going<00:03:07.719> to<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:07.989> gym<00:03:08.200> this<00:03:08.409> is<00:03:08.469> perfect<00:03:09.159> I

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
but going to the gym this is perfect I

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.089 
but going to the gym this is perfect I
really<00:03:09.760> really<00:03:10.120> I<00:03:10.389> am<00:03:10.870> happy<00:03:11.319> that<00:03:11.349> I<00:03:11.500> got<00:03:11.829> this

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
really really I am happy that I got this

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.839 
really really I am happy that I got this
lock<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:12.790> I<00:03:13.719> give<00:03:13.989> it<00:03:14.019> a<00:03:14.200> full<00:03:14.379> thumbs<00:03:14.709> up<00:03:14.980> let

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
lock and I give it a full thumbs up let

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.559 
lock and I give it a full thumbs up let
me<00:03:15.939> quickly<00:03:16.209> show<00:03:16.449> you<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.840> dimensions<00:03:17.829> here

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
me quickly show you the dimensions here

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:26.339 
me quickly show you the dimensions here
so<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:20.769> loop<00:03:21.040> itself<00:03:21.609> is<00:03:22.829> about<00:03:23.829> one<00:03:24.220> inch<00:03:25.349> the

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
so the loop itself is about one inch the

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.809 
so the loop itself is about one inch the
total<00:03:26.709> width<00:03:26.919> is<00:03:27.190> about<00:03:27.489> two<00:03:27.729> inches

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.929 

same<00:03:30.819> as<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.989> length<00:03:32.290> and<00:03:32.620> total<00:03:33.489> length<00:03:33.639> is

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:33.939 
same as the length and total length is

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:38.460 
same as the length and total length is
about<00:03:34.329> I<00:03:35.579> would<00:03:36.579> say<00:03:36.699> thread<00:03:37.090> 3<00:03:38.079> and<00:03:38.169> a<00:03:38.199> half<00:03:38.319> a

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
about I would say thread 3 and a half a

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.740 
about I would say thread 3 and a half a
little<00:03:38.680> less<00:03:38.829> than<00:03:39.040> three<00:03:39.220> and<00:03:39.280> a<00:03:39.370> half<00:03:39.579> and<00:03:39.909> in

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
little less than three and a half and in

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.229 
little less than three and a half and in
centimeters<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.979> loop<00:03:42.189> is<00:03:42.400> three<00:03:42.729> centimeter

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
centimeters the loop is three centimeter

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.030 
centimeters the loop is three centimeter
centimeters<00:03:45.449> it's<00:03:46.449> at<00:03:47.109> about<00:03:47.169> five<00:03:47.799> and<00:03:47.949> a

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
centimeters it's at about five and a

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.929 
centimeters it's at about five and a
half<00:03:48.099> centimeters<00:03:48.639> in<00:03:49.590> length<00:03:50.590> and<00:03:51.430> width

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:51.939 
half centimeters in length and width

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:54.119 
half centimeters in length and width
here<00:03:52.359> and<00:03:52.599> total<00:03:52.930> length<00:03:53.079> is<00:03:53.379> about<00:03:53.829> eight

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
here and total length is about eight

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.689 
here and total length is about eight
centimeters<00:03:55.530> also<00:03:56.530> I<00:03:56.560> wanted<00:03:56.949> to<00:03:57.009> mention<00:03:57.129> one

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:57.699 
centimeters also I wanted to mention one

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:02.999 
centimeters also I wanted to mention one
-<00:03:58.120> that<00:03:58.419> I<00:03:58.829> that<00:03:59.829> I<00:03:59.859> wish<00:04:00.220> they<00:04:01.049> they<00:04:02.049> fixed<00:04:02.590> on

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:03.009 
- that I that I wish they they fixed on

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:06.390 
- that I that I wish they they fixed on
the<00:04:03.220> next<00:04:03.579> version<00:04:04.560> notice<00:04:05.560> that<00:04:05.799> the<00:04:06.009> numbers

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
the next version notice that the numbers

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.999 
the next version notice that the numbers
are<00:04:06.729> visible<00:04:07.449> for<00:04:07.720> all<00:04:07.959> three<00:04:08.379> sides

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:09.009 
are visible for all three sides

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:11.429 
are visible for all three sides
I<00:04:09.069> wish<00:04:09.489> really<00:04:10.269> that<00:04:10.509> they<00:04:10.659> only<00:04:10.900> add<00:04:11.229> the

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 
I wish really that they only add the

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:14.189 
I wish really that they only add the
numbers<00:04:11.829> visible<00:04:12.400> from<00:04:12.609> one<00:04:12.879> side<00:04:13.209> because

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:14.199 
numbers visible from one side because

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:16.409 
numbers visible from one side because
when<00:04:14.409> you<00:04:14.530> unlock<00:04:14.919> it<00:04:15.280> there's<00:04:15.669> a<00:04:15.729> there's<00:04:16.329> a

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
when you unlock it there's a there's a

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.539 
when you unlock it there's a there's a
higher<00:04:16.690> chance<00:04:16.720> of<00:04:17.380> someone<00:04:17.620> actually<00:04:17.949> seeing

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
higher chance of someone actually seeing

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.080 
higher chance of someone actually seeing
the<00:04:19.479> numbers<00:04:20.010> if<00:04:21.010> they're<00:04:21.310> standing<00:04:21.700> next<00:04:21.909> to

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
the numbers if they're standing next to

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.690 
the numbers if they're standing next to
you

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
you

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.520
