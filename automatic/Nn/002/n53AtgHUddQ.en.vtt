00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:45.990
 You Kon'nichiwa 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:51.720
 Of Table Tennis spree ceiling is Omura in this video was the actual effect in the day-to-day lessons 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:59.250
 I think if you would like to introduce one-point advice, thank you 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:01:07.700
 Yes, this time I would like to explain how to use the neck during backshorting 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:11.450
 a little way to the river called even this a Building 4 District 8 is wrong in the head with students 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:17.630
 If you are gone and the misunderstanding is in, but I think that come a lot 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:23.600
 As a feature of those who do not stabilize the back somehow or get a lot of 8 mistakes 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.619
 There are many people who use the wrist too much or use the wrist incorrectly 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.720
 I think to 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:34.140
 Also etc. say that Deetto backhand 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:39.900
 When you put in to connect to walk and when you put a turn then hit hard and three East 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:42.930
 If you don't give it a use for your wrist and you don't use it, the swing that you wrote on that ball is 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:49.470
 I think I can not 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:50.400
 At first it is time to connect, but in my mind I think that I will not use the wrist almost anymore 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.080
 No thank you 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.570
 a 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:02:01.130
 Wrist Mengo in the direction you are always facing the body surface 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:08.510
 And to give straight missing wrist'll be fixed by bending here 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:11.069
 It is enough to move the arm back and forth from there with the racket and it is enough to do this 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:18.209
 The place where you're moving 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:22.680
 Because the angle of the rear surface changes depending on , the ball is flowing here a little earlier 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:29.159
 When it's too late and it's going to flow here or if you look in various directions 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:31.060
 At the high school, if the direction of the five faces is in the direction that I aimed at, and it goes straight as it is 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:35.349
 Hit here and here too 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:39.400
 Even if you hit it, the ball will move in the direction you aimed at all the time 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:44.230
 There are no more 8 easy to make mistakes by timing 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:48.370
 But if it is this, 8 fast ball can not be taken out and it is always stable 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.080
 If you use this way when taking out a ball that does not miss 8 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:55.880
 The wrist when hit the mid-goal in the opposite 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:03:01.319
 Next time you use it in this direction, you can play the ball strongly 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:04.409
 But this is where timing becomes quite important, and then, when the final rotation is applied 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:10.829
 It means that I will use my wrist here 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:18.269
 So here in and I'll turn over the cola wrist becomes a way against applying the rotation on the ball 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:20.310
 So if you solidify your wrist, it will be stable, if you hit hard, this direction if you apply this direction of rotation 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.310
 Let's use your wrists 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.960
 I will try for a moment 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:38.630
 I am 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:38.630
 First of all said firmly boo 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:50.689
 In is why wear the wrist when striking force to the next 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.420
 It seemed to meet the wrist before 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.110
 Then it is important to hit the ball 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.320
 Boo Boo 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:06.980
 It's a broken shape so if you write how to use your wrist with the ball you want to hit it 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:09.100
 Because so Okuridaseru a ball that is suitable to try doing it aware of this use little 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.100
 Please give me
