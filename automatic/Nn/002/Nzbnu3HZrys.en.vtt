00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:10.959 
I know it's September but I thought

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:13.709 
I know it's September but I thought
since<00:00:11.379> I<00:00:12.340> have<00:00:12.430> over<00:00:12.760> 30<00:00:13.029> of<00:00:13.209> them<00:00:13.360> I<00:00:13.570> would

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:13.719 
since I have over 30 of them I would

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.049 
since I have over 30 of them I would
like<00:00:13.750> to<00:00:13.990> make<00:00:14.199> and<00:00:14.559> maybe<00:00:14.799> more<00:00:15.100> I<00:00:15.400> would

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059 
like to make and maybe more I would

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.500 
like to make and maybe more I would
start<00:00:16.359> a<00:00:16.510> little<00:00:16.690> early<00:00:17.320> so<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:19.210> is<00:00:19.330> what<00:00:19.480> I

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
start a little early so this is what I

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.000 
start a little early so this is what I
made<00:00:19.720> so<00:00:19.960> far<00:00:20.200> I've<00:00:21.190> never<00:00:21.520> used<00:00:23.010> scenic

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
made so far I've never used scenic

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.460 
made so far I've never used scenic
background<00:00:24.730> papers<00:00:25.090> before<00:00:25.300> so<00:00:26.170> what<00:00:26.320> I<00:00:26.380> had

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
background papers before so what I had

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.040 
background papers before so what I had
done<00:00:26.590> was<00:00:26.730> taking<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:27.880> paper<00:00:28.119> to<00:00:28.840> show<00:00:28.869> you

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
done was taking the paper to show you

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:46.290 
done was taking the paper to show you
the<00:00:29.260> original<00:00:37.649> okay<00:00:38.649> here<00:00:39.070> it<00:00:39.220> is<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:46.059> by

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300

the original okay here it is it's by
Forever<00:00:46.989> Friends<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:49.030> this<00:00:49.360> was<00:00:49.510> the<00:00:49.600> original

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
Forever Friends so this was the original

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.110 
Forever Friends so this was the original
piece<00:00:50.170> of<00:00:50.200> paper<00:00:50.530> and<00:00:50.829> I<00:00:51.399> had<00:00:51.489> cut<00:00:51.700> it<00:00:51.790> down<00:00:51.910> to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
piece of paper and I had cut it down to

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.400 
piece of paper and I had cut it down to
size<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:54.160> fit<00:00:54.309> the<00:00:54.340> card<00:00:54.460> and<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:56.170> use

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
size to fit the card and I use

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.280 
size to fit the card and I use
double-sided<00:00:56.860> sticky<00:00:57.399> tape<00:00:57.930> because<00:00:58.930> glue

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
double-sided sticky tape because glue

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.440 
double-sided sticky tape because glue
can<00:00:59.860> be<00:00:59.890> quite<00:01:00.309> messy<00:01:00.520> even<00:01:00.910> with<00:01:01.180> a<00:01:01.210> glue

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
can be quite messy even with a glue

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.810 
can be quite messy even with a glue
stick<00:01:01.480> and<00:01:01.989> might<00:01:02.829> not<00:01:03.010> necessarily<00:01:03.160> stick

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
stick and might not necessarily stick

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.149 
stick and might not necessarily stick
very<00:01:04.059> well<00:01:04.149> so<00:01:05.139> I<00:01:05.199> use<00:01:05.350> double-sided<00:01:05.679> sticky

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
very well so I use double-sided sticky

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.419 
very well so I use double-sided sticky
tape<00:01:06.340> for<00:01:07.119> the<00:01:07.420> sides<00:01:07.929> of<00:01:08.109> the<00:01:08.200> card<00:01:08.439> and<00:01:08.679> then

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:09.429 
tape for the sides of the card and then

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:14.580 
tape for the sides of the card and then
I<00:01:09.549> used<00:01:09.880> those<00:01:10.469> 3d<00:01:11.469> foam<00:01:11.979> squares<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:13.590> attach

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
I used those 3d foam squares to attach

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.879 
I used those 3d foam squares to attach
my<00:01:14.979> image<00:01:15.729> so<00:01:15.999> it<00:01:16.299> does<00:01:16.450> look<00:01:16.689> a<00:01:16.929> little<00:01:17.049> 3d<00:01:17.499> in

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:17.889 
my image so it does look a little 3d in

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:20.789 
my image so it does look a little 3d in
person<00:01:18.429> and<00:01:18.880> I<00:01:19.840> colored<00:01:20.200> it<00:01:20.319> with<00:01:20.350> Copic

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
person and I colored it with Copic

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.340 
person and I colored it with Copic
markers<00:01:21.189> and<00:01:21.490> I<00:01:21.670> added<00:01:21.850> some<00:01:22.270> silver<00:01:22.899> star

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
markers and I added some silver star

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.399 
markers and I added some silver star
stickers<00:01:23.859> so<00:01:24.579> pretty<00:01:24.969> simple<00:01:25.229> because<00:01:26.229> I<00:01:26.319> had

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
stickers so pretty simple because I had

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.730 
stickers so pretty simple because I had
so<00:01:26.590> much<00:01:26.740> of<00:01:26.799> this<00:01:27.270> piece<00:01:28.270> of<00:01:28.420> paper<00:01:28.600> left<00:01:28.810> I

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
so much of this piece of paper left I

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.029 
so much of this piece of paper left I
took<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:31.029> upper<00:01:31.389> part<00:01:31.599> of<00:01:31.659> the<00:01:31.749> paper<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.950> I

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
took the upper part of the paper and I

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:36.209 
took the upper part of the paper and I
cut<00:01:33.249> it<00:01:33.340> out<00:01:33.459> and<00:01:33.789> it<00:01:34.659> was<00:01:34.779> just<00:01:35.079> a<00:01:35.349> snowy<00:01:35.799> scene

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
cut it out and it was just a snowy scene

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.620 
cut it out and it was just a snowy scene
and<00:01:36.639> I<00:01:37.029> colored<00:01:37.929> in<00:01:38.079> an<00:01:38.889> angel<00:01:39.340> attached<00:01:40.329> it

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
and I colored in an angel attached it

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.249 
and I colored in an angel attached it
the<00:01:40.840> same<00:01:41.020> way<00:01:41.229> and<00:01:41.529> added<00:01:41.770> some<00:01:41.920> silver<00:01:42.130> stars

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259

video

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.940 
video
when<00:01:47.770> using<00:01:47.950> double-sided<00:01:48.520> sticky<00:01:49.179> tape

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
when using double-sided sticky tape

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.889 
when using double-sided sticky tape
first<00:01:50.950> thing<00:01:51.099> you<00:01:51.159> want<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:51.369> do<00:01:51.490> is<00:01:51.729> cut<00:01:52.599> your

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
first thing you want to do is cut your

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.729 
first thing you want to do is cut your
paper<00:01:55.079> measure<00:01:56.079> a<00:01:56.169> cut<00:01:56.469> your<00:01:56.560> paper

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:56.739 
paper measure a cut your paper

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:00.359 
paper measure a cut your paper
accordingly<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.840> that<00:01:58.989> way<00:01:59.109> it<00:01:59.229> fits<00:01:59.529> your

accordingly so that way it fits your
cardstock<00:02:01.499> flip<00:02:02.499> it<00:02:02.649> so<00:02:02.829> the<00:02:02.950> pattern<00:02:03.310> is

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:03.989 
cardstock flip it so the pattern is

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:07.120 
cardstock flip it so the pattern is
facing<00:02:04.989> downward

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
facing downward

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.400 
facing downward
and<00:02:07.760> then<00:02:07.970> take<00:02:08.360> your<00:02:08.390> double-sided<00:02:08.899> sticky

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
and then take your double-sided sticky

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.100 
and then take your double-sided sticky
tape<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:11.830> cut<00:02:12.830> off<00:02:13.040> four<00:02:13.490> pieces<00:02:13.870> one<00:02:14.870> for

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
tape and cut off four pieces one for

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.080 
tape and cut off four pieces one for
each<00:02:15.290> side<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:17.030> your<00:02:17.239> paper<00:02:18.940> assuming<00:02:19.940> you

each side of your paper assuming you
have<00:02:20.270> a<00:02:20.300> square<00:02:20.840> or<00:02:21.050> rectangle<00:02:21.800> shape<00:02:22.510> card

have a square or rectangle shape card

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.660 
have a square or rectangle shape card
going<00:02:23.840> on<00:02:26.650> apply<00:02:27.650> it<00:02:27.709> as<00:02:27.950> close<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.520> edge

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
going on apply it as close to the edge

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.370 
going on apply it as close to the edge
as<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:28.970> can<00:02:29.830> but<00:02:30.830> do<00:02:31.040> not<00:02:31.250> remove<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:32.540> plastic

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
as you can but do not remove the plastic

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.360 
as you can but do not remove the plastic
protective<00:02:34.100> backing<00:02:34.640> yet<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:36.260> press<00:02:37.190> it<00:02:37.340> down

protective backing yet and press it down

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.120 
protective backing yet and press it down
quite<00:02:38.060> well<00:02:38.239> that<00:02:38.480> way<00:02:38.600> it's<00:02:38.780> easier<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.920> peel

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
quite well that way it's easier to peel

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.630 
quite well that way it's easier to peel
off<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.550> plastic<00:02:41.000> later<00:02:41.269> when<00:02:41.600> you're<00:02:41.720> ready

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
it's not completely stuck and it will be

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:11.319 
it's not completely stuck and it will be
much<00:04:07.190> easier<00:04:08.650> so<00:04:09.650> it<00:04:10.609> doesn't<00:04:10.940> matter<00:04:11.060> what

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
much easier so it doesn't matter what

direction you go in just peel off about
half<00:04:15.530> of<00:04:15.919> each<00:04:16.130> strip<00:04:16.609> and<00:04:16.880> then<00:04:17.750> what<00:04:18.109> you

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
half of each strip and then what you

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.460 
half of each strip and then what you
want<00:04:18.350> to<00:04:18.440> do<00:04:18.530> is<00:04:18.739> fold

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
want to do is fold

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.940 
want to do is fold
plastic<00:04:22.930> so<00:04:23.930> that<00:04:23.960> way<00:04:24.260> it<00:04:24.410> kind<00:04:24.560> of<00:04:24.680> looks

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
plastic so that way it kind of looks

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.830 
plastic so that way it kind of looks
like<00:04:25.600> this

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
like this

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.650 
like this
so<00:04:27.110> it's<00:04:27.260> stick<00:04:27.530> in<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.740> ocean<00:04:31.180> so<00:04:32.180> do<00:04:32.330> that<00:04:32.480> to

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
so it's stick in the ocean so do that to

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.500 
so it's stick in the ocean so do that to
each<00:04:32.900> side<00:04:33.669> and<00:04:34.669> it<00:04:34.790> doesn't<00:04:35.060> matter<00:04:35.210> what

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
each side and it doesn't matter what

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.600 
each side and it doesn't matter what
will<00:04:35.630> you<00:04:35.720> fold<00:04:36.020> it<00:04:36.230> because<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.220> plastic

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
will you fold it because the plastic

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:55.490 
will you fold it because the plastic
will<00:04:37.850> come<00:04:38.060> off<00:04:38.210> in<00:04:38.540> the<00:04:38.840> end

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.350 

okay<00:04:57.140> so<00:04:58.140> when<00:04:58.710> you<00:04:58.800> have<00:04:58.950> all<00:04:59.130> four<00:04:59.580> half

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
okay so when you have all four half

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.660 
okay so when you have all four half
peeled<00:05:00.720> you<00:05:01.530> have<00:05:01.620> something<00:05:01.980> like<00:05:02.130> this<00:05:02.310> and

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670

your plastic pieces bed a different

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.090 
your plastic pieces bed a different
direction<00:05:05.910> now<00:05:06.440> carefully<00:05:07.440> take<00:05:07.710> your<00:05:07.860> paper

because those will come off very easily

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.420 
because those will come off very easily
in<00:05:20.100> just<00:05:20.160> a<00:05:20.610> moment<00:05:21.710> don't<00:05:22.710> press<00:05:22.980> down<00:05:23.010> too
