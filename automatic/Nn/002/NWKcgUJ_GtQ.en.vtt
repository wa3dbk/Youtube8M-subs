I<00:01:25.140> just<00:01:25.920> now<00:01:26.070> wanted<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.400> show<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.729> an<00:01:27.000> example

I just now wanted to show you an example
of<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:28.110> dog<00:01:28.439> coughing<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.280> have<00:01:29.850> my<00:01:30.030> dog

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
of a dog coughing and I have my dog

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.069 
of a dog coughing and I have my dog
Jesse<00:01:30.750> here<00:01:31.220> he<00:01:32.220> has<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:33.060> mild<00:01:33.450> condition

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
Jesse here he has a mild condition

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.410 
Jesse here he has a mild condition
called<00:01:34.470> tracheal<00:01:34.979> collapse<00:01:35.189> where<00:01:36.060> part<00:01:36.360> of

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
called tracheal collapse where part of

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.050 
called tracheal collapse where part of
his<00:01:36.540> airway<00:01:36.930> collapses<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.740> itself<00:01:38.060> making

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
his airway collapses in on itself making

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.090 
his airway collapses in on itself making
him<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.600> more<00:01:39.750> sensitive<00:01:40.140> period<00:01:40.740> more

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
him just more sensitive period more

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.880 
him just more sensitive period more
likely<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.729> gag<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.240> regurgitation<00:01:45.770> so<00:01:46.770> if

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
likely to gag and regurgitation so if

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.800 
likely to gag and regurgitation so if
you're<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.100> dog<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.579> coughing<00:01:48.149> similar<00:01:48.630> to

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
you're a dog is coughing similar to

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.020 
you're a dog is coughing similar to
Jesse<00:01:49.200> where<00:01:49.409> he's<00:01:49.619> gagging<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.909> then

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
Jesse where he's gagging and then

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.910 
Jesse where he's gagging and then
seemingly<00:01:51.600> like<00:01:51.930> he's<00:01:52.110> retching<00:01:52.560> something

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
seemingly like he's retching something

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.429 
seemingly like he's retching something
up<00:01:53.070> such<00:01:53.369> as<00:01:53.549> cuffing<00:01:53.909> off<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.149> hairball<00:01:54.570> but

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
up such as cuffing off a hairball but

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.200 
up such as cuffing off a hairball but
that's<00:01:55.710> more<00:01:55.920> typical<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.520> tracheal<00:01:56.969> collapse

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
that's more typical of tracheal collapse

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.770 
that's more typical of tracheal collapse
if<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.680> coughing<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.969> more<00:02:00.390> prolonged

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
if the coughing is more prolonged

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.550 
if the coughing is more prolonged
similar<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.829> but<00:02:02.340> even<00:02:02.610> more<00:02:02.790> forceful

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
similar to that but even more forceful

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.959 
similar to that but even more forceful
that<00:02:04.560> going<00:02:04.860> throughout<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.250> day<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.880> it
