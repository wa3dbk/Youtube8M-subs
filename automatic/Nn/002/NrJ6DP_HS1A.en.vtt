00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
might added a lot of of these to the

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.110 
might added a lot of of these to the
ground<00:05:33.930> but<00:05:34.080> it's<00:05:34.230> funny<00:05:34.440> as<00:05:35.190> I'm<00:05:35.640> saying<00:05:35.940> all

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
ground but it's funny as I'm saying all

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.730 
ground but it's funny as I'm saying all
this<00:05:36.330> but<00:05:36.570> I'm<00:05:36.660> not<00:05:36.960> one<00:05:37.470> hundred<00:05:37.560> percent

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
this but I'm not one hundred percent

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.470 
this but I'm not one hundred percent
sure<00:05:40.250> all<00:05:41.250> the<00:05:41.460> differences<00:05:41.910> i<00:05:42.090> know<00:05:42.150> this<00:05:42.420> is

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 
sure all the differences i know this is

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.550 
sure all the differences i know this is
probably<00:05:42.750> know<00:05:43.850> all<00:05:44.850> of<00:05:44.910> that<00:05:45.180> those<00:05:46.170> plants

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
probably know all of that those plants

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:53.600 
probably know all of that those plants
in<00:05:46.650> area<00:05:48.620> let's<00:05:49.620> see<00:05:52.010> they<00:05:53.010> keep<00:05:53.190> adding<00:05:53.460> more

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
in area let's see they keep adding more

in area let's see they keep adding more
trees<00:05:54.090> right<00:05:54.360> here<00:05:54.390> in<00:05:54.630> this<00:05:54.720> area

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:04.500 

yep<00:05:58.200> Adam<00:05:59.200> more<00:05:59.350> torches<00:05:59.800> I<00:06:00.070> think<00:06:00.970> uh<00:06:03.300> in<00:06:04.300> this

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
yep Adam more torches I think uh in this

we have anything new I don't know how

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:16.210 
we have anything new I don't know how

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.400 

so<00:06:17.220> if<00:06:17.370> anything<00:06:17.610> this<00:06:18.120> mod<00:06:18.420> adds<00:06:18.720> you<00:06:19.260> know

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
so if anything this mod adds you know

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.230 
so if anything this mod adds you know
that<00:06:20.400> much<00:06:20.610> more<00:06:20.880> like<00:06:21.210> a<00:06:21.390> life<00:06:21.630> to<00:06:21.960> the<00:06:22.350> game

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
that much more like a life to the game

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.930 
that much more like a life to the game
it<00:06:24.240> might<00:06:24.480> add<00:06:24.630> some<00:06:24.930> lanterns<00:06:25.140> to<00:06:25.790> imagine<00:06:26.790> to

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
it might add some lanterns to imagine to

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.870 
it might add some lanterns to imagine to
hear<00:06:27.150> something<00:06:28.020> like<00:06:28.140> that<00:06:28.230> but<00:06:29.130> um<00:06:30.030> I<00:06:31.880> know

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
hear something like that but um I know

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.940 
hear something like that but um I know
at<00:06:33.300> nighttime<00:06:33.690> this<00:06:33.930> might<00:06:34.170> be<00:06:34.320> brighter<00:06:34.650> on

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950 
at nighttime this might be brighter on

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.740 
at nighttime this might be brighter on
let<00:06:35.430> me<00:06:35.490> go<00:06:35.580> downstairs<00:06:38.390> where's<00:06:39.390> the<00:06:39.510> nearest

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.600 

but<00:06:47.960> I<00:06:47.990> do<00:06:48.110> believe<00:06:48.439> that<00:06:48.860> he<00:06:49.009> added<00:06:49.400> you<00:06:49.580> know

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
but I do believe that he added you know

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.850 
but I do believe that he added you know
some<00:06:50.530> some<00:06:51.530> flavor<00:06:52.960> so<00:06:53.960> what<00:06:54.139> Rifton<00:06:54.530> already
