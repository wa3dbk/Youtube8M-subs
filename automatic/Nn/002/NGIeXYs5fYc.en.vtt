00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 if I tell you to write a book with 12 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.230
 years I wrote a book with 10 years and 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.389
 then I wrote it again with 12 years 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.160
 thinking that the 10-year-old was a whore 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.920
 shit but the truth is that it was a 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.920
 bitch fuck all the same wow 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.270
 it's terrible seriously I've taken several 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.609
 catches of the first and second 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.930
 chapter and I do not know what I put up with 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.289
 reading it because the truth is that it was 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.240
 enough cancer cited for me if it coughs 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.250
 underlined- the most terrifying parts 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.469
 for clips you see a radiator that 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.079
 true such incredible things at the beginning 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.750
 as he knew well to know and not only that 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.670
 but I realized reading that 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.469
 Many of the characters were based on 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.360
 people that I already knew and some 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.160
 changed the meaning name by 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.020
 example and that was my dog ​​that was 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.510
 he called very original wiki all other 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.949
 fantastic things as a 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.719
 heavy rain 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.760
 you have to select a strong 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.129
 rain fields that approach a 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.800
 heavy rain threatened a strong 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.620
 rain 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.020
 in this part I really believe that my me 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.369
 of 12 years tried to convert did not have 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.570
 that being a novel writer has 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.060
 to be a poetry writer 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.460
 because I said good I wrote an answer 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.770
 as help as improper catastrophes 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.470
 they produced that is all their fortune they 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.690
 turn into famine a round of applause for 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.350
 me or from the past please and eye what 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.960
 improper catastrophes too but eye 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.810
 there 's a piece and did not remember it and 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.030
 I'm not a racist who told the story 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.710
 they are children on a Caribbean island if it is 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.270
 grace talking about the story and I have not 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.039
 explained which story is supposed to be 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.020
 is about three children who are on an island 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:40.910
 the Caribbean at the time of pirates 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.800
 and such I suppose it was for every duty 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.649
 Pirates of the Caribbean I do not know 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.670
 the point is that there were three children one 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:54.050
 girl a boy and a boy who was black and 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.960
 the boy was called bongo but but what 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.869
 best of all is that it is alive first 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.360
 what I say about him is Pongo was a boy 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.780
 of the black race a round of applause for me 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.780
 draft 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.060
 it's the second thing he gave about him that is 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.580
 his parents turned out to be slaves in 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.070
 a sugar and cocoa plantation and boom 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.720
 it became his capital then I put 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.000
 he gets to run away on a ship and some 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.850
 form reaches that cocoa plantation at 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.700
 Caribbean 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:33.080
 great and racist was with 12 years was that 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.750
 I say it makes me write the black child and 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.180
 let's say I had a flat nose and 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.520
 a few big glasses with lips 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.410
 proper to people of their race and 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.000
 some way I put a lot of code 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.360
 morse I do not know why it's there in 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.360
 medium 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.879
 and then he had a strange hobby 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.010
 to make necklaces and bracelets of everything 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.810
 I found only I needed to put 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.810
 fakes in the 'top blanket' 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:03.819
 this scary over I talk about that the 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:06.579
 mushroom love and bark poiárs because 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.610
 he signed the oximeter laluenga I say it is 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:11.110
 the fungus where a icon led 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.670
 armaments in the abdomen 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.590
 I would not miss much for it to happen 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.420
 realize that there are spaces and that 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.670
 seize everything sounds very gay and then the 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.769
 third character I love it too and it's 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.200
 that I write it as it was a very boy 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.569
 impulsive guided more than by the nobility 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.120
 for his lust for power although it was very 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.220
 nice and fantastic and really 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.470
 sociable today is a guy from whom I 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.290
 would go to another great place where I say 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.359
 Unfortunately, his misfortune 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.760
 had been great better let's see please 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:42.460
 that this I wrote it with 12 years worth was 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.040
 One fucking manco and another thing regretted 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:48.220
 and racist who was 12 years please 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.440
 that bongo where bongo lived and put I put 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.390
 he had already arrived at his cabin he lived alone 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.520
 from 11 years old, although it was 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.190
 difficult to survive being a child and 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.800
 living near the fantastic forest 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.500
 black is called bongo sells compulsive 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.240
 in the top belly and his parents were one 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.980
 cocoa chocapic plantation that 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.320
 say and also the chapters the 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.300
 closed in an incredible way instead of 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.700
 create the questions and that the people who 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.370
 I gave him those questions 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.440
 super motis and stupid things like all 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.510
 and each of them unanswered 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.370
 would have the stones properties that 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.010
 they did not know it was a coincidence 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.570
 all those anonymous Peronism are 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.580
 it is a coincidence all those 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.500
 phenomena as strange as they had 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.240
 come those stones to your hands many 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.160
 questions without answers between 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.230
 parentheses for the moment then one of 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.180
 the children are supposed to be the father 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.920
 captain but he's dead and for one thing 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.140
 as great as but right in that 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.670
 moment he saw a letter on the table 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.200
 that was addressed to his father or what 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.660
 was left of him 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.490
 the girl is supposed to start trying 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.840
 make a joke to your classmates and 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.550
 begins to loose a lot of things that 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.640
 does not have a fucking sense that children 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.320
 poor in the Caribbean of 1600 know that 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.870
 fucking shit and the girl starts saying 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.670
 things in plan saturn magnetism 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.380
 eye that the girl knows what Saturn and the 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.090
 opposite pole of mercury officiate and 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.280
 asserted that mercury is producing a

 desertification magnetto chemistry 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.000
 both horizons and the environment was cold 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:13.480
 and humid which means that a wind 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.450
 omnipotent be the moment of diosito 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:19.590
 produced by the waves caused by the 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:23.260
 radiation of the moon conceived by the 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:25.060
 desertification hydraulic eye of both 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.890
 horizons consists according to the tercea blá 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.360
 blá blá blá blá despite my state I 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.420
 embarrassed to read this that you make us a 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.190
 idea tells you how in the descriptions it 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.140
 opened Drac's mouth almost to the 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.230
 ground and eyebrows marked him a 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:40.750
 deep curve in your forehead 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.390
 and here is a point too cool bear 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.310
 where an arrow goes to plan 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.680
 crossbow will go through all three and 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.650
 a captained dragon appears out of nowhere 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.840
 by the pirate jake hats there were raps 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.250
 sorry do not notice anything I've put the 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.620
 name again on the back of his dragon 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.990
 willett and stopped her with her very hard 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.940
 armored almost unbreakable skin of 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.770
 dragon scales and heading too much 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.960
 great is when you go to the description 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.360
 of the characters that is the captain and the 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.520
 dragon were very close so much so 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.140
 even both were missing a hand and 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.000
 They had a hook in their place please 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:16.630
 imagine the fucking fucking dragon with 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.070
 a giant calcium and the latter more than 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.930
 a novel or whatever this fucking shit 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.130
 It seems like a joke because 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.560
 I'm like writing a lot of 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.720
 ships and unfortunately puts the boat 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.970
 French is patrolled and guarded 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.860
 constantly in English we clicked on the 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.930
 great time and the Castilian even more 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.600
 guarded looks like a good joke 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.760
 I hope you liked it I liked it 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.410
 rather it's the idea this fucking shit of 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.970

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.790
 two first chapters and obtained all 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:45.150
 these painful pearls so you know 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.610

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:49.700
 and I leave you with the cover of my book 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.829

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.829
 [Music]

 beautiful country but good 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:20.830
