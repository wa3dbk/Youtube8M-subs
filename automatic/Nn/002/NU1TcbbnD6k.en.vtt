them and it's it's very it's easy to do
the<00:00:31.140> work<00:00:31.289> on-site<00:00:31.820> just<00:00:32.820> open<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.210> back<00:00:33.390> and

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
the work on-site just open the back and

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:42.319 
the work on-site just open the back and
only<00:00:34.320> at<00:00:34.680> work<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:40.520> designed<00:00:41.520> all<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
only at work I designed all this the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.340 
only at work I designed all this the
whole<00:00:42.510> setup<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.200> all<00:00:43.440> pulls<00:00:43.739> right<00:00:43.950> out<00:00:44.010> and

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
whole setup it all pulls right out and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.840 
whole setup it all pulls right out and
easy<00:00:46.350> access<00:00:46.789> I'll<00:00:47.789> take<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.660> knife<00:00:48.960> and

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
easy access I'll take this knife and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.020 
easy access I'll take this knife and
basically<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.829> touch<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.980> up<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.789> this

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
basically I I touch it up on this

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.630 
basically I I touch it up on this
machine<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.690> then<00:00:54.780> I'll<00:00:54.960> use<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.640> sharpener

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
machine and then I'll use the sharpener

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.119 
machine and then I'll use the sharpener
to<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.149> fine-tune<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.809> kind<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.739> works<00:00:58.920> very

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
to to fine-tune it kind of works very

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.639 
to to fine-tune it kind of works very
well<00:00:59.219> so<00:01:00.180> I'm<00:01:00.300> going<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.539> just<00:01:00.750> start<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.530> right

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
well so I'm going to just start it right

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.080 
well so I'm going to just start it right
up

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.069 

and<00:01:09.049> this<00:01:09.229> this<00:01:10.189> machine<00:01:10.640> has<00:01:10.880> a<00:01:11.079> adjustable

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:12.079 
and this this machine has a adjustable

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:15.190 
and this this machine has a adjustable
speed<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:12.649> adjustable<00:01:13.189> angle<00:01:13.399> so<00:01:14.149> I<00:01:14.210> can<00:01:14.390> find

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
speed and adjustable angle so I can find

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.700 
speed and adjustable angle so I can find
it

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
it

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.380 
it
start<00:01:17.310> from<00:01:17.460> behind<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.939> cutting<00:01:18.240> edge<00:01:18.359> and

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
start from behind the cutting edge and

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:27.340 
start from behind the cutting edge and
walk<00:01:18.689> up<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.079> it

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:36.290 

very<00:01:28.350> sharp<00:01:28.620> itch<00:01:33.620> and<00:01:34.620> also<00:01:35.010> with<00:01:35.250> scissors<00:01:36.030> I

very sharp itch and also with scissors I

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.800 
very sharp itch and also with scissors I
use<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.470> machine<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.190> beauty<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.520> this

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
use this machine and the beauty of this

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.140 
use this machine and the beauty of this
machine<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.080> on<00:01:40.620> one<00:01:41.430> blade<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.910> thumb<00:01:42.150> blade

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
machine is on one blade the thumb blade

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.250 
machine is on one blade the thumb blade
is<00:01:45.440> designed<00:01:46.440> to<00:01:47.210> hold<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.390> fabric<00:01:48.660> the

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
is designed to hold the fabric the

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.050 
is designed to hold the fabric the
fabric<00:01:49.410> sits<00:01:49.800> on<00:01:49.979> there<00:01:50.190> and<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.670> blade<00:01:50.940> is

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
fabric sits on there and this blade is

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.790 
fabric sits on there and this blade is
designed<00:01:51.300> to<00:01:51.540> shear<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.200> has<00:01:52.350> one<00:01:52.560> type

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
designed to shear so this has one type

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.790 
designed to shear so this has one type
of<00:01:52.830> finish<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.490> has<00:01:53.670> another<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:55.560> first

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
of finish and this has another the first

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:03.859 
of finish and this has another the first
one<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.010> just<00:01:56.990> use<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.020> stone<00:01:58.610> finish<00:02:02.720> but<00:02:03.720> the

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
one I just use a stone finish but the

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.620 
one I just use a stone finish but the
next<00:02:04.200> one<00:02:04.440> has<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.580> be

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:16.390 

smoother<00:02:09.500> so<00:02:10.400> I<00:02:11.260> sharpen<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:14.840> then<00:02:15.590> take<00:02:16.190> this

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
smoother so I sharpen and then take this

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.490 
smoother so I sharpen and then take this
and<00:02:16.640> flip<00:02:16.790> it<00:02:16.970> right<00:02:17.120> over<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:18.110> go<00:02:18.320> over<00:02:18.470> to

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
and flip it right over and go over to

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.350 
and flip it right over and go over to
this<00:02:18.740> honing<00:02:19.310> wheel

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.250 

and<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:26.020> gives<00:02:26.140> up<00:02:26.350> a<00:02:26.640> smoother<00:02:27.640> finish<00:02:27.820> and

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
and it gives up a smoother finish and

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.970 
and it gives up a smoother finish and
the<00:02:29.260> shears<00:02:29.500> work<00:02:29.740> as<00:02:30.160> they<00:02:30.520> were<00:02:30.580> intended<00:02:31.480> to

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
set in this other machine is used I use

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.259 
set in this other machine is used I use
them<00:02:40.590> with<00:02:40.739> my<00:02:40.920> salon<00:02:41.459> shears<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:42.180> polish<00:02:43.040> the
