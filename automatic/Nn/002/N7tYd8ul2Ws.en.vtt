rj11 there we go and then actually this
takes<00:01:19.010> the<00:01:19.100> battery<00:01:19.520> takes<00:01:19.820> a<00:01:20.860> tix<00:01:21.860> a<00:01:21.979> 9-volt

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
takes the battery takes a tix a 9-volt

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.850 
takes the battery takes a tix a 9-volt
battery<00:01:23.170> so<00:01:24.170> make<00:01:24.290> sure<00:01:24.320> you<00:01:24.530> get<00:01:24.590> a<00:01:24.650> battery

for it to once you get it does not come
with<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.750> battery<00:01:27.020> included<00:01:27.670> make<00:01:28.670> sure<00:01:28.700> you

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
with the battery included make sure you

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.070 
with the battery included make sure you
get<00:01:28.970> a<00:01:29.030> battery<00:01:29.240> for<00:01:29.600> it<00:01:31.510> and<00:01:32.510> all<00:01:32.780> you<00:01:32.900> do<00:01:33.050> is

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
get a battery for it and all you do is

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.249 
get a battery for it and all you do is
turn<00:01:33.620> it<00:01:33.740> on<00:01:34.750> so<00:01:35.750> we're<00:01:35.869> now<00:01:35.960> it's<00:01:36.140> been

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
turn it on so we're now it's been

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.070 
turn it on so we're now it's been
testing<00:01:36.710> it<00:01:36.800> and<00:01:37.540> it's<00:01:38.540> going<00:01:38.780> through<00:01:38.930> all

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
testing it and it's going through all

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.190 
testing it and it's going through all
the<00:01:39.530> numbers<00:01:39.830> 1<00:01:40.009> 2<00:01:40.160> 3<00:01:40.190> 4<00:01:40.729> 5<00:01:41.030> 6<00:01:41.060> 7<00:01:41.780> 8<00:01:42.130> 1<00:01:43.130> 2<00:01:43.160> 3<00:01:43.580> 4<00:01:44.150> 5<00:01:44.810> 6

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.300 
the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6
7<00:01:45.440> 8<00:01:45.890> same<00:01:46.310> on<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.490> other<00:01:46.550> side<00:01:46.700> 1<00:01:47.270> 2<00:01:47.300> 3<00:01:47.990> 4<00:01:48.259> 5<00:01:48.920> 6<00:01:48.979> 7

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
7 8 same on the other side 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.450 
7 8 same on the other side 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8<00:01:49.580> so<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:49.910> cable<00:01:50.210> is<00:01:50.270> good<00:01:50.979> cable<00:01:51.979> is<00:01:52.040> good<00:01:52.190> if

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
8 so the cable is good cable is good if

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.639 
8 so the cable is good cable is good if
the<00:01:52.610> cables<00:01:52.940> if<00:01:53.149> one<00:01:54.020> of<00:01:54.110> those<00:01:54.170> numbers<00:01:54.500> is

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
the cables if one of those numbers is

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.490 
the cables if one of those numbers is
not<00:01:54.830> coming<00:01:55.160> up<00:01:55.280> if<00:01:55.940> it<00:01:56.119> stops<00:01:56.330> I<00:01:56.479> got<00:01:56.630> 5<00:01:56.899> or<00:01:57.290> 7

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
not coming up if it stops I got 5 or 7

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.590 
not coming up if it stops I got 5 or 7
or<00:01:57.890> even<00:01:58.280> it<00:01:58.430> stops<00:01:58.610> at<00:01:58.759> three<00:01:58.790> wherever<00:01:59.479> it

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
or even it stops at three wherever it

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.240 
or even it stops at three wherever it
stops<00:01:59.869> that<00:02:00.080> it<00:02:00.229> means<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.500> cable<00:02:00.770> is<00:02:00.830> bad<00:02:01.009> and

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
stops that it means the cable is bad and

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.210 
stops that it means the cable is bad and
that's<00:02:01.340> your<00:02:01.520> problem<00:02:01.759> ok<00:02:02.770> now<00:02:03.770> let's<00:02:03.950> move<00:02:04.040> on

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
that's your problem ok now let's move on

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.499 
that's your problem ok now let's move on
to<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.430> next<00:02:04.460> step<00:02:04.759> if<00:02:04.910> your<00:02:05.030> cables<00:02:05.330> good

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
to the next step if your cables good

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.249 
to the next step if your cables good
then<00:02:06.410> the<00:02:06.500> next<00:02:06.649> step<00:02:06.860> is<00:02:07.190> going<00:02:07.369> to<00:02:07.429> be<00:02:07.490> this

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
then the next step is going to be this

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.270 
then the next step is going to be this
so<00:02:09.259> our<00:02:09.350> next<00:02:09.470> step<00:02:09.619> for<00:02:09.979> internet

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
so our next step for internet

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.460 
so our next step for internet
troubleshooting<00:02:10.880> will<00:02:11.030> be<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.300> check<00:02:11.630> our<00:02:11.930> our

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
troubleshooting will be to check our our

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.670 
troubleshooting will be to check our our
IP<00:02:13.100> address<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:13.940> don't<00:02:14.900> mind<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.380> internet

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680
