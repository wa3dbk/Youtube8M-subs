 [Music] 

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:08.519
 hello everyone I'm bringing you a video 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.500
 so much special it's a game that 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.710
 they bought destiny is the plants against 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.590
 zombies punk daf zombies I've been 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.330
 testing the survival mode this one that 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.369
 endless calls without end 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.230
 and provided here is where you can inflate 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.990
 I've seen videos of people who have 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.920
 reached more than even 10 thousand rounds 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.570
 so survival I do not know is 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.010
 I will reach so many but good for now 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.980
 I'm 28 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:41.920
 and I'm going to show you my 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.129
 configuration for 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.720
 to attack the two we will make a round 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.430
 to see how it is 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.200
 let's see me here I'm lame 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.140
 you will see that this is based, although they are 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:58.489
 these imbeciles here in the middle 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.890
 the basis of all this is the partners these 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.020
 that the mushrooms are not getting these 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.250
 be for all directions are a 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.960
 kind of machine gun shoots very 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.159
 quick for pa pa pa pa pa and make 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.200
 a lot of damage 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.850
 if you put them here in the center, 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.390
 I know if the mouse will be watching or not in 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.220
 the fraction 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.700
 so if you do not see 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.900
 in institutions to all those who 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.180
 they pass by the sides above and by 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.660
 down 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.540
 are affected by these things here and 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.320
 then we need here at the beginning 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.270
 here with what many 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.380
 Many Mary Welsh to have a lot of gold 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.080
 for the truth that you need a lot to 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.050
 build these moves but then the 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.330
 is replacing as you see here 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.240
 double corn with this is also the 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.830
 another base or with this and with this we 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.710
 we carry everything that comes and we need 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.160
 checking especially the gargantua 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.500
 corn bombs if we're not fucking fucking 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.869
 apart I have here put as you will see 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.490
 then there behind two floors of you 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.810
 to avoid being avenged by the types that 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.659
 jump 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.460
 and you steal things from me and do not do 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.380
 missing because really things are 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.030
 purple in the cepi to all I love 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.319
 the lexicon that I have about plants from 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.660
 games and no fucking idea of ​​how it 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.790
 calls none and of course everything with 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.739
 pumpkins to protect everything that is 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.989
 possible in front I put for a bit of 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.930
 plus some skewers 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:24.410
 although the first two rows and columns 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.349
 forgiveness from the right with spikes da 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.180
 Even when they come, they charge them. 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.830
 the zombie grandparents these in chair of 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.569
 wheels were loaded but good 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.519
 meanwhile you have a little more than 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.630
 money well enough now I have no leftovers 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.090
 a lot of money because I have been charged 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.120
 around here a little 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.930
 good and the only thing I have to say 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.680
 is that I have a full column 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.129
 except in the water 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.750
 as you can see melons with ice melons 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.260
 that delay all the enemies that 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.950
 they are coming out 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:59.280
 and without more let's make a lesson of 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.989
 plants here I choose them a little during 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.030
 lame pump and such but you have to have 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:09.989
 Take care for example for this mesh 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.700
 and the corn cannon for your glasses and 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.760
 you break them because they do not 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.140
 can put pumpkins with which there are 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.080
 to do it successfully 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.110
 I'll catch this woman and then if 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.430
 perhaps they break me 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.040
 [Music] 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.620
 the thing of these abodes 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.150
 the coffee seed with which with these 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.439
 coffees to wake them up because they are 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.659
 nocturnal plants this just in case and already 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:40.159
 without further delay I will take things by 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:41.350
 this and this to explode along with this 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:42.560
 this and this 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.780
 [Music] 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.290
 I can not catch spikes good for the 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.480
 following 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.209
 I will not avoid a bomb I'm not going to 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.000
 remove this I'm going to put the bomb and I'm going to 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.190
 catch the skewers for this 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.380
 I also put in front as you see 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.620
 two gold magnets to go 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.599
 picking up the coins and such 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.400
 and that since we are the truth that here 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.400
 and if you put something else, neither 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.200
 so happy that they hold 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:20.260
 maximum possible because the problem charges 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.260
 you have to put too many battles 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.389
 quirós 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:54.289
 it did not really cut me two parts of 

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:54.289
 these for 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.180
 from behind you can have a row 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.480
 for an image 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.900
 we will put the kisses 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.790
 it is loading everything we have 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.830
 behind 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.490
 they are fucking a little more pumpkins 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.589
 the line back but it does not matter 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.589
 [Music] 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.270
 Y 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:40.280
 is recovering I've seen several videos 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.120
 his ovaries but everything handled 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.060
 or not 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.930
 now 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:09.330
 this holds us pretty well here 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:11.479
 I have another one that I have to repair if it comes out 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.870
 [Music] 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:23.019
 each final jump 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:23.019
 [Music] 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.720
 two 

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.250
 [Music] 

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:55.689
 customers are looking at this that is 

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:58.479
 picking up and good and done and with this one 

00:07:55.689 --> 00:07:59.999
 I have already done 30 I hope that I have 

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:01.869
 liked for those who have played this 

00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:03.819
 approximately if I get to 

00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:06.539
 some rather spectacular number or change 

00:08:03.819 --> 00:08:09.290
 the design whatever it is to record another ear 

00:08:06.539 --> 00:08:13.879
 thank you very much for seeing me and goodbye 

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:13.879
