the<00:00:15.660> 301<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.440> learn<00:00:17.430> more<00:00:17.670> about<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:18.000> in<00:00:18.090> this

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
the 301 I a learn more about it in this

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:28.300 
the 301 I a learn more about it in this
video<00:00:18.539> coming<00:00:19.109> soon<00:00:19.460> well<00:00:20.460> now<00:00:21.980> okay<00:00:22.980> now

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.690 

basically<00:00:30.439> the<00:00:31.439> outside<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.070> system<00:00:32.489> is

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
basically the outside of this system is

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.120 
basically the outside of this system is
extremely<00:00:33.120> classy<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.170> uses<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.559> fractal

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
extremely classy it uses the fractal

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.740 
extremely classy it uses the fractal
design<00:00:35.250> define<00:00:35.430> mini<00:00:36.030> which<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.390> one<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.660> my

favorite cases from one of my favorite

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.389 
favorite cases from one of my favorite
manufacturers<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:40.020> very<00:00:40.260> similar<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:41.190> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
manufacturers it is very similar to the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.750 
manufacturers it is very similar to the
full-size<00:00:41.969> define<00:00:42.600> except<00:00:43.530> well<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.309> mini

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
full-size define except well it's mini

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.420 
full-size define except well it's mini
so<00:00:45.300> it's<00:00:45.480> shorter<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.680> accommodates<00:00:47.190> only

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
so it's shorter and it accommodates only

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.610 
so it's shorter and it accommodates only
an<00:00:47.520> M<00:00:47.789> ATX<00:00:48.300> motherboard<00:00:48.809> as<00:00:48.960> opposed<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.530> a

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
an M ATX motherboard as opposed to a

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.040 
an M ATX motherboard as opposed to a
full-sized<00:00:50.129> ATX<00:00:50.879> board<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.629> that's<00:00:51.809> where<00:00:51.989> you

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
full-sized ATX board so that's where you

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.660 
full-sized ATX board so that's where you
get<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.260> little<00:00:52.620> bit<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.860> space<00:00:53.190> savings

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
get that little bit of space savings

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.580 
get that little bit of space savings
this<00:00:53.850> then<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.510> doesn't<00:00:54.690> make<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.199> small

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
this then it doesn't make it a small

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.380 
this then it doesn't make it a small
case<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:56.070> not<00:00:56.190> tiny<00:00:56.550> by<00:00:56.820> any<00:00:57.000> stretch<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
case it's not tiny by any stretch of the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.970 
case it's not tiny by any stretch of the
imagination<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:58.079> still<00:00:58.289> got<00:00:58.440> some<00:00:58.590> heft<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.890> it

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
imagination it still got some heft to it

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.700 
imagination it still got some heft to it
but<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.910> just<00:01:00.059> kind<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.719> adorable<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.289> like<00:01:01.530> it

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
but it's just kind of adorable I like it

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.070 
but it's just kind of adorable I like it
anyway<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:03.120> front<00:01:03.300> you're<00:01:03.629> going<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.809> find

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
anyway on the front you're going to find

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.590 
anyway on the front you're going to find
classic<00:01:04.890> fractal<00:01:05.519> design<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.180> there's<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.420> nice

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
classic fractal design so there's a nice

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.289 
classic fractal design so there's a nice
little<00:01:06.869> LED<00:01:07.560> indicator<00:01:08.100> for<00:01:08.400> power<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.880> then

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
little LED indicator for power and then

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.000 
little LED indicator for power and then
other<00:01:09.510> than<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.229> rest<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.650> front<00:01:10.890> is

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
other than that the rest of the front is

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.859 
other than that the rest of the front is
extremely<00:01:11.670> plane<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.360> for<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.600> good

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
extremely plane and this is for a good

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.990 
extremely plane and this is for a good
reason<00:01:13.020> practically<00:01:13.950> as<00:01:14.130> well<00:01:14.640> as<00:01:14.760> for

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
reason practically as well as for

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.090 
reason practically as well as for
aesthetics<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:16.110> inside<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.740> front

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
aesthetics on the inside of that front

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.100 
aesthetics on the inside of that front
door<00:01:17.280> you're<00:01:17.460> going<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.670> see<00:01:17.909> why<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:18.900> so

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
door you're going to see why it's so

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.380 
door you're going to see why it's so
plain<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.799> silence<00:01:20.520> optimized<00:01:21.060> case

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
plain this is a silence optimized case

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.719 
plain this is a silence optimized case
and<00:01:21.689> we've<00:01:22.020> got<00:01:22.229> noise<00:01:22.530> dampening<00:01:22.830> foam<00:01:23.460> in

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
and we've got noise dampening foam in

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.840 
and we've got noise dampening foam in
front<00:01:24.570> here<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.080> then<00:01:25.530> we've<00:01:25.710> also<00:01:25.920> got<00:01:26.400> all

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
front here and then we've also got all

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.390 
front here and then we've also got all
the<00:01:27.450> i/o<00:01:27.630> sitting<00:01:28.530> behind<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.070> what<00:01:29.250> this

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
the i/o sitting behind it so what this

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.420 
the i/o sitting behind it so what this
does<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:29.909> acts<00:01:30.240> as<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> barrier<00:01:30.810> between

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
does is it acts as a barrier between

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.530 
does is it acts as a barrier between
these<00:01:34.009> potentially<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.400> 120<00:01:36.210> millimeter

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540

there<00:04:35.440> this<00:04:35.860> also<00:04:36.130> serves<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:36.850> purpose<00:04:37.180> of

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
there this also serves the purpose of

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.480 
there this also serves the purpose of
making<00:04:37.480> the<00:04:37.720> case<00:04:37.930> a<00:04:38.170> little<00:04:38.620> bit<00:04:38.740> more<00:04:38.920> rigid

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
making the case a little bit more rigid

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.150 
making the case a little bit more rigid
which<00:04:39.880> makes<00:04:40.180> it<00:04:40.390> just<00:04:41.260> adding<00:04:41.620> more<00:04:41.800> weight

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
which makes it just adding more weight

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.540 
which makes it just adding more weight
and<00:04:42.520> more<00:04:42.730> rigidity<00:04:43.000> makes<00:04:43.420> it<00:04:43.600> less<00:04:43.960> prone<00:04:44.350> to

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
and more rigidity makes it less prone to

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.160 
and more rigidity makes it less prone to
vibration<00:04:45.550> which<00:04:46.000> in<00:04:46.180> turn<00:04:46.390> makes<00:04:46.630> it<00:04:46.870> less

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
vibration which in turn makes it less

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.500

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
exhaust it directly so you've got to

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.940 
exhaust it directly so you've got to

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
have I think that Pro and this is that

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.630 
have I think that Pro and this is that
but<00:06:25.420> wait<00:06:25.720> there's<00:06:26.140> more<00:06:26.260> mobile<00:06:27.250> check<00:06:27.520> this

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:43.780 
want to put a quad-core in there and I

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.840 
want to put a quad-core in there and I
would<00:06:43.960> also<00:06:43.990> add<00:06:44.560> a<00:06:44.590> storage<00:06:45.160> drive<00:06:45.460> with<00:06:45.670> that
