of proper knowledge animals don't make
their<00:00:24.390> journey<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:25.140> green<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.680> brown<00:00:25.800> anoles

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
their journey so green and brown anoles

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.009 
their journey so green and brown anoles
are<00:00:26.550> simple<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.090> keep<00:00:27.240> because<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.900> their

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
are simple to keep because of their

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.529 
are simple to keep because of their
small<00:00:28.320> size<00:00:28.349> they're<00:00:29.340> insectivores<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.390> it's

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
small size they're insectivores so it's

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.389 
small size they're insectivores so it's
a<00:00:30.599> lot<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.869> fun<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.199> watch<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.590> meat<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:32.250> keep

velociraptors when they come out of
their<00:00:48.000> trees<00:00:48.360> they<00:00:48.809> are<00:00:48.840> arboreal<00:00:49.770> by<00:00:49.950> nature

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
their trees they are arboreal by nature

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.520 
their trees they are arboreal by nature
meaning<00:00:50.610> they<00:00:50.850> stay<00:00:51.149> up<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.960> air<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
meaning they stay up in the air of the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.619 
meaning they stay up in the air of the
terrarium<00:00:53.280> they<00:00:53.670> are<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.120> leaves<00:00:54.360> they

terrarium they are in the leaves they

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.180 
terrarium they are in the leaves they
are<00:00:54.660> hanging<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> little<00:00:55.710> bit<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.860> the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
are hanging in the little bit of the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.099 
are hanging in the little bit of the
tank<00:00:56.460> sometimes<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.420> can't<00:00:57.629> see<00:00:57.809> them<00:00:57.960> very

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
tank sometimes you can't see them very

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.990 
tank sometimes you can't see them very
well<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:58.770> when<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> crickets<00:00:59.280> come<00:00:59.460> out<00:00:59.609> they

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
well but when the crickets come out they

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.430 
well but when the crickets come out they
come<00:01:00.030> diving<00:01:00.719> down<00:01:00.899> like<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> little

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
come diving down like the little

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.349 
come diving down like the little
dinosaurs<00:01:01.949> they<00:01:02.129> look<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.760> lamb

they've<00:01:03.719> nailed<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.110> crickets<00:01:04.500> one<00:01:04.799> after

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
they've nailed the crickets one after

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.330 
they've nailed the crickets one after
the<00:01:05.489> other<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:07.619> think<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.130> lot<00:01:08.310> of

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
the other so I can think of a lot of

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.910 
the other so I can think of a lot of
