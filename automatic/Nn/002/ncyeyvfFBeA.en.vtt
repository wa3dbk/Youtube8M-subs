00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 I was asked to write one 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:12.030
 wiring to explain an arpeggio ne 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:15.750
 I do my home as you should 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.859
 to know me in the words they are me milk 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.400
 not above me not in the boxes 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.920
 I can do it and if what I do 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.060
 can make me want to do then 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.939
 here I am 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.660
 with this but they are the line they are 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.660
 unable to do any other 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:40.500
 what I say why not make a video 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:44.040
 tutorial you know no youtube is there from the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.450
 possibility to click and close the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.750
 video so who doesn't care 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.590
 nothing will close alive and avoid sending me 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:57.449
 you see that country at the camp you see 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.879
 something so paralyzes the dress worse 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.399
 specific request was for as I had 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.830
 made for page on song for the summer 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.369
 by fabrizio de andrÃ¨ who was mine 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.549
 original adaptation between ces in the queue 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.260
 anyway I had exploited it 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.260
 this figure harpege more or less does so 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:33.530
 a lot of wheel in front of itself 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.530
 quiz sit next door 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:44.460
 according to me because it is a mountain pasture that has it 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:47.600
 a beautiful rhythmic that is mastalli 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.600
 like a beijing 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:02:06.450
 you like this atmosphere instead 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:08.910
 pace the ninth day we have one 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.370
 kind of tirh we left 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.530
 how to do it 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.530
 let's do that I want to do this 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.040
 year I am loosening 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:47.420
 and let it not require it at the first step 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:50.060
 first and second initial thumb goes up 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.280
 fourth 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.490
 I always look again 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.490
 she 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.500
 the index on the third 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.180
 thumb on the head 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.810
 ring finger that plays in the second like 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.110
 at the beginning only us and together with them 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.110
 reserved site 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.260
 and instead makes the third wait 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.489
 and so again 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.489
 Paris 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:46.440
 make friends summer song did 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:48.300

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.320
 on 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.260
 difference between the two money that 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:58.570
 at the beginning I put a little finger here on 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:03.150
 second string the third button forward 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.150

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:11.750

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:14.109

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.109

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:31.100
 She was his people 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.620
 with the index the choice leads to 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.990
 first meal to give this this 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.990
 fourth in the sun and smiles 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:05:00.390
 then you go years minor and andrea mi minor 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.390
 you can do this step is enough 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.200
 unlikely 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.110
 nothing more 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:27.470
 strange things 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.470
 and breathe 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.670
 the agreements and found maybe it was not 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:40.270
 easy to find on that of 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:43.860
 especially if I've done other ones too 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.860
