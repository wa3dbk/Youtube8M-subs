00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:06.620 
today it's just an electric motorcycle

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.790 
today it's just an electric motorcycle
that<00:00:06.859> I<00:00:06.920> built<00:00:07.130> and<00:00:07.330> runs<00:00:08.330> on<00:00:08.540> Wow<00:00:09.320> regular

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:09.800 
that I built and runs on Wow regular

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.570 
that I built and runs on Wow regular
electricity<00:00:10.660> she's<00:00:11.660> got<00:00:11.919> kind<00:00:12.919> of<00:00:13.009> bored<00:00:13.249> this

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
electricity she's got kind of bored this

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.789 
electricity she's got kind of bored this
winter<00:00:13.999> and<00:00:14.360> I<00:00:14.419> just<00:00:15.139> decided<00:00:15.469> to<00:00:15.589> make

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:15.799 
winter and I just decided to make

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.220 
winter and I just decided to make
something<00:00:16.119> I<00:00:17.119> didn't<00:00:17.600> want<00:00:17.750> to<00:00:17.840> drive<00:00:18.020> around

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
something I didn't want to drive around

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.300 
something I didn't want to drive around
in<00:00:18.410> a<00:00:18.500> truck<00:00:18.769> that<00:00:19.070> used<00:00:19.699> a<00:00:19.789> bunch<00:00:19.939> of<00:00:20.029> gas<00:00:20.240> and

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
in a truck that used a bunch of gas and

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.890 
in a truck that used a bunch of gas and
figured<00:00:22.310> this<00:00:22.460> thing<00:00:22.519> was<00:00:22.820> a<00:00:22.900> perfect

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
figured this thing was a perfect

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.380 
figured this thing was a perfect
solution<00:00:24.439> for<00:00:24.619> that<00:00:24.830> problem<00:00:24.980> and<00:00:25.400> it's

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
solution for that problem and it's

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.950 
solution for that problem and it's
worked<00:00:26.599> out<00:00:26.689> really<00:00:26.900> well<00:00:26.990> for<00:00:27.109> me<00:00:28.599> it<00:00:29.599> runs<00:00:29.779> on

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
worked out really well for me it runs on

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.440 
worked out really well for me it runs on
a<00:00:30.230> hundred<00:00:30.589> and<00:00:30.740> ten<00:00:30.980> volts<00:00:31.009> it's<00:00:31.789> got<00:00:32.419> a

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
a hundred and ten volts it's got a

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.529 
a hundred and ten volts it's got a
brushless<00:00:33.350> DC<00:00:33.710> motor<00:00:34.160> built<00:00:34.940> into<00:00:35.210> the<00:00:35.300> rear

00:00:35.529 --> 00:00:35.539 
brushless DC motor built into the rear

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:39.790 
brushless DC motor built into the rear
wheel<00:00:35.750> it's<00:00:37.660> has<00:00:38.660> a<00:00:38.690> built-in<00:00:39.110> controller<00:00:39.500> and

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
wheel it's has a built-in controller and

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.250 
wheel it's has a built-in controller and
charger<00:00:40.270> it's<00:00:41.270> you<00:00:41.660> know<00:00:41.750> just<00:00:41.930> solves<00:00:42.199> the

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
charger it's you know just solves the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.740 
charger it's you know just solves the
problem<00:00:42.620> of<00:00:42.829> point<00:00:43.550> A<00:00:43.670> to<00:00:43.699> point<00:00:43.820> B<00:00:44.030> travel<00:00:44.539> and

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
problem of point A to point B travel and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.150 
problem of point A to point B travel and
um<00:00:45.190> it's<00:00:46.190> got<00:00:46.399> a<00:00:46.430> range<00:00:46.670> of<00:00:46.850> about<00:00:46.969> 50<00:00:47.510> miles

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
um it's got a range of about 50 miles

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.770 
um it's got a range of about 50 miles
it's<00:00:49.160> got<00:00:49.489> a<00:00:49.520> top<00:00:49.699> speed<00:00:49.940> of<00:00:50.000> 50<00:00:50.390> miles<00:00:50.539> per

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
it's got a top speed of 50 miles per

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
working on the development of a mobile

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.060 
working on the development of a mobile
phone<00:01:17.450> app<00:01:17.659> that<00:01:17.960> communicates<00:01:18.829> with<00:01:18.950> the

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
phone app that communicates with the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.160 
phone app that communicates with the
computer<00:01:19.430> system<00:01:19.759> that's<00:01:20.119> inside<00:01:20.960> of<00:01:20.990> the

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
computer system that's inside of the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.069 
computer system that's inside of the
vehicle<00:01:22.000> yeah<00:01:23.000> it<00:01:23.180> does<00:01:23.329> it<00:01:23.360> gives<00:01:23.780> you<00:01:23.840> the

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
vehicle yeah it does it gives you the

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.530 
vehicle yeah it does it gives you the
data<00:01:24.259> as<00:01:24.710> a<00:01:24.740> we'll<00:01:25.640> get<00:01:25.759> a<00:01:25.820> little<00:01:26.000> closer<00:01:26.210> and

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
data as a we'll get a little closer and

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.109 
data as a we'll get a little closer and
show<00:01:27.380> you<00:01:27.439> that<00:01:27.560> so<00:01:27.770> that's<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.130> scree<00:01:28.549> screen

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
show you that so that's the scree screen

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:30.969 
show you that so that's the scree screen
readout<00:01:29.450> right<00:01:29.659> there<00:01:29.930> it's<00:01:30.140> two<00:01:30.320> line<00:01:30.500> LCD

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
readout right there it's two line LCD

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.010 
readout right there it's two line LCD
and<00:01:31.220> this<00:01:31.759> is<00:01:31.880> where<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.119> iPhone<00:01:32.509> of<00:01:32.810> what

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
and this is where the iPhone of what

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.039 
and this is where the iPhone of what
mobile<00:01:33.560> phone<00:01:33.860> goes<00:01:34.070> Wow<00:01:34.520> okay<00:01:35.180> and<00:01:35.420> then<00:01:35.540> the

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
mobile phone goes Wow okay and then the

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.950 
mobile phone goes Wow okay and then the
whole<00:01:36.229> goal<00:01:36.500> is<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:36.970> get<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.210> data<00:01:38.450> coming<00:01:38.810> off

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
whole goal is to get the data coming off

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.289 
whole goal is to get the data coming off
with<00:01:39.110> a<00:01:39.170> computer<00:01:39.619> to<00:01:39.939> display<00:01:40.939> and<00:01:41.270> then

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
with a computer to display and then

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:42.999 
with a computer to display and then
graphically<00:01:41.810> app<00:01:41.899> even<00:01:42.079> way<00:01:42.380> on<00:01:42.649> the<00:01:42.829> mobile

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
graphically app even way on the mobile
