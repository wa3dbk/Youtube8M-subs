00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 1 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.660
 hello to all today we're going 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.580
 make a tutorial to give you 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.539
 ideas for decorating your tree and 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.150
 your christmas balls 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:22.590
 for that I chose to use 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:26.100
 raffia cinnamon glitter 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.600
 the white cord a figurine of 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.820
 feather beads and city racks 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.219
 we will also need some glue 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.199
 brush and scissors we go 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:43.469
 to make a Christmas ball with 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:49.710
 raffia and cinnamon you take your 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:52.969
 supports you take your raffia that 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.969
 you wrapped around your fingers 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.469
 you want to place inside the 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.469
 half do this 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.910
 you add cinnamon pieces 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.979
 and to fix your half-sphere 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:23.079
 advise you to put glue on 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:26.710
 the edges for that use a brush 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.710
 and glue varnish 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.620
 a little bit is enough advantage with 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.700
 the glue varnish and that it becomes 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.700
 transparent while drying 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:54.200
 now we have to bring the two 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.200
 half sphere and wait for it to dry 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.450
 for the second bull a whole idea 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.430
 simple take a figurine of your 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.649
 kids in their play box and put 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.899
 the in a ball we repeat the same 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.039
 operation a little glue on the edges 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.039
 and voila 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:32.060
 and here and 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.459
 another idea you take pearls and 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.470
 you put them in a ball I have 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.920
 chose transparent pearls and 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.920
 pearly 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.110
 always my little trick of the glue 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.260
 I just have to assemble them 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.909
 and finally to finish my favorite you 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:09.829
 take feathers and glitter 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.829
 golden that you put in a ball 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.910
 do not hesitate to put the most it is 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.800
 pretty 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.330
 little trick if your feathers do not fit 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.330
 not you just have to cut them 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.079
 the little golden bunch of christmas 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.079
 flakes 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:04.040
 and here you are 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.870
 use your white cord or 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.140
 redemption to be able to fix them on the 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.140
 fir 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.940
 2 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.470
 it only remains to decorate the tree 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.470
 and I wish you jae christmas 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.139
