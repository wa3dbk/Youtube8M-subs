00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.360 
so if all your friends are on one
platform<00:03:00.840> I'd<00:03:01.500> say<00:03:01.709> you<00:03:01.769> probably<00:03:01.950> want<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.250> go

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
platform I'd say you probably want to go

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.550 
platform I'd say you probably want to go
with<00:03:02.489> that<00:03:02.720> so<00:03:03.720> those<00:03:04.049> are<00:03:04.230> all<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.350> major

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
with that so those are all the major

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.990 
with that so those are all the major
differences<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.250> course<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.670> game<00:03:05.819> looks

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
differences of course the game looks

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.759 
differences of course the game looks
better<00:03:06.180> on<00:03:06.299> PC<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.870> features<00:03:07.200> much<00:03:07.380> faster

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
better on PC it features much faster

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.979 
better on PC it features much faster
load<00:03:07.950> times<00:03:07.980> almost<00:03:08.700> no<00:03:08.910> texture<00:03:09.360> pop-in<00:03:09.510> and

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
load times almost no texture pop-in and

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.500 
load times almost no texture pop-in and
of<00:03:10.650> course<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:11.010> mouse<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.400> keyboard<00:03:11.519> UI<00:03:11.880> but

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
of course that mouse and keyboard UI but

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.210 
of course that mouse and keyboard UI but
it's<00:03:12.720> not<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:12.930> crazy<00:03:13.260> improvement<00:03:13.950> over<00:03:14.130> the

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
it's not a crazy improvement over the

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.250 
it's not a crazy improvement over the
console<00:03:14.580> version<00:03:14.959> unfortunately<00:03:15.959> we<00:03:16.110> did<00:03:16.230> not

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
console version unfortunately we did not

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.620 
console version unfortunately we did not
have<00:03:16.560> access<00:03:16.739> to<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.160> ps3<00:03:17.400> build<00:03:17.820> but<00:03:18.269> we<00:03:18.480> can

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
have access to the ps3 build but we can

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.030 
have access to the ps3 build but we can
assume<00:03:18.900> that<00:03:18.930> it's<00:03:19.230> pretty<00:03:19.440> comparable<00:03:19.950> to

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
assume that it's pretty comparable to

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.099 
assume that it's pretty comparable to
