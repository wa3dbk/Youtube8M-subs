00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.010
 important do not forget to take it 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.150
 you can take your passport with you 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.489
 federal police 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.830
 you will also need a visa 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.040
 to travel to the united states 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.260
 This is how you apply for the visa to access 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.070
 the US embassy website and click 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.470
 non-immigrant visas and check 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.310
 if you qualify for exemption from 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.650
 visa 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.689
 if you were from another country 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.250
 not the Brazil and planning to stay 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.710
 less than 90 days 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.409
 it may be that you can travel without a visa 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.299
 that your country of origin is 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.700
 list of countries of the exemption program 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.260
 of visas 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.210
 even if you need to visa the 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.310
 process is very easy 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.350
 complete the application form 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.170
 seen online and pay the fee 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.020
 according to the instructions 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.480
 then you should schedule a quick 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.000
 interview at the consulate or embassy of 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.400
 united states closer than this 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.200
 process used to take much longer 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.060
 now it got much faster 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.100
 for example in sao paulo 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.680
 the United States took more than four 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.540
 months to get ready and now the school 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.760
 just two days 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.590
 so we were very excited about the 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.990
 ease with which we plan our 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.090
 trip to equal december the treasure 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.570
 Now we're leaving, we're going to 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.570
