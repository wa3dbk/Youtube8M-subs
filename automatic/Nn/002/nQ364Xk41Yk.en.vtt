now<00:00:39.870> my<00:00:40.200> second<00:00:40.770> tip<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.129> don't<00:00:41.489> go<00:00:41.670> out<00:00:41.820> too

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
now my second tip is don't go out too

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.290 
now my second tip is don't go out too
hard<00:00:42.329> at<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.170> start<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.649> race<00:00:43.969> the<00:00:44.969> reason

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
hard at the start of the race the reason

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.540 
hard at the start of the race the reason
why<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.450> don't<00:00:45.840> want<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.140> go<00:00:46.230> out<00:00:46.350> too<00:00:46.590> hard<00:00:46.890> is

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
why you don't want to go out too hard is

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.670 
why you don't want to go out too hard is
because<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:48.300> could<00:00:48.510> sabotage<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.289> rest<00:00:49.500> of

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
because you could sabotage the rest of

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.090 
because you could sabotage the rest of
race<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.129> might<00:00:50.309> lose<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.090> pack<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:52.140> set<00:00:53.070> a

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
race you might lose the pack so set a

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.760 
race you might lose the pack so set a
goal<00:00:53.280> time<00:00:53.520> for<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.760> first<00:00:54.030> mile<00:00:54.480> try<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.530> be

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
goal time for the first mile try to be

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.610 
goal time for the first mile try to be
on<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.370> goal<00:00:56.640> time<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.300> then<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.320> come<00:00:58.590> to

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.779 
on that goal time and then we come to
the<00:00:58.920> third<00:00:59.309> tip<00:00:59.879> which<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.629> past<00:01:01.500> people<00:01:02.219> after

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
let's say it's a windy race well if you

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.069 
let's say it's a windy race well if you
lead<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.759> little<00:01:39.150> bit<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.630> helps<00:01:39.780> your

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
lead a little bit that helps your

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.840 
lead a little bit that helps your
teammates<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.950> then<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.250> switch<00:01:41.400> leads

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850
