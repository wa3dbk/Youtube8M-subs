00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 hello to you andrew andreevich my 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.280
 site all point dot ru 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.400
 let's break the change at number 352 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.170
 shorten 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.830
 and then swipe to the lowest total 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.529
 denominator fraction why you need to reduce 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:22.189
 let's try well now I'll start let's 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:28.769
 from the second fraction 44 it is 4 times 11 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:34.200
 phone 99 is 9 times 11 here 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:38.850
 us 33 is 3 multiply by 11 out of 44 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.430
 this is 4 times 11 as there is a cut 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.260
 here at 11 and here is the same at 11 that 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:53.010
 we get here 4 9 and here three 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:58.680
 fourth so now let's too 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:03.629
 let's try to cut it well let's 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:11.030
 try on 5 to cut 75 by 5 divided 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:11.030
 it turns out 15 to 5 15 can on 5 be 75 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:20.400
 a90 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:23.070
 this is 18 multiplied by 5 maxima can 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.820
 again it will be 90 then we can again 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:30.210
 cut top and bottom get 15 and 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:36.659
 18 can still be a little cut 15 is 5 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:41.460
 multiply by 3a 18 is 9 multiply 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.930
 oh sorry this is 6 multiplied by 3 can 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.180
 another three cut then it turns out 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:50.700
 here are five sixths now let's get on 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.860
 Now we first reduced when already 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.750
 finished cut now turn to 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.219
 finding the lowest common denominator 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.009
 for this we expand and the denominator on 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.340
 prime factors 4 is 2 multiply by 2 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:12.930
 here 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:16.319
 9 this is 3 multiply by 3a here is six this 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.970
 incriminate this 3 multiply by 2 we look 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.830
 here are two twos on clean and in all 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.290
 the other should be two twos then 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.959
 here we multiply by one deuce and on top 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:31.410
 and below and here we multiply into two twos 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:34.140
 and top and bottom so here are two twos 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.730
 here are two twos here two twos here 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.319
 there is no construction 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.090
 we multiply on the top three then here are two 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.950
 triples means should be everywhere by three 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.180
 trio began you multiplied 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:54.840
 and here for three more where the knife for the top three 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:03:08.790
 top three and now we count 3 by 39 by 2 18 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:17.850
 by 2 3 6 4 by 2 8 and by 216 here 2 by 2 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:23.700
 4 4 on 3 12 on 3 36 and on top 3 on 3 on 3 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:28.799
 up to 20 73 to 39 and 327 more and here we consider 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:37.169
 1 2 3 by 2 6 by 2 12-36 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:39.720
 and on top of 2 to 5 10 and 330 will 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:46.970
 3036 them 1636 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:49.960
 and 2736 it was a letter and it was a letter 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:54.550
 such a solution 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.680
 and now the letter b so that under us 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:03.780
 letter b 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:08.320
 there are 40 sixty fourth there are 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:15.870
 42 144 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:20.320
 and there are 100 180 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:25.990
 first we cut it so well let's 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:29.020
 order 40 is for example 5 by 8 64 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:32.490
 this is 8 multiplied by 8 is reduced by 8 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.490
 five eighths remain 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:49.480
 here so so so well 144 this is 12 multiply 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:55.420
 by 12 and 42 this is for example 6 multiplied by 7 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:05:00.540
 7 our 7 on 6 42 and that we have as so 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:05.110
 and stands 180 that is 10 multiplied by 10 and 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:09.400
 180 is 18 multiplied by 10 here we can 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:13.180
 cut two tens left 10 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.870
 divide by 18 so here nothing yet 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.720
 can cut 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:22.210
 let's expand a little more 6 multiply 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:25.420
 by 7 and 12 12 decompose as 6 multiply by 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.100
 2 that is, the first 12 were decomposed as 6 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:31.590
 multiply by 2 then we have sixes 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:37.960
 are reduced and we can still reduce here 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:39.940
 10 is 2 times 5 and 18 is 2 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.590
 we can multiply by 9 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.830
 to cut 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:49.180
 stays here 5 9 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:51.640
 here we have 7 divided by well 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.970
 will not combine here 27 24 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:58.910
 it turns out 24 Nov let's leave here 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:01.590
 so here is five eighths 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.590
 cut cut cut now 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.090
 see which times if denominators and 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.730
 denominator is laid out on simple 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.860
 multipliers denominator now 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:14.120
 decomposed into 8 prime it 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:18.600
 two times two times two 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:22.470
 here deuce leave a 12 this 3 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:25.770
 multiply by 4 3 multiply by 4 a 4 to 2 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:29.850
 multiply by 2 i.e. deuce ahead 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:34.380
 was a 3 by 2 6 2 12 cm and by just and 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:37.800
 lay out here the top five leave a9 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:40.470
 from three multiplied by three now we look 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.110
 here are two triples and here is just one 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.130
 so we multiply by 3 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.380
 multiply necessarily above and below 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.290
 so that the fraction has not changed, we can 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.730
 cut into a cadaver then disappear 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.840
 here there are no triples at all 

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:58.740
 two triples multiply 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:07:01.680
 and below and above so look here 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.690
 times two three twos here times two three 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.690
 twos and here only 2 2 and here in general 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:09.750
 2 not three deuces here require 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:22.740
 12 and generally not three deuces two times 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:33.570
 three and top 1 2 3 so 5 by 3 15 and another 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:40.250
 by 3 45 in the denominator 2 by 2 by 2 8 3 by 

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:47.490
 3 2 3 on 3 9 a 2 on 2 on 288 on 972 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:54.930
 here too 2 by 2 by 283 by 399 by 872 

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:57.270
 It turns out 7 to 321 and the last one is well 

00:07:54.930 --> 00:08:01.320
 then it's nine it's 8 total 72 

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:05.970
 it turns out but now multiply 2 by 2 by 2 

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:09.390
 This 85 on 840 it turns out like this 

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:12.060
 the way it was task 352 

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:15.889
