GPS<00:00:22.890> related<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:23.910> we<00:00:24.060> actually<00:00:24.180> can

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
GPS related to it so we actually can

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.540 
GPS related to it so we actually can
natively<00:00:24.990> get<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.769> speed<00:00:26.160> acceleration

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
natively get the speed acceleration

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.179 
natively get the speed acceleration
location<00:00:27.510> direction<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.260> altitude<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.160> we

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
location direction and altitude and we

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.140 
location direction and altitude and we
actually<00:00:29.310> have<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.550> platform<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:30.029> actually
