donated to me by geo stealth r1 thanks a
ton<00:00:20.270> man<00:00:20.689> but<00:00:21.650> as<00:00:21.950> you<00:00:22.040> can<00:00:22.160> see<00:00:22.220> this<00:00:22.670> would<00:00:22.910> be

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
ton man but as you can see this would be

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.150 
ton man but as you can see this would be
wire<00:00:23.570> mesh<00:00:24.170> and<00:00:24.529> you<00:00:24.619> can<00:00:24.740> just<00:00:24.890> go<00:00:24.980> ahead<00:00:25.070> and

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
wire mesh and you can just go ahead and

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.150 
wire mesh and you can just go ahead and
put<00:00:25.310> it<00:00:25.400> over<00:00:25.520> it's<00:00:26.119> purely<00:00:27.080> visual<00:00:27.470> it<00:00:27.950> does

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
put it over it's purely visual it does

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.850 
put it over it's purely visual it does
provide<00:00:28.850> some<00:00:28.910> protection<00:00:29.840> but<00:00:30.529> he<00:00:30.619> gave<00:00:30.830> me

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
provide some protection but he gave me

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.650 
provide some protection but he gave me
enough<00:00:31.340> to<00:00:31.730> go<00:00:31.850> ahead<00:00:31.970> and<00:00:32.210> do<00:00:32.300> the<00:00:32.419> three

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
enough to go ahead and do the three

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.540 
enough to go ahead and do the three
cables<00:00:33.020> coming<00:00:33.260> off<00:00:33.530> of<00:00:33.559> lenio<00:00:34.040> motor<00:00:34.250> and

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
cables coming off of lenio motor and

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.540 
cables coming off of lenio motor and
going<00:00:34.790> to<00:00:34.910> the<00:00:35.000> ESC<00:00:35.510> now<00:00:36.379> this<00:00:36.920> is<00:00:37.129> gonna<00:00:37.309> add<00:00:37.520> a

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
going to the ESC now this is gonna add a

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.729 
going to the ESC now this is gonna add a
certain<00:00:38.000> kind<00:00:38.300> of<00:00:38.390> thickness<00:00:38.720> to<00:00:39.350> it<00:00:39.379> so<00:00:39.710> I

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
certain kind of thickness to it so I

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.729 
certain kind of thickness to it so I
won't<00:00:40.010> be<00:00:40.160> able<00:00:40.309> to<00:00:40.730> string<00:00:41.090> it<00:00:41.239> through<00:00:41.739> the

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
won't be able to string it through the

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.500 
won't be able to string it through the
rear<00:00:42.920> shock<00:00:43.190> tower<00:00:43.220> so<00:00:43.790> I'm<00:00:43.879> just<00:00:44.059> gonna<00:00:44.150> have

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
rear shock tower so I'm just gonna have

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.710 
rear shock tower so I'm just gonna have
the<00:00:44.690> mesh<00:00:44.960> meet<00:00:45.890> up<00:00:46.070> to<00:00:46.250> right<00:00:46.489> there<00:00:46.540> and<00:00:47.540> it's

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
the mesh meet up to right there and it's

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.570 
the mesh meet up to right there and it's
gonna<00:00:47.839> be<00:00:48.019> really<00:00:48.290> easy<00:00:48.500> all<00:00:48.830> I'm<00:00:49.070> gonna<00:00:49.220> do<00:00:49.400> is

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
ahead and pop off this end motor cap

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.639 
ahead and pop off this end motor cap
just<00:01:33.259> like<00:01:33.409> that<00:01:33.770> that<00:01:34.549> way<00:01:34.789> I<00:01:34.820> can<00:01:35.210> push<00:01:35.649> the

just like that that way I can push the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.649 
just like that that way I can push the
shrink<00:01:36.950> tube<00:01:37.130> all<00:01:37.429> the<00:01:37.490> way<00:01:37.640> down<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:38.420> now<00:01:38.539> I'm

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
shrink tube all the way down and now I'm

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.989 
shrink tube all the way down and now I'm
just<00:01:38.719> gonna<00:01:39.049> go<00:01:39.289> ahead<00:01:39.409> and<00:01:39.710> hold<00:01:39.890> RC<00:01:40.399> upside

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:40.999 
just gonna go ahead and hold RC upside

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:43.480 
just gonna go ahead and hold RC upside
down<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:41.719> raise<00:01:42.320> it<00:01:42.560> with<00:01:42.679> some<00:01:42.859> heat<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:43.340> it

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
down and raise it with some heat and it

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.819 
down and raise it with some heat and it
will<00:01:43.549> shrink<00:01:43.850> all<00:01:44.479> right<00:01:44.929> check<00:01:45.530> it<00:01:45.560> out

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
will shrink all right check it out

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.190 
will shrink all right check it out
perfect<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:46.939> I'm<00:01:47.509> just<00:01:47.689> gonna<00:01:47.810> snap<00:01:48.140> that

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.569 
perfect and I'm just gonna snap that
back<00:01:48.560> on<00:01:49.329> voila<00:01:50.740> next<00:01:51.740> I<00:01:51.950> need<00:01:52.130> to<00:01:52.310> go<00:01:52.429> ahead

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
back on voila next I need to go ahead

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.580 
back on voila next I need to go ahead
and<00:01:52.909> find<00:01:53.149> that<00:01:53.270> little<00:01:53.600> white<00:01:53.749> dot<00:01:53.780> right

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
and find that little white dot right

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.830 
and find that little white dot right
there<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:55.640> I'm<00:01:55.789> gonna<00:01:55.969> go<00:01:56.149> ahead<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:56.569> trim

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
there and I'm gonna go ahead and trim

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.630 
there and I'm gonna go ahead and trim
this<00:01:56.869> down<00:01:57.079> and<00:01:57.649> then<00:01:57.740> put<00:01:58.009> string<00:01:58.280> tube<00:01:58.490> on

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
this down and then put string tube on
