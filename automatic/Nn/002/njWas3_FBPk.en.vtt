the Forgotten Shore is a bit from far
pretty<00:00:57.850> far<00:00:58.060> away<00:00:58.180> from<00:00:58.870> this<00:00:59.350> bond<00:00:59.590> location

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
pretty far away from this bond location

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.340 
pretty far away from this bond location
where<00:01:00.340> you<00:01:00.370> spawn<00:01:00.790> when<00:01:01.420> you<00:01:01.570> enter<00:01:01.600> the<00:01:02.110> free

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.310 
where you spawn when you enter the free
room<00:01:02.590> so<00:01:03.280> it's<00:01:03.820> I<00:01:04.329> recommend<00:01:04.930> that<00:01:04.960> you<00:01:05.140> take

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
room so it's I recommend that you take

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.560 
room so it's I recommend that you take
this<00:01:05.530> vehicle<00:01:06.189> because<00:01:06.909> it's<00:01:07.149> going<00:01:07.329> to<00:01:07.390> take

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
this vehicle because it's going to take

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.420 
this vehicle because it's going to take
a<00:01:07.600> lot<00:01:07.899> more<00:01:07.960> it's<00:01:08.470> going<00:01:08.649> to<00:01:08.740> be<00:01:08.799> faster<00:01:09.399> to

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
a lot more it's going to be faster to

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.580 
a lot more it's going to be faster to
get<00:01:09.700> to<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:09.939> location<00:01:10.210> and<00:01:10.780> you<00:01:11.170> don't<00:01:11.380> have

get to the location and you don't have

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.590 
get to the location and you don't have
to<00:01:11.740> waste<00:01:12.040> a<00:01:12.219> lot<00:01:12.340> of<00:01:12.399> time<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:12.909> kill<00:01:12.999> enemies

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600
