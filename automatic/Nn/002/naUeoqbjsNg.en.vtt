00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.830 
first I want to go over stuff I've said
recently<00:00:19.949> it's<00:00:20.340> almost<00:00:20.520> in<00:00:20.789> conflict<00:00:21.570> with<00:00:21.630> it

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
recently it's almost in conflict with it

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.929 
recently it's almost in conflict with it
because<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.080> think<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> opinion<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.640> used

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
because I think this is a opinion I used

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.550 
because I think this is a opinion I used
to<00:00:24.150> have<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.480> I'm<00:00:24.600> sort<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.840> returning<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.529> a

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
to have that I'm sort of returning to a

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.980 
to have that I'm sort of returning to a
bit<00:00:25.769> but<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:25.949> think<00:00:26.130> I've<00:00:26.220> kind<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.990> complained

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
bit but I think I've kind of complained

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.640 
bit but I think I've kind of complained
about<00:00:28.189> over<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.310> last<00:00:29.340> few<00:00:29.789> games<00:00:30.060> uh<00:00:30.650> you

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
about over the last few games uh you

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.959 
about over the last few games uh you
know<00:00:31.740> I've<00:00:31.830> complained<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.340> lot<00:00:32.520> about<00:00:32.579> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
know I've complained a lot about the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.030 
know I've complained a lot about the
writing<00:00:33.239> quality<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.320> continuity<00:00:35.010> of

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
writing quality and the continuity of

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.610 
writing quality and the continuity of
the<00:00:35.160> series<00:00:35.579> uh<00:00:35.850> into<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.930> guys<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.290> probably

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
the series uh into you guys it probably

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.479 
the series uh into you guys it probably
looks<00:00:37.770> something<00:00:37.860> like<00:00:39.950> but<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:40.980> really<00:00:41.280> think

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
looks something like but I really think

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.760 
looks something like but I really think
that<00:00:41.610> if<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.910> compare<00:00:42.420> Zelda<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.320> like<00:00:43.530> other

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
that if you compare Zelda to like other

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.920 
that if you compare Zelda to like other
stories<00:00:44.340> or<00:00:44.489> other<00:00:44.670> like<00:00:45.030> even<00:00:45.270> books<00:00:45.539> or<00:00:45.719> even

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
stories or other like even books or even

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.440 
stories or other like even books or even
even<00:00:46.649> children's<00:00:47.129> books<00:00:47.399> from<00:00:47.610> like<00:00:47.820> really

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
even children's books from like really

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.180 
even children's books from like really
well<00:00:48.750> really<00:00:49.170> well<00:00:49.440> written<00:00:49.620> ones<00:00:49.980> from

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
well really well written ones from

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.639 
well really well written ones from
really<00:00:50.430> old<00:00:50.610> times<00:00:50.789> like<00:00:51.590> Alice<00:00:52.590> in

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
really old times like Alice in

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.990 
really old times like Alice in
Wonderland<00:00:53.039> or<00:00:53.250> The<00:00:53.430> Hobbit<00:00:53.579> which<00:00:53.820> are

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
Wonderland or The Hobbit which are

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.540 
Wonderland or The Hobbit which are
children's<00:00:54.390> books<00:00:54.629> uh<00:00:55.129> Zelda's<00:00:56.129> just<00:00:56.309> not<00:00:56.460> up

children's books uh Zelda's just not up
to<00:00:56.640> snuff<00:00:56.699> there's<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.180> significant<00:00:58.109> drop<00:00:58.350> in

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
to snuff there's a significant drop in

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.110 
to snuff there's a significant drop in
the<00:00:58.770> quality<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> writing<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.760> quality

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
the quality of the writing the quality

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.939 
the quality of the writing the quality
the<00:01:00.210> storytelling<00:01:00.719> not<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.590> knee<00:01:01.770> like

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
the storytelling not that knee like

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.950 
the storytelling not that knee like
we're<00:01:02.160> expecting<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.609> literature<00:01:03.120> but<00:01:03.329> some

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
we're expecting a literature but some

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.899 
we're expecting a literature but some
series<00:01:04.439> do<00:01:04.619> actually<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> great<00:01:05.250> start<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.729> and

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
series do actually a great start on and

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.490 
series do actually a great start on and
for<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.150> series<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.720> tends<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.260> a

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
for a series that tends to have a

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.020 
for a series that tends to have a
notable<00:01:08.010> storyline<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.520> people<00:01:08.850> talk<00:01:09.000> about

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
notable storyline that people talk about

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.060 
notable storyline that people talk about
a<00:01:09.270> lot<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.140> doesn't<00:01:10.350> really<00:01:10.380> like<00:01:10.770> go

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
a lot so that doesn't really like go

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.560 
a lot so that doesn't really like go
crazy<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.670> doesn't<00:01:11.939> actually<00:01:12.030> make<00:01:12.330> it

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
crazy on it doesn't actually make it

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.660 
crazy on it doesn't actually make it
that<00:01:12.810> well<00:01:13.080> written<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:13.860> decently

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
that well written it it's decently

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.490 
that well written it it's decently
written<00:01:14.909> it's<00:01:15.030> not<00:01:15.180> bad<00:01:15.570> but<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:15.960> not<00:01:16.229> it's

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
written it's not bad but it's not it's

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.020 
written it's not bad but it's not it's
not<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.890> great<00:01:16.920> either<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.640> not<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
not that great either it's not the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.660 
not that great either it's not the
Senate<00:01:18.689> amazing<00:01:19.080> plot<00:01:19.320> animate<00:01:19.830> well<00:01:20.040> it's

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
Senate amazing plot animate well it's

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.070 
Senate amazing plot animate well it's
usually<00:01:21.000> pretty<00:01:21.090> good<00:01:21.240> concept<00:01:21.840> but<00:01:21.900> it's

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
usually pretty good concept but it's

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.320 
usually pretty good concept but it's
never<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.470> well<00:01:22.799> told<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.460> decently<00:01:24.119> told

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
never that well told it's decently told

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.440 
never that well told it's decently told
it's<00:01:24.509> it's<00:01:24.930> sufficiently<00:01:25.860> told<00:01:26.159> uh<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
it's it's sufficiently told uh and the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.240 
it's it's sufficiently told uh and the
continuity<00:01:28.080> tends<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.380> be<00:01:28.470> really<00:01:28.770> bad<00:01:28.920> where

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
continuity tends to be really bad where

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.550 
continuity tends to be really bad where
the<00:01:29.640> links<00:01:30.390> between<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.780> stories<00:01:31.140> don't<00:01:31.380> make

the links between the stories don't make

they don't make any effort to define
them<00:01:35.729> which<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:35.880> fine<00:01:36.329> sometimes<00:01:37.020> but<00:01:37.680> it

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
them which is fine sometimes but it

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.190 
them which is fine sometimes but it
really<00:01:37.979> pissed<00:01:38.220> me<00:01:38.340> off<00:01:38.400> with<00:01:38.759> Skyward<00:01:39.150> Sword

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
really pissed me off with Skyward Sword

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.760 
really pissed me off with Skyward Sword
uh<00:01:40.200> because<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.130> know<00:01:41.840> it's<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.990> freaking

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
uh because you know it's the freaking

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.200 
uh because you know it's the freaking
prequel<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.280> whole<00:01:44.430> series<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:44.880> they

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
prequel to the whole series and they

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.469 
prequel to the whole series and they
didn't<00:01:45.509> make<00:01:45.600> any<00:01:45.810> effort<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.200> connect<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.829> uh

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
didn't make any effort to connect it uh

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.030 
didn't make any effort to connect it uh
seriously<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.750> rest<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.049> series<00:01:49.290> they

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
seriously to the rest of the series they

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.520 
seriously to the rest of the series they
connected<00:01:50.659> minorly<00:01:51.659> kind<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.200> like<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.380> same

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
connected minorly kind of like the same

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.319 
connected minorly kind of like the same
thing<00:01:52.799> they<00:01:52.950> may<00:01:53.130> they<00:01:53.520> have<00:01:53.700> sufficient

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
thing they may they have sufficient

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.209 
thing they may they have sufficient
storytelling<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.170> get<00:01:55.320> their<00:01:55.560> idea<00:01:55.979> across

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
storytelling to get their idea across

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.740 
storytelling to get their idea across
but<00:01:56.579> they<00:01:56.700> don't<00:01:56.909> really<00:01:57.360> put<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.570> lot<00:01:57.630> of

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
but they don't really put a lot of

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.480 
but they don't really put a lot of
effort<00:01:58.079> into<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.439> Skyward<00:01:59.100> Sword<00:01:59.130> did<00:01:59.399> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
effort into it Skyward Sword did the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.069 
effort into it Skyward Sword did the
best<00:01:59.670> on<00:01:59.850> this<00:01:59.969> probably<00:02:00.360> with<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.600> quality

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
best on this probably with the quality

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.260 
best on this probably with the quality
of<00:02:01.290> its<00:02:01.409> dialogue<00:02:01.950> but<00:02:02.219> aside<00:02:02.880> from<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.090> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
of its dialogue but aside from that the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.609 
of its dialogue but aside from that the
storytelling<00:02:03.719> didn't<00:02:04.020> necessarily

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
storytelling didn't necessarily

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.620 
storytelling didn't necessarily
transcend<00:02:05.490> what<00:02:05.820> we're<00:02:05.969> familiar<00:02:06.119> with<00:02:06.360> what

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
transcend what we're familiar with what

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.389 
transcend what we're familiar with what
especially<00:02:07.170> on<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.409> continuity<00:02:07.950> Department

that continuity issue annoys me

that continuity issue annoys me
especially<00:02:27.560> in<00:02:27.799> that<00:02:27.950> not<00:02:28.400> this<00:02:28.670> node<00:02:28.909> because

especially in that not this node because

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.069 
especially in that not this node because
my<00:02:29.719> theory<00:02:30.340> explicitly<00:02:31.340> was<00:02:31.969> uh<00:02:32.000> was<00:02:32.870> not

my theory explicitly was uh was not

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.990 
my theory explicitly was uh was not
shown<00:02:33.409> but<00:02:34.040> because<00:02:34.400> they<00:02:34.549> didn't<00:02:34.819> show

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
shown but because they didn't show

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.309 
shown but because they didn't show
continuity<00:02:35.569> with<00:02:35.689> major<00:02:35.870> elements<00:02:36.260> the

continuity with major elements the
series<00:02:36.590> which<00:02:36.739> I<00:02:36.889> considered<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.430> dark<00:02:37.609> tribe

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
series which I considered the dark tribe

series which I considered the dark tribe
to<00:02:37.969> be<00:02:38.090> but<00:02:38.299> didn't<00:02:38.540> yes<00:02:38.719> I<00:02:38.930> need<00:02:39.170> to<00:02:39.230> be<00:02:39.319> the

um and I also want to point out that

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.629 
um and I also want to point out that
these<00:04:48.080> two<00:04:48.440> ideas<00:04:48.680> are<00:04:49.039> not<00:04:49.190> mutually

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
these two ideas are not mutually

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.310 
these two ideas are not mutually
exclusive<00:04:49.699> at<00:04:50.360> least<00:04:50.539> I<00:04:50.660> don't<00:04:50.750> feel<00:04:51.050> they<00:04:51.199> are

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
exclusive at least I don't feel they are

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.590 
exclusive at least I don't feel they are
I<00:04:51.530> don't<00:04:51.889> see<00:04:52.070> why<00:04:52.220> you<00:04:52.280> can't<00:04:52.580> do<00:04:53.120> some<00:04:53.330> world

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
I don't see why you can't do some world

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.409 
I don't see why you can't do some world
building<00:04:53.900> and<00:04:54.080> do<00:04:54.199> some<00:04:54.470> continuity<00:04:55.070> uh<00:04:55.430> while

quality writing in there because that's

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.770

an<00:05:22.070> issue<00:05:22.190> um<00:05:22.990> the<00:05:23.990> continuity<00:05:24.680> can<00:05:24.860> still<00:05:25.039> be

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
an issue um the continuity can still be

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.159 
an issue um the continuity can still be
there<00:05:25.280> too<00:05:25.490> because<00:05:25.699> you<00:05:26.000> can<00:05:26.150> still<00:05:26.509> you<00:05:27.020> can

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
there too because you can still you can

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.200 
there too because you can still you can
still<00:05:27.500> establish<00:05:28.370> connections<00:05:28.789> but<00:05:28.910> make<00:05:29.090> the

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
still establish connections but make the

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.850 
still establish connections but make the
mysterious<00:05:29.660> making<00:05:29.930> a<00:05:30.020> little<00:05:30.320> vague<00:05:30.530> but

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
mysterious making a little vague but

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.589 
mysterious making a little vague but
they're<00:05:31.610> still<00:05:31.729> solid<00:05:32.240> if<00:05:32.330> you're<00:05:32.449> actually

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
they're still solid if you're actually

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.029 
they're still solid if you're actually
paying<00:05:32.840> attention<00:05:32.930> actually<00:05:33.530> looking<00:05:33.800> at<00:05:33.889> and

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
paying attention actually looking at and

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:35.680 
paying attention actually looking at and
actually<00:05:34.400> connecting<00:05:34.849> things<00:05:35.000> that<00:05:35.479> that's

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
actually connecting things that that's

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.839 
actually connecting things that that's
that's<00:05:35.990> fine<00:05:36.409> it<00:05:36.620> that<00:05:36.830> would<00:05:36.979> be<00:05:37.099> still<00:05:37.490> very

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
that's fine it that would be still very

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:39.279 
that's fine it that would be still very
enjoyable<00:05:38.120> plot<00:05:38.449> assault<00:05:38.750> hands<00:05:38.930> that's<00:05:39.139> what

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
enjoyable plot assault hands that's what

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.200 
enjoyable plot assault hands that's what
they<00:05:39.440> do<00:05:39.500> now<00:05:39.919> just<00:05:40.639> talking<00:05:40.880> about<00:05:40.909> doing

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
they do now just talking about doing

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.700 
they do now just talking about doing
more<00:05:41.419> of<00:05:41.479> it<00:05:41.599> so<00:05:41.750> you<00:05:41.810> can<00:05:41.960> actually<00:05:42.110> paint<00:05:42.590> a

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
more of it so you can actually paint a

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.610 
more of it so you can actually paint a
real<00:05:42.860> picture<00:05:43.159> of<00:05:43.400> what's<00:05:43.580> going<00:05:43.639> on<00:05:44.000> uh<00:05:44.690> but

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
real picture of what's going on uh but

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.140 
real picture of what's going on uh but
meanwhile<00:05:46.010> the<00:05:46.190> storyline<00:05:46.639> is<00:05:46.789> mostly

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
meanwhile the storyline is mostly

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.550 
meanwhile the storyline is mostly
self-contained<00:05:47.780> and<00:05:47.960> it<00:05:48.110> doesn't<00:05:48.409> really

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
self-contained and it doesn't really

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.439 
self-contained and it doesn't really
need<00:05:48.860> the<00:05:49.039> other<00:05:49.159> game<00:05:49.430> so<00:05:49.940> it's<00:05:50.120> still

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:50.449 
need the other game so it's still

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:52.629 
need the other game so it's still
building<00:05:50.810> its<00:05:50.960> own<00:05:51.169> tail<00:05:51.500> its<00:05:51.770> own<00:05:52.010> world<00:05:52.340> and

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
building its own tail its own world and

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.399 
building its own tail its own world and
the<00:05:53.030> style<00:05:53.330> in<00:05:53.630> the<00:05:53.720> world<00:05:53.900> can<00:05:54.139> still<00:05:54.320> be

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:54.409 
the style in the world can still be

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:57.490 
the style in the world can still be
completely<00:05:55.009> unique<00:05:55.310> and<00:05:55.750> it<00:05:56.750> can<00:05:57.199> preserve

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
completely unique and it can preserve

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.379 
completely unique and it can preserve
both<00:05:57.710> sales<00:05:58.009> so<00:05:58.220> I<00:05:58.280> think<00:05:58.340> it<00:05:58.550> can<00:05:58.699> do<00:05:58.849> both<00:05:59.090> but

00:05:59.379 --> 00:05:59.389 
both sales so I think it can do both but

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:01.540 
both sales so I think it can do both but
I<00:05:59.449> do<00:05:59.570> agree<00:06:00.050> that<00:06:00.320> Zelda<00:06:00.770> needs<00:06:01.009> to<00:06:01.190> stay<00:06:01.430> as

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
I do agree that Zelda needs to stay as

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.850 
I do agree that Zelda needs to stay as
it<00:06:01.699> is<00:06:01.729> where<00:06:02.090> the<00:06:02.210> stories<00:06:02.570> are<00:06:02.720> standalone<00:06:03.440> I

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
it is where the stories are standalone I

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.760 
it is where the stories are standalone I
just<00:06:04.669> don't<00:06:04.820> think<00:06:04.970> that<00:06:05.060> they<00:06:05.180> needs<00:06:05.389> to<00:06:05.770> mean

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
just don't think that they needs to mean

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.040 
just don't think that they needs to mean
there's<00:06:07.070> no<00:06:07.220> connection<00:06:07.669> or<00:06:08.060> not<00:06:08.780> more

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
there's no connection or not more

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.649 
there's no connection or not more
connection<00:06:09.500> but<00:06:10.280> yeah<00:06:11.030> so<00:06:11.270> those<00:06:11.419> are<00:06:11.539> my

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:11.659 
connection but yeah so those are my

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:13.390 
connection but yeah so those are my
