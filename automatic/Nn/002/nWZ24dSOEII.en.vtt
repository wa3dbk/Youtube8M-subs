ok<00:00:02.429> everybody<00:00:02.700> we're<00:00:02.970> gonna<00:00:03.090> continue<00:00:03.330> with

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
ok everybody we're gonna continue with

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.530 
ok everybody we're gonna continue with
my<00:00:04.200> review<00:00:04.830> of<00:00:05.009> the<00:00:06.000> Kenwood<00:00:06.690> exelon<00:00:07.589> KDC<00:00:08.540> x99

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
my review of the Kenwood exelon KDC x99

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.440 
my review of the Kenwood exelon KDC x99
3<00:00:10.050> I<00:00:10.260> thought<00:00:10.920> this<00:00:11.040> time<00:00:11.219> around<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.670> do<00:00:11.730> the

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
3 I thought this time around I do the

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.490 
3 I thought this time around I do the
iPod<00:00:13.070> functionality<00:00:14.070> in<00:00:14.340> this<00:00:14.700> unit<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.500> I

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
iPod functionality in this unit and I

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.080 
iPod functionality in this unit and I
guess<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.800> place<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.310> start<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.820> with<00:00:17.850> the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
guess the place to start is with the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.490 
guess the place to start is with the
iPod<00:00:18.510> itself<00:00:19.050> now<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:20.359> own<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.750> guess<00:00:22.080> three

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
iPod itself now I own I guess three

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.800 
iPod itself now I own I guess three
iPods<00:00:22.920> at<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.550> point<00:00:23.820> in<00:00:23.910> time<00:00:24.029> but<00:00:24.539> none<00:00:24.779> of

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
iPods at this point in time but none of

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.660 
iPods at this point in time but none of
them<00:00:24.960> are<00:00:25.140> any<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.769> new<00:00:26.010> ones<00:00:26.250> like<00:00:26.490> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
them are any of the new ones like the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.980 
them are any of the new ones like the
5th<00:00:27.029> generation<00:00:27.119> iPod

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
5th generation iPod

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.320 
5th generation iPod
or<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.500> second<00:00:29.099> generation<00:00:29.340> iPod<00:00:29.820> Touch<00:00:29.849> I

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
or the second generation iPod Touch I

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.380 
or the second generation iPod Touch I
have<00:00:30.960> this<00:00:31.410> one<00:00:31.740> which<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.279> think<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.969> third

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
have this one which is I think a third

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.830 
have this one which is I think a third
generation<00:00:33.750> iPod<00:00:34.500> not<00:00:35.190> 100%<00:00:35.760> sure<00:00:35.790> but<00:00:36.180> it's

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
generation iPod not 100% sure but it's

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.310 
generation iPod not 100% sure but it's
it's<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.260> 30-30<00:00:38.129> gig<00:00:38.399> version<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.930> also<00:00:40.110> have

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
it's a 30-30 gig version and I also have

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.889 
it's a 30-30 gig version and I also have
the<00:00:40.440> iPod<00:00:40.770> Touch<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:42.000> first<00:00:42.270> generation<00:00:42.750> one

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
the iPod Touch the first generation one

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.440 
the iPod Touch the first generation one
and<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.440> nano<00:00:43.710> from<00:00:44.190> ages<00:00:45.180> ago<00:00:46.489> it<00:00:47.489> charges<00:00:48.030> all

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
and a nano from ages ago it charges all

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.369 
and a nano from ages ago it charges all
of<00:00:48.840> these<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:50.280> think<00:00:51.030> what<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.960> comes<00:00:52.230> down

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
of these and I think what it comes down

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.709 
of these and I think what it comes down
to<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:52.920> comes<00:00:53.250> down<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> cable<00:00:54.030> there

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
to is it comes down to the cable there

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.630 
to is it comes down to the cable there
is<00:00:54.870> some<00:00:55.170> question<00:00:55.739> about<00:00:55.860> whether<00:00:56.070> or<00:00:56.430> not

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
is some question about whether or not

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.869 
is some question about whether or not
the<00:00:57.570> new<00:00:57.930> iPods<00:00:58.590> will<00:00:58.920> charge<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.730> new

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
the new iPods will charge in the new

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.610 
the new iPods will charge in the new
stereos<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.480> it's<00:01:00.690> causing<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.079> bit<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.230> grief

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
stereos and it's causing a bit of grief

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.149 
stereos and it's causing a bit of grief
in<00:01:02.210> in<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.390> stereo<00:01:03.989> circles<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.500> think<00:01:04.979> right

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
in in the stereo circles I think right

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.770 
in in the stereo circles I think right
now<00:01:05.189> because<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.850> new<00:01:06.060> ones<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.479> think<00:01:06.659> what

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
now because the new ones I think what

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.210 
now because the new ones I think what
Apple<00:01:07.049> did<00:01:07.200> was<00:01:07.409> they<00:01:07.590> switched<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.159> around

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
Apple did was they switched it around

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.370 
Apple did was they switched it around
and<00:01:08.700> now<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.180> voltage<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> little<00:01:10.260> bit

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
and now the voltage is a little bit

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.340 
and now the voltage is a little bit
different<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.630> some<00:01:12.630> iPods<00:01:12.990> aren't

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
different and so some iPods aren't

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.800 
different and so some iPods aren't
charging<00:01:13.740> from<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.520> dongles<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.630> car

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
charging from the dongles in the car

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.789 
charging from the dongles in the car
stereos<00:01:16.280> that's<00:01:17.280> not<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> case<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.330> one

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
stereos that's not the case on this one

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.469 
stereos that's not the case on this one
at<00:01:19.799> least<00:01:19.860> not<00:01:20.100> from<00:01:20.310> what<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.549> know<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.939> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
at least not from what I know and the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.480 
at least not from what I know and the
reason<00:01:21.630> for<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.350> because<00:01:22.470> like<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.430> said

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
reason for that is because like I said

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.580 
reason for that is because like I said
they<00:01:23.700> use<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.850> dongle<00:01:24.600> mechanism<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.290> connect

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
they use a dongle mechanism to connect

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.870 
they use a dongle mechanism to connect
the<00:01:25.680> iPods<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.250> basically<00:01:26.520> what<00:01:26.729> you're

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the iPods so basically what you're

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.280 
the iPods so basically what you're
looking<00:01:26.909> at<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.750> standard<00:01:28.229> USB<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:29.270> to

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
looking at is a standard USB in to

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.740 
looking at is a standard USB in to
connect<00:01:31.290> your<00:01:31.560> iPod<00:01:31.979> as<00:01:32.490> far<00:01:32.700> as<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.880> know<00:01:32.939> that

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
connect your iPod as far as I know that

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.270 
connect your iPod as far as I know that
gives<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:35.689> basically<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.840> power<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.320> where

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
gives you basically the power and where

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.399 
gives you basically the power and where
it<00:01:38.460> goes<00:01:38.490> voltage<00:01:39.150> wise<00:01:39.390> into<00:01:39.780> which<00:01:40.020> pin

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
it goes voltage wise into which pin

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.940 
it goes voltage wise into which pin
depends<00:01:41.130> entirely<00:01:41.430> upon<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:42.150> actual<00:01:42.950> cable

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
depends entirely upon the actual cable

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.010 
depends entirely upon the actual cable
that<00:01:44.130> comes<00:01:44.399> with<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.850> iPod<00:01:45.240> so

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
that comes with the iPod so

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.870 
that comes with the iPod so
theoretically<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:47.340> shouldn't<00:01:47.610> be<00:01:47.700> an<00:01:47.820> issue

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
theoretically this shouldn't be an issue

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.819 
theoretically this shouldn't be an issue
and<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.240> should<00:01:48.390> charge<00:01:48.570> every<00:01:48.960> iPod<00:01:49.350> but<00:01:49.799> I

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
and it should charge every iPod but I

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.350 
and it should charge every iPod but I
can<00:01:50.009> tell<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.250> from<00:01:50.399> personal<00:01:50.490> experience

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
can tell you from personal experience

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.810 
can tell you from personal experience
that<00:01:51.420> I've<00:01:51.600> had<00:01:51.630> no<00:01:51.930> problems<00:01:52.350> yet<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.520> that's

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
that I've had no problems yet so that's

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.310 
that I've had no problems yet so that's
that's<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.240> good<00:01:54.329> sign<00:01:57.020> but<00:01:58.020> there<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.290> a

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
that's a good sign but there is a

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.690 
that's a good sign but there is a
trade-off<00:01:58.649> for<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.070> now<00:01:59.219> what<00:01:59.340> I'm<00:01:59.399> gonna<00:01:59.490> do

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
trade-off for this now what I'm gonna do

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.969 
trade-off for this now what I'm gonna do
is<00:01:59.880> I'm<00:02:00.030> going<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.740> sorry<00:02:01.740> about<00:02:01.920> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
is I'm going to sorry about the

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
so life's good even though it's not on

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.330 
so life's good even though it's not on
anyway<00:02:22.160> I'm<00:02:22.250> just<00:02:22.310> gonna<00:02:22.460> leave<00:02:22.640> this<00:02:22.760> in<00:02:24.340> so

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
anyway I'm just gonna leave this in so

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.220 
anyway I'm just gonna leave this in so
this<00:02:26.350> this<00:02:27.350> little<00:02:27.680> power<00:02:28.190> thing<00:02:28.550> is<00:02:28.700> actually

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
this this little power thing is actually

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.750 
this this little power thing is actually
not<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:30.560> good<00:02:30.590> in<00:02:30.860> some<00:02:31.070> ways<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.430> think<00:02:31.640> as

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
not so good in some ways I think as

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.840 
not so good in some ways I think as
you'll<00:02:32.480> see<00:02:32.950> what<00:02:33.950> winds<00:02:34.160> up<00:02:34.280> happening<00:02:34.340> is

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
you'll see what winds up happening is

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.760 
you'll see what winds up happening is
although<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.300> can<00:02:35.540> control<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.050> iPod<00:02:36.560> from

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
although it can control the iPod from

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.310 
although it can control the iPod from
the<00:02:36.980> deck<00:02:37.190> when<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:38.240> turn<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.600> on<00:02:38.690> let's<00:02:39.020> let's

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
the deck when you turn it on let's let's

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.720 
the deck when you turn it on let's let's
turn<00:02:39.530> it<00:02:39.620> on<00:02:39.710> let's<00:02:39.890> grab<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.220> source<00:02:40.460> and

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
turn it on let's grab the source and

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.640 
turn it on let's grab the source and
we'll<00:02:41.450> switch<00:02:41.630> it<00:02:41.660> to<00:02:41.780> iPod<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.380> knows<00:02:42.620> that

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
we'll switch it to iPod it knows that

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.950 
we'll switch it to iPod it knows that
there's<00:02:43.040> an<00:02:43.130> iPod<00:02:43.520> attached<00:02:43.940> from<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.690> USB

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
there's an iPod attached from the USB

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.960 
there's an iPod attached from the USB
port<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:45.530> don't<00:02:45.680> know<00:02:45.770> how<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.070> does<00:02:46.220> that<00:02:46.460> but

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
port I don't know how it does that but

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.760 
port I don't know how it does that but
it<00:02:47.000> can<00:02:47.210> differentiate<00:02:47.660> between<00:02:47.960> an<00:02:48.260> iPod<00:02:48.590> and

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
it can differentiate between an iPod and

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.070 
it can differentiate between an iPod and
the<00:02:48.830> thumbnail<00:02:49.070> drive<00:02:49.400> so<00:02:50.120> if<00:02:50.360> we<00:02:50.510> select<00:02:50.810> the

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
the thumbnail drive so if we select the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.080 
the thumbnail drive so if we select the
iPod<00:02:51.470> interface<00:02:51.800> what<00:02:52.700> winds<00:02:52.970> up<00:02:53.030> happening

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
iPod interface what winds up happening

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.900 
iPod interface what winds up happening
is<00:02:53.660> it<00:02:53.810> will<00:02:53.840> select<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.320> iPod<00:02:54.770> and<00:02:55.010> then<00:02:55.700> it

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
is it will select the iPod and then it

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.960 
is it will select the iPod and then it
will<00:02:56.120> read<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:56.840> this<00:02:57.410> reading<00:02:57.830> seems<00:02:58.790> to

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
will read it and this reading seems to

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.380 
will read it and this reading seems to
take<00:02:59.120> a<00:02:59.180> long<00:02:59.540> time<00:02:59.960> at<00:03:00.440> least<00:03:00.890> for<00:03:01.160> me<00:03:01.430> versus

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
take a long time at least for me versus

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.540 
take a long time at least for me versus
other<00:03:02.750> units<00:03:03.260> like<00:03:03.470> for<00:03:03.800> instance<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.220> Alpine

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
other units like for instance the Alpine

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.890 
other units like for instance the Alpine
that<00:03:04.670> I<00:03:04.730> had<00:03:04.850> before<00:03:05.000> sort<00:03:05.600> of<00:03:05.690> playing

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
that I had before sort of playing

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.960 
that I had before sort of playing
immediately<00:03:06.200> whereas<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.160> takes<00:03:07.340> about<00:03:07.520> that

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
immediately whereas it takes about that

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.450 
immediately whereas it takes about that
long<00:03:08.350> every<00:03:09.350> time<00:03:09.590> you<00:03:09.770> switch<00:03:10.040> over<00:03:10.250> I'm

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
long every time you switch over I'm

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.890 
long every time you switch over I'm
going<00:03:10.610> to<00:03:10.670> turn<00:03:10.820> this<00:03:10.970> down<00:03:11.030> so<00:03:11.420> we've<00:03:11.600> I<00:03:11.750> mean

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
going to turn this down so we've I mean

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.400 
going to turn this down so we've I mean
that<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.260> stones<00:03:12.500> are<00:03:12.710> bad<00:03:12.830> but<00:03:14.230> basically<00:03:15.230> it

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
that the stones are bad but basically it

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.740 
that the stones are bad but basically it
takes<00:03:15.590> about<00:03:15.740> that<00:03:16.130> long<00:03:16.190> to<00:03:16.880> read<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.330> ipod

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
takes about that long to read the ipod

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.930 
takes about that long to read the ipod
every<00:03:18.170> single<00:03:18.440> time<00:03:18.650> you<00:03:19.070> either<00:03:19.220> connect<00:03:19.760> it

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
every single time you either connect it

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.960 
every single time you either connect it
or<00:03:20.090> switch<00:03:20.750> it<00:03:20.780> over<00:03:21.050> which<00:03:21.890> is<00:03:22.070> a<00:03:22.100> little<00:03:22.760> bit

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
or switch it over which is a little bit

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.060 
or switch it over which is a little bit
of<00:03:23.120> a<00:03:23.240> bother<00:03:23.480> if<00:03:23.900> you<00:03:24.470> or<00:03:24.800> if<00:03:24.920> you're

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
of a bother if you or if you're

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.190 
of a bother if you or if you're
impatient<00:03:25.550> or<00:03:25.940> if<00:03:26.090> you're<00:03:26.240> you<00:03:26.780> know<00:03:26.870> for<00:03:27.080> some

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
impatient or if you're you know for some

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.750 
impatient or if you're you know for some
strange<00:03:27.440> reason<00:03:27.470> you<00:03:27.920> you<00:03:28.340> don't<00:03:28.490> like<00:03:28.670> to

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
strange reason you you don't like to

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.680 
strange reason you you don't like to
wait<00:03:30.040> that<00:03:31.040> is<00:03:31.280> also<00:03:31.550> present<00:03:31.940> when<00:03:32.210> you<00:03:32.270> start

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
wait that is also present when you start

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.930 
wait that is also present when you start
to<00:03:32.990> search<00:03:33.410> and<00:03:33.740> see<00:03:34.010> cuz<00:03:34.400> that's<00:03:34.580> one<00:03:34.730> of<00:03:34.850> the

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
to search and see cuz that's one of the

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.370 
to search and see cuz that's one of the
things<00:03:35.120> that<00:03:35.330> you<00:03:35.690> know<00:03:35.780> you're<00:03:35.930> I<00:03:35.990> was

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
things that you know you're I was

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.510 
things that you know you're I was
interested<00:03:36.620> anyway<00:03:37.010> when<00:03:37.190> I<00:03:37.220> was<00:03:37.250> doing<00:03:37.460> this

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
interested anyway when I was doing this

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.040 
interested anyway when I was doing this
there's<00:03:37.940> a<00:03:38.000> search<00:03:38.210> functionality<00:03:38.660> so

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
there's a search functionality so

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.390 
there's a search functionality so
basically<00:03:39.350> you<00:03:39.500> put<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.680> click<00:03:40.070> the<00:03:40.190> search

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
basically you put the click the search

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.370 
basically you put the click the search
and<00:03:40.550> it's<00:03:40.700> it's<00:03:40.970> pretty<00:03:41.600> basic<00:03:41.750> up<00:03:42.110> to<00:03:42.260> this

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
and it's it's pretty basic up to this

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.320 
and it's it's pretty basic up to this
point<00:03:42.620> it's<00:03:42.980> like<00:03:43.100> artists<00:03:43.610> albums<00:03:44.030> songs

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
point it's like artists albums songs

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.690 
point it's like artists albums songs
podcast<00:03:45.170> genres<00:03:45.680> you<00:03:45.860> can<00:03:46.220> select<00:03:46.520> all<00:03:46.670> of

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
podcast genres you can select all of

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.400 
podcast genres you can select all of
this<00:03:46.910> stuff<00:03:47.150> so<00:03:47.630> for<00:03:47.780> instance<00:03:48.050> if<00:03:48.170> we<00:03:48.200> go<00:03:48.350> to

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
this stuff so for instance if we go to

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.280 
this stuff so for instance if we go to
songs<00:03:48.800> okay<00:03:49.790> there's<00:03:50.630> a<00:03:50.690> number<00:03:50.990> of<00:03:51.080> ways<00:03:51.260> that

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
songs okay there's a number of ways that

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.630 
songs okay there's a number of ways that
you<00:03:51.620> can<00:03:51.980> search<00:03:52.670> now<00:03:53.330> you<00:03:53.990> get<00:03:54.230> five<00:03:54.620> lines<00:03:55.340> of

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
you can search now you get five lines of

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.970 
you can search now you get five lines of
text<00:03:55.910> so<00:03:56.240> that<00:03:56.270> gives<00:03:56.600> you<00:03:56.690> a<00:03:56.720> lot<00:03:57.110> of<00:03:57.440> context

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
text so that gives you a lot of context

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.070 
text so that gives you a lot of context
which<00:03:58.100> is<00:03:58.250> really<00:03:58.670> pretty<00:03:59.000> sweet<00:03:59.300> and<00:03:59.480> when

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
which is really pretty sweet and when

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.710 
which is really pretty sweet and when
you<00:04:00.170> go<00:04:00.590> through<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:01.220> list<00:04:01.430> it<00:04:02.030> kind<00:04:02.570> of

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
you go through the list it kind of

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.600 
you go through the list it kind of
depending<00:04:03.470> upon<00:04:03.590> how<00:04:03.740> big<00:04:03.800> your<00:04:04.190> collection

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
depending upon how big your collection

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.260 
depending upon how big your collection
is<00:04:04.730> can<00:04:05.150> be<00:04:05.330> totally<00:04:05.900> unruly<00:04:06.700> so<00:04:07.700> it<00:04:07.910> takes<00:04:08.120> you

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
is can be totally unruly so it takes you

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.820 
is can be totally unruly so it takes you
awhile<00:04:08.360> like<00:04:08.690> God<00:04:08.930> forbid<00:04:09.230> I<00:04:09.260> had<00:04:09.470> to<00:04:09.560> go<00:04:09.680> all

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
awhile like God forbid I had to go all

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.470 
awhile like God forbid I had to go all
the<00:04:09.860> way<00:04:09.950> down<00:04:10.190> to<00:04:10.370> like<00:04:10.520> R<00:04:10.700> or<00:04:11.150> something

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
the way down to like R or something

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.330 
the way down to like R or something
doing<00:04:11.720> this<00:04:11.870> I'd<00:04:12.590> be<00:04:12.620> sitting<00:04:13.070> here<00:04:13.100> all<00:04:13.310> day

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
doing this I'd be sitting here all day

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.580 
doing this I'd be sitting here all day
so<00:04:13.700> the<00:04:14.209> solution<00:04:14.690> to<00:04:14.720> that<00:04:14.840> at<00:04:15.200> least<00:04:15.380> from

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
so the solution to that at least from

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.070 
so the solution to that at least from
kenwood<00:04:16.010> perspective<00:04:16.640> is<00:04:16.760> to<00:04:17.359> give<00:04:17.690> you<00:04:17.900> and

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
kenwood perspective is to give you and

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.810 
kenwood perspective is to give you and
you<00:04:18.140> get<00:04:18.290> this<00:04:18.410> by<00:04:18.620> pushing<00:04:18.890> down<00:04:19.010> a<00:04:19.430> little

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
you get this by pushing down a little

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.789 
you get this by pushing down a little
alphabetized<00:04:20.540> list<00:04:20.690> that<00:04:21.080> you<00:04:21.170> can<00:04:21.320> then<00:04:21.500> go

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
alphabetized list that you can then go

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.510 
alphabetized list that you can then go
to<00:04:21.859> and<00:04:22.280> search<00:04:23.000> but<00:04:23.750> if<00:04:24.050> you<00:04:24.470> click<00:04:24.740> R<00:04:24.979> for

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
to and search but if you click R for

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.580 
to and search but if you click R for
instance<00:04:25.910> it<00:04:26.090> searches<00:04:26.990> on<00:04:27.110> our

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
instance it searches on our

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.530 
instance it searches on our
for<00:04:27.889> an<00:04:27.980> inordinate<00:04:28.580> amount<00:04:28.790> of<00:04:29.060> time<00:04:29.120> before

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
for an inordinate amount of time before

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.010 
for an inordinate amount of time before
it<00:04:29.750> winds<00:04:29.990> up<00:04:30.199> getting<00:04:30.530> to<00:04:31.310> our<00:04:31.840> which<00:04:32.840> is<00:04:32.990> a

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
it winds up getting to our which is a

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.400 
it winds up getting to our which is a
little<00:04:33.410> bit<00:04:33.530> weird<00:04:33.770> so<00:04:34.340> it<00:04:34.550> has<00:04:35.389> the<00:04:35.840> ability

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
little bit weird so it has the ability

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.830 
little bit weird so it has the ability
to<00:04:36.440> get<00:04:36.800> to<00:04:37.010> places<00:04:37.220> quote<00:04:38.060> unquote<00:04:38.210> fast

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
to get to places quote unquote fast

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.070 
to get to places quote unquote fast
although<00:04:39.740> it's<00:04:39.889> not<00:04:40.070> doing<00:04:40.580> it<00:04:40.729> very<00:04:41.210> fast<00:04:41.660> for

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
although it's not doing it very fast for

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.879 
although it's not doing it very fast for
me

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
me

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:44.890 
me
I<00:04:42.919> don't<00:04:43.610> know<00:04:43.699> if<00:04:43.850> there's<00:04:44.060> a<00:04:44.150> difference<00:04:44.690> in

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
I don't know if there's a difference in

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.830 
I don't know if there's a difference in
the<00:04:45.260> iPod<00:04:45.830> in<00:04:46.040> question<00:04:46.699> in<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.570> amount<00:04:47.780> of

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
the iPod in question in the amount of

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.879 
the iPod in question in the amount of
time<00:04:48.020> it<00:04:48.139> takes<00:04:48.260> you<00:04:48.410> to<00:04:48.500> get<00:04:48.620> where<00:04:48.770> you're

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
time it takes you to get where you're

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:50.800 
time it takes you to get where you're
going<00:04:48.919> but<00:04:49.460> one<00:04:50.030> way<00:04:50.150> or<00:04:50.180> another<00:04:50.300> it<00:04:50.630> does

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
going but one way or another it does

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.689 
going but one way or another it does
take<00:04:51.080> a<00:04:51.290> certain<00:04:51.530> amount<00:04:51.680> of<00:04:51.860> time<00:04:52.100> before

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
take a certain amount of time before

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.090 
take a certain amount of time before
you'll<00:04:53.060> see<00:04:53.419> the<00:04:53.630> are<00:04:53.810> is<00:04:54.080> listed<00:04:54.560> even<00:04:54.740> and

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
you'll see the are is listed even and

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.180 
you'll see the are is listed even and
that<00:04:55.130> is<00:04:56.090> a<00:04:56.120> big<00:04:56.960> downfall<00:04:57.500> of<00:04:58.040> this

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
that is a big downfall of this

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.159 
that is a big downfall of this
particular<00:04:58.729> unit<00:04:58.880> it's<00:04:59.479> not<00:04:59.660> so<00:04:59.810> big<00:04:59.960> a<00:04:59.990> deal

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
particular unit it's not so big a deal

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:01.930 
particular unit it's not so big a deal
for<00:05:00.410> me<00:05:00.530> because<00:05:00.800> I<00:05:00.830> tend<00:05:01.100> to<00:05:01.220> choose<00:05:01.760> my

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
for me because I tend to choose my

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.129 
for me because I tend to choose my
albums<00:05:02.330> and<00:05:02.479> play<00:05:02.660> them<00:05:02.810> all<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:03.020> way<00:05:03.110> through

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
albums and play them all the way through

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.050 
albums and play them all the way through
but<00:05:03.860> if<00:05:03.950> you're<00:05:04.100> shuffling<00:05:04.310> all<00:05:04.639> the<00:05:04.729> time<00:05:04.940> or

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
but if you're shuffling all the time or

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.670 
but if you're shuffling all the time or
if<00:05:05.150> you've<00:05:05.270> got<00:05:05.389> a<00:05:05.419> particular<00:05:05.600> song<00:05:06.290> in<00:05:06.470> mind

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
if you've got a particular song in mind

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.890 
if you've got a particular song in mind
you're<00:05:07.310> gonna<00:05:07.460> be<00:05:07.639> better<00:05:08.060> off<00:05:08.330> even<00:05:08.600> to

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
you're gonna be better off even to

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.580 
you're gonna be better off even to
disconnect<00:05:09.440> the<00:05:09.620> iPod<00:05:10.010> and<00:05:10.870> just<00:05:11.870> use<00:05:12.169> it<00:05:12.200> and

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
disconnect the iPod and just use it and

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.530 
disconnect the iPod and just use it and
then<00:05:12.979> plug<00:05:13.190> it<00:05:13.340> back<00:05:13.370> in<00:05:13.669> before<00:05:13.850> you<00:05:14.090> find<00:05:14.360> it

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
then plug it back in before you find it

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.440 
then plug it back in before you find it
so<00:05:15.139> now<00:05:15.770> we've<00:05:15.919> got<00:05:16.070> the<00:05:16.160> ours<00:05:16.370> we're<00:05:16.970> great<00:05:17.180> we

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.330 
well that's good to have not sure let's
have<00:05:28.310> some<00:05:28.520> bone<00:05:28.669> iam<00:05:28.880> so<00:05:29.510> anyway<00:05:30.340> that's

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
have some bone iam so anyway that's

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.430 
have some bone iam so anyway that's
that's<00:05:31.850> how<00:05:32.000> you<00:05:32.060> get<00:05:32.300> around<00:05:32.479> in<00:05:32.990> this<00:05:33.229> and

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
that's how you get around in this and

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.670 
that's how you get around in this and
that<00:05:34.070> is<00:05:34.280> probably<00:05:34.550> the<00:05:34.789> biggest<00:05:35.470> downfall<00:05:36.470> of

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
that is probably the biggest downfall of

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.300 
that is probably the biggest downfall of
this<00:05:37.220> unit<00:05:37.760> is<00:05:37.910> how<00:05:38.060> long<00:05:38.330> it<00:05:38.570> takes<00:05:38.840> to<00:05:39.310> fine

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
this unit is how long it takes to fine

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.430 
this unit is how long it takes to fine
tunes<00:05:40.760> if<00:05:41.150> you<00:05:41.300> want<00:05:41.450> to<00:05:41.539> find<00:05:41.720> a<00:05:41.870> particular

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
tunes if you want to find a particular

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.310 
tunes if you want to find a particular
tune<00:05:43.000> aside<00:05:44.000> from<00:05:44.180> that<00:05:44.240> we've<00:05:44.720> got<00:05:44.960> some

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
tune aside from that we've got some

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.990 
tune aside from that we've got some
pretty<00:05:45.680> decent<00:05:45.919> functions<00:05:46.430> going<00:05:46.610> on<00:05:46.789> here

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
pretty decent functions going on here

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.270 
pretty decent functions going on here
what<00:05:47.450> winds<00:05:47.750> up<00:05:47.810> happening<00:05:47.870> is<00:05:48.620> so<00:05:49.130> yeah

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
what winds up happening is so yeah

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.650 
what winds up happening is so yeah
you've<00:05:49.460> got<00:05:49.610> a<00:05:49.639> bunch<00:05:49.849> of<00:05:49.970> options<00:05:50.090> here<00:05:50.570> and

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
you've got a bunch of options here and

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.000 
you've got a bunch of options here and
now<00:05:50.810> what<00:05:51.020> you<00:05:51.169> can<00:05:51.289> do<00:05:51.410> these<00:05:51.620> are<00:05:51.740> the<00:05:51.830> random

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
now what you can do these are the random

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.100 
now what you can do these are the random
functions<00:05:52.639> so<00:05:53.150> you<00:05:53.180> can<00:05:53.419> designate<00:05:53.720> whether

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
functions so you can designate whether

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.140 
functions so you can designate whether
or<00:05:54.229> not<00:05:54.320> you<00:05:54.470> want<00:05:54.710> to<00:05:54.770> randomize<00:05:55.370> the<00:05:55.610> folder

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
or not you want to randomize the folder

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.379 
or not you want to randomize the folder
all<00:05:56.570> or<00:05:57.260> file<00:05:57.860> repeat<00:05:58.490> I<00:05:58.610> guess<00:05:58.849> that's<00:05:59.090> loop

00:05:59.379 --> 00:05:59.389 
all or file repeat I guess that's loop

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:01.210 
all or file repeat I guess that's loop
and<00:05:59.599> these<00:06:00.020> two<00:06:00.229> things<00:06:00.500> I<00:06:00.650> figure<00:06:01.010> are

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
and these two things I figure are

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.610 
and these two things I figure are
probably<00:06:01.820> shared<00:06:02.180> amongst<00:06:02.690> the<00:06:02.870> USB<00:06:03.380> thumb

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
probably shared amongst the USB thumb

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.040 
probably shared amongst the USB thumb
nail<00:06:03.830> drive<00:06:04.099> and<00:06:04.340> iPod<00:06:04.760> functionalities<00:06:05.570> so

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
nail drive and iPod functionalities so

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.300 
nail drive and iPod functionalities so
basically<00:06:06.349> if<00:06:06.500> you<00:06:06.530> want<00:06:06.710> to<00:06:06.770> use<00:06:06.919> one<00:06:07.099> of<00:06:07.130> them

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
basically if you want to use one of them

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.730 
basically if you want to use one of them
you<00:06:07.400> just<00:06:07.550> click<00:06:07.910> and<00:06:08.090> it<00:06:08.510> will<00:06:08.690> say<00:06:08.960> you<00:06:09.650> know

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
you just click and it will say you know

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.320 
you just click and it will say you know
file<00:06:09.979> repeat<00:06:10.340> and<00:06:10.490> it'll<00:06:10.639> repeat<00:06:10.910> all<00:06:11.060> of<00:06:11.090> that

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
file repeat and it'll repeat all of that

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.480 
file repeat and it'll repeat all of that
or<00:06:11.570> you<00:06:11.690> can<00:06:11.810> say<00:06:11.960> all<00:06:12.139> random<00:06:12.560> at<00:06:12.979> that<00:06:13.220> point

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
or you can say all random at that point

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.270 
or you can say all random at that point
it<00:06:13.789> stops<00:06:14.630> the<00:06:15.110> one<00:06:15.260> that<00:06:15.410> it's<00:06:15.530> playing<00:06:15.800> finds

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
it stops the one that it's playing finds

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.860 
it stops the one that it's playing finds
you<00:06:16.340> a<00:06:16.370> random<00:06:16.580> track<00:06:16.970> and<00:06:17.180> from<00:06:17.360> here<00:06:17.570> on<00:06:17.599> in

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
you a random track and from here on in

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.529 
you a random track and from here on in
will<00:06:18.440> scour<00:06:18.800> the<00:06:18.919> entire<00:06:19.070> iPod<00:06:19.910> looking<00:06:20.360> for

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:20.539 
will scour the entire iPod looking for

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:23.379 
will scour the entire iPod looking for
stuff<00:06:20.720> to<00:06:21.020> play<00:06:21.200> and<00:06:21.789> those<00:06:22.789> are<00:06:22.970> the<00:06:23.060> options

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:23.389 
stuff to play and those are the options

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:25.450 
stuff to play and those are the options
for<00:06:23.599> that<00:06:23.750> you<00:06:24.470> go<00:06:24.590> into<00:06:24.740> the<00:06:24.830> menu<00:06:24.979> command

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
for that you go into the menu command

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.589 
for that you go into the menu command
you've<00:06:25.610> got<00:06:25.729> a<00:06:25.760> couple<00:06:25.970> of<00:06:26.090> other<00:06:26.240> things<00:06:26.479> like

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:26.599 
you've got a couple of other things like

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:30.159 
you've got a couple of other things like
in<00:06:26.750> addition<00:06:27.169> to<00:06:27.490> what<00:06:28.490> you've<00:06:28.639> got<00:06:28.910> in<00:06:29.210> the

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.169 
in addition to what you've got in the

in addition to what you've got in the
regular<00:06:31.240> these<00:06:32.240> are<00:06:32.360> the<00:06:32.450> regular<00:06:32.780> functions

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:33.169 
regular these are the regular functions

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:34.600 
regular these are the regular functions
you<00:06:33.349> can<00:06:33.470> have<00:06:33.620> this<00:06:33.770> on<00:06:33.950> pretty<00:06:34.160> much<00:06:34.280> any

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
you can have this on pretty much any

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.089 
you can have this on pretty much any
setting<00:06:35.360> the<00:06:35.870> skip<00:06:36.140> search<00:06:36.380> function<00:06:36.800> is<00:06:36.890> kind

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:37.099 
setting the skip search function is kind

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:39.339 
setting the skip search function is kind
of<00:06:37.190> cool<00:06:37.340> to<00:06:37.490> use<00:06:37.610> you<00:06:37.700> can<00:06:37.820> designate<00:06:38.360> how

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:39.349 
of cool to use you can designate how

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:40.810 
of cool to use you can designate how
quickly<00:06:39.740> it's<00:06:40.039> going<00:06:40.219> to<00:06:40.370> skip<00:06:40.580> through<00:06:40.760> a

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
quickly it's going to skip through a

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:41.470 
quickly it's going to skip through a
song<00:06:41.060> you

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:41.480 
song you

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.320 
song you
say<00:06:41.630> 5%<00:06:41.930> or<00:06:42.410> 10%<00:06:42.440> of<00:06:42.920> the<00:06:42.980> song<00:06:43.220> or<00:06:43.550> whatever

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.330 
say 5% or 10% of the song or whatever

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.880 
say 5% or 10% of the song or whatever
you<00:06:44.480> want<00:06:44.660> to<00:06:44.780> use<00:06:44.990> and<00:06:45.320> I'll<00:06:45.530> show<00:06:45.650> you<00:06:45.710> how

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:45.890 
you want to use and I'll show you how

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.020 
you want to use and I'll show you how
that<00:06:45.920> happens<00:06:46.340> when<00:06:46.460> I<00:06:46.520> get<00:06:46.640> back<00:06:46.790> to<00:06:46.940> the

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.030 
that happens when I get back to the

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.580 
that happens when I get back to the
other<00:06:47.150> thing<00:06:47.390> I<00:06:47.540> think<00:06:47.840> that's<00:06:48.080> really<00:06:48.470> the

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
other thing I think that's really the

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.620 
other thing I think that's really the
only<00:06:48.620> thing<00:06:49.070> in<00:06:49.190> here<00:06:49.430> that<00:06:49.490> you'd<00:06:50.450> be

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:50.630 
only thing in here that you'd be

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.870 
only thing in here that you'd be
concerned<00:06:51.080> with<00:06:51.350> so<00:06:51.890> if<00:06:52.100> you<00:06:52.160> go<00:06:52.280> back<00:06:52.520> let's

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 
concerned with so if you go back let's

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.380 
concerned with so if you go back let's
say<00:06:53.380> to<00:06:54.380> what<00:06:54.500> we're<00:06:54.650> doing<00:06:54.680> here<00:06:54.890> and<00:06:55.390> you

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:56.390 
say to what we're doing here and you

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.060 
say to what we're doing here and you
want<00:06:56.660> to<00:06:56.840> then<00:06:56.990> skip<00:06:57.410> through<00:06:57.620> the<00:06:57.740> song<00:06:57.920> you

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.070 
want to then skip through the song you

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.470 
want to then skip through the song you
just<00:06:58.220> click<00:06:58.400> and<00:06:58.520> hold<00:06:58.580> and<00:06:58.970> it's<00:06:59.150> gonna<00:06:59.240> go

00:06:59.470 --> 00:06:59.480 
just click and hold and it's gonna go

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.870 
just click and hold and it's gonna go
faster<00:07:00.110> through<00:07:00.620> the<00:07:00.770> song<00:07:00.980> at<00:07:01.250> increments

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:01.880 
faster through the song at increments

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.340 
faster through the song at increments
based<00:07:02.150> around<00:07:02.420> that<00:07:02.630> percentage<00:07:03.170> that<00:07:03.290> you

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:03.350 
based around that percentage that you

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:08.470
