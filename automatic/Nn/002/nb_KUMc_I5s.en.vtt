in this fight

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.429 
in this fight
I<00:01:57.540> think<00:01:58.200> estada<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.189> better<00:02:00.030> skill<00:02:00.479> wise<00:02:00.750> in

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.410 
I think estada is better skill wise in
terms<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.890> boxing

terms of boxing

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.910 
terms of boxing
I<00:02:03.450> think<00:02:03.990> he's<00:02:04.380> faster<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.219> stronger<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:06.920> the

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
I think he's faster and stronger so the

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.210 
I think he's faster and stronger so the
only<00:02:08.069> thing<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.340> could<00:02:08.399> give<00:02:08.789> Segura<00:02:09.270> an

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
only thing I could give Segura an

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.410 
only thing I could give Segura an
advantage<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:11.489> one<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.819> his<00:02:12.030> level<00:02:12.390> of

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
advantage in this one is his level of

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.730 
advantage in this one is his level of
experience<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.260> the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
experience and the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.040 
experience and the
fighter<00:02:13.980> ships<00:02:14.280> fought<00:02:14.580> in<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.850> past<00:02:15.090> that's

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
fighter ships fought in the past that's

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.210 
fighter ships fought in the past that's
the<00:02:16.140> only<00:02:16.320> thing<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:16.500> can<00:02:16.680> give<00:02:16.710> them<00:02:17.130> an

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
the only thing I can give them an

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.400 
the only thing I can give them an
advantage<00:02:17.370> in<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:17.910> one<00:02:18.120> but<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.600> think<00:02:19.080> it's

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
advantage in this one but I think it's

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.600 
advantage in this one but I think it's
time<00:02:19.650> for<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.730> younger<00:02:21.060> guy<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:22.610> step-step

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
time for the younger guy to step-step

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.510 
time for the younger guy to step-step
forward<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:24.060> move<00:02:24.210> on<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:24.630> think<00:02:24.890> strata<00:02:25.890> will

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
forward and move on I think strata will

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.360 
forward and move on I think strata will
will<00:02:27.210> put<00:02:27.450> will<00:02:27.720> win<00:02:27.960> this<00:02:28.110> fight<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:29.070> think

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
will put will win this fight I I think

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.890 
will put will win this fight I I think
we'll<00:02:29.460> be<00:02:29.580> competitive<00:02:30.120> though<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.570> think

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
we'll be competitive though I think

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.330 
we'll be competitive though I think
we'll<00:02:30.990> be<00:02:31.080> competitive<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.770> close<00:02:31.950> but<00:02:32.310> I

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
we'll be competitive and close but I

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.660 
we'll be competitive and close but I
think<00:02:32.490> I<00:02:32.850> start<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.390> got<00:02:33.540> this<00:02:34.370> but<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.430> won't<00:02:35.550> be

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
think I start I got this but I won't be

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.730 
think I start I got this but I won't be
