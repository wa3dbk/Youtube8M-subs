have<00:01:51.220> to<00:01:51.250> put<00:01:51.460> in<00:01:51.549> some<00:01:51.670> decent<00:01:52.299> decent<00:01:52.600> lap

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
have to put in some decent decent lap

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.050 
have to put in some decent decent lap
times<00:01:53.409> but<00:01:54.010> despite<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.460> fact<00:01:54.490> it<00:01:54.700> only<00:01:54.790> being

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
times but despite the fact it only being

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.120 
times but despite the fact it only being
a<00:01:55.180> three-lap<00:01:55.510> race<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:56.200> try<00:01:56.380> and<00:01:56.680> catch<00:01:56.860> up

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
a three-lap race to try and catch up

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.060 
a three-lap race to try and catch up
into<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.909> podium<00:01:58.150> at<00:01:58.510> positions<00:01:59.049> spots<00:01:59.530> so<00:01:59.950> we

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
into the podium at positions spots so we

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.289 
into the podium at positions spots so we
now<00:02:00.189> come<00:02:00.430> around<00:02:00.549> the<00:02:00.700> penultimate<00:02:00.909> corner

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
track but we have still gained time on

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.350 
track but we have still gained time on
the<00:02:05.619> guy<00:02:05.799> in<00:02:05.950> front<00:02:06.280> because<00:02:06.490> that's<00:02:07.030> what<00:02:07.240> we

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
the guy in front because that's what we
