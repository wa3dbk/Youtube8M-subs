00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
ago one minor difference is that snake

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.010 
ago one minor difference is that snake
is<00:02:00.310> now<00:02:00.609> wearing<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:00.969> earbud<00:02:01.450> on<00:02:01.630> his<00:02:01.749> right

snake<00:02:04.210> eater<00:02:04.420> I<00:02:04.780> get<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.319> feeling<00:02:05.649> that<00:02:05.679> this

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:05.859 
snake eater I get the feeling that this

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.679 
snake eater I get the feeling that this

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
can think of is that snake is purposely

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.050 
can think of is that snake is purposely
going<00:02:34.380> back<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.860> old<00:02:34.890> codex<00:02:35.459> system<00:02:35.819> for<00:02:36.030> a

going back to the old codex system for a

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.040 
particular mission because the 20 year
old<00:02:38.160> technology<00:02:38.790> might<00:02:39.390> be<00:02:39.630> harder<00:02:40.020> to

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
old technology might be harder to

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.990 
old technology might be harder to

with<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.480> newer<00:02:42.690> technology<00:02:43.290> but<00:02:43.470> i<00:02:43.620> don't

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
with the newer technology but i don't

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.530 
with the newer technology but i don't
know<00:02:43.860> how<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.069> stuff<00:02:44.370> works<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:45.120> i<00:02:45.150> could<00:02:45.390> be

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
know how the stuff works so i could be

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.809 
know how the stuff works so i could be
way<00:02:45.810> off<00:02:46.010> regardless<00:02:47.010> i<00:02:47.160> am<00:02:47.340> leaning<00:02:47.640> more

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
way off regardless i am leaning more

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.699 
way off regardless i am leaning more

would<00:02:52.560> like<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.830> point<00:02:53.010> out<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.610> uniform

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
would like to point out is the uniform

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.520 
would like to point out is the uniform
that<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.420> soldier<00:02:54.750> in<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.959> background<00:02:55.380> is

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
that the soldier in the background is

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.380 
that the soldier in the background is
wearing<00:02:55.890> notice<00:02:56.610> how<00:02:56.700> he<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:56.970> wearing<00:02:57.209> a

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
wearing notice how he is wearing a

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.820 
wearing notice how he is wearing a
different<00:02:57.570> outfit<00:02:58.110> from<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.410> ones<00:02:58.590> we<00:02:58.739> have

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
different outfit from the ones we have

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.920 
different outfit from the ones we have
seen<00:02:59.010> in<00:02:59.160> previous<00:02:59.190> footage<00:02:59.910> perhaps<00:03:00.600> this<00:03:00.780> is

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
seen in previous footage perhaps this is

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.240 
seen in previous footage perhaps this is
hinting<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.290> players<00:03:01.650> will<00:03:01.769> be<00:03:01.950> able<00:03:01.980> to

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
hinting that players will be able to

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.130 
hinting that players will be able to
customize<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.970> uniforms<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:03.630> diamond<00:03:03.989> dog

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
customize the uniforms that diamond dog

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.800 
customize the uniforms that diamond dog
soldiers<00:03:04.590> wear<00:03:04.890> how<00:03:05.550> badass<00:03:05.910> would<00:03:06.120> that<00:03:06.540> be

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
soldiers wear how badass would that be

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.960 
soldiers wear how badass would that be
now<00:03:07.500> something<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.069> noticed<00:03:08.459> is<00:03:08.580> that<00:03:08.700> the

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
now something that I noticed is that the

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.759 
now something that I noticed is that the
soldier<00:03:09.330> is<00:03:09.360> wearing<00:03:09.780> an<00:03:09.870> outfit<00:03:10.200> that<00:03:10.380> vastly

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
soldier is wearing an outfit that vastly

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.620 
soldier is wearing an outfit that vastly
resembles<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.400> ones<00:03:11.610> worn<00:03:11.850> by<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.090> Ocelot

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
resembles the ones worn by the Ocelot

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.509 
resembles the ones worn by the Ocelot
unit<00:03:12.930> from<00:03:13.110> snake<00:03:13.410> eater<00:03:13.739> so<00:03:14.280> another

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
unit from snake eater so another

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.130 
unit from snake eater so another
possibility<00:03:15.060> is<00:03:15.300> that<00:03:15.420> this<00:03:15.660> is<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.840> higher

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
possibility is that this is a higher

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.410 
possibility is that this is a higher
rank<00:03:16.500> soldier<00:03:16.920> specially<00:03:17.459> trained<00:03:17.760> by<00:03:17.910> Ocelot

rank soldier specially trained by Ocelot

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.960 
rank soldier specially trained by Ocelot
or<00:03:18.450> perhaps<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:19.170> soldier<00:03:19.830> loyal<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.370> Assad<00:03:20.819> that

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
or perhaps a soldier loyal to Assad that

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.550 
or perhaps a soldier loyal to Assad that
he<00:03:21.060> brought<00:03:21.300> along<00:03:21.330> when<00:03:21.840> he<00:03:21.900> joined<00:03:22.170> Diamond
