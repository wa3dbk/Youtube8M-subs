the ten yards get to that line you're
breaking<00:00:41.670> through<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.000> middle<00:00:42.329> got<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.690> couple

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
breaking through the middle got a couple

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.920 
breaking through the middle got a couple
things<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.500> point<00:00:43.530> out<00:00:43.980> as<00:00:44.219> we<00:00:44.910> break<00:00:45.239> we<00:00:45.539> want

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
things to point out as we break we want

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.869 
things to point out as we break we want
to<00:00:46.020> stay<00:00:46.200> as<00:00:46.320> close<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.980> cones<00:00:47.250> as<00:00:47.489> we<00:00:47.640> can

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
to stay as close to the cones as we can

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.729 
to stay as close to the cones as we can
so<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.149> want<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.539> run<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> straight<00:00:49.170> line<00:00:49.440> right

on<00:01:47.240> your<00:01:47.720> approach<00:01:48.080> when<00:01:48.530> you<00:01:48.619> start<00:01:48.890> in<00:01:48.979> the

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
on your approach when you start in the

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.100 
on your approach when you start in the
middle<00:01:49.159> go<00:01:49.580> ahead<00:01:49.790> and<00:01:49.939> open<00:01:50.360> up<00:01:50.509> one<00:01:50.869> of<00:01:50.899> the

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
middle go ahead and open up one of the

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.289 
middle go ahead and open up one of the
legs<00:01:51.259> slightly<00:01:52.040> so<00:01:52.610> that<00:01:52.640> you<00:01:52.909> can<00:01:53.090> turn

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
legs slightly so that you can turn

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.690 
legs slightly so that you can turn
towards<00:01:53.840> that<00:01:54.020> foot<00:01:54.380> all<00:01:54.590> right<00:01:54.619> if<00:01:54.920> you<00:01:55.549> have

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
both feet closed you're not going to

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.810 
both feet closed you're not going to
open<00:01:57.409> your<00:01:57.560> hips<00:01:57.770> and<00:01:57.890> really<00:01:58.100> go<00:01:58.280> as<00:01:58.460> easy<00:01:58.640> as

resistance sets followed by unresisted

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.449 
resistance sets followed by unresisted
to<00:02:45.320> really<00:02:45.500> build<00:02:45.680> some<00:02:45.829> strength<00:02:46.250> and

to really build some strength and

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.729 
to really build some strength and
endurance<00:02:47.030> through<00:02:47.359> your<00:02:47.480> legs<00:02:47.690> hip<00:02:48.260> flexors

used to them first and then you really
start<00:03:07.010> working<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.489> be<00:03:07.579> explosive<00:03:08.180> right

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
start working to be explosive right

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.449 
start working to be explosive right
we're<00:03:08.720> going<00:03:08.900> all<00:03:09.019> right<00:03:09.109> let's<00:03:10.100> get<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.310> good
