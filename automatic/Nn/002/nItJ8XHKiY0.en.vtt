00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
that would keep me from being in Christ

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.250 
that would keep me from being in Christ
for<00:01:54.920> salvation<00:01:54.950> is<00:01:55.700> not<00:01:56.630> if<00:01:56.810> I<00:01:56.900> want<00:01:57.110> to<00:01:57.170> be

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
thought was was so good about the

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.179 
thought was was so good about the
Baptist<00:03:44.299> Church<00:03:44.599> who<00:03:45.439> teaches<00:03:45.709> that<00:03:46.040> you

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:46.189 
Baptist Church who teaches that you

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:47.530 
Baptist Church who teaches that you
don't<00:03:46.430> have<00:03:46.610> to<00:03:46.760> be<00:03:46.849> baptized<00:03:47.269> to<00:03:47.420> be<00:03:47.450> saved

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
don't have to be baptized to be saved

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.839 
don't have to be baptized to be saved
you're<00:03:48.230> saved<00:03:48.530> before<00:03:48.739> you're<00:03:49.190> baptized<00:03:49.579> and

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
you're saved before you're baptized and

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.259 
you're saved before you're baptized and
so<00:03:49.970> baptism<00:03:50.480> is<00:03:50.599> not<00:03:50.750> really<00:03:51.019> necessary<00:03:52.269> one
