you<00:01:11.259> might<00:01:11.439> have<00:01:11.590> discounted<00:01:12.159> it<00:01:12.249> before

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
you might have discounted it before

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.609 
you might have discounted it before
where<00:01:13.329> maybe<00:01:13.509> you<00:01:13.659> never<00:01:13.780> paid<00:01:14.109> attention<00:01:14.469> to

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
where maybe you never paid attention to

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.719 
where maybe you never paid attention to
it<00:01:15.179> but<00:01:16.179> this<00:01:16.359> thing<00:01:16.600> is<00:01:16.780> fun<00:01:17.729> everything

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.179 
it but this thing is fun everything
about<00:01:18.939> this<00:01:19.179> car<00:01:19.450> is<00:01:19.689> unlike<00:01:20.229> other<00:01:20.619> cars<00:01:20.979> on

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
about this car is unlike other cars on

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.730 
about this car is unlike other cars on
the<00:01:21.280> road<00:01:21.460> and<00:01:22.390> of<00:01:22.509> course<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:23.229> biggest<00:01:23.439> thing

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
the road and of course the biggest thing

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.649 
the road and of course the biggest thing
that<00:01:23.890> makes<00:01:24.100> this<00:01:24.219> car<00:01:24.459> unique<00:01:24.819> is<00:01:25.119> the<00:01:25.329> rotary

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
that makes this car unique is the rotary

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.940 
that makes this car unique is the rotary
engine

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.370 

the<00:01:31.950> rx-8<00:01:32.490> came<00:01:32.790> out<00:01:33.000> they<00:01:33.600> discontinued<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
the rx-8 came out they discontinued the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.650 
the rx-8 came out they discontinued the
rx-7<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.250> was<00:01:35.430> supposed<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.760> be<00:01:35.940> the

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
rx-7 and this was supposed to be the

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.469 
rx-7 and this was supposed to be the
better<00:01:36.900> successor<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.620> that<00:01:37.650> car

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
better successor to that car

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.389 
better successor to that car
so<00:01:40.020> obviously<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.649> the<00:01:40.740> old<00:01:40.920> guy<00:01:41.189> of

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
so obviously this is the old guy of

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.190 
so obviously this is the old guy of
these<00:01:41.579> three<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.479> little<00:01:42.719> less<00:01:42.840> advanced

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
these three it's a little less advanced

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.499 
these three it's a little less advanced
especially<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.920> interior<00:01:44.280> but<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.270> what

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
especially in the interior but so what

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.300 
especially in the interior but so what
did<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.020> really<00:01:46.200> come<00:01:46.469> to<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:46.770> car<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.100> look

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
did you really come to this car to look

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.330 
did you really come to this car to look
at<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.490> map<00:01:47.759> screen<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.270> don't<00:01:48.360> think<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:48.929> I<00:01:49.340> was

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
at a map screen I don't think so I was

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.919 
at a map screen I don't think so I was
so<00:01:50.460> different<00:01:50.670> about<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.060> rx-8<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.539> that<00:01:51.840> it

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
so different about the rx-8 is that it

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.050 
so different about the rx-8 is that it
had<00:01:52.079> four<00:01:52.350> doors<00:01:52.619> they<00:01:53.369> were<00:01:53.399> really<00:01:53.670> hidden

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
had four doors they were really hidden

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:02.350 
had four doors they were really hidden

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.839 
really feel what's going on with the
road<00:03:59.870> it<00:04:00.870> definitely<00:04:01.230> has<00:04:01.349> that<00:04:01.380> small<00:04:02.040> dial

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
road it definitely has that small dial

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.770 
road it definitely has that small dial
in<00:04:03.120> handling<00:04:03.690> but<00:04:04.050> you<00:04:04.170> expect<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.860> mx-5

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
in handling but you expect the mx-5

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.630 
in handling but you expect the mx-5
this<00:04:06.780> really<00:04:07.020> isn't<00:04:07.170> an<00:04:07.349> x5<00:04:07.709> or<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:07.980> hardtop<00:04:08.220> 2

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
this really isn't an x5 or the hardtop 2

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.570 
this really isn't an x5 or the hardtop 2
extra<00:04:08.940> seat

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.930 

I'm<00:04:14.090> frankly<00:04:14.630> shocked<00:04:14.930> this<00:04:15.200> is<00:04:15.350> just<00:04:15.560> fun

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.659 

handling<00:04:19.940> stunning

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.670 

I<00:04:24.699> know<00:04:25.150> this<00:04:25.330> is<00:04:25.479> the<00:04:25.509> oldest<00:04:25.990> car<00:04:26.259> here<00:04:26.560> it

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
I know this is the oldest car here it

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.610 
I know this is the oldest car here it
doesn't<00:04:27.129> feel<00:04:27.370> outdated

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.630 

this<00:04:31.190> car<00:04:31.490> really<00:04:32.210> does<00:04:32.360> play<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.290> underdog

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
this car really does play the underdog

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.430 
this car really does play the underdog
to<00:04:34.640> the<00:04:34.730> Infinity<00:04:35.180> in<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:35.390> Hyundai<00:04:35.690> it's<00:04:36.110> down

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
to the Infinity in the Hyundai it's down

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.650 
to the Infinity in the Hyundai it's down
on<00:04:36.470> power<00:04:36.920> by<00:04:37.220> quite<00:04:37.610> a<00:04:37.640> bit<00:04:37.760> but<00:04:38.360> it's<00:04:38.480> also

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
on power by quite a bit but it's also

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.430 
on power by quite a bit but it's also
the<00:04:38.930> lightest<00:04:39.350> of<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.500> three<00:04:41.230> rx-8<00:04:42.230> has<00:04:42.410> a

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
the lightest of the three rx-8 has a

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.380 
the lightest of the three rx-8 has a
rotary<00:04:42.860> engine<00:04:42.980> so<00:04:43.430> what<00:04:43.550> that<00:04:43.640> means<00:04:43.880> is<00:04:44.120> the

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
rotary engine so what that means is the

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.690 
rotary engine so what that means is the
mechanicals<00:04:45.050> of<00:04:45.140> the<00:04:45.230> rotary<00:04:45.590> are<00:04:46.190> moving<00:04:46.580> in

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
mechanicals of the rotary are moving in

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.480 
mechanicals of the rotary are moving in
one<00:04:46.940> direction<00:04:47.180> at<00:04:47.660> all<00:04:47.810> times<00:04:48.140> they're<00:04:48.440> not

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
reciprocating going back and forth so

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.220 
reciprocating going back and forth so
the<00:04:51.620> motor<00:04:51.830> revs<00:04:52.220> a<00:04:52.400> lot<00:04:52.550> easier<00:04:52.990> not<00:04:53.990> only

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
the motor revs a lot easier not only

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.870 
the motor revs a lot easier not only
does<00:04:54.410> it<00:04:54.440> want<00:04:54.800> you<00:04:54.920> to<00:04:55.100> but
