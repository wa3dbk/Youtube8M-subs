 in which I will explain some things 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.849

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.269
 things that you can find and other 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.880
 things that you may not know without mentioning 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.819
 some tips and some curiosities 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.929
 what's here in beta 7 then this 

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:23.279
 It is a complement of the most 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.319
 interesting that I found and from ccoo 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.210
 written to see as I said and how there 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:30.239
 many new ones because yesterday in the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.250
 late that is July 24 good and 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.930
 good gift rather he made public the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.970
 beta of design and for everyone 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.440
 both playstation and good xbox 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.000
 now it's free and then a lot of people 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.980
 I already downloaded it and today is when it goes 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.660
 to start playing and then they need 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.340
 know some things if you like to see 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.660
 clear videos and if that is the case here 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.210
 There is one in which I am going to tell you 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.210
 some things ok then let's start 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.850
 first of all for those who were already 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.260
 aware of destiny for many 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.409
 days that were already in the beta will know 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.210
 that there are 5 gold chests because that is the 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.129
 color seems to me in the earth hidden 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.049
 in the beta there are 5 chests that are 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.360
 scattered in the missions in which 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.979
 we are going to have to go by itself 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.659
 because it's the story, but it's the same 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.759
 we can find all of these 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.710
 chests in the cosmodrome that is this 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.299
 green dot that is there there the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.979
 we can find or directly when 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.659
 we start the story nothing else we will go 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.399
 linear as the 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.259
 missions we will find one another 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.240
 chest here as you can see I already 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.649
 I found all five upload a video but 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.149
 better to leave a link here below a 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.909
 youtuber that I like that has already uploaded 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.649
 so there's ok second thing that 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.409
 I want to teach you is in this part 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.990
 forgiveness in this incredible lake is part 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.850
 of the boot really from the bottle the 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.069
 selling really a god of mine and here it is 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.780
 facebook I do not know if it's my obviously up 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:46.190
 dance a little to look for me but 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.200
 good here as really just put 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.450
 and here we are going to find what would be 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.220
 one of the golden chests one of the 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.679
 chests that are first here 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.840
 just in these in this piece of furniture here is 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.490
 pointed out but it's not because I already 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.000
 I have the five as I mentioned before 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.440
 but 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.510
 what happens when against the 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.980
 five chests good first of all with 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.810
 every box you find you can 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.850
 go giving a gun both a heavy weapon 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.740
 as a special weapon as a weapon 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.220
 primary and as different types of your 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.890
 equipment helmets boots and so on and when 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.040
 join the five with fred now two you 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.140
 is going to give this vehicle which is the sic rls 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.060
 20 if you want not the Spanish that is the one 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.920
 we have this is a little faster and 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.120
 has greater impulses so therefore 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.160
 goes faster ok 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.410
 let's move on with the next curiosity that 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.660
 it's really things you should know 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.790
 here inside the tower that for those who 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.680
 do not know it is like the social point of 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.330
 all destiny to whom that tower where we 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.040
 we gather the guardians good one thing 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.330
 that it is important that they know how to know is that 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.760
 by pressing the right stick that is with 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.319
 the one that we move the camera we can 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.930
 select 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.120
 to the friend to the guardian that we have in 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.620
 against which we are targeting and 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.670
 put start we can see all the 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.319
 options that we just saw to 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.239
 then and we can get to see 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.530
 even how it is equipped then it is 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.599
 something very important we can even 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.010
 invite our and so fire kim to 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.849
 our team to do missions with 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.889
 they 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.719
 ok this is the map the map of all the 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:10.879
 tower this we find it in the 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:12.019
 robots and all of you are those that 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.419
 they are spread the same throughout 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.040
 the whole tower go to these vaults are 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.810
 a very important thing then in these 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.609
 vaults we can store all our 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.349
 things that we want both weapons so much 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.639
 equipment so much interest and the 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.500
 we can exchange with the others 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.569
 characters that we believe in the time in the 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.909
 beta that are two others me in my case 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.889
 I created a war documentary and a hunter 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.780
 so I have the three classes that I 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.459
 I can create by itself ok 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.169
 something else that they may not know but that 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.609
 it's very obvious really if you investigate a 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.109
 little cost you anything I found it from 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.209
 the first moment is that we can dance 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:44.019
 with the father to the right we can 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.159
 say hello with pat up and we can 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.770
 point with pad to the left and 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.900
 we can sit down with pad down 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.900
 ok here as you can see I'm next to 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.870
 what would be a green chest that are like 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.220
 the golden chests but they contain 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.410
 same things but as important as 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.660
 the gold ones the gold ones can generate more 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.220
 rare or so in this case I found a 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.990
 green chest which will give me a 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.850
 escape well that is a tunic is a 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.560
 moment that I can put my guardian 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.480
 that can give me more protection or not 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.250
 depending on what I have in this 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.569
 case does not work for me because then the 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.690
 that I have is very advanced 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.519
 and good to show where I'm from 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.320
 you do not know what it's called in Spanish 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.450
 but I'm in it 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.310
 near this part that is where they 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.690
 I taught a while ago he found me in a chest of 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.360
 gold then it is not very difficult to 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.970
 find go then let's see the 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.350
 next curiosity that there are enemies in 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.480
 the movie beta which are 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.120
 immortals are practically level 20 to 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.890
 one more level or higher level here 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.400
 I bought I'm showing where I'm 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.740
 I am 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.330
 close to that thing that was shown next 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.979
 I'm usually this me back to 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.840
 Cosmodrome appear very close to this 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.600
 location in order then going down by 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.699
 these stairs and saying goodbye for this 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.280
 like that tunnel of a shattered house 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:59.289
 something like this we can find what 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.360
 they would be enemies that have a sign 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:04.770
 of interrogation and they have the name 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.169
 at least in English of hold out 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.550
 ward released and right now I'm going to point you 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.069
 here they are on the left as they can 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.560
 see I just pointed the 1 says javier to 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:14.150
 covite 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.320
 and how will I invest without introduction 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.169
 I'm going to start waiting because they see 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.520
 that are immune go to all weapons 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.590
 I also fired with my special weapon that 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.450
 is the shotgun in this case that is not 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.030
 very powerful really but the same is if 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.830
 had my heavy gun shoot him already with 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.270
 and they would see that nothing came down anyway 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.669
 of life then we can not go down 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.870
 absolutely nothing of life to these 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.850
 video monsters that are level 8 and 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.590
 those levels very superior then 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.419
 here I tried to put in and out of pure luck 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.160
 I came to this room that is the one 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:41.900
 they really guard there's nothing like 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.480
 can you see then then it's something 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.800
 curious to go and look for the assets of 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.600
 they find them and see if they survive 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.310
 his attack is worth mentioning that a single 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.630
 touch they kill you but in the end there is nothing 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.700
 more in that room at least because I 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.889
 investigated from both sides and well that's 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.389
 everything there are several enemies that are immune 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:58.430
 to absolutely any weapon 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:59.950
 scattered throughout the beta of 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.060
 cinema on either side of the cosmodrome 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.100
 well also once we have finished 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.229
 the story or in fact while we're 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.700
 initiating the we can find us these 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:09.320
 green headlights that are to get 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.700
 missions which will give us the same 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.500
 experience points are going to help us 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.040
 go up and they're going to give us a reputation inside 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.710
 of the space 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.000
 are scattered in absolutely all the 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.520
 land 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.690
 very well one of the last things that 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.510
 I will teach you in the things that you 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.770
 you can find what would be the 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.780
 missions here as you can see is 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.430
 demonstrating the speed metal that is supposed 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.400
 which is to sell but I have found 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:34.500
 that is sold until 2012 so that 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.880
 also the leader seeds that you are 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.250
 you can consume them that passes from 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.380
 consume 10 10 approximate minutes in the 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.210
 in which if you kill enemies you will 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.800
 run over or they will give you more points of 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.500
 experience rather very good sorry 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.870
 more like he's the money here 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.770
 those these blue cubes that is the free 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.030
 okay 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.040
 one of the last things is that with 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.720
 our is for the consort care what 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.910
 we can do when pressing right trigger 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.850
 is to make that turn that says and so 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.860
 maneuver maneuver more hesitates at 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:04.260
 vehicle and finally I want to teach you 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:07.860
 the location of one of the 20 to the 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:09.750
 found the coast that are 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.490
 the fallen spectra which we can 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.560
 revive and they will give us letters that 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.150
 we can see in bonn and dot net which is 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.040
 what have fragments of the history of 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.690
 destiny and some things that we should 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.880
 know about the guardians and the 

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.950
 powers and also from the traveler here as 

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.600
 can see their horrible with the sniper 

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.490
 I did not get what I wanted but 

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.810
 the one of goes is very easy to find 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.160
 I really do not know the location but 

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.720
 Well, they've seen more or less where 

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.400
 they have to push themselves with their unemployed 

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.900
 although in their vehicle they also have 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.490
 making the double jump this is true 

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:38.250
 from me they came up here about 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.840

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.400
 time tomorrow I do not know but it's very 

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.170
