can pull it out you can see everything
that's<00:02:52.560> inside<00:02:52.860> um<00:02:54.260> without<00:02:55.260> just<00:02:55.530> say

that's inside um without just say
removing<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.490> roof<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.970> having<00:02:57.240> it<00:02:57.300> up<00:02:57.450> I'll

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
removing the roof and having it up I'll

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.560 
removing the roof and having it up I'll
be<00:02:57.780> dark<00:02:58.640> so<00:02:59.640> more<00:02:59.820> or<00:02:59.910> less<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.240> lighting

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
be dark so more or less the lighting

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.350 
be dark so more or less the lighting
will<00:03:00.690> be<00:03:00.780> kind<00:03:01.020> of<00:03:01.080> like<00:03:01.200> how<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:01.470> is<00:03:01.560> now<00:03:01.830> a

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
will be kind of like how it is now a

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.640 
will be kind of like how it is now a
little<00:03:03.360> bit<00:03:03.510> darker<00:03:03.870> in<00:03:03.960> the<00:03:04.050> back<00:03:04.230> because

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
little bit darker in the back because

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.710 
little bit darker in the back because
there<00:03:04.770> will<00:03:04.860> be<00:03:04.950> more<00:03:05.130> walls<00:03:05.480> but<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.510> want<00:03:06.690> to

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
there will be more walls but I want to

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.900 
there will be more walls but I want to
make<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.960> roof<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.950> part<00:03:08.640> of<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.760> walls

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
make the roof and the part of the walls

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.000 
make the roof and the part of the walls
removable<00:03:09.600> so<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:10.440> think<00:03:10.620> it'll<00:03:10.740> turn<00:03:10.860> out

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
removable so I think it'll turn out

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.300 
removable so I think it'll turn out
nicely<00:03:11.250> um<00:03:12.200> pretty<00:03:13.200> much<00:03:13.380> no<00:03:13.800> work<00:03:14.040> on<00:03:14.190> the

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
nicely um pretty much no work on the

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.670 
nicely um pretty much no work on the
downstairs<00:03:15.590> when<00:03:16.590> I'm<00:03:16.680> thinking<00:03:17.010> about<00:03:17.340> it<00:03:17.790> I

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
downstairs when I'm thinking about it I

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.970 
downstairs when I'm thinking about it I
put<00:03:19.680> in<00:03:20.239> flowers<00:03:21.239> those<00:03:22.050> are<00:03:22.260> kind<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.530> plants

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
put in flowers those are kind of plants

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.670 
put in flowers those are kind of plants
as<00:03:23.100> just<00:03:23.310> filler<00:03:24.200> ninety<00:03:25.200> percent<00:03:25.320> chance

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
as just filler ninety percent chance

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.620 
as just filler ninety percent chance
I'll<00:03:25.920> improve<00:03:26.280> them<00:03:26.489> at<00:03:26.700> some<00:03:27.239> point<00:03:27.270> or

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
I'll improve them at some point or

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.710 
I'll improve them at some point or
another<00:03:28.100> um<00:03:29.239> because<00:03:30.239> they<00:03:30.360> look<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.600> little

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
another um because they look a little

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.410 
another um because they look a little
bit<00:03:30.930> lame<00:03:31.140> um<00:03:32.360> and<00:03:33.360> then<00:03:34.459> temporary<00:03:35.459> well<00:03:36.150> I

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
bit lame um and then temporary well I

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.660 
bit lame um and then temporary well I
say<00:03:36.989> temporary<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.650> added<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.280> other<00:03:38.430> blue

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
say temporary I added the other blue

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.300 
say temporary I added the other blue
staircase<00:03:39.209> which<00:03:39.450> isn't<00:03:39.690> exactly<00:03:39.780> how<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:40.800> want

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
staircase which isn't exactly how I want

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.960 
staircase which isn't exactly how I want
it<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.430> be<00:03:41.959> but<00:03:42.959> I<00:03:43.890> think<00:03:44.220> i'm<00:03:44.489> gonna<00:03:44.610> leave<00:03:44.700> it

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
it to be but I think i'm gonna leave it

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.940 
it to be but I think i'm gonna leave it
how<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.090> is<00:03:45.260> even<00:03:46.260> though<00:03:46.350> it<00:03:46.500> juts<00:03:46.769> out<00:03:46.890> a

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
how it is even though it juts out a

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.170 
how it is even though it juts out a
little<00:03:47.160> farther<00:03:47.400> than<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:47.730> technically

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
little farther than the technically

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.990 
little farther than the technically
should<00:03:48.450> who<00:03:48.900> cares<00:03:49.459> it's<00:03:50.459> not<00:03:50.610> a<00:03:50.640> big<00:03:50.790> deal<00:03:50.820> to

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
should who cares it's not a big deal to

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.390 
should who cares it's not a big deal to
me<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.720> I<00:03:52.470> don't<00:03:52.620> feel<00:03:52.769> like<00:03:52.830> redoing<00:03:53.220> that

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
me and I don't feel like redoing that

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.620 
me and I don't feel like redoing that
wall<00:03:53.670> that's<00:03:53.940> actually<00:03:54.150> going<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.330> be<00:03:54.360> a<00:03:54.420> big

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
wall that's actually going to be a big

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.550 
wall that's actually going to be a big
pain<00:03:54.840> if<00:03:55.019> I<00:03:55.110> were<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.440> do<00:03:55.560> that<00:03:56.300> plus<00:03:57.300> I<00:03:57.600> don't

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
pain if I were to do that plus I don't

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.979 
pain if I were to do that plus I don't
believe<00:03:58.800> this<00:03:58.980> shows<00:03:59.220> up<00:03:59.400> in<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.610> video<00:03:59.850> but<00:04:00.720> I

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
believe this shows up in the video but I

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.970 
believe this shows up in the video but I
layer<00:04:01.560> 10<00:04:02.040> tiles<00:04:02.730> on<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.239> on<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.290> second

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
layer 10 tiles on the on the second

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.800 
layer 10 tiles on the on the second
floor<00:04:05.130> over<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.820> white<00:04:07.640> so<00:04:08.640> you<00:04:09.269> know<00:04:09.390> doing

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
floor over the white so you know doing

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.710 
floor over the white so you know doing
that<00:04:10.110> was<00:04:10.290> actually<00:04:10.440> a<00:04:11.010> lot<00:04:11.489> of<00:04:11.580> work<00:04:11.820> it<00:04:12.120> was

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
that was actually a lot of work it was

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.110 
that was actually a lot of work it was
kind<00:04:13.709> of<00:04:13.800> annoying<00:04:14.040> to<00:04:14.280> get<00:04:14.430> it<00:04:14.519> all<00:04:14.640> to<00:04:14.790> stick

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
kind of annoying to get it all to stick

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.539 
kind of annoying to get it all to stick
without<00:04:15.350> pushing<00:04:16.350> other<00:04:16.650> pieces<00:04:16.919> in<00:04:17.190> too<00:04:17.370> much

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
without pushing other pieces in too much

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.050 
without pushing other pieces in too much
and<00:04:17.940> whatnot<00:04:18.690> oh<00:04:19.070> yeah<00:04:20.070> one<00:04:20.250> more<00:04:20.280> thing<00:04:20.459> last

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
and whatnot oh yeah one more thing last

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.140 
and whatnot oh yeah one more thing last
thing<00:04:21.209> I<00:04:21.299> did<00:04:21.510> on<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.720> bottom<00:04:22.140> floor<00:04:22.169> I<00:04:23.150> I

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
thing I did on the bottom floor I I

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.810 
thing I did on the bottom floor I I
finished<00:04:24.660> up<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:24.870> little<00:04:25.440> healing<00:04:26.070> machine

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
finished up the little healing machine

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.180 
finished up the little healing machine
because<00:04:27.810> I<00:04:27.840> got<00:04:28.020> some<00:04:28.170> blue<00:04:28.350> jumper<00:04:28.740> plates<00:04:28.980> I

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
because I got some blue jumper plates I

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.250 
because I got some blue jumper plates I
got<00:04:29.490> a<00:04:29.520> couple<00:04:29.730> spares<00:04:30.120> for<00:04:30.630> whatever<00:04:30.990> I<00:04:31.080> might

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
got a couple spares for whatever I might

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.620 
got a couple spares for whatever I might
want<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.470> use<00:04:31.560> them<00:04:31.740> for<00:04:32.010> and<00:04:32.370> so<00:04:33.270> now<00:04:33.300> it<00:04:33.540> looks

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
want to use them for and so now it looks

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.560 
want to use them for and so now it looks
a<00:04:33.750> lot<00:04:33.870> nicer<00:04:33.930> and<00:04:35.240> pokeballs<00:04:36.240> fit<00:04:36.510> on<00:04:36.630> it<00:04:36.660> um

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
a lot nicer and pokeballs fit on it um

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.600 
a lot nicer and pokeballs fit on it um
as<00:04:39.570> you<00:04:40.170> might<00:04:40.350> see<00:04:40.530> in<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.650> video<00:04:40.950> I'm<00:04:41.250> not

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
as you might see in the video I'm not

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.830 
as you might see in the video I'm not
entirely<00:04:41.910> sure<00:04:42.120> what<00:04:42.420> to<00:04:42.510> do<00:04:42.630> with<00:04:42.750> the

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
entirely sure what to do with the

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.050 
entirely sure what to do with the
doorway<00:04:43.110> i<00:04:43.200> think<00:04:43.590> i'm<00:04:43.710> gonna<00:04:43.830> use<00:04:44.010> a<00:04:44.400> wedge

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
doorway i think i'm gonna use a wedge

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.910 
doorway i think i'm gonna use a wedge
pieces<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:46.500> 3<00:04:47.280> by<00:04:47.430> 2<00:04:47.490> or<00:04:47.940> 2<00:04:48.900> by<00:04:49.050> 3<00:04:49.080> I<00:04:49.530> guess<00:04:49.770> is

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
pieces the 3 by 2 or 2 by 3 I guess is

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.370 
pieces the 3 by 2 or 2 by 3 I guess is
how<00:04:50.040> it<00:04:50.190> be<00:04:50.340> measured<00:04:50.640> I<00:04:50.760> think<00:04:51.000> I<00:04:51.210> think<00:04:52.170> width

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
how it be measured I think I think width

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.620 
how it be measured I think I think width
comes<00:04:52.860> first<00:04:53.580> not<00:04:54.330> the<00:04:54.480> point<00:04:54.660> um<00:04:55.850> so<00:04:56.850> that's

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
comes first not the point um so that's

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.940 
comes first not the point um so that's
that's<00:04:57.960> probably<00:04:58.260> how<00:04:58.410> I<00:04:58.440> go<00:04:58.650> about<00:04:58.680> doing

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
that's probably how I go about doing

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.470 
that's probably how I go about doing
those<00:04:59.160> am<00:04:59.340> I<00:04:59.400> still<00:04:59.610> changed<00:04:59.940> up<00:05:00.090> but<00:05:00.270> for<00:05:00.420> now

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
those am I still changed up but for now

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.450 
those am I still changed up but for now
I<00:05:00.540> kind<00:05:00.810> of<00:05:00.840> just<00:05:00.990> left<00:05:01.170> that<00:05:01.320> area<00:05:01.520> alone<00:05:02.520> um

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
I kind of just left that area alone um

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.760 
I kind of just left that area alone um
what<00:05:05.460> else<00:05:05.610> then<00:05:05.850> on<00:05:05.970> the<00:05:06.090> top<00:05:06.270> area<00:05:06.770> after

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
what else then on the top area after

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.640 
what else then on the top area after
layering<00:05:07.980> the<00:05:08.280> white<00:05:08.520> on<00:05:08.790> and<00:05:09.300> the<00:05:09.600> tan<00:05:10.290> over

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
layering the white on and the tan over

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.940 
layering the white on and the tan over
it<00:05:10.770> I<00:05:10.980> put<00:05:11.670> in<00:05:11.790> new<00:05:11.970> desks<00:05:12.570> and<00:05:12.810> another<00:05:13.410> flower

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
it I put in new desks and another flower

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.690 
it I put in new desks and another flower
is<00:05:14.220> filler<00:05:14.520> and<00:05:15.920> I<00:05:16.920> think<00:05:17.340> that<00:05:17.520> might

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
is filler and I think that might

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.030 
is filler and I think that might
actually<00:05:17.970> be<00:05:18.300> it<00:05:18.540> for<00:05:19.350> what<00:05:19.500> I've<00:05:19.620> done<00:05:19.650> this

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
actually be it for what I've done this

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.820 
actually be it for what I've done this
video<00:05:20.370> a<00:05:20.640> lot<00:05:21.210> of<00:05:21.360> pieces<00:05:21.570> added<00:05:22.110> but<00:05:22.620> as<00:05:22.680> far

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
video a lot of pieces added but as far

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.580 
video a lot of pieces added but as far
as<00:05:22.890> things<00:05:23.310> actually<00:05:23.550> done<00:05:23.930> not<00:05:24.930> quite<00:05:25.440> as

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
as things actually done not quite as

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.030 
as things actually done not quite as
many<00:05:25.800> as<00:05:26.190> in<00:05:26.610> the<00:05:26.880> previous<00:05:27.570> update<00:05:28.290> but

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
many as in the previous update but

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.560 
many as in the previous update but
anyway<00:05:29.310> it<00:05:29.490> is<00:05:29.610> shaping<00:05:29.880> up<00:05:30.090> pretty<00:05:30.150> nicely

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
anyway it is shaping up pretty nicely

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.230 
anyway it is shaping up pretty nicely
and<00:05:31.110> I've<00:05:31.590> still<00:05:31.740> got<00:05:31.920> a<00:05:31.950> lot<00:05:32.100> of<00:05:32.240> bricks

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
and I've still got a lot of bricks

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.970 
and I've still got a lot of bricks
leftover<00:05:33.950> that<00:05:34.950> I<00:05:34.980> can<00:05:35.220> use<00:05:35.250> on<00:05:36.890> you<00:05:37.890> know

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
leftover that I can use on you know

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.210 
leftover that I can use on you know
whatever<00:05:38.160> I<00:05:38.310> want<00:05:39.080> I<00:05:40.080> what<00:05:41.010> am<00:05:41.100> I<00:05:41.130> talking

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220

about whatever I want on the second

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.530 
about whatever I want on the second
floor<00:05:43.080> is<00:05:43.500> what<00:05:44.100> i<00:05:44.130> meant<00:05:44.220> to<00:05:44.400> say<00:05:44.490> and<00:05:44.940> then<00:05:45.450> i

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540

from<00:06:13.860> seven<00:06:14.340> will<00:06:14.520> see<00:06:14.880> it<00:06:15.330> would<00:06:15.450> be<00:06:15.510> cool<00:06:15.750> if

but some of them are going to be tough
to<00:06:19.590> do<00:06:19.790> like<00:06:20.790> maybe<00:06:21.140> you<00:06:22.140> know<00:06:22.260> the<00:06:22.410> cloud<00:06:22.740> nine

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
that that'll probably be tough plus kind

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.030 
plates and then the plate in the center

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.590 
plates and then the plate in the center
to<00:06:46.750> be<00:06:46.900> read<00:06:47.170> I<00:06:47.850> think<00:06:48.850> there's<00:06:49.030> one<00:06:49.090> that's<00:06:49.419> in

to be read I think there's one that's in
solid<00:06:49.990> red<00:06:50.639> but<00:06:51.639> I<00:06:51.910> want<00:06:52.780> to<00:06:52.840> say<00:06:52.990> that<00:06:53.110> the

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:53.200 
solid red but I want to say that the

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.220 
solid red but I want to say that the
inside<00:06:53.650> of<00:06:53.680> the<00:06:53.919> plate<00:06:54.130> that's<00:06:54.850> a<00:06:55.240> mushroom

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.230 
inside of the plate that's a mushroom

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.940 
inside of the plate that's a mushroom
colored<00:06:57.120> or<00:06:58.120> mushroom<00:06:58.510> design<00:06:58.870> will<00:06:59.530> also<00:06:59.800> be

00:06:59.940 --> 00:06:59.950 
colored or mushroom design will also be

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.560 
colored or mushroom design will also be
solid<00:07:00.280> red<00:07:00.430> i'll<00:07:00.669> have<00:07:00.880> to<00:07:00.940> double<00:07:01.120> check<00:07:01.270> on

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:01.570 
solid red i'll have to double check on

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.900 
solid red i'll have to double check on
that<00:07:01.600> just<00:07:02.169> to<00:07:02.260> make<00:07:02.320> sure<00:07:02.440> if<00:07:03.070> so<00:07:03.520> then<00:07:03.820> i'll

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:03.910 
that just to make sure if so then i'll

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.129 
that just to make sure if so then i'll
probably<00:07:04.150> just<00:07:04.270> order<00:07:04.630> five<00:07:04.840> of<00:07:05.020> those

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:05.139 
probably just order five of those

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:06.990 
probably just order five of those
because<00:07:05.740> i<00:07:05.770> think<00:07:05.919> will<00:07:06.130> be<00:07:06.250> really<00:07:06.280> cool<00:07:06.700> if<00:07:06.760> i

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 
because i think will be really cool if i

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.300 
because i think will be really cool if i
made<00:07:07.570> one<00:07:07.750> of<00:07:07.840> my<00:07:07.900> mario<00:07:08.200> karts<00:07:08.470> with<00:07:08.620> mushroom

tires<00:07:10.740> but<00:07:11.740> anyway<00:07:11.950> i<00:07:12.010> guess<00:07:12.130> that's<00:07:12.310> about<00:07:12.400> it

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520
