00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.450 
shooting the double and you are
sprawling<00:00:14.870> with<00:00:15.139> an<00:00:15.230> over/under<00:00:15.620> book<00:00:15.830> but

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
sprawling with an over/under book but

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.790 
sprawling with an over/under book but
you<00:00:16.580> can<00:00:16.700> feel<00:00:16.910> that<00:00:16.970> you're<00:00:17.870> wrestling

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
you can feel that you're wrestling

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.770 
you can feel that you're wrestling
counter<00:00:19.100> is<00:00:19.190> not<00:00:19.310> holding<00:00:19.670> your<00:00:20.000> sprawl<00:00:20.630> is

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:20.780 
counter is not holding your sprawl is

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.089 
counter is not holding your sprawl is
now<00:00:20.900> deep<00:00:21.110> enough<00:00:21.380> and<00:00:21.560> use<00:00:21.679> a<00:00:21.830> little<00:00:22.010> bit

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099 
now deep enough and use a little bit

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:23.679 
now deep enough and use a little bit
late<00:00:22.340> maybe<00:00:22.640> that<00:00:22.970> underhook<00:00:23.300> isn't<00:00:23.599> deep

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
late maybe that underhook isn't deep

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.179 
late maybe that underhook isn't deep
enough<00:00:23.779> so<00:00:24.109> you're<00:00:24.619> going<00:00:24.710> to<00:00:24.769> have<00:00:24.830> to<00:00:25.009> think

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
enough so you're going to have to think

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:26.560 
enough so you're going to have to think
of<00:00:25.279> something<00:00:25.460> else<00:00:25.640> and<00:00:25.939> this<00:00:26.119> is<00:00:26.240> a<00:00:26.269> chance

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
of something else and this is a chance

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.099 
of something else and this is a chance
to<00:00:26.900> actually<00:00:27.349> go<00:00:27.650> over<00:00:27.949> to<00:00:28.310> go<00:00:28.429> with<00:00:28.640> the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
to actually go over to go with the

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.800 
to actually go over to go with the
energy<00:00:30.109> that<00:00:30.320> double<00:00:30.800> into<00:00:31.730> an<00:00:31.820> elevator<00:00:32.150> and

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810 
energy that double into an elevator and

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.020 
energy that double into an elevator and
then<00:00:32.990> his<00:00:33.740> energy<00:00:34.100> combined<00:00:34.370> with<00:00:34.520> yours<00:00:34.700> ends

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
then his energy combined with yours ends

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.900 
then his energy combined with yours ends
up<00:00:35.290> bringing<00:00:36.290> the<00:00:36.410> overt<00:00:36.650> amount<00:00:36.890> so<00:00:37.190> I'm<00:00:37.670> here

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
up bringing the overt amount so I'm here

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.970 
up bringing the overt amount so I'm here
he<00:00:38.120> gets<00:00:38.239> in<00:00:38.570> and<00:00:39.050> I<00:00:39.140> variegated<00:00:39.530> a<00:00:39.680> sprawl<00:00:39.950> of

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
he gets in and I variegated a sprawl of

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.740 
he gets in and I variegated a sprawl of
my<00:00:40.219> field<00:00:40.460> of<00:00:40.520> my<00:00:40.640> deep<00:00:40.879> and<00:00:41.090> he's<00:00:41.239> got<00:00:41.390> my<00:00:41.510> legs

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
my field of my deep and he's got my legs

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.689 
my field of my deep and he's got my legs
so<00:00:42.320> i<00:00:42.350> can't<00:00:42.649> i<00:00:42.829> can't<00:00:42.860> get<00:00:43.160> this<00:00:43.250> nice<00:00:43.460> deep

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
so i can't i can't get this nice deep

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:46.600 
so i can't i can't get this nice deep
when<00:00:43.820> he's<00:00:43.969> got<00:00:44.059> me<00:00:44.270> in<00:00:44.390> so<00:00:45.140> i'm<00:00:45.379> going<00:00:45.649> over<00:00:46.010> so

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.049 
what I'm gonna do is make sure this foot
ends<00:00:48.020> up<00:00:48.110> inside<00:00:48.440> his<00:00:48.649> leg<00:00:48.890> and<00:00:49.280> I'm<00:00:49.969> gonna

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
ends up inside his leg and I'm gonna

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.270 
ends up inside his leg and I'm gonna
roll<00:00:50.270> over<00:00:50.480> my<00:00:50.750> left<00:00:51.020> shoulder<00:00:51.230> kick<00:00:51.980> him<00:00:52.129> up

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
roll over my left shoulder kick him up

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.029 
roll over my left shoulder kick him up
and<00:00:52.579> then<00:00:53.180> follow<00:00:53.480> him<00:00:53.660> over<00:00:53.930> to<00:00:54.469> my<00:00:54.620> let<00:00:54.920> his

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
and then follow him over to my let his

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.470 
and then follow him over to my let his
head<00:00:55.190> out<00:00:55.340> I<00:00:55.370> could<00:00:55.670> give<00:00:55.850> a<00:00:55.879> stock<00:00:56.149> tune<00:00:56.359> that

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
head out I could give a stock tune that

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.240 
head out I could give a stock tune that
crank<00:00:56.750> there<00:00:56.930> but<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:57.649> point<00:00:57.829> here<00:00:57.920> is<00:00:58.039> really

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
crank there but the point here is really

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.330 
crank there but the point here is really
to<00:00:58.340> get<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:58.609> mountain<00:01:00.039> so<00:01:01.039> we'll<00:01:01.160> look<00:01:01.219> at

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
to get the mountain so we'll look at

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.270 
to get the mountain so we'll look at
that<00:01:01.399> again<00:01:01.609> in<00:01:01.820> slow<00:01:01.879> motion<00:01:02.149> this<00:01:02.899> time<00:01:03.280> from

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
that again in slow motion this time from

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.910 
that again in slow motion this time from
here<00:01:04.610> and<00:01:04.879> so<00:01:05.480> he<00:01:05.630> shoots<00:01:05.900> and<00:01:06.200> my<00:01:06.590> sprawl

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
here and so he shoots and my sprawl

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.560 
here and so he shoots and my sprawl
isn't<00:01:07.160> deep<00:01:07.340> enough<00:01:07.460> time<00:01:07.850> I've<00:01:08.150> got<00:01:08.390> the

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
isn't deep enough time I've got the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.660 
isn't deep enough time I've got the
underhook<00:01:08.960> in<00:01:09.170> but<00:01:09.920> it<00:01:10.400> would<00:01:10.520> have<00:01:10.580> been

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
underhook in but it would have been

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.630 
underhook in but it would have been
better<00:01:10.729> if<00:01:11.270> I<00:01:11.450> get<00:01:11.689> here<00:01:11.900> yeah<00:01:12.470> for<00:01:13.369> my<00:01:13.460> hips

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
better if I get here yeah for my hips

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.120 
better if I get here yeah for my hips
are<00:01:13.759> far<00:01:14.000> away<00:01:14.119> but<00:01:14.900> as<00:01:15.049> it<00:01:15.229> is<00:01:15.259> he<00:01:15.500> got<00:01:15.650> in<00:01:15.830> his

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
are far away but as it is he got in his

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.890 
are far away but as it is he got in his
posture<00:01:16.670> is<00:01:16.700> there<00:01:16.939> I<00:01:16.970> can<00:01:17.180> feel<00:01:17.210> when<00:01:17.810> his

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
posture is there I can feel when his

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.330 
posture is there I can feel when his
back<00:01:18.049> is<00:01:18.110> straight<00:01:18.590> that<00:01:18.799> he's<00:01:18.920> got<00:01:19.100> a<00:01:19.130> good

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
back is straight that he's got a good

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.700 
back is straight that he's got a good
double<00:01:19.720> he's<00:01:20.720> got<00:01:20.869> a<00:01:20.900> good<00:01:21.049> grip<00:01:21.200> on<00:01:21.320> my<00:01:21.470> legs

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
double he's got a good grip on my legs

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.830 
double he's got a good grip on my legs
so<00:01:22.430> now<00:01:22.640> I<00:01:22.670> have<00:01:22.850> to<00:01:23.119> think<00:01:23.329> of<00:01:23.420> something<00:01:23.630> else

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
so now I have to think of something else

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.679 
so now I have to think of something else
I<00:01:24.170> can't<00:01:24.680> sprawl<00:01:25.100> front<00:01:26.060> headlock<00:01:26.329> or<00:01:26.390> go

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
I can't sprawl front headlock or go

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.480 
I can't sprawl front headlock or go
behind<00:01:27.049> so<00:01:27.530> I'm<00:01:27.590> going<00:01:27.710> to<00:01:27.740> roll<00:01:27.920> back<00:01:28.100> into<00:01:28.340> my

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
behind so I'm going to roll back into my

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.149 
behind so I'm going to roll back into my
left<00:01:28.759> side<00:01:29.000> as<00:01:29.420> my<00:01:29.900> rightful<00:01:30.320> it<00:01:30.409> hooks<00:01:30.650> inside

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
left side as my rightful it hooks inside

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.819 
left side as my rightful it hooks inside
of<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.430> leg<00:01:31.640> and<00:01:31.970> my<00:01:32.720> other<00:01:32.900> arm<00:01:33.170> over<00:01:33.680> those

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829
