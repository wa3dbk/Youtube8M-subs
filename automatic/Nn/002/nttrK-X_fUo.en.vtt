00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello everyone with you channel bikes and today 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.710
 we will talk about 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:15.450
 about the rules of the road and the axis 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.940
 tourists have them like a bear how to walk 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.710
 bike as a general behavior 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.560
 cyclist in an urban setting 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:33.989
 how to stay alive make the future and 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:36.510
 fag there went one of the main mistakes 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.140
 or ignoring the road right 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.899
 movements 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.030
 it is a red light when all 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.960
 cars are and you think you need 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.750
 go further as now it is possible 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.989
 do with impunity but in there and 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.050
 big big mistake not all you can 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.340
 see not all you can notice 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.430
 now you think you will lose on 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.680
 red color does not bother anyone just 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.979
 jumps out drunk moped st beats up 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.000
 You and we are you scaring some someone 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.070
 pedestrian either 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.100
 a woman with a child and everything can 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.710
 turn around the opposite is not as you thought 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.340
 not as you want them to stop 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.580
 traffic light 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.619
 wait for the green extra minute 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.270
 for you the role they play but can save 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.159
 you life as all you can 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.049
 see not follow up to 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.380
 there is nothing to add here now an important point 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:35.159
 is it say something about showing 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.220
 turns hands classic show 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.710
 where do you turn left or right 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:44.460
 to wife the right mascara left for sale 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.990
 dressed on well don't forget his showing 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.649
 turnaround will come separated arruda 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.909
 every bicyclist can lift his hand 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.159
 from the wheel you need to understand too 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.990
 try to go to an empty empty 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.469
 section of the road to any site 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.790
 practice turning turns 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:05.159
 so that later the roads were much 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.020
 more confident than 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.360
 the world when you do not know how much 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.480
 safer than just not making sure 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.680
 security maneuver just turned on 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.299
 fret and some trouble might happen 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.830
 sorrow 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:22.110
 five times shallow it later 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.349
 turn direction 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.250
 your movement and everything with you will be super 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:32.010
 again, the practice of waving hands is needed 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.840
 also for if you rate on 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.599
 left for example you have a right hand 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.920
 automatically pulls the steering wheel a little here 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.299
 you can even fall down a little 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.049
 unpleasant this workout again 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:48.000
 we train and besides that you will be well 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:51.329
 when you learn to wave it 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.250
 good too try once to see what 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:56.370
 take you back or buy a mirror 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.440
 rear view or learn to turn 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.109
 head so that your hands do not go away 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.299
 on the Crimea so if you often drive along 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:06.950
 the city or you want to go to work 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:09.660
 on the bike every day good fords 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.540
 whatever weather you want later then 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.459
 better to start with a mirror as follows 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.440
 point of our safe program 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.400
 driving on and safe driving on 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.069
 the bike will probably be hiv everyone 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.200
 accidents about effects not only do you see u 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:30.090
 we have a worm in this is probably an alcoholic 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:33.120
 point and alka paradise dengi is a man 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.519
 thinks well if something on a bike whom he 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.569
 there touches drink a bottle of beer 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:42.630
 2 bottles of beer or three don't think so 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.799
 I go quietly home and often get 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.090
 mosquito brave rolls of course 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:51.150
 machines they are so solid starts 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.900
 seem to pedestrians think will 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.290
 to scatter 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.599
 but it does not happen that we do not allow desirable 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.299
 drink driving a car 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.900
 cycling any drink only in 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.700
 minibuses 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:08.549
 this is cool or even the Egyptians are important to you 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.470
 secondary and main road even 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.730
 if you ride a bike through the main 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.940
 the road 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:18.570
 we wish to take into account as a factor 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:21.269
 called the factor of bread and fortress fact 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.150
 factors of her important investment of what 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.250
 the driver on the car may just be 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.280
 a fool 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.690
 but most likely simply does not see to Korea 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.139
 just don't see either think so somehow 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.449
 you will go differently therefore before 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.250
 any intersection ensure safety 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.710
 look around and then only 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.330
 I pass nevertheless the bicycle infrastructure is not 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.130
 so developed to for 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.750
 cyclist and a bowl of her sense 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.789
 separate concepts secondary and 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.919
 the main road 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:55.260
 most probably the main thing is not even there and 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:57.930
 big problem cyclists everyone 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.910
 even experienced inexperienced for whom 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.419
 broadcasts the atom a large number of crashes 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:06.750
 Here until death this pro e o 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:09.419
 cycling ji bike on 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.030
 bike live and live and 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:15.120
 Korf you will again you my level 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.250
 victory is generally very simple 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.669
 pedestrian crossing created for pedestrians 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.849
 so they quickly or almost immediately 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:25.950
 come to the base safely so being 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.570
 cyclists if you need to go to 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.240
 other hydrogen in the tank write 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.460
 stitch dismount and roll 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.729
 and this bike I assure you will save 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.830
 you have a huge number of lives just 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.810
 this one this rule probably can 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.150
 reduce the number of crashes with a bike 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:46.560
 by a percentage of 8 what their and looking at 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:49.080
 video in u-tub 80 percent is a project 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.080
 crosswalk all together no this 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.539
 road is not road is a thing for 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.729
 pedestrians yes so this wanna go 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:06:00.780
 crosswalk go go they 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:03.870
 moving it all with you was the bike of those 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.440
 Alexander Dialects Like 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.740
 subscribe to new meetings
