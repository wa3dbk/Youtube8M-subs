00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.520
 will argue that the poppy is great 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.500

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.829

 with it and cross-platform gaming with 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.020
 devices on ios and support for these 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.520
 most games on ios 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.559
 unfortunately they mostly live there 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.900
 kazualki and call it full 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.809

 albert einstein once said 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.250
 technological advancement is like an ax in 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.989
 in the hands of a pathological criminal but you 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.420
 were ever in top mage appstore 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.369

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.770
 sky gamblers on the top lines like you 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.660

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.950
 all companies sell their games through the magician 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.840
 appstore for example electronics art 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.039

 real football and this is the first series 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.360
 FIFA who visited the apple platform 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.429
 some games craftsmen 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.110
 port their own quality of such 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:28.670
 Frankenstein of usually leaves 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.709
 wanting the best suffers first 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.750
 performance and compatibility but 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:34.520
 there is still a great can clean tell you 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.679
 it's true let's go for a walk 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.599
 media libraries and if the first one 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.310
 borderlands 2 supports poppy then this 

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:42.709
 rather the exception to the rule than him 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.989
 confirmation has generally seen a list of games 

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:47.179
 on the steam platform I would not say that 

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:49.700
 they are all terrible there but unfortunately it 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.649
 not the level of the gaming computer and what are you 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.119
 think arnold hordes are not worth 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.069
 forget about cloud services but to 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.780
 Unfortunately, the nut is not really born yet 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:59.060
 when are you promising onlive already 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.380
 bent and it's very sad because 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.690
 it was a really cool decision 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.340
 for the game including on the mac 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.530
 It turns out that with games on mac affairs 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.690
 things do not matter, but I will give you the ultimate 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.280
 advice on how to play mac for this 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.129
 we need macbook air from 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.849
 11-inch version or the same aimag any 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:15.470
 Year of release 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.720
 open the browser safari or chrome 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.980
 we introduce stamps point yandex.ru and there are three 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.840
 ps3 character 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.050
 sometimes it's four letters and three numbers 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.580
 x-box 360 is not true any console will decide 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.829
 your problem playing poppy once and 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.540
 forever all the same mac to work a 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:32.799
 plays is worth on those devices that 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.799
 specially invented for this 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.190
 she gave 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.620
 we have 2 threads left untouched this 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.600
 virtualization and boot camp I think that 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.730
 both of these formats are not suitable though 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.130
 the latter is good enough for 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.410
 to play a letter game but like me and 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.090
 said it seems to me to put on the mac 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.700
 windows just to play 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:07.700
 games but it 's somehow wrong but to me 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:09.020
 so it seems like a guy what do you think write 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.790
