00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.030 
still some things that I didn't really
like<00:01:57.640> about<00:01:57.790> it<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.720> first<00:01:58.990> thing<00:01:59.200> is<00:01:59.410> that<00:01:59.440> if

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
like about it the first thing is that if

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.090 
like about it the first thing is that if
i<00:02:00.280> install<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:01.360> home<00:02:02.020> button<00:02:02.290> sticker<00:02:02.740> on<00:02:03.070> my

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
ipod it actually makes the home button

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.969 
ipod it actually makes the home button
harder<00:02:06.700> to<00:02:06.850> press<00:02:07.150> and<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:08.259> gives<00:02:08.500> you<00:02:08.679> less

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
harder to press and it gives you less

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.970 
harder to press and it gives you less
clicky<00:02:09.910> sound<00:02:10.149> which<00:02:10.810> I<00:02:11.080> don't<00:02:11.410> really<00:02:11.740> like

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
clicky sound which I don't really like

clicky sound which I don't really like
and<00:02:12.280> also<00:02:13.270> another<00:02:13.690> thing<00:02:13.870> is<00:02:14.440> that<00:02:14.700> the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700
