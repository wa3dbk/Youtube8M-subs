very scale flying for us just a

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:37.030 
very scale flying for us just a
two-channel<00:06:31.580> myself<00:06:34.600> alright<00:06:35.600> so<00:06:36.500> obviously

a<00:06:37.340> really<00:06:37.820> nice<00:06:38.210> flyer<00:06:39.130> as<00:06:40.130> I<00:06:40.430> mentioned

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
a really nice flyer as I mentioned

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.840 
a really nice flyer as I mentioned
before<00:06:41.270> I<00:06:41.510> had<00:06:41.930> put<00:06:42.140> zero<00:06:42.560> trim<00:06:42.920> into<00:06:43.070> that<00:06:43.310> all

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:43.850 
before I had put zero trim into that all

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.570 
before I had put zero trim into that all
I<00:06:44.420> did<00:06:44.480> on<00:06:44.840> that<00:06:44.990> model<00:06:45.350> is<00:06:45.470> centered<00:06:46.430> the

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:46.580 
I did on that model is centered the

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.730 
I did on that model is centered the
control<00:06:47.030> surfaces<00:06:47.480> no<00:06:48.170> issues<00:06:48.500> with<00:06:48.650> the

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
control surfaces no issues with the

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.410 
control surfaces no issues with the
center<00:06:48.980> gravity<00:06:49.280> with<00:06:49.400> the<00:06:49.430> 2200<00:06:50.150> milliamp

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:50.420 
center gravity with the 2200 milliamp

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.160 
center gravity with the 2200 milliamp
hour<00:06:50.630> 3s<00:06:51.500> set<00:06:51.740> battery<00:06:52.070> in<00:06:52.160> there<00:06:52.310> and<00:06:53.050> tons<00:06:54.050> of

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:54.170 
hour 3s set battery in there and tons of

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.420 
hour 3s set battery in there and tons of
powers<00:06:54.470> you<00:06:54.620> can<00:06:54.740> see<00:06:54.890> it'll<00:06:55.070> climb<00:06:55.220> right

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:55.430 
powers you can see it'll climb right

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.600 
powers you can see it'll climb right
vertical<00:06:55.760> lots<00:06:56.420> of<00:06:56.540> controls<00:06:57.340> surface<00:06:58.340> area

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
vertical lots of controls surface area

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.700 
vertical lots of controls surface area
so<00:06:58.790> it<00:06:58.880> can<00:06:59.030> do<00:06:59.180> loops<00:06:59.570> rolls<00:06:59.840> all<00:07:00.200> that<00:07:00.350> type

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:00.710 
so it can do loops rolls all that type

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.740 
so it can do loops rolls all that type
of<00:07:00.740> thing<00:07:01.010> and<00:07:01.130> really<00:07:01.820> good<00:07:01.970> low<00:07:02.120> flying<00:07:02.420> good

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:02.750 
of thing and really good low flying good

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.810 
of thing and really good low flying good
low<00:07:02.870> slow<00:07:03.680> flying<00:07:03.980> characteristics

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:04.820 
low slow flying characteristics

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.690 
low slow flying characteristics
so<00:07:04.970> although<00:07:05.680> 100%<00:07:06.680> of<00:07:06.860> just<00:07:07.220> a<00:07:07.310> beautiful
