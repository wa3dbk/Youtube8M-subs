00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
overly sized for what it should be I

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.190 
overly sized for what it should be I
think<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.520> minigun<00:02:01.119> that<00:02:01.330> you<00:02:01.420> get<00:02:01.630> with<00:02:01.840> the

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
think the minigun that you get with the

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.630 
think the minigun that you get with the
hunt<00:02:02.530> for<00:02:02.619> grievous<00:02:02.920> battle<00:02:03.250> pack<00:02:03.430> is

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
hunt for grievous battle pack is

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.810 
hunt for grievous battle pack is
probably<00:02:03.909> closer<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.420> more<00:02:05.290> accurate<00:02:05.820> and

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
probably closer to more accurate and

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.340 
probably closer to more accurate and
also<00:02:07.060> its<00:02:07.210> missile<00:02:07.479> firing<00:02:07.869> you<00:02:07.960> press<00:02:08.200> this

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
also its missile firing you press this

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.620 
also its missile firing you press this
knob<00:02:08.590> on<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:08.800> top<00:02:09.070> here<00:02:09.280> and<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.450> fires

there's no weathering on the weapon at
all<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:14.709> does<00:02:14.860> hold<00:02:15.100> it<00:02:15.310> very<00:02:15.459> well<00:02:15.670> so

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
all and it does hold it very well so

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.420 
all and it does hold it very well so
like<00:02:16.989> I<00:02:17.080> said<00:02:17.140> they're<00:02:17.320> not<00:02:17.350> bad<00:02:17.650> but<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.160> think

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
like I said they're not bad but I think

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.699 
like I said they're not bad but I think
just<00:02:18.580> think<00:02:18.730> they're<00:02:18.820> a<00:02:18.850> bit<00:02:19.000> over<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.300> top<00:02:19.709> if

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
just think they're a bit over the top if

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.380 
just think they're a bit over the top if
I<00:02:20.860> display<00:02:21.190> them<00:02:21.430> i<00:02:21.519> tend<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:21.820> display<00:02:22.209> them

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
I display them i tend to display them

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.970 
I display them i tend to display them
without<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.840> missile<00:02:23.170> in<00:02:23.380> because<00:02:23.739> i<00:02:23.800> think

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
without the missile in because i think

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.210 
without the missile in because i think
it<00:02:24.100> looks<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.370> bit<00:02:24.489> daft<00:02:25.110> there<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.170> go<00:02:26.380> that's
