00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
dear Minister for the first time in ten

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.160 
dear Minister for the first time in ten
years<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:06.089> law<00:00:06.270> that<00:00:06.450> was<00:00:06.600> supposed<00:00:06.990> to

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
years the law that was supposed to

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.320 
years the law that was supposed to
secure<00:00:07.529> sound<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.160> sustainable<00:00:08.700> fishing<00:00:09.030> is

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
secure sound and sustainable fishing is

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.259 
secure sound and sustainable fishing is
up<00:00:09.630> for<00:00:09.840> review<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.500> guess<00:00:11.070> what<00:00:11.269> something

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
up for review and guess what something

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.230 
up for review and guess what something
is<00:00:12.360> very<00:00:12.420> fishy<00:00:13.070> so<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.099> looked<00:00:14.549> into<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:15.089> and

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
is very fishy so I looked into it and

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.019 
is very fishy so I looked into it and
it's<00:00:15.630> actually<00:00:15.809> really<00:00:16.350> really<00:00:16.740> simple<00:00:17.190> there

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
it's actually really really simple there

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.769 
it's actually really really simple there
are<00:00:18.180> too<00:00:18.330> many<00:00:18.449> boats<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.350> catch<00:00:19.560> too<00:00:19.920> few<00:00:20.189> fish

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
are too many boats to catch too few fish

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.810 
are too many boats to catch too few fish
simply<00:00:21.779> put<00:00:21.990> if<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.590> continues<00:00:23.279> there<00:00:23.640> won't

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
simply put if this continues there won't

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.790 
simply put if this continues there won't
be<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.029> whole<00:00:24.269> lot<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.630> fish<00:00:24.840> left<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.260> eat<00:00:25.410> in

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
be a whole lot of fish left to eat in

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.220 
be a whole lot of fish left to eat in
just<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.220> few<00:00:26.369> decades<00:00:26.869> but<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.050> will

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
just a few decades but this will

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.470 
just a few decades but this will
regulate<00:00:28.560> itself<00:00:29.070> right<00:00:29.460> if<00:00:30.000> there<00:00:30.269> are<00:00:30.359> no

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
regulate itself right if there are no

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.510 
regulate itself right if there are no
fish<00:00:30.750> left<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.439> number<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.830> boats<00:00:32.040> will<00:00:32.340> go

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
fish left the number of boats will go

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.660 
fish left the number of boats will go
down<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.149> fish<00:00:33.480> will<00:00:33.630> come<00:00:33.870> back<00:00:34.110> yes<00:00:34.710> no

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670
