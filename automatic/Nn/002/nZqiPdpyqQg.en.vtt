00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.850
 hello today I show you how I did for 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.189
 make the costume of elsa clouseau eva 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:12.090
 there I have a yard of this fabric that is 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.340
 the lycra that is used for things 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.680
 gymnastics is a yard that I have bent 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:22.270
 in the middle 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:25.750
 and again in the middle of this lake 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:30.220
 and this is going to be the basis of the dress 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.660
 although that will go on the little tree 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.010
 long sleeves that can also do it 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.620
 with an east the ballet afternoon is more 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.920
 nice with that I'm going to buy it and 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.050
 then so more or less at the height of 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.040
 here they will not start the dress towards 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.030
 down 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.760
 because so what he's going to do here is 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.550
 simply from this corner measure the 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.910
 width 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.370
 from half the town we know how to double their 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.460
 people they already have as a teacher 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.470
 managing to put here 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.730
 but I'm showing I'm going to cut more 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.290
 right now 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:14.650
 and that they were going to measure there leaving their 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.590
 space to be able to sew 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.340
 we're going to have to measure it where 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.520
 will go the knees of your baby that the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.150
 here 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.860
 and then it's going to open up a lot 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.230
 to the edge 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.230
 so they're going to cut here 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.870
 and up to the top so that the part of 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.210
 back look wider as in any 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.150
 I made came out dressed so that they can 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.520
 see there and I'm going to cut only one of 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.160
 the pieces by that line and they will see 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.710
 so in two ways the left side of 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.570
 back and the right side forward the 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.450
 I put face to face with the side 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.090
 right looking at each other and the wrong side 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.520
 outside and I sew it so that it looks like this and in 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.370
 one side cut her a neckline so she 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.340
 look like dress and show elsa 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.910
 that the town that I chose had a neck 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.850
 high as well as sporty and just what 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.710
 I cut it back to sew it in the way that 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.860
 I wanted to and to have more 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.830
 pegadito m not so loose you got a little 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.230
 in front and got him a little behind 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.510
 as you can see here and how I showed them 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.060
 discover it also up close 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.540
 It is dirty because they are by their 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.970
 birthday but beware this here 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.730
 Buy like little bottles like this with 1 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.819
 point my tip very thin and you can 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.799
 absorb the fabric is very easy 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.060
 and I also wanted to show you the material 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.580
 which I used for the layer 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.110
 This is a fabric that sells it more than 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.849
 nothing in life but that can be 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.099
 get others the reason why 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.000
 I got to buy this was because it 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.000
 stretch from one side 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.480
 because all the materials that I have 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.489
 are 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.840
 elastic because only this is done 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.090
 stretch 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.420
 and all that is sewn with a special point 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.019
 as in zig zag I do not know if you see it here 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.019
 but it's a point 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:17.110
 so that it stretches and does not break 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.980
 and to put the layer first then the 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.870
 layer on the pole before putting it 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.870
 about the dress what needs to be done 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:30.100
 use the polo with the dress then what 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.670
 I put this way open up and 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.220
 then be like that 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.290
 I say it later that I could more or 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.690
 minus the side of the armpit to the other 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.380
 side and once I was happy as 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.350
 where I put in the layer 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.110
 I put the dress on top of the cape and 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.920
 the chicken and how can you see here in 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.120
 only one line on the side here 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.590
 he is still very young here 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.590
 and from the front 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.739
 the material and there they see the zigzag point 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.739
 perfect 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:14.080
 part of here and then I put him 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:17.110
 march to cover the imperfections 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.150
 near the painted on the bottom 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:22.150
 of the layer so that they do not all run 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.530
 the edges I put also and that painting 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.530
 that I showed you at the pole 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.820
 is the real zigzag point this the 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.220
 provinces to you valdano here 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.610
 stretch 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.370
 and it does not break but good is 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.439
 so you could see the dress without the 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.169
 painting he liked but I had 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:47.240
 more so I bought a painting is a 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.189
 special metallic acrylic for fabrics 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.889
 which are called lumiÃ¨re can be mixed 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:54.530
 with water dilute and thus be able to achieve 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.569
 type of graffiti that I wanted there they saw 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.180
 my graffiti test this is how it was 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:01.280
 tooth in front and behind there are the 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.500
 details also of the dress that 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.099
 they say arms to this the part of 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.560
 back is not even a model was and also 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:11.689
 to be able to put everything much better 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.120
 I did a hairstyle of the bank sae a 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:16.370
 French braid on the side that grass 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.439
