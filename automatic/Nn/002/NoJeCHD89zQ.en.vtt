it's starting up and it's really cool

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.610 
it's starting up and it's really cool
I'm<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.629> one<00:00:42.780> thing<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.260> don't<00:00:43.410> like

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
I'm the one thing that I don't like

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.190 
I'm the one thing that I don't like
about<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.910> have<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.180> press<00:00:45.360> P<00:00:45.719> and

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
about it is that you have to press P and

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.600 
about it is that you have to press P and
it<00:00:46.379> would<00:00:46.500> be<00:00:46.530> better<00:00:46.800> if<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.070> could<00:00:47.219> craft

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
it would be better if you could craft

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.700 
it would be better if you could craft
something<00:00:47.969> using<00:00:48.480> like<00:00:48.600> spider<00:00:49.050> string<00:00:49.500> or

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
something using like spider string or

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.049 
something using like spider string or
something<00:00:50.100> like<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.910> can

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
something like that and so you can

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.670 
something like that and so you can
create<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.510> thread<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.559> would

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
create the thread like that and it would

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.580 
create the thread like that and it would
run<00:00:52.920> out<00:00:53.100> because<00:00:53.789> as<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.809> my<00:00:54.960> knowledge<00:00:55.170> um

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
run out because as to my knowledge um

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.549 
run out because as to my knowledge um
there<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.100> no<00:00:56.399> sort<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.109> ammunition<00:00:58.109> or

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
there is no sort of ammunition or

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.139 
there is no sort of ammunition or
anything<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.190> can<00:00:59.370> place<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.940> sort

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
anything that you can place and it sort

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.119 
anything that you can place and it sort
of<00:01:00.180> becomes<00:01:00.480> overpowered<00:01:01.410> having<00:01:02.010> this

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
of becomes overpowered having this

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.670 
of becomes overpowered having this
thread<00:01:02.850> sort<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.690> silken<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:04.500> see<00:01:04.650> that

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
thread sort of silken you can see that

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.469 
thread sort of silken you can see that
it<00:01:04.920> sort<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.100> disappears<00:01:05.640> but<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.299> if<00:01:06.360> you

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
it sort of disappears but so if you

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.450 
it sort of disappears but so if you
follow<00:01:06.750> along<00:01:07.110> your<00:01:07.409> key<00:01:07.770> you'll<00:01:08.010> keep<00:01:08.250> on

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
follow along your key you'll keep on

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.030 
follow along your key you'll keep on
appearing<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:09.750> not<00:01:09.990> lag<00:01:10.200> intensive<00:01:10.830> so

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
appearing and it's not lag intensive so

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.399 
string or just string in general and
you'd<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.189> collect<00:01:39.060> more<00:01:39.479> string<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.140> you

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
you'd have to collect more string so you

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.130 
you'd have to collect more string so you
sort<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.189> have<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.549> run<00:01:41.729> out<00:01:41.909> because<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.930> is

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
sort of have to run out because this is

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.770 
sort of have to run out because this is
kind<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.409> overpowered<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.369> we<00:01:45.180> met<00:01:45.630> our

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
kind of overpowered and we met our

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.690 
kind of overpowered and we met our
string<00:01:46.049> before<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.500> if<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.680> actually<00:01:47.070> make<00:01:47.460> a

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
string before and if you actually make a

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.789 
string before and if you actually make a
loop<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.210> sort<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.659> connects<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.290> back<00:01:49.439> up<00:01:49.649> and

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
loop it sort of connects it back up and

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.520 
loop it sort of connects it back up and
I<00:01:49.950> realizes<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.820> went<00:01:51.240> back<00:01:51.509> home<00:01:52.170> or

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
I realizes that you went back home or

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.740 
I realizes that you went back home or
