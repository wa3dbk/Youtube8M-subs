hello review on the jelly belly dual ice
snow<00:00:04.980> cone<00:00:05.220> maker<00:00:05.460> now<00:00:05.759> last<00:00:06.000> year<00:00:06.210> I<00:00:06.240> reviewed

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
snow cone maker now last year I reviewed

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.900 
snow cone maker now last year I reviewed
the<00:00:07.040> single<00:00:08.040> maker<00:00:08.220> this<00:00:08.519> year<00:00:08.700> we're<00:00:08.820> going

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
the single maker this year we're going

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.520 
the single maker this year we're going
to<00:00:09.000> review<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.480> kind<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:09.990> granddaddy<00:00:10.440> of

to review the kind of the granddaddy of

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.799 
to review the kind of the granddaddy of
all<00:00:10.769> Jelly<00:00:11.250> Belly<00:00:11.490> snow<00:00:11.790> cone<00:00:11.969> maker<00:00:12.150> the

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
all Jelly Belly snow cone maker the

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.360 
all Jelly Belly snow cone maker the
double<00:00:13.170> so<00:00:13.799> we're<00:00:13.889> going<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.040> see<00:00:14.130> how<00:00:14.219> this

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
double so we're going to see how this

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.790 
double so we're going to see how this
works<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.940> make<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.809> couple<00:00:16.020> snow<00:00:16.289> cones<00:00:16.590> so

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
works and make a couple snow cones so

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.779 
works and make a couple snow cones so
see<00:00:16.920> if<00:00:16.980> this<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.130> maybe<00:00:17.340> something<00:00:17.760> that

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
see if this is maybe something that

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.000 
see if this is maybe something that
would<00:00:18.119> uh<00:00:18.150> be<00:00:18.660> fun<00:00:18.840> for<00:00:19.020> your<00:00:19.140> family<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:19.890> the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
would uh be fun for your family in the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.800 
would uh be fun for your family in the
summer<00:00:20.189> or<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.670> guess<00:00:20.970> maybe<00:00:21.240> if<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.480> like<00:00:21.630> snow

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
summer or I guess maybe if you like snow

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.599 
summer or I guess maybe if you like snow
cones<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.199> winter<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.529> winter<00:00:22.710> too<00:00:22.980> so

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
cones in the winter in the winter too so

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.830 
cones in the winter in the winter too so
see<00:00:23.760> how<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:23.970> works<00:00:26.269> okay<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.720> where

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
see how it works okay so this is where

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.929 
see how it works okay so this is where
the<00:00:27.960> ice<00:00:28.080> goes<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.400> can<00:00:29.550> see<00:00:29.699> it's

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
the ice goes in and you can see it's

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.189 
the ice goes in and you can see it's
kind<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.210> dripping<00:00:30.539> right<00:00:30.689> out<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.050> made

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
kind of dripping right out so I made

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.170 
kind of dripping right out so I made
some<00:00:31.349> snow<00:00:31.560> cones<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:32.040> be<00:00:32.520> kind<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.790> careful<00:00:32.940> on

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
some snow cones so be kind of careful on

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.510 
some snow cones so be kind of careful on
the<00:00:33.239> placement<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.780> what<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.860> do<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.309> see

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
the placement and what you do is you see

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.810 
the placement and what you do is you see
right<00:00:35.700> there<00:00:35.910> there's<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.989> tab<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.219> tab

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
right there there's a tab and that tab

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.139 
right there there's a tab and that tab
lines<00:00:39.210> up<00:00:42.440> tab<00:00:43.440> right<00:00:43.710> there<00:00:43.969> we're<00:00:44.969> going<00:00:45.090> to

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
lines up tab right there we're going to

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.180 
lines up tab right there we're going to
fill<00:00:45.360> ice<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.780> here<00:00:46.050> we're<00:00:46.739> going<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.890> turn<00:00:47.039> it

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
fill ice in here we're going to turn it

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.080 
fill ice in here we're going to turn it
on<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.399> we're<00:00:47.489> going<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.640> make<00:00:47.760> some<00:00:47.940> snow

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
on and we're going to make some snow

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.240 
on and we're going to make some snow
cones<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.570> see<00:00:48.780> how<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:49.050> thing<00:00:49.230> works<00:00:49.500> but

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
cones to see how this thing works but

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.529 
cones to see how this thing works but
first<00:00:50.460> we're<00:00:50.789> going<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.940> look<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.210> see<00:00:51.360> that

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
first we're going to look and see that

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.720 
first we're going to look and see that
unlike<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.079> single<00:00:52.620> maker<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:53.579> one

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
unlike the single maker this one

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.490 
unlike the single maker this one
actually<00:00:53.910> has<00:00:54.289> little<00:00:56.030> tubs<00:00:57.030> dispensing<00:00:58.820> your

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
actually has little tubs dispensing your

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.290 
actually has little tubs dispensing your
snow<00:01:01.500> cone<00:01:01.739> tree<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.340> one<00:01:02.850> side<00:01:03.030> I've<00:01:03.149> got

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
snow cone tree so one side I've got

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.509 
snow cone tree so one side I've got
great<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.830> this<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.100> grape<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.280> other

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
great and this is the grape and other

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.000 
great and this is the grape and other
side<00:01:05.760> was<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.909> cherry<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:07.680> kind<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.860> nice

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
side was the cherry so it's kind of nice

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.719 
side was the cherry so it's kind of nice
because<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.430> actually<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:10.729> syrup

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
because you actually have the syrup

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.179 
because you actually have the syrup
dispenser<00:01:11.880> right<00:01:12.420> here<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> unit<00:01:13.590> unlike

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
dispenser right here in the unit unlike

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.700 
dispenser right here in the unit unlike
last<00:01:14.369> years<00:01:14.640> now<00:01:15.390> also<00:01:15.600> here<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.320> see<00:01:16.470> is

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
last years now also here you can see is

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.580 
last years now also here you can see is
dual<00:01:17.189> snow<00:01:17.700> cone<00:01:17.909> holders<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:19.229> let's<00:01:19.409> make

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
dual snow cone holders so let's make

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.420 
dual snow cone holders so let's make
some<00:01:19.619> snow<00:01:19.890> cones<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.340> see<00:01:20.490> how<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.700> works<00:01:22.430> okay

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
some snow cones to see how it works okay

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.620 
some snow cones to see how it works okay
the<00:01:23.549> first<00:01:23.729> thing<00:01:23.850> we're<00:01:24.119> do<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.420> we're<00:01:24.540> going

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
the first thing we're do is we're going

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.830 
the first thing we're do is we're going
to<00:01:24.689> actually<00:01:24.840> put<00:01:25.140> icing<00:01:29.509> you're<00:01:30.509> then<00:01:30.659> going

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
to actually put icing you're then going

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
to actually put icing you're then going
to<00:01:30.900> put<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.200> top<00:01:34.340> put<00:01:35.340> into<00:01:35.610> two<00:01:35.790> snow<00:01:36.060> cones

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
to put the top put into two snow cones

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.920 
to put the top put into two snow cones
and<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.820> got<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> neat<00:01:39.240> feature<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.750> just

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
and this is got a neat feature you just

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:49.300 
and this is got a neat feature you just
simply<00:01:40.229> twist

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.999 

and<00:01:50.310> then<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.640> turn<00:01:50.850> back<00:01:51.030> around<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.890> you

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
and then you turn back around and you

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.310 
and then you turn back around and you
can<00:01:53.159> see<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:55.740> ice<00:01:55.860> now<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.729> use<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.420> typically<00:01:58.140> go

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
can see the ice now I use I typically go

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.240 
can see the ice now I use I typically go
about<00:01:58.469> half<00:01:58.679> way<00:01:59.090> put<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.179> in<00:02:00.270> some<00:02:00.390> syrup<00:02:01.250> back

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
about half way put it in some syrup back

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:14.720 
about half way put it in some syrup back
in

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:24.500 

a<00:02:16.670> little<00:02:17.670> bit<00:02:17.790> more

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.809 

and<00:02:25.019> there<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.769> have<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.010> nice<00:02:26.370> little<00:02:26.580> snow

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
and there you have a nice little snow

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.160 
and there you have a nice little snow
cone<00:02:27.000> I'll<00:02:27.120> put<00:02:27.269> a<00:02:27.330> little<00:02:27.450> bit<00:02:27.540> more<00:02:27.629> syrup<00:02:28.050> in

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
cone I'll put a little bit more syrup in

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.930 
cone I'll put a little bit more syrup in
here<00:02:28.319> and<00:02:28.739> that's<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.310> fun<00:02:29.459> little<00:02:29.489> treat<00:02:31.940> okay

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
here and that's a fun little treat okay

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.640 
here and that's a fun little treat okay
couple<00:02:33.150> final<00:02:33.540> things<00:02:33.750> one<00:02:33.989> is<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.409> doesn't

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
couple final things one is it doesn't

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.140 
couple final things one is it doesn't
really<00:02:34.739> come<00:02:34.950> with<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.220> many<00:02:35.370> cups<00:02:35.670> so

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
really come with that many cups so

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.399 
really come with that many cups so
you're<00:02:36.269> going<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.450> need<00:02:36.629> get<00:02:36.780> more<00:02:36.900> cups<00:02:37.140> and

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
you're going to need get more cups and

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.559 
you're going to need get more cups and
possibly<00:02:37.709> straws<00:02:38.069> too<00:02:38.370> but<00:02:39.120> other<00:02:39.239> than<00:02:39.390> that

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
possibly straws too but other than that

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.600 
possibly straws too but other than that
it's<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.870> pretty<00:02:39.900> good<00:02:40.230> little<00:02:40.409> deal<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:41.069> my

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
it's a pretty good little deal so my

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.789 
it's a pretty good little deal so my
final<00:02:41.879> verdict<00:02:42.390> I'm<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.690> Jelly<00:02:43.019> Belly<00:02:43.260> dual

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
final verdict I'm the Jelly Belly dual

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.070 
final verdict I'm the Jelly Belly dual
snow<00:02:44.549> cone<00:02:44.760> maker<00:02:44.970> I'm<00:02:45.690> going<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.930> even

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
snow cone maker I'm going to even

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.420 
snow cone maker I'm going to even
actually<00:02:46.349> five<00:02:46.590> stars<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.129> think<00:02:47.280> it's<00:02:47.400> a

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
actually five stars I think it's a

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.830 
actually five stars I think it's a
significant<00:02:47.910> improvement<00:02:48.060> over<00:02:48.330> last<00:02:48.599> year's

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
significant improvement over last year's

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.990 
significant improvement over last year's
model<00:02:49.170> it's<00:02:49.769> a<00:02:49.860> lot<00:02:50.040> more<00:02:50.220> power<00:02:50.430> makes<00:02:50.849> the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
model it's a lot more power makes the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.059 
model it's a lot more power makes the
snow<00:02:51.239> cones<00:02:51.510> are<00:02:51.750> are<00:02:52.200> much<00:02:52.500> easier<00:02:52.799> to<00:02:52.890> make

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
snow cones are are much easier to make

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.380 
snow cones are are much easier to make
and<00:02:53.280> actually<00:02:53.549> I<00:02:53.579> think<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.849> mess<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.180> quite<00:02:54.360> a

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
and actually I think the mess is quite a

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.539 
and actually I think the mess is quite a
bit<00:02:54.510> less<00:02:54.659> too<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.709> I<00:02:55.739> like<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.370> surp

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
bit less too so I like the surp

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.660 
bit less too so I like the surp
dispensers<00:02:57.060> on<00:02:57.239> each<00:02:57.360> side<00:02:57.629> and<00:02:58.489> the<00:02:59.489> dual

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
dispensers on each side and the dual

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.970 
dispensers on each side and the dual
action<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:00.629> you<00:03:00.989> can<00:03:01.049> get<00:03:01.319> strap<00:03:01.530> regular<00:03:01.890> ice

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
action and you can get strap regular ice

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.130 
action and you can get strap regular ice
cubes<00:03:02.310> in<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:03.030> seems<00:03:03.299> to<00:03:03.450> be<00:03:03.569> safer<00:03:03.959> and

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
cubes in and it seems to be safer and

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.660 
cubes in and it seems to be safer and
better<00:03:04.470> built<00:03:04.920> in<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.129> whole<00:03:05.250> bit<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:05.609> I'm

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
better built in the whole bit so I'm

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.490 
better built in the whole bit so I'm
gonna<00:03:05.760> give<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:05.940> five<00:03:06.150> stars<00:03:06.180> it's<00:03:07.170> quite<00:03:07.470> a

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
gonna give it five stars it's quite a

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.030 
gonna give it five stars it's quite a
improvement<00:03:08.250> from<00:03:08.340> last<00:03:08.400> year's<00:03:08.730> model
