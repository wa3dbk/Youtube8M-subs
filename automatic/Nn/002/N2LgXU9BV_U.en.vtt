 even on the spot there was a fire every year 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.130
 even 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.200
 further all good evening and good 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.690
 to the world premiere of the a8 audit 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.690
 first three months 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.780
 word variant creation process 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.410
 car art and design go side by side

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.320
 in front of her only a clean slate crossed 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.420
 clear idea 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.480
 and the challenge is to impress first 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.480
 turn yourself red banner 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.040
 and they have it all turned us 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.450
 surprised not only themselves but the whole world 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.360
 The new flagship is not positioned 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.450
 just like a limousine for successful people 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.030

 sedan in its classroom looking at 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.020
 characteristics it is not difficult to believe 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.640
 engines to choose from while 2 petrol and 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.560
 diesel volume of 4 and two tenths of a liter 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.340
 seems like a promising three-liter diesel 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.659
 which will supposedly consume all-time 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.700
 6 liters per hundred by words 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.810
 company representatives this 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.990
 absolute segment record look 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.490
 power moment motors compared 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.390
 with predecessors naturally raised 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.509
 but the fuel consumption has decreased by an average of 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.590
 13 or even 22 percent at least so 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.369
 reads the official press release to 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:40.789

 duty theft in particular 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.829
 significantly eased the body 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:47.829
 now it consists of aviation 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.990
 aluminum and weighs almost 40 percent 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.640
 smaller steel body 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.979
 following tillering to reduce consumption 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.460
 fuel is an eight-speed 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.250
 tiptronic range 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.090
 gear ratios is wide therefore 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.800
 shifting speeds instantly a 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.320

 safety and driver assistance computer 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.959
 analyzes the route laid and 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.300
 transmits data on the control unit
