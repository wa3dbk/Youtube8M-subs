00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.890
 I am jpr 80 18 and today I bring you a new 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.860
 video tutorial so that you are able to 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.809
 create our own usb cutter for 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.299
 who do not know a usb boot cable 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.130
 would be the equivalent of a CD or DVD that 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.440
 start automatically when carrying 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.480
 our team this may result 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.150
 quite useful when using it in 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.490
 some portable winner or notebook since 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.650
 many do not have a reader in which you 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.120
 you can enter a cd and that 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.670
 they started 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.440
 I specifically used it at the time 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.670
 to install operating systems in my 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:38.470
 notebook and good before it is very useful and in 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.590
 this time I will use has pieces 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.290
 that I would like to store it in a usb already 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.900
 which is I give it a more comfortable use 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.870
 Well, let's start, we're going to 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.320
 start and we wrote tm once here 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.100
 let's open cmd but the right 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.370
 run 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.270
 let's see here yes and we will open this this 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.460
 window 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.650
 with this here we must write my 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.780
 parts 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.690
 for those who do not know because it is a 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.860
 small application that has windows by 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.850
 defect to make this class 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.299
 once selected we give to list 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.299
 bread 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.310
 dix is ​​from s 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.890
 that would give us the list of disks that 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.439
 we have in our team in this 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.590
 occasion I get a zero disk the 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:33.829
 hard disk of a terabit and a half 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.280
 the disk I do not know why it fails me and the 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:40.270
 disk 2 would be our 77 thousand usb 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.439
 megas let's select the disk 2 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.950
 here it does not have to occur in this 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.630
 order but okay I guess we're going to 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.289
 do 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.920
 x2 mentioned before can be one two 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.600
 three 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.409
 and now going to disk 2 has been 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.409
 selected 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.939
 once here we are going to clean our 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.590
 disk let's format the best said 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:08.250
 so that no content is left 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.570
 undesirable inside 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.570
 and then king 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.410
 activision 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:21.180
 primal let's create a partition 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.870
 We give and have created the satisfactory 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.350
 let's select the first partition 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.350
 pathetic select 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.160
 or not 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.700
 to see what looks good 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.190
 we give it is selected and we're going to 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.490
 activate active 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.330
 it's here 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.310
 now we should form format the with 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.890
 so that it could be executed at 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.820
 start it we should write what 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.120
 next format 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.060
 efe is equal to nt 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.640
 That would be a type of format 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.610
 different before we were using 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.160
 fat32 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.180
 we give him and he will start charging in this 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.180
 occasion taken but finally 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.819
 very well already carries 98 percent as 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.269
 you can know observer opposite camera 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:20.230
 fast and now it will reach one hundred percent 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:24.459
 there is this the speed of that 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.500
 have it formatted good 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.349
 varies depending on the capacity you have 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.069
 usb very well once done we should give it 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.069
 a well 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.860
 this would serve to assign a letter a 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.720
 character to our unit should be 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.340
 for it is assigned and now 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.290
 we should just give it to him if 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.170
 to leave the track 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:52.040
 once outside we will get windows 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:55.780
 system32 and we left that month 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.780
 now we turn to our team 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.659
 the unit position here and now we're going to 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:07.560
 move the files that you had before 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.560
 our usb 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.250
 we drag them as is and simply 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.470
 we should wait another little 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.610
 My passion would take 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.610
 to load 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:32.600
 it is now very simple now our 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.460
 usb would be late this is all not 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.080
 I hope you liked it and good if it is 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.950
