00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.080
 a new study reveals that the individuals who carry out the works 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.229
 typical of men have a male brain pattern 

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:11.860
 and those who do women's jobs 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.159
 they have a female pattern regardless of their sex 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:17.089
 as humans sink 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:22.070
 cost others have criticized me a lot what discover is that men who 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:25.710
 they did the jobs that women generally do had more morbid 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.390
 had results more typical of the female model, many Tucuman and 

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:34.039
 women who occupied positions that were frequently intended for 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:34.770
 mens 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.410
 they got results that seemed to belong with their example animates a 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.270
 female brain 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.499
 if you are right 

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:46.219
 carolina that working in a profession dominated by men should have 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.620
 a brain with a masculine disposition 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.370
 and salmon 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.200
 one female 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.780
 we asked the government professor to do a psa test and bolivia 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.780
 carolina to see it 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.170
 it's called disco listening 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.550
 debatable embedded the test was heard tico tico is very simple without

 you put some helmets on him and he gets some up and washed hesitated in bosnia 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.330
 a syllable in one ear 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.560
 minds a different greeting and syllable in another video 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.190
 what I do is let them hear 60 pairs of these syllables bush their homework 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.190
 it is simply to say what they hear 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.219
 the text is designed for right-handers 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:36.259
 and look directly at how verbal action is distributed in the brain 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.020
 An official 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.430
 our right son has direct connections to the left side of 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.860
 Our brain 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.100
 well ours and left is directly connected to the side 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.010

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.290
 when 2002 a typically masculine boyÃ© sound at the same time 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.350
 more often the sound on the right 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.540
 the ear that is directly connected to the side that processes the 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.630
 data 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.489
 this is called right ear benefit 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.489
 implies that normally they only pick up a sound 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.409
 concelebrated typically female on the other hand I just made the sounds by 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.639
 both ears because the verbal processing extends to both sides 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:28.919
 normally they pick up two sounds 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:33.649
 devesa usun carolina the results of carolina were the typical ones that you can 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:34.289
 wait

 andratx next to guti is exempt as boy may 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:50.499
 that's what I would have expected name

 obama 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:57.409
 at 28,700 and the second one they made tests to emol was very interested in

 the climax that is a big guy likes to play rugby the memory ever 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.359
 and I was wondering if 4th and 7th admit that I asked myself if the official refused 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.719
 but his psychotic listening was very typical of a Kirchner woman shown 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:12.999
 an advantage of the left huila very pronounced
