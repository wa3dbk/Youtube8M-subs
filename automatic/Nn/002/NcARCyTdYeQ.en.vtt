a<00:03:52.860> really<00:03:53.010> short<00:03:53.340> season<00:03:53.820> hurts<00:03:53.970> even<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:54.750> few

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
a really short season hurts even a few

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.740 
a really short season hurts even a few
episodes<00:03:55.350> I<00:03:55.500> mean<00:03:55.650> something<00:03:56.030> to<00:03:57.030> kind<00:03:57.690> of

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
episodes I mean something to kind of

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.270 
episodes I mean something to kind of
hold<00:03:57.959> over<00:03:58.170> until<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.860> movie<00:04:00.470> because<00:04:01.470> it

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
hold over until the movie because it

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.860 
hold over until the movie because it
seems<00:04:02.580> like<00:04:02.640> this<00:04:02.880> year<00:04:02.940> they're<00:04:03.390> adding<00:04:03.750> a

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
seems like this year they're adding a

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.270 
seems like this year they're adding a
lot<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:06.140> it<00:04:07.140> just<00:04:07.470> it<00:04:07.590> just<00:04:07.620> makes<00:04:07.920> me<00:04:08.010> wonder

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
lot and it just it just makes me wonder

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.780 
lot and it just it just makes me wonder
what<00:04:08.580> they<00:04:08.730> will<00:04:08.850> add<00:04:09.290> for<00:04:10.370> next<00:04:11.370> year<00:04:11.580> because

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
what they will add for next year because

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.670 
what they will add for next year because

going to be but I know they said it's
going<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:33.780> take<00:04:33.990> place<00:04:34.200> in<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:35.160> universe<00:04:35.700> of

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
going to take place in the universe of

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.210 
going to take place in the universe of
the<00:04:36.480> lego<00:04:36.660> movie<00:04:36.800> so<00:04:37.800> it's<00:04:38.010> gonna<00:04:38.130> be

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
the lego movie so it's gonna be

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.550 
the lego movie so it's gonna be
something<00:04:38.460> like<00:04:38.640> the<00:04:38.820> lego<00:04:39.000> movie<00:04:39.350> sort<00:04:40.350> of

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
something like the lego movie sort of

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.540 
something like the lego movie sort of
course<00:04:41.490> it's<00:04:41.670> Ninjago<00:04:42.180> though<00:04:42.480> but<00:04:43.430> will<00:04:44.430> we

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
course it's Ninjago though but will we

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.790 
course it's Ninjago though but will we
see<00:04:44.850> this<00:04:45.120> story<00:04:45.510> that<00:04:45.960> we've<00:04:46.140> been<00:04:46.290> following

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
see this story that we've been following

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.120 
see this story that we've been following
for<00:04:46.860> years<00:04:47.520> will<00:04:48.450> we<00:04:48.600> see<00:04:48.810> more<00:04:49.020> of<00:04:49.080> it<00:04:49.260> in<00:04:49.290> 2016

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
for years will we see more of it in 2016

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.620 
for years will we see more of it in 2016
that's<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.270> question<00:04:51.450> I<00:04:51.870> think<00:04:52.370> 2016<00:04:53.370> is<00:04:53.670> the

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
that's the question I think 2016 is the

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.180 
that's the question I think 2016 is the
big<00:04:54.840> question<00:04:54.990> here<00:04:55.440> is<00:04:55.500> what<00:04:55.710> will<00:04:55.860> we<00:04:55.980> see

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
big question here is what will we see

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.190 
big question here is what will we see
then<00:04:56.400> that<00:04:56.700> year<00:04:57.090> next<00:04:57.780> year<00:04:58.280> but<00:04:59.450> then<00:05:00.450> bigger

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
then that year next year but then bigger

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.440 
then that year next year but then bigger
questions<00:05:01.710> are<00:05:01.919> like<00:05:02.160> what<00:05:02.669> will<00:05:02.850> we<00:05:02.970> see<00:05:03.270> in

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
questions are like what will we see in

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.590 
questions are like what will we see in
like<00:05:03.660> 20<00:05:04.380> 17<00:05:05.010> or<00:05:05.130> eight<00:05:05.250> 2018<00:05:06.030> that's<00:05:06.240> way<00:05:06.540> too

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
like 20 17 or eight 2018 that's way too

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.200 
like 20 17 or eight 2018 that's way too
far<00:05:07.050> in<00:05:07.169> the<00:05:07.260> future<00:05:07.460> it's<00:05:08.460> kind<00:05:08.700> of<00:05:08.790> too<00:05:08.970> far

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
far in the future it's kind of too far

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.650 
far in the future it's kind of too far
to<00:05:09.360> think<00:05:09.630> about<00:05:09.870> right<00:05:09.900> now<00:05:10.160> but<00:05:11.270> when<00:05:12.270> we<00:05:12.450> see

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
to think about right now but when we see

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.020 
to think about right now but when we see
next<00:05:12.990> year<00:05:13.050> will<00:05:13.950> we<00:05:14.100> see<00:05:14.340> more<00:05:14.610> another

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
next year will we see more another

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.690 
next year will we see more another
another<00:05:15.570> season<00:05:16.350> or<00:05:18.680> what<00:05:19.680> it<00:05:19.800> seemed<00:05:20.070> like<00:05:20.100> to

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
another season or what it seemed like to

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.940 
another season or what it seemed like to
the<00:05:20.820> Ninjago<00:05:21.180> creators<00:05:21.720> that<00:05:22.020> that<00:05:22.770> would<00:05:22.919> be

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
the Ninjago creators that that would be

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.080 
the Ninjago creators that that would be
too<00:05:23.400> many<00:05:23.610> seasons<00:05:24.290> crammed<00:05:25.290> together<00:05:25.590> in<00:05:26.220> and

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
too many seasons crammed together in and

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.010 
too many seasons crammed together in and
I<00:05:28.370> 2015<00:05:29.370> into<00:05:29.730> the<00:05:29.850> 16<00:05:30.330> that'd<00:05:30.450> be<00:05:30.570> about<00:05:30.660> three

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
I 2015 into the 16 that'd be about three

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.690 
I 2015 into the 16 that'd be about three
seasons<00:05:31.440> I<00:05:31.650> don't<00:05:31.890> know<00:05:32.010> if<00:05:32.160> they<00:05:32.280> would<00:05:32.400> think

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
seasons I don't know if they would think

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.219 
seasons I don't know if they would think
that's<00:05:32.850> too<00:05:33.030> much<00:05:33.060> or<00:05:33.419> not<00:05:33.450> I<00:05:33.690> don't<00:05:33.930> think<00:05:34.110> it

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
that's too much or not I don't think it

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.010 
that's too much or not I don't think it
would<00:05:34.350> be<00:05:34.470> to<00:05:35.010> be<00:05:35.040> awesome<00:05:35.580> but<00:05:36.360> what<00:05:36.870> do<00:05:36.930> you

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
would be to be awesome but what do you

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.159 
would be to be awesome but what do you
think<00:05:37.260> I<00:05:37.500> mean<00:05:38.280> what<00:05:39.240> do<00:05:39.390> you<00:05:39.450> think<00:05:39.840> will

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
think I mean what do you think will

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.900 
think I mean what do you think will
happen<00:05:40.340> what<00:05:41.340> do<00:05:41.460> you<00:05:41.520> think<00:05:41.580> we<00:05:41.910> will<00:05:41.940> have<00:05:42.060> I

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
don't think Ninjago is going to be

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.000 
don't think Ninjago is going to be
ending<00:05:46.470> anytime<00:05:46.620> soon<00:05:47.570> but<00:05:48.830> what<00:05:49.830> do<00:05:49.919> you
