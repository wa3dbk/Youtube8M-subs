00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.299
 the one who dances less especially here less 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.029
 love in a new tutorial that I 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:09.160
 They asked for facebook and it is to install 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.620
 a small pack of skins for gta vale 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.000
 The first thing we want to do is go to 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.299
 the children that I will leave in the 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.340
 description mediafire and iu and this one is worth 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.300
 once already being there 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:25.820
 we copy the link 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.820
 and we go to our browser we paste it 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.350
 and we hope the link is uploaded by me and 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.300
 we give you to download 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.940
 one of them downloaded will leave you this 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.120
 winrar file 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.670
 we give you double click extract here and you 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.859
 will leave a folder 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.909
 calls and these will be the ones who's worth 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:55.940
 this and to install it as always 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:55.940
 the elche and the editor open it 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:03.600
 we hope we give to open we will be 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:08.690
 our gta folder I have it in my 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:12.330
 desktop models and this to 3 open 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.220
 we hope and we give it here we look for where 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.950
 let's have 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.950
 and the skins here is we give 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.460
 and open I do not do it because I already have it 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:27.850
 and how I realized that you no longer 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:32.180
 record good game take photos of all 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.430
 the skis is worth here is the skin 281 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.970
 We give to establish as fund of 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.300
 screen is worth 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:45.020
 for this is a small mistake we see how 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.000
 it looks and the 280 set as background of 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.600
 screen 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.030
 the truth is that I like 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:57.189
 let's see let's choose 284 establish a 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.060
 Wallpaper on a skin 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.060
 this is a skin of 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.429
 I forgot the name 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:13.629
 worth a normal skin or this is the 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:17.350
 skin of 181 280 and 284 are elkin who 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:21.240
 replaces the 285 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.240
 here in 285 vale 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:31.340
 the skin 286 by the face and finally the 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.360
 287 set as wallpaper 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:39.410
 I like everything and good friends 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.500
 you tell me what other video you want 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.760
 what installation do you want and I will do it 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.189
 depends on the cost 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.730
 of what it costs me and good until the 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.730
