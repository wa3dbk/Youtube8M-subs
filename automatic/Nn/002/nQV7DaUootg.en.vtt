00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.660
 Game of this group 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.700
 after their botched market economy kicked off FC Berlin anyway 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.469
 no secret to focus on the relegation and that seems only 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.250
 once to go because in the last games of the league season were the 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.650
 Berliners do not recognize them, they put their faith in youth 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.779
 This concept first hit 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.300
 the Brandenburger fluctuate in the entire season so between sparkling wine and 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.570
 Selters landlord even first Bundesliga then second Bundesliga ultimately remained 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.570
 only the relegation 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.810
 The word palpation was foreign to both teams this evening 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.440
 chance 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.440
 for a few minutes in less than a minute 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.220
 the Berliner with TUI at Dieter Hennig Rehbein second striker next to for 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.860
 Here we have about 30 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.460
 the Brandenburger with Blüthmann and Schulz from the beginning for a long time and 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.330
 Jeske 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.009
 Veteran Jens Voigt was in midfield in the diversified 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:07.889
 Midfield quintet with innocent lambs lived Nitschke the 

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:09.300
 arbitration judge 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.930
 there is already 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.840
 the first good basis 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.840
 and guilt is after only 90 seconds 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.480
 the Brandenburgers begin to press without a heart 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.160
 comes then sent 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.970
 you'll see it soon. "We have Juve Schulz 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.100
 1000 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.460
 23 paying spectators 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.540
 in the Berlin Jahnsportpark 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.710
 Example that I can already say had a much larger backdrop 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.710
 deserves to wait for it 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.330
 We were there every year 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.100
 have the mosque at Bohleys hang here different 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.750
 Responsible coaches 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.140
 Jan Bolland header 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.710
 just the little Heike Bohn 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.710
 Tickets are final in the south part 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.790
 just a minute later 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.520
 After a strong initial phase of the steel world, Berliners are now getting better 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.269
 liquid combinations 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.269
 again Vögler 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.849
 Brega was one 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.179
 that Heinz 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:28.179
 beautifully played out 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:33.219
 21-year-old Kurt Rehbein during the season 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:50.469
 and the game of FCB Heiko Bonan is outstanding in these first 20 minutes 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:53.469
 nice hidden pass on reach 

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:04.499
 Istanbul is 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:07.119
 with the left leg and again 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:09.249
 yes these are great scenes 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:10.609
 in this test 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.609
 20 25 minutes 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.549
 and again the Berliners with Geithner 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:24.799
 Alba Dark to the corner 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.679
 a corner kick with consequences kicked by Pückler 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:30.679
 10 pm Tel 

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:36.039
 maybe we will see 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:41.489
 oil the life path go 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.539
 stand still 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:47.709
 obviously again in the room but also 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.329
 is beaten 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.329
 undoubtedly 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.659
 Now they want the bag too 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:04.229
 and since today he probably the durability of the 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.639
 after that, the homeowners make life difficult for themselves 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:16.889
 Attention Küchler completely unnecessary back pass 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.789
 especially for listening Fox Outreach 

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:25.059
 Heike can not be true human 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.830
 because almost the logical consequence of Chile was weak in the Berlin defense 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.020
 Kiedrich to the place of the goalkeeper 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:41.460
 2 to 1 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.509
 from the customer's point of view 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:46.840
 it stays that way for two to one 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.249
 for a break 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:53.319
 down a good 1000 spectators "say that up to a quick pace driving way 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:54.330
 really 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.430
 high class games 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.009
 how is the Stanley Cup 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:04:58.960
 and again 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.960
 to confirm the scorers 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:06.959
 female kicker Klaus Peschel the second half to a new man 

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:10.139
 come to Brannenburg confreres and also has this chance happily 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:14.110
 after only 19 seconds 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.279
 Heiko Rüger 

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:18.770
 a young man 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.770
 the rooms now bigger «People» 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:27.270
 Opener directly 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.520
 Towards the scoreboard 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.520
 you have to take the risk 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:38.779
 it remains the proposal 

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:46.319
 wrestling on the other side 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:49.319
 and he too with the risk 

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:53.979
 all those scenes from the second half to the first 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.300
 four minutes 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.360
 then a 17-year-old another young man comes in the races 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.360
 I have Kontron 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:06.279
 on the line Lindner 

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:07.860
 good scenes 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.860
 in the second half 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.020
 dribbler 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.020
 and sammer 

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:22.869
 beautiful scenes 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:26.759
 and a nice backdrop 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:30.849
 then the 72 Deloitte is running 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:34.299
 Brandenburg constantly in forward gear, the Berlin in the counter 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:44.689
 since last year 

00:06:57.719 --> 00:07:00.809
 Of course the result was huge not only with the young man 

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:02.999
 recognition 

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:06.349
 to the Brandenburgers they do not recognize Janata 

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:08.490
 capital shot 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:09.729
 everyone was loud 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:12.869
 a very good keeper at the age of 29, by the way the oldest 

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:16.960
 his young team 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.490
 The Brandenburg is normal but that was not enough today 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:25.139
 once again Helmut Roleder 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:29.599
 follows another shot of Lindner in the end wins 

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:30.740
 the better team
