there are the organic seed company seed

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.240 
there are the organic seed company seed
distributors<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.530> would<00:00:37.710> be<00:00:37.739> companies

like<00:00:38.430> seeds<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.879> change<00:00:39.440> hi<00:00:40.440> mowing<00:00:40.829> organic

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
like seeds of change hi mowing organic

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.569 
like seeds of change hi mowing organic
seeds<00:00:42.320> these<00:00:43.320> guys<00:00:43.559> are<00:00:43.739> buying<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.280> seeds

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
seeds these guys are buying the seeds

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.510 
seeds these guys are buying the seeds
from<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.360> big<00:00:45.539> guys<00:00:45.780> from<00:00:46.170> bae<00:00:46.410> ho<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.039> their

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
from the big guys from bae ho and their

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.549 
from the big guys from bae ho and their
organic<00:00:48.090> seed<00:00:48.960> divisions<00:00:49.640> so<00:00:50.840> in<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.320> seed

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
organic seed divisions so in the seed

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.090 
organic seed divisions so in the seed
industry<00:00:53.210> typically<00:00:54.320> there's<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.649> upper

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
industry typically there's this upper

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.760 
industry typically there's this upper
level<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.670> actually<00:00:57.149> breeds<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.020> grows<00:00:58.379> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
level that actually breeds and grows the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.369 
level that actually breeds and grows the
seeds<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.489> then<00:01:00.300> below<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.690> there's<00:01:01.289> a

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
seeds and then below that there's a

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.170 
seeds and then below that there's a
level<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.859> distributes<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.699> seeds<00:01:02.969> and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
level that distributes the seeds and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.420 
level that distributes the seeds and
these<00:01:03.329> are<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.570> catalog<00:01:04.019> companies<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
these are the catalog companies the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.429 
these are the catalog companies the
catalog<00:01:05.850> companies<00:01:06.330> are<00:01:06.510> buying<00:01:06.840> their<00:01:07.110> seeds

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
catalog companies are buying their seeds

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.120 
catalog companies are buying their seeds

like you sow seeds of change has its own
network<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.890> organic<00:01:44.399> growers<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.000> they've

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
network of organic growers that they've

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.929 
network of organic growers that they've
been<00:01:45.540> developing<00:01:46.140> since<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.619> early<00:01:46.890> 90s<00:01:48.439> and

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
been developing since the early 90s and

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.780 
been developing since the early 90s and
so<00:01:50.939> they<00:01:51.360> are<00:01:51.630> sourcing<00:01:52.500> their<00:01:52.710> seeds<00:01:53.130> from<00:01:53.520> in

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
so they are sourcing their seeds from in

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.020 
so they are sourcing their seeds from in
high<00:01:54.750> mowings<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.560> way<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.369> it's<00:01:56.549> fedco

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
high mowings this way and so it's fedco

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.060 
high mowings this way and so it's fedco
and<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.570> it's<00:01:57.719> johnny's<00:01:58.140> they<00:01:58.619> are<00:01:58.799> both

and so it's johnny's they are both

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.030
