00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.710
 it's the world knows but today we 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.290
 is found for the presentation of 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.090
 the Nomads bp 2001 from nike 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.559
 at the packaging level we have 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.360
 something very sober 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.920
 personally I like it a lot 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.540
 on the other hand I confess that I had a 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.990
 little trouble opening this correctly 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.640
 box 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.820
 you have to see you will be able to have 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.130
 access to a jack cable mal mal 3.5 here 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.390
 unfortunately broke a usb cable for 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.340
 charge your speaker 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.570
 note that you can also have it loaded 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.769
 with most chargers from 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.269
 android smartphones 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.949
 you will have as well on the speaker 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.899
 itself and a little manual 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.910
 of use integrally in English 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.530
 the very worked design both passes 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.120
 everywhere I like him too 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.410
 many more its size makes them 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.210
 make perfect in the near 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.010
 before a backpack so a very good 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.420
 point the favor of this enclosure you 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.100
 you doubt this little speaker 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.750
 and as many compatible bluetooth 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.309
 and has a button in the center 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.719
 intended to answer calls that 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.379
 speaker is connected to your phone 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.969
 end all 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.680
 to my regret , sometimes there was 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.270
 no button intended to change 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.949
 music no either to ride or 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.289
 to lower the sound it will have to be done at 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.699
 from your phone directly on 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.189
 will not mind him being minimalist 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.869
 given its very affordable price of 35 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.210
 euros currently and same aspect there 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.070
 you will have a very clean sound the speaker 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.960
 offers a power of 2 x 5 watts 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.250
 10 watts which will allow you to listen 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.049
 music in two large rooms 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.939
 indoors but also if you 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.500
 sings outdoors at the level of 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.180
 basins are not exceptional but 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.710
 still remains the favored 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.900
 it's not spitting at all and 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.280
 do not produce a dirty sound others to 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.720
 not push with this speaker it's 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.700
 it has a dedicated location 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.600
 to smartphones and tablets as well as a 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.280
 foot in the back to stabilize 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.110
 all when wearing these 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.310
 the autonomy of this speaker is more 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.170
 that correct since it comes very 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.310
 easily 6 hours when you 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.110
 plug in your singles for the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.790
 recharge by seeing the charge 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.439
 will light up and when the whole will be 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.850
 totally charged the light is going 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.710
 turn off to warn you 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.000
 the enclosure is not water resistant 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.500
 but they do not attack commercializes too 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.880
 a poor splash speaker that you 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.920
 can find a test in the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.630
 description to conclude this speaker 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.969
 is a very good deal since his 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.290
 price of I recalls 35 euros of 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.880
 products will therefore suit any 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.229
 what a person wanting a small 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.820
 portable speaker without 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.320
 demand standards and performance 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.000
 I hope you liked this 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.380

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.050
