00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.679 
rubber over top of it as a fire extender
and<00:01:11.240> so<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:13.400> have<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:15.000> fat<00:01:15.180> wood<00:01:15.450> right<00:01:15.630> here

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
and so I have the fat wood right here

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.010 
and so I have the fat wood right here
that<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.259> can<00:01:16.320> scrape<00:01:16.680> off<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.570> use<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.840> start

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
that I can scrape off and use to start

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.219 
that I can scrape off and use to start
fire<00:01:19.670> I've<00:01:20.670> got<00:01:20.880> duct<00:01:21.150> tape<00:01:21.390> here<00:01:21.720> for<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> knob

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
fire I've got duct tape here for a knob

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.130 
fire I've got duct tape here for a knob
and<00:01:22.610> my<00:01:23.610> Ferro<00:01:23.850> rod<00:01:23.939> now<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.479> slips<00:01:24.869> right

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
and my Ferro rod now this slips right

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.010 
and my Ferro rod now this slips right
inside<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:26.270> that's<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> way<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.600> carry

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
inside that and that's the way you carry

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.100 
inside that and that's the way you carry
it<00:01:28.430> so<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.579> actually<00:01:29.759> acts<00:01:30.450> as<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:32.780> cover<00:01:33.780> for

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110

this<00:02:01.049> cover<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:02.009> thought<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.280> was<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.520> good

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
this cover and I thought that was a good

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.839
