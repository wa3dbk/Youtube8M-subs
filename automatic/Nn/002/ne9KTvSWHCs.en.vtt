00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
very important to realize at the bottom

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.789 
very important to realize at the bottom
left<00:01:26.360> that<00:01:27.360> there's<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.750> timer<00:01:28.080> again<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.740> it

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
left that there's a timer again and it
