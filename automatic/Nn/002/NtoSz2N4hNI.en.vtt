00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.410 
hope it did so we're going to have a
tough<00:02:23.970> go<00:02:24.330> at<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.510> in<00:02:24.690> racing<00:02:25.760> but<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:27.300> know

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
tough go at it in racing but you know

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.530 
tough go at it in racing but you know
I've<00:02:27.990> been<00:02:28.170> here<00:02:28.350> two<00:02:28.530> years<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:29.120> we've<00:02:30.120> done

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
I've been here two years and we've done

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.810 
I've been here two years and we've done
really<00:02:30.810> well<00:02:31.050> in<00:02:31.320> in<00:02:31.560> freestyle<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:32.580> we're

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
really well in in freestyle so we're

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.150 
really well in in freestyle so we're
going<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.000> try<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:33.240> continue<00:02:33.600> that<00:02:33.870> trend<00:02:34.170> we

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
going to try and continue that trend we

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.740 
going to try and continue that trend we
finished<00:02:35.490> ninth<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.880> first<00:02:36.090> time<00:02:36.300> out<00:02:36.510> and

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
finished ninth the first time out and

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.190 
finished ninth the first time out and
drove<00:02:37.110> off<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.350> track<00:02:37.710> last<00:02:38.520> year<00:02:38.880> i<00:02:39.540> think<00:02:40.110> we

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
drove off the track last year i think we

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.100 
drove off the track last year i think we
tied<00:02:40.410> for<00:02:40.650> third<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:42.210> just<00:02:42.720> want<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:42.900> bump

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
tied for third so I just want to bump

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.930 
tied for third so I just want to bump
that<00:02:43.170> up<00:02:43.320> maybe<00:02:43.620> 100<00:02:44.070> two<00:02:44.160> notches<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.760> we'd

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
that up maybe 100 two notches and we'd

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.760 
that up maybe 100 two notches and we'd
be<00:02:45.090> really<00:02:45.330> happy<00:02:45.570> as<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.380> look<00:02:46.530> towards

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
be really happy as you look towards

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.860 
be really happy as you look towards
freestyle<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.430> layout<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:48.000> track<00:02:48.270> there

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
freestyle the layout of the track there

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.510 
freestyle the layout of the track there
seems<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.230> be<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.320> lot<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.560> big<00:02:49.830> obstacles<00:02:50.400> but

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
seems to be a lot of big obstacles but

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.570 
seems to be a lot of big obstacles but
there's<00:02:50.730> some<00:02:50.910> room<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.150> gain<00:02:51.570> some<00:02:51.870> speed<00:02:52.020> is

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
there's some room to gain some speed is

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.820 
there's some room to gain some speed is
