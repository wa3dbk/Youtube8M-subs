00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
but no it's actually easier and faster

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.790 
but no it's actually easier and faster
to<00:04:53.099> do<00:04:53.430> when<00:04:54.000> you<00:04:54.150> know<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:54.629> tricks<00:04:54.930> then<00:04:55.199> when

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:07.159 
and easy then I can see anything that I
can<00:05:03.960> do<00:05:04.289> faster<00:05:05.009> on<00:05:05.250> my<00:05:05.310> Mac<00:05:05.789> that<00:05:06.360> I<00:05:06.389> can<00:05:06.689> do<00:05:06.900> on

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
can do faster on my Mac that I can do on

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.230 
can do faster on my Mac that I can do on
my<00:05:07.199> iPad<00:05:07.979> it's<00:05:08.250> actually<00:05:08.729> the<00:05:08.909> other<00:05:08.939> way

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
my iPad it's actually the other way

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.839 
my iPad it's actually the other way
around<00:05:09.389> for<00:05:10.050> me<00:05:10.169> because<00:05:10.500> I've<00:05:10.919> tried<00:05:11.310> go<00:05:11.580> back

connected to each other you can do stuff

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.219 
connected to each other you can do stuff
between<00:05:48.389> them<00:05:49.699> multi<00:05:50.699> tasking<00:05:51.509> between<00:05:51.900> your

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
between them multi tasking between your

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:54.200 
between them multi tasking between your
