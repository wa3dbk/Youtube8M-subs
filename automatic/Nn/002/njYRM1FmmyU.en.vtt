00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:13.359
 and hotels 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:17.009
 This phone is Denmark kia xperia which on 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.460
 today is one of 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.890
 the most long-awaited 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.369
 selling droid smartphones from him 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.329
 large screen diagonal 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.309
 and powerful productive 

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:31.060
 CPU look 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.310
 near what is this 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.060
 what is the cute phone worth 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.890
 say that except the big diagonal 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.950
 which well and can not be called 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.410
 for the sake of note that the age but in principle occupying 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.670
 yes a lot of space and I immediately rushes to 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.719
 eyes what 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.700
 the screen is large 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.359
 the percentage is worth saying that he 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:56.189
 we had a body in the hands of the percentage of white 

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:58.229
 colors he is much prettier than 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:01.709
 phone in black percentage on 

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:05.090
 black case for plastic teams 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.290
 prominent prints here are some 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.509
 strange typo almost invisible 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.020
 that is, to notice you need 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.439
 specially here to play some tricky corner 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:15.130
 review 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.200
 phone is really whose 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.500
 pretty 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.230
 but due to the fact that a particular screen has 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.060
 he has enough brand 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.930
 are visible 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.370
 the short bill is worth saying that he 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.750
 he is thin enough 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.750
 that is, you are comfortable in the hand 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.020
 despite such large sizes 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.650
 without a doubt he 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.570
 I'll show you how he looks next to 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.810
 monty 1 97 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.350
 it is clear that the grandchildren substantially received 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.810
 thanks to its quota keyboard 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.790
 0 well, of course the size of Polina is different 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.870
 just no one 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.400
 and shelin 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.410
 and more though of course for sure 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.080
 but it means 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.870
 what else to say 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.140
 worth saying 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.540
 percent year on the front 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.319
 but here is such 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.319
 proton criticized form 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.129
 no, they won't let the planet in transparent plastic 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.870
 Hard to say but in general it's all at 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.939
 200 mb great view and we have the upper end 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.389
 there is a power button headphone jack 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:27.789
 and 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:29.959
 connector development 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.439
 micro and uzbeks 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:34.619
 and at the bottom 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:36.019
 only 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.499
 speakers 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:40.329
 at the microphone means see what he has 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:41.609
 inside 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.239
 the cap is removed like this 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.779
 very tricky 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:48.419
 percentage to the beginning and everything was afraid and 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:49.539
 to harm 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:50.959
 percent 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.859
 but we have it on communal 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:53.779
 capacity 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:55.839
 1500 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:58.259
 I have for hours 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:59.519
 and there is 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.949
 main handed to the memory card 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:04.949
 and if not blown away 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:08.369
 similar estimates of the Moscow Ring Road or k.bakiyev 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.349
 it's worth saying he 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.669
 interest 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:14.889
 battery 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.239
 blocks 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.259
 memory card that is 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:21.149
 you write it 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:23.089
 with the phone turned on resolutely 

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:26.229
 Impossible Yushchenko located module 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:29.019
 8 megapixel camera module if 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.139
 no backlight 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.769
 which basically 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.189
 does not give any special advantages 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:38.159
 most android phones give 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.159
 quality consumables 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.399
 d 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:45.269
 what else to say 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.379
 on the right side there 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.459
 key rocker to adjust cron 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.229
 bones 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.229
 and camera activation button 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.659
 that's actually 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:57.919
 more 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.719
 there is nothing to boast about 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:02.319
 consider further now we will 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.959
 go all the insides thank you 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.150
 read our tasks for attention
