plotting is not cool you got to get in

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.620 
plotting is not cool you got to get in

I mean it's it's pretty awesome now
there<00:01:56.470> are<00:01:56.620> a<00:01:56.650> couple<00:01:56.830> of<00:01:56.980> things<00:01:57.130> that<00:01:57.280> are

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
there are a couple of things that are

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.470 
there are a couple of things that are
different<00:01:57.550> that<00:01:57.850> you'll<00:01:57.970> have<00:01:58.090> to<00:01:58.150> get<00:01:58.360> used

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
different that you'll have to get used

no<00:02:13.330> idea<00:02:13.750> I'm<00:02:13.870> behind<00:02:14.170> him<00:02:14.410> so<00:02:14.920> at<00:02:15.070> low<00:02:15.250> speeds

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
no idea I'm behind him so at low speeds

powered by the electric motor

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.870 
powered by the electric motor
essentially<00:02:20.440> it<00:02:20.500> makes<00:02:20.710> very<00:02:21.220> little<00:02:21.580> if<00:02:21.700> any

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
essentially it makes very little if any

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
problem but that first time when that

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.060 
problem but that first time when that
motor<00:03:12.489> clicks<00:03:13.060> off<00:03:13.269> you're<00:03:13.540> like<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:13.930> knew<00:03:14.860> this

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
motor clicks off you're like I knew this

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.800 
motor clicks off you're like I knew this
hybrid<00:03:15.430> technology<00:03:16.060> was<00:03:16.269> no<00:03:16.420> good<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:19.720> know

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
hybrid technology was no good you know

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.930 
hybrid technology was no good you know
overall<00:03:20.140> I<00:03:20.709> think<00:03:20.890> this<00:03:21.250> is<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.430> great<00:03:21.730> little

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
overall I think this is a great little

and<00:04:53.380> it's<00:04:53.710> kind<00:04:53.889> of<00:04:53.949> odd<00:04:54.100> take<00:04:54.699> some<00:04:54.910> time

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
and it's kind of odd take some time

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.170 
and it's kind of odd take some time
getting<00:04:55.360> used<00:04:55.449> to<00:04:55.750> 50<00:04:56.470> miles<00:04:56.949> per<00:04:57.400> gallon<00:04:57.970> for

the<00:04:58.240> most<00:04:58.449> part<00:04:58.720> I<00:04:58.870> think<00:04:59.080> this<00:04:59.199> is<00:04:59.289> a<00:04:59.320> really

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
the most part I think this is a really

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.730 
the most part I think this is a really
solid<00:04:59.860> durable<00:05:00.460> and<00:05:01.060> well<00:05:01.479> composed<00:05:01.990> interior

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
but I have to give it a thumbs up so

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.879 
but I have to give it a thumbs up so
there<00:05:07.449> you<00:05:07.570> have<00:05:07.600> it<00:05:07.750> another<00:05:08.229> honest<00:05:08.680> Auto
