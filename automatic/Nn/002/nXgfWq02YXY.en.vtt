00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
this is you don't this is a set of

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.779 
this is you don't this is a set of
calipers<00:04:42.900> backwards<00:04:43.900> rednecks<00:04:44.469> like<00:04:44.740> us<00:04:45.039> who

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
calipers backwards rednecks like us who

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:47.310 
calipers backwards rednecks like us who
don't<00:04:46.060> have<00:04:46.360> all<00:04:46.599> the<00:04:46.750> tools<00:04:46.900> in<00:04:47.200> the<00:04:47.289> world

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
don't have all the tools in the world

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.779 
don't have all the tools in the world
this<00:04:48.310> is<00:04:48.460> a<00:04:48.490> caliper<00:04:50.310> it's<00:04:51.310> a<00:04:51.430> two-piece

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
this is a caliper it's a two-piece

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:53.670 
this is a caliper it's a two-piece
caliper<00:04:52.300> you<00:04:52.419> need<00:04:52.599> a<00:04:52.630> ruler<00:04:53.050> and<00:04:53.260> a<00:04:53.469> crescent

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
caliper you need a ruler and a crescent

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.550 
caliper you need a ruler and a crescent
match<00:04:54.390> let<00:04:55.390> me<00:04:55.479> show<00:04:55.719> you<00:04:55.780> I'm<00:04:56.080> gonna<00:04:56.169> slip

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
match let me show you I'm gonna slip

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.880 
match let me show you I'm gonna slip
this<00:04:56.770> crescent<00:04:57.580> wrench<00:04:57.669> on<00:04:57.940> this<00:04:58.120> bar<00:04:58.890> nice

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
this crescent wrench on this bar nice

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.070 
this crescent wrench on this bar nice
and<00:05:00.099> tight<00:05:00.570> then<00:05:01.570> I'm<00:05:01.659> going<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:01.870> show<00:05:02.050> you

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
and tight then I'm going to show you

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:08.520 
and tight then I'm going to show you
that<00:05:04.050> that<00:05:05.050> measures<00:05:05.500> clearly<00:05:06.039> one<00:05:06.849> inch<00:05:07.530> okay

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
that that measures clearly one inch okay

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.750 
that that measures clearly one inch okay
now<00:05:09.219> as<00:05:09.460> I<00:05:10.210> slide<00:05:10.719> my<00:05:10.860> redneck<00:05:11.860> caliper<00:05:12.520> down

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
now as I slide my redneck caliper down

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.589 
now as I slide my redneck caliper down
the<00:05:13.030> tube<00:05:14.070> look<00:05:15.070> how<00:05:15.219> loose<00:05:15.490> it<00:05:15.729> gets<00:05:16.000> on<00:05:16.539> the

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
the tube look how loose it gets on the

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:20.550 
the tube look how loose it gets on the
end<00:05:16.990> so<00:05:17.860> now<00:05:18.099> I'm<00:05:18.430> going<00:05:18.820> to<00:05:19.000> recalibrate<00:05:19.930> the

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
end so now I'm going to recalibrate the

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.209 
end so now I'm going to recalibrate the
diameter<00:05:21.219> of<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:21.880> bar<00:05:22.090> and<00:05:22.740> show<00:05:23.740> you<00:05:23.800> clearly

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:26.219 
diameter of the bar and show you clearly

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:30.659 
diameter of the bar and show you clearly
that<00:05:27.219> it<00:05:27.550> is<00:05:27.820> 7/8<00:05:28.510> of<00:05:28.690> an<00:05:28.810> inch<00:05:29.280> okay

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
that it is 7/8 of an inch okay

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:37.459 
that it is 7/8 of an inch okay
so<00:05:32.640> the<00:05:33.640> result<00:05:34.090> of<00:05:34.389> our<00:05:35.110> study<00:05:36.120> shows<00:05:37.120> that

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:37.469 
so the result of our study shows that

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:42.110 
so the result of our study shows that
one<00:05:38.469> of<00:05:38.500> two<00:05:38.770> things<00:05:38.979> either<00:05:39.820> my<00:05:40.300> original

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
one of two things either my original

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.879 
one of two things either my original
hypothesis<00:05:43.120> on<00:05:43.300> this<00:05:43.570> frame<00:05:43.900> is<00:05:44.169> correct<00:05:44.560> that

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
hypothesis on this frame is correct that

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.820 
hypothesis on this frame is correct that
this<00:05:45.099> is<00:05:45.280> an<00:05:45.430> early<00:05:45.700> 37<00:05:46.479> frame<00:05:46.719> when<00:05:47.560> it<00:05:47.680> was

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
this is an early 37 frame when it was

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.830 
this is an early 37 frame when it was
sent<00:05:48.159> back<00:05:48.340> to<00:05:48.610> Harley<00:05:49.030> whether<00:05:49.300> this<00:05:49.570> whole

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
sent back to Harley whether this whole

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.810 
sent back to Harley whether this whole
thing<00:05:50.139> was<00:05:50.349> bent<00:05:50.650> or<00:05:50.950> Harley<00:05:51.310> just<00:05:51.460> did<00:05:51.700> the

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
thing was bent or Harley just did the

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.690 
thing was bent or Harley just did the
upgrade<00:05:52.270> Harley<00:05:53.260> Davidson<00:05:53.770> had<00:05:53.979> some<00:05:54.400> tubes

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
upgrade Harley Davidson had some tubes

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.649 
upgrade Harley Davidson had some tubes
made<00:05:55.180> that<00:05:55.960> were<00:05:56.110> 1<00:05:56.409> inch<00:05:56.650> on<00:05:56.860> this<00:05:57.070> end<00:05:57.450> 7/8<00:05:58.450> on

either they did that as an upgrade or

either they did that as an upgrade or
perhaps<00:06:09.969> we<00:06:10.570> have<00:06:10.750> discovered<00:06:11.229> the<00:06:12.000> type<00:06:13.000> for

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
using the 7/8 inch neck they started

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.830 
using the 7/8 inch neck they started
experimenting<00:06:21.219> with<00:06:21.760> a<00:06:21.789> 1<00:06:22.060> inch<00:06:22.240> bar<00:06:22.510> and<00:06:22.719> they

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
experimenting with a 1 inch bar and they

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.219 
experimenting with a 1 inch bar and they
made<00:06:23.139> some<00:06:23.169> tubes<00:06:24.210> that<00:06:25.210> tapered<00:06:25.660> down<00:06:25.810> from

right here on these welds I took some of
the<00:06:47.770> paint<00:06:47.980> off<00:06:48.130> you<00:06:48.310> got<00:06:48.430> some<00:06:48.610> paint<00:06:48.850> damage

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
the paint off you got some paint damage

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.850 
the paint off you got some paint damage
from<00:06:49.420> a<00:06:49.540> fuel<00:06:49.780> leak<00:06:49.960> here<00:06:50.260> but<00:06:50.410> I<00:06:50.440> took<00:06:50.500> some<00:06:50.680> of

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:50.860 
from a fuel leak here but I took some of

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.680 
from a fuel leak here but I took some of
the<00:06:50.980> paint<00:06:51.190> off<00:06:51.370> and<00:06:51.550> I<00:06:51.640> filed<00:06:52.030> on<00:06:52.360> the<00:06:52.480> weld

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:52.690 
the paint off and I filed on the weld

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.470 
the paint off and I filed on the weld
this<00:06:53.350> is<00:06:53.530> definitely<00:06:53.830> a<00:06:54.010> steel<00:06:54.550> weld<00:06:54.910> this<00:06:55.300> is

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:55.480

some light on it these welds are not

some light on it these welds are not
real<00:07:18.010> pretty<00:07:18.340> so<00:07:19.240> I'm<00:07:19.660> gonna<00:07:19.840> guess<00:07:20.200> that

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:20.580 
real pretty so I'm gonna guess that

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.950 
real pretty so I'm gonna guess that
Harley<00:07:21.580> maybe<00:07:21.790> just<00:07:22.150> got<00:07:22.300> the<00:07:22.510> welder<00:07:22.720> or

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 
Harley maybe just got the welder or

maybe the guy on the welder was you know

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.500 
maybe the guy on the welder was you know
fairly<00:07:26.500> new<00:07:26.830> but<00:07:27.610> those<00:07:27.790> are<00:07:27.910> not<00:07:27.970> pretty

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:28.510 
fairly new but those are not pretty

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:32.550 
fairly new but those are not pretty
perfect<00:07:29.140> beads<00:07:29.380> those<00:07:29.860> are<00:07:30.160> those<00:07:31.150> are<00:07:31.560> rough

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560
