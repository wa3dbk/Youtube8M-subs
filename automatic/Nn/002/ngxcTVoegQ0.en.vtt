00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.150

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.830
 go paot hd pvr rocket many of you 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.990
 you ask me how do I record my 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.730
 gameplays good then what better than this 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.680
 video to show the new features 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.680
 of this capturing and so maybe a 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.150
 day you decide for it because I think it 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.179
 It's time to go to our table for a 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.920
 boxing and start what seems to you there 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.770
 we go 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.470
 Well here we have the new hauppauge hd 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.810
 pvr rock is a portable capturer of 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.340
 very small size and with a lot of 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.470
 new functions that will allow us 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.809
 improve the quality of our gameplays 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.989
 and that will also give us many facilities 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.540
 it fits to say that it serves for pc for xbox 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.510
 360 for xbox one for playstation 3 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.460
 playstation 4 i will you let's start 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.830
 watching the capturing and the reduced 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.739
 size that has to be good I must say 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.050
 that in my tiny hands it seems that 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.270
 be bigger than it is but that's why 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.370
 I'm going to put a picture where we compare and 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.940
 we see the difference in size of the 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.460
 previous pvr 2 and the current rocker is 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.210
 note and now we will see all 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.610
 connections 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.350
 we have a microphone input what 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.290
 which means that we can record the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.210
 sound directly to the grabber and a 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.250
 usb connector that allows us to record the 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.070
 gameplays without having a pc 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.740
 near the back we have the 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.780
 usb that connects to the pc or the console in 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.450
 the case that we do not have pc for 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.760
 capture and the video input that we 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.550
 will serve to connect a playstation 3 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.100
 components since this console has 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.740
 layer of the hdmi capture and as some 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.540
 you know and if not, well I tell you and I 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.750
 finally we have an exit and a 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.460
 hdmi input we also have the button that 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.400
 we must press to start the capture 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.310
 of video let's go to the wiring on one side 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.130
 we have the usb cable that in the case of 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.350
 that we connect the console will be the cable 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.990
 red or color connector 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.510
 red and for the pc it will be the black one 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.150
 as you can see, the captor includes 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.160
 a small microphone that also has 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.960
 a clip of these so cute for 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.510
 catch you there the micro to the shirt and 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.250
 you know the following cable is only 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.560
 to connect a playstation 3 by 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.530
 components that as you can see has a 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.110
 special connector this cable is also 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.510
 only for playstation3 and is the one 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.760
 goes from the captor to the 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.440
 previous cable components and 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.500
 obviously we also have an HDMI cable 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.100

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.630

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.470
 The most important functions are the 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.390
 following 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.130
 you do not need a pc to capture video 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.290

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.070
 It has a built-in microphone for 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.630

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.060
 directly with your software house 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.620
 capture in addition this software incorporates 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.930
 a section for video editing where 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.000

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.740
