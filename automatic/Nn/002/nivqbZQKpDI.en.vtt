when<00:00:00.870> using<00:00:01.020> your<00:00:01.260> screen<00:00:01.469> printing

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
when using your screen printing

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.290 
when using your screen printing
chemicals<00:00:02.100> one<00:00:02.370> thing<00:00:02.669> that<00:00:02.850> screen<00:00:03.030> printers

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
chemicals one thing that screen printers

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.329 
chemicals one thing that screen printers
sometimes<00:00:03.720> forget<00:00:03.990> to<00:00:04.020> realize<00:00:04.500> is<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:05.040> fact

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
sometimes forget to realize is the fact

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.860 
sometimes forget to realize is the fact
that<00:00:05.460> you<00:00:05.609> can<00:00:05.759> actually<00:00:06.240> take<00:00:06.509> most

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
that you can actually take most

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.990 
that you can actually take most
chemicals<00:00:07.440> and<00:00:07.649> reduce<00:00:08.340> them<00:00:08.610> down<00:00:08.639> with

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
chemicals and reduce them down with

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.419 
chemicals and reduce them down with
water<00:00:09.240> we're<00:00:10.170> going<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.349> use<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.769> example<00:00:11.250> of

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
water we're going to use the example of

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.430 
water we're going to use the example of
neutralized<00:00:12.240> screen<00:00:12.509> printing<00:00:12.780> degreaser<00:00:13.230> a

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
neutralized screen printing degreaser a

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.259 
neutralized screen printing degreaser a
screen<00:00:13.980> frame<00:00:14.190> fabric<00:00:14.460> degreaser<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.179> then

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
screen frame fabric degreaser and then

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.630 
screen frame fabric degreaser and then
also<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.630> r35<00:00:16.470> emulsion<00:00:16.980> remover

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
also a r35 emulsion remover

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.550 
also a r35 emulsion remover
now<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.150> labels<00:00:18.690> typically<00:00:18.960> will<00:00:19.109> say<00:00:19.260> what

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
now the labels typically will say what

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.290 
now the labels typically will say what
you<00:00:19.710> can<00:00:19.890> reduce<00:00:20.130> them<00:00:20.369> down<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.699> four<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.090> for

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
you can reduce them down to four so for

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.429 
you can reduce them down to four so for
instance<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.720> can<00:00:21.869> be<00:00:21.960> reduced

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
instance this can be reduced

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.980 
instance this can be reduced
ten<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.160> one<00:00:23.189> with<00:00:23.640> water<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.570> think<00:00:24.779> about

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
ten to one with water so think about

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.370 
ten to one with water so think about
using<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:25.560> one<00:00:26.340> part<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.240> one<00:00:27.449> part<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.960> how

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
using this one part to one part and how

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.109 
using this one part to one part and how
much<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.769> would<00:00:28.859> cost<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.220> versus<00:00:29.550> reducing

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
much that would cost you versus reducing

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.510 
much that would cost you versus reducing
it<00:00:30.240> down<00:00:30.599> by<00:00:30.810> ten<00:00:31.109> we're<00:00:31.890> going<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.189> do<00:00:32.340> an

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
it down by ten we're going to do an

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.639 
it down by ten we're going to do an
example<00:00:32.940> right<00:00:33.300> now<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.540> showing<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.410> use

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
example right now of showing that in use

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.590 
example right now of showing that in use
so<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:34.890> have<00:00:35.100> two<00:00:35.280> screens<00:00:35.460> here<00:00:35.940> I'm<00:00:36.239> gonna<00:00:36.450> get

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
so I have two screens here I'm gonna get

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.770 
so I have two screens here I'm gonna get
these<00:00:36.780> screens<00:00:37.140> wet<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:38.129> then<00:00:38.730> degree<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:41.780> you

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
these screens wet and then degree so you

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.209 
these screens wet and then degree so you
got<00:00:42.960> them<00:00:43.050> wet<00:00:43.260> now<00:00:43.440> I'm<00:00:43.590> gonna<00:00:43.829> spray<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
got them wet now I'm gonna spray the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.639 
got them wet now I'm gonna spray the
first<00:00:44.460> screen<00:00:44.850> with<00:00:45.570> pure<00:00:45.989> degreaser<00:00:46.530> I'm

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
first screen with pure degreaser I'm

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.799 
first screen with pure degreaser I'm
gonna<00:00:46.800> take<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.280> spray<00:00:47.700> bottle<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.329> if<00:00:48.719> you're

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
gonna take a spray bottle and if you're

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.119 
gonna take a spray bottle and if you're
gonna<00:00:48.930> be<00:00:49.079> reducing<00:00:49.530> products<00:00:49.980> you're<00:00:50.070> going

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
gonna be reducing products you're going

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.670 
gonna be reducing products you're going
to<00:00:50.250> want<00:00:50.579> plenty<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.480> spray<00:00:51.750> bottles<00:00:52.140> on<00:00:52.320> hand

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
to want plenty of spray bottles on hand

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.350 
to want plenty of spray bottles on hand
because<00:00:53.010> without<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.879> spray<00:00:54.059> bottles<00:00:54.300> you

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
because without the spray bottles you

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.790 
because without the spray bottles you
won't<00:00:54.510> have<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.809> ability<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.170> reduce<00:00:55.590> them

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
won't have the ability to reduce them

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.279 
won't have the ability to reduce them
down<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.789> I'm<00:00:56.850> going<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.030> spray<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
down so I'm going to spray this on the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:05.210 
down so I'm going to spray this on the
first<00:00:58.590> screen<00:01:03.409> it's<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.680> couple<00:01:04.860> squirts

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
first screen it's just a couple squirts

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.340 
first screen it's just a couple squirts
right<00:01:05.369> there<00:01:05.670> now<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> degreaser<00:01:06.869> typically

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
right there now a degreaser typically

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.620 
right there now a degreaser typically
goes<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> long<00:01:07.799> ways<00:01:08.070> anyway<00:01:08.549> well<00:01:09.420> then<00:01:09.540> I'm

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
goes a long ways anyway well then I'm

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.270 
goes a long ways anyway well then I'm
going<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.810> take<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.740> I'm<00:01:11.040> going<00:01:11.250> to

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
going to take this and I'm going to

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.820 
going to take this and I'm going to
reduce<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.939> one<00:01:12.000> down<00:01:12.450> going<00:01:12.869> ten<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.650> one

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
reduce this one down going ten to one

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.530 
reduce this one down going ten to one
with<00:01:14.100> water<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.880> fact<00:01:15.030> I'm<00:01:15.240> going<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.420> get<00:01:15.509> a

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
with water in fact I'm going to get a

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.420 
with water in fact I'm going to get a
little<00:01:15.689> bit<00:01:15.869> more<00:01:16.320> than<00:01:16.560> ten<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.009> one<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.340> I'm

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
little bit more than ten to one so I'm

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.980 
little bit more than ten to one so I'm
going<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.580> take<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.240> just<00:01:18.630> with<00:01:18.960> a

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
going to take this and just with a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.440 
going to take this and just with a
little<00:01:19.470> bit<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.830> bottom<00:01:20.159> I'll<00:01:21.090> take<00:01:21.270> that

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
little bit in the bottom I'll take that

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.749 
little bit in the bottom I'll take that
I'm<00:01:21.720> gonna<00:01:22.320> fill<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.770> entire<00:01:23.189> rest<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
I'm gonna fill the entire rest of the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:33.200 
I'm gonna fill the entire rest of the
bottle<00:01:24.119> up<00:01:29.150> alright<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:31.759> put<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.820> brand<00:01:33.119> new

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
bottle up alright so put a brand new

bottle up alright so put a brand new
nozzle<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.159> now<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.340> reduced<00:01:35.820> down

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
nozzle on that now this is reduced down

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.480 
nozzle on that now this is reduced down
drastically<00:01:36.680> let's<00:01:37.680> spray<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> couple<00:01:38.130> squirts

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
drastically let's spray a couple squirts

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.139 
drastically let's spray a couple squirts
on<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:38.820> guy<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.470> we'll<00:01:40.470> scrub<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.979> around<00:01:44.149> so

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
about four squirts on each one take our

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.219 
about four squirts on each one take our
scrub<00:01:48.180> brush<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:51.420> can<00:01:51.540> see<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.869> one<00:01:52.079> I'm

suds on it than this screen right here
what<00:02:05.259> they<00:02:05.350> concentrate<00:02:05.950> so<00:02:06.549> obviously<00:02:06.819> as

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939

good of a job as this one this one were
much<00:02:11.650> more<00:02:11.860> cost-effective<00:02:12.489> in<00:02:12.879> the<00:02:12.940> usage<00:02:13.420> of

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
much more cost-effective in the usage of

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.839 
much more cost-effective in the usage of
our<00:02:13.750> chemical<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:15.280> next<00:02:15.519> product<00:02:15.670> we're

our chemical the next product we're
going<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.030> demonstrate<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.510> dilution<00:02:16.959> of<00:02:17.080> is

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
going to demonstrate the dilution of is

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.800 
going to demonstrate the dilution of is
er<00:02:17.980> 35<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.670> moles<00:02:18.910> remember<00:02:19.330> this<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.660> most

moles remembers that round it sells this

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.680 
moles remembers that round it sells this
product<00:02:23.830> most<00:02:24.760> of<00:02:24.879> the<00:02:24.940> time<00:02:25.150> is<00:02:25.299> used<00:02:25.510> right

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
product most of the time is used right

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.330 
product most of the time is used right
out<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:25.989> bottle<00:02:26.260> but<00:02:26.410> can<00:02:26.590> actually<00:02:26.799> be

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
out of the bottle but can actually be

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.300 
out of the bottle but can actually be
diluted<00:02:27.760> once<00:02:27.910> again<00:02:28.120> ten<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.720> one<00:02:28.989> so<00:02:29.310> what

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
diluted once again ten to one so what

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.710 
diluted once again ten to one so what
we're<00:02:30.400> gonna<00:02:30.489> do<00:02:30.760> is<00:02:30.880> we're<00:02:31.060> going<00:02:31.269> to<00:02:31.450> demo

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.539 
screen reclaims is a lot of how well it
was<00:03:34.750> exposed<00:03:35.109> the<00:03:35.230> beginning<00:03:35.590> basically<00:03:36.069> if

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
was exposed the beginning basically if

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.339 
was exposed the beginning basically if
you're<00:03:36.730> under<00:03:37.000> exposing<00:03:37.510> your<00:03:37.630> screens<00:03:37.959> that

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
you're under exposing your screens that

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:39.900 
you're under exposing your screens that
they're<00:03:38.530> coming<00:03:38.799> out<00:03:38.919> slimy<00:03:39.280> they're<00:03:39.819> gonna

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
they're coming out slimy they're gonna

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.430 
they're coming out slimy they're gonna
absorb<00:03:40.359> chemical<00:03:40.900> they're<00:03:41.139> gonna<00:03:41.230> a<00:03:41.319> little

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
absorb chemical they're gonna a little

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.589 
absorb chemical they're gonna a little
chemically<00:03:41.919> lock<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.549> be<00:03:42.880> much<00:03:43.060> harder<00:03:43.389> and

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
chemically lock and be much harder and

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:44.940 
chemically lock and be much harder and
more<00:03:43.720> difficult<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:44.139> reclaim<00:03:44.440> than<00:03:44.919> a

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
more difficult to reclaim than a

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.680 
more difficult to reclaim than a
properly<00:03:45.459> exposed<00:03:45.849> screen<00:03:46.060> so<00:03:46.180> a<00:03:46.239> properly

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
properly exposed screen so a properly

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.170 
properly exposed screen so a properly
exposed<00:03:47.049> screen<00:03:47.349> is<00:03:47.500> very<00:03:48.310> important<00:03:48.790> in<00:03:48.940> the

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
exposed screen is very important in the

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.670 
exposed screen is very important in the
ease<00:03:49.389> of<00:03:49.690> use<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.019> I<00:03:50.079> think<00:03:50.290> one<00:03:50.530> of<00:03:50.560> the

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
ease of use and I think one of the

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.620 
ease of use and I think one of the
reasons<00:03:51.069> why<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.280> lot<00:03:51.400> of<00:03:51.669> screen<00:03:51.880> printers<00:03:52.150> try

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
reasons why a lot of screen printers try

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.300 
reasons why a lot of screen printers try
to<00:03:52.690> get<00:03:52.959> more<00:03:53.109> powerful<00:03:53.500> chemicals<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:54.190> don't

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
to get more powerful chemicals and don't

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.589 
to get more powerful chemicals and don't
dilute<00:03:54.609> them<00:03:54.790> it's<00:03:55.180> because<00:03:55.239> they're<00:03:55.450> not

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
dilute them it's because they're not

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.420 
dilute them it's because they're not
beginning<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.500> process<00:03:56.889> with<00:03:56.980> a<00:03:57.040> properly

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
beginning the process with a properly

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.680 
beginning the process with a properly
exposed<00:03:57.819> screen<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:58.329> they<00:03:58.389> feel<00:03:58.540> they<00:03:58.660> need

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
exposed screen and they feel they need

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.870 
exposed screen and they feel they need
more<00:03:58.989> power<00:03:59.200> to<00:03:59.560> actually<00:03:59.829> blow<00:04:00.010> it<00:04:00.130> out<00:04:00.220> so

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
more power to actually blow it out so

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.459 
more power to actually blow it out so
let's<00:04:01.030> take<00:04:01.239> this<00:04:01.389> and<00:04:01.659> spray<00:04:01.900> it<00:04:02.019> on<00:04:02.140> here<00:04:02.439> and

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:02.469 
let's take this and spray it on here and

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:05.339 
let's take this and spray it on here and
then<00:04:02.650> at<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.670> same<00:04:03.879> time<00:04:03.939> let's<00:04:04.840> take<00:04:05.110> the

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
then at the same time let's take the

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.650 
then at the same time let's take the
concentrate<00:04:05.950> and<00:04:06.099> spray<00:04:06.430> that<00:04:06.459> on<00:04:06.879> this

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
concentrate and spray that on this

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.860 
concentrate and spray that on this
and<00:04:08.080> so<00:04:08.320> we'll<00:04:08.500> start<00:04:08.620> with<00:04:08.980> this<00:04:09.730> one<00:04:09.840> kind<00:04:10.840> of

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
and so we'll start with this one kind of

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.570 
and so we'll start with this one kind of
sprayed<00:04:11.170> over<00:04:11.320> now<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:11.980> way<00:04:12.250> this<00:04:12.430> is

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
sprayed over now the way this is

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.370 
sprayed over now the way this is
typically<00:04:13.060> done<00:04:13.090> is<00:04:13.510> it's<00:04:13.720> sprayed<00:04:14.020> on<00:04:14.170> both

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
typically done is it's sprayed on both

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.310 
typically done is it's sprayed on both
sides<00:04:14.740> and<00:04:15.130> then<00:04:15.970> scrubbed<00:04:16.630> this<00:04:17.470> rubber<00:04:19.320> and

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
sides and then scrubbed this rubber and

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.780 
sides and then scrubbed this rubber and
we'll<00:04:20.530> scrub<00:04:20.860> this<00:04:21.070> screen<00:04:21.400> first<00:04:22.530> and<00:04:23.790> then

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
we'll scrub this screen first and then

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.490 
we'll scrub this screen first and then
this<00:04:24.940> screen<00:04:25.120> second<00:04:25.630> so<00:04:25.750> let's<00:04:25.870> scrub<00:04:26.290> this

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
this screen second so let's scrub this

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:41.190 
this screen second so let's scrub this
one<00:04:26.710> now<00:04:31.830> go<00:04:39.030> now<00:04:40.030> I<00:04:40.060> can<00:04:40.480> tell<00:04:40.660> this<00:04:40.840> screen

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
one now go now I can tell this screen

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.630 
one now go now I can tell this screen
was<00:04:41.470> actually<00:04:41.830> a<00:04:41.860> little<00:04:42.220> bit<00:04:42.400> underexposed

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
was actually a little bit underexposed

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.890 
was actually a little bit underexposed
as<00:04:43.300> well<00:04:43.510> so<00:04:45.120> now<00:04:46.120> let's<00:04:46.330> take<00:04:46.450> our<00:04:46.630> scrub

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
as well so now let's take our scrub

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:56.050 
as well so now let's take our scrub
brush

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:04.640 

see<00:04:57.060> that<00:04:57.210> emulsion<00:04:57.569> degree<00:04:58.310> nicely<00:05:03.469> do<00:05:04.469> the

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
see that emulsion degree nicely do the

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:12.800 
see that emulsion degree nicely do the
same<00:05:04.889> thing<00:05:05.129> on<00:05:05.250> the<00:05:05.340> back<00:05:05.520> here<00:05:11.780> seen<00:05:12.780> the

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
same thing on the back here seen the

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.300 
same thing on the back here seen the
mole<00:05:13.020> degree<00:05:13.289> night<00:05:13.560> so<00:05:13.770> now<00:05:13.889> let's<00:05:14.039> do<00:05:14.189> this

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
mole degree night so now let's do this

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.010 
mole degree night so now let's do this
one

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.390 

so<00:05:21.020> now<00:05:21.199> let's<00:05:21.439> bust<00:05:21.710> them<00:05:21.919> out<00:05:22.099> with<00:05:22.370> a

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
so now let's bust them out with a

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.420 
so now let's bust them out with a
pressure<00:05:22.759> washer

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.640 

start<00:05:28.430> with<00:05:28.550> this<00:05:28.699> one<00:05:28.909> first

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
start with this one first

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:40.980 
start with this one first
should<00:05:30.650> we<00:05:30.740> got<00:05:30.860> enough<00:05:31.039> power<00:05:31.249> going<00:05:31.610> there

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.360 

obviously<00:05:41.990> that's<00:05:42.110> reclaiming<00:05:42.650> extremely

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
obviously that's reclaiming extremely

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:51.500 
obviously that's reclaiming extremely
well

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:06:10.330 

that<00:05:52.230> was<00:05:52.350> done

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.530 

this<00:06:11.340> wasn't<00:06:11.550> the<00:06:11.700> most<00:06:11.850> fair<00:06:12.060> comparison

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
this wasn't the most fair comparison

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.940 
this wasn't the most fair comparison
because<00:06:12.570> this<00:06:12.810> actually<00:06:13.140> was<00:06:13.260> built<00:06:13.500> up<00:06:13.710> right

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
because this actually was built up right

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.400 
because this actually was built up right
here<00:06:14.130> for<00:06:14.190> a<00:06:14.430> white<00:06:14.700> print<00:06:15.240> but<00:06:16.020> you<00:06:16.110> can<00:06:16.230> see

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
here for a white print but you can see

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:17.690 
here for a white print but you can see
right<00:06:16.590> here<00:06:16.620> it's<00:06:16.890> reclining<00:06:17.340> well<00:06:17.490> on<00:06:17.580> the

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700 
right here it's reclining well on the

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:31.490 
right here it's reclining well on the
edges<00:06:18.060> where<00:06:18.270> there<00:06:18.540> wasn't<00:06:18.840> more<00:06:19.140> more<00:06:19.410> than

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.770 

so<00:06:32.500> what<00:06:32.590> do<00:06:32.650> we<00:06:32.710> learn<00:06:33.210> we<00:06:34.210> learn<00:06:34.240> that<00:06:34.599> this

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
so what do we learn we learn that this

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.570 
so what do we learn we learn that this
screen<00:06:35.139> it<00:06:35.590> was<00:06:35.740> slightly<00:06:35.979> underexposed

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
screen it was slightly underexposed

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.890 
screen it was slightly underexposed
probably<00:06:36.970> due<00:06:37.060> to<00:06:37.090> the<00:06:37.300> thickness<00:06:37.660> of<00:06:37.780> the

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900 
probably due to the thickness of the

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.230 
probably due to the thickness of the
emulsion<00:06:38.250> versus<00:06:39.250> this<00:06:39.460> screen<00:06:39.729> was<00:06:39.940> actually

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
emulsion versus this screen was actually

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.439 
emulsion versus this screen was actually
harder<00:06:40.660> to<00:06:40.690> reclaim<00:06:41.130> with<00:06:42.130> a<00:06:42.460> concentrated

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:43.449 
harder to reclaim with a concentrated

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:46.110 
harder to reclaim with a concentrated
this<00:06:43.900> one<00:06:44.110> reclaimed<00:06:44.470> very<00:06:44.889> nicely<00:06:45.160> with<00:06:46.090> a

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120 
this one reclaimed very nicely with a
