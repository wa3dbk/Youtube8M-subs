00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
away from the skateboard grip tape

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.810 
away from the skateboard grip tape
because<00:00:16.560> it's<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:16.800> coarse<00:00:17.100> it<00:00:17.250> rips<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.490> pants

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
because it's so coarse it rips the pants

don't necessarily recommend it for your
average<00:00:32.040> street<00:00:32.430> rider<00:00:32.610> because<00:00:32.969> you're

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.200 

so<00:00:45.540> up<00:00:45.630> top<00:00:45.840> here<00:00:46.730> what<00:00:47.730> I've<00:00:47.820> done<00:00:48.000> is

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
so up top here what I've done is

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.900 
so up top here what I've done is
traditionally<00:00:48.840> with<00:00:48.990> the<00:00:49.080> 636<00:00:49.700> the<00:00:50.700> with<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
traditionally with the 636 the with the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.160 
traditionally with the 636 the with the
stock<00:00:51.090> clip<00:00:51.330> bonds<00:00:51.510> there<00:00:51.720> underneath<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
stock clip bonds there underneath the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.010 
stock clip bonds there underneath the
triple<00:00:52.470> tree<00:00:52.650> and<00:00:52.860> they're<00:00:53.730> angled<00:00:54.600> down<00:00:54.780> and

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
triple tree and they're angled down and

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.200 
triple tree and they're angled down and
turned<00:00:55.200> real<00:00:55.440> far<00:00:55.650> inwards<00:00:55.980> for<00:00:56.970> my

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
turned real far inwards for my

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.030 
turned real far inwards for my
competition<00:00:57.510> bike<00:00:57.900> just<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.650> get<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.830> little

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
competition bike just to get a little

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.350 
competition bike just to get a little
extra<00:00:59.190> clearance<00:00:59.520> what<00:00:59.760> I've<00:00:59.850> done<00:00:59.970> is<00:01:00.210> I

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
extra clearance what I've done is I

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.660 
extra clearance what I've done is I
bought<00:01:00.570> aftermarket<00:01:01.110> clip<00:01:01.320> ons<00:01:01.470> and<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:02.460> put

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
bought aftermarket clip ons and I put

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.430 
bought aftermarket clip ons and I put
them<00:01:02.790> on<00:01:03.000> top<00:01:03.360> by<00:01:03.600> lowering<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> front<00:01:04.230> end<00:01:04.350> a

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
them on top by lowering the front end a

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.990 
them on top by lowering the front end a
little<00:01:04.530> bit<00:01:04.680> which<00:01:05.250> also<00:01:05.489> helps<00:01:05.700> for<00:01:05.760> some

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
little bit which also helps for some

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.970 
little bit which also helps for some
burnouts<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.600> some<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.870> other<00:01:06.990> some<00:01:07.950> of

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980 
burnouts and some of the other some of

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.080 
burnouts and some of the other some of
the<00:01:08.100> tricks<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.370> we<00:01:08.490> do<00:01:08.610> have<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:08.910> the<00:01:08.940> lower

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
the tricks that we do have in the lower

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.940 
the tricks that we do have in the lower
front<00:01:09.360> end<00:01:09.480> is<00:01:09.540> actually<00:01:09.660> an<00:01:09.870> advantage<00:01:09.990> I've

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
front end is actually an advantage I've

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.260 
front end is actually an advantage I've
done<00:01:11.190> that<00:01:11.340> place<00:01:11.670> them<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:11.910> top<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
done that place them on top of the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.180 
done that place them on top of the
triple<00:01:12.540> tree<00:01:12.690> here<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.080> actually<00:01:13.950> instead<00:01:14.070> of

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
triple tree here and actually instead of

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.430 
triple tree here and actually instead of
being<00:01:14.280> angled<00:01:15.030> down<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.210> flipped<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.900> side<00:01:16.110> so

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
being angled down I flipped the side so

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.359 
being angled down I flipped the side so
the<00:01:16.500> left<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.830> on<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:16.950> right<00:01:17.190> and

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
the left is on the right and

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.400 
the left is on the right and
corresponding<00:01:18.090> for<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.330> other<00:01:18.900> side<00:01:19.170> and

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
corresponding for the other side and

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.050 
corresponding for the other side and
they're<00:01:19.770> angled<00:01:20.100> up<00:01:20.220> just<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.490> little<00:01:20.729> bit<00:01:20.880> and

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
they're angled up just a little bit and

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.180 
they're angled up just a little bit and
that<00:01:21.240> gives<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.800> pretty<00:01:22.800> much<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:23.100> a

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
that gives you pretty much just a

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.440 
that gives you pretty much just a
leverage<00:01:23.490> advantage<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.000> when<00:01:24.119> you're<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.300> top

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
leverage advantage so when you're on top

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.450 
leverage advantage so when you're on top
of<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.690> bike<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.080> you're<00:01:25.860> working<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.310> and

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
of the bike and you're working it and

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.410 
of the bike and you're working it and
you're<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.759> wheelie<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.090> you're<00:01:27.270> really

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
you're in a wheelie and you're really

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.700 
you're in a wheelie and you're really
starting<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.780> get<00:01:27.900> some<00:01:28.050> lean<00:01:28.200> angle<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.590> you

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
starting to get some lean angle in you

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.990 
starting to get some lean angle in you
have<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> little<00:01:29.040> bit<00:01:29.220> more<00:01:29.369> leverage<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.790> shove

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
have a little bit more leverage to shove

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.070 
have a little bit more leverage to shove
down<00:01:30.030> with<00:01:30.360> your<00:01:30.479> arms

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
clip-ons there's no angle on them and on

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.600 
clip-ons there's no angle on them and on
this<00:01:36.780> bike<00:01:37.020> actually<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.619> stock<00:01:37.860> setting<00:01:38.400> is

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
this bike actually the stock setting is

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.700 
this bike actually the stock setting is
they're<00:01:39.300> actually<00:01:39.420> underneath<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.140> clip-on

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
they're actually underneath the clip-on

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.210 
they're actually underneath the clip-on
which<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.369> uh<00:01:41.600> for<00:01:42.600> me<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.050> for<00:01:43.440> Nick<00:01:43.590> also<00:01:43.830> it

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
which is uh for me and for Nick also it

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.370 
which is uh for me and for Nick also it
kind<00:01:44.400> of<00:01:44.520> kind<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:44.970> puts<00:01:45.509> us<00:01:45.600> at<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:46.200> weird

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
kind of kind of puts us at a weird

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.630 
kind of kind of puts us at a weird
position<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.920> where<00:01:46.979> we<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.250> get<00:01:47.400> the<00:01:47.520> most

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
position to where we can get the most

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.669 
position to where we can get the most
leverage<00:01:47.880> out<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.300> the<00:01:48.360> bike<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:49.170> we<00:01:49.319> kind<00:01:49.649> of

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
leverage out of the bike so we kind of

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:51.200 
leverage out of the bike so we kind of
pull<00:01:49.890> them<00:01:49.950> up<00:01:50.130> lower<00:01:50.550> the<00:01:50.670> front<00:01:50.910> end<00:01:51.119> a

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
pull them up lower the front end a

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.580 
pull them up lower the front end a
little<00:01:51.330> bit<00:01:51.479> throw<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> clip<00:01:52.050> ons<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.380> top

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
little bit throw the clip ons on top

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.249 
little bit throw the clip ons on top
gives<00:01:53.009> us<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.220> little<00:01:53.340> more<00:01:53.520> leverage<00:01:54.140> able<00:01:55.140> to

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
gives us a little more leverage able to

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.559 
gives us a little more leverage able to
do<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.410> lot<00:01:55.590> more<00:01:55.619> different<00:01:56.190> tricks<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.850> push

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
do a lot more different tricks and push

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:59.419 
do a lot more different tricks and push
it<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> little<00:01:58.080> harder<00:01:58.500> lets<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.220> ride<00:01:59.399> a

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
it a little harder lets you ride a

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:00.650 
it a little harder lets you ride a
little<00:01:59.700> more<00:01:59.819> aggressive<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.360> on<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.569> edge

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
little more aggressive and on the edge

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.120 
little more aggressive and on the edge
it<00:02:00.899> just<00:02:00.929> gives<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.319> different<00:02:01.500> control

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
it just gives you a different control

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.770 
it just gives you a different control
and<00:02:02.310> different<00:02:02.550> feel<00:02:02.729> on<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.000> bike<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.720> then

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
and different feel on the bike and then

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.570 
and different feel on the bike and then
of<00:02:04.170> course<00:02:04.200> pretty<00:02:04.890> much<00:02:05.009> everything<00:02:05.340> else<00:02:05.429> I

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
of course pretty much everything else I

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.950 
of course pretty much everything else I
try<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.819> keep<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.090> stock<00:02:06.330> as<00:02:06.509> possible

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
try to keep the stock as possible

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.859 
try to keep the stock as possible
because<00:02:07.259> stock<00:02:07.590> things<00:02:07.830> never<00:02:08.009> fail<00:02:08.780> like<00:02:09.780> I

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
because stock things never fail like I

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
going to find yourself flipping over the

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.460 
going to find yourself flipping over the
front<00:02:32.970> because<00:02:33.240> you<00:02:33.390> were<00:02:33.930> really<00:02:34.200> high<00:02:34.319> on

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
front because you were really high on

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.900 
front because you were really high on
the<00:02:34.530> balance<00:02:34.830> point<00:02:35.069> and<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:35.370> just<00:02:35.760> lean

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
the balance point and you just lean

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.160 
the balance point and you just lean
forward<00:02:36.240> for<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.420> second<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:36.840> lost<00:02:37.020> your

concentration<00:02:38.060> as<00:02:39.060> you'll<00:02:39.569> see<00:02:39.720> here<00:02:39.930> this<00:02:40.080> is

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
concentration as you'll see here this is

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.559 
concentration as you'll see here this is

my custom blown fork seal I find it to

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.390 
my custom blown fork seal I find it to
be<00:02:42.660> an<00:02:42.750> integral<00:02:43.080> part<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.349> my<00:02:43.530> my<00:02:44.040> riding

be an integral part of my my riding
ability<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:45.270> more<00:02:45.420> often<00:02:45.569> I<00:02:45.750> blow<00:02:45.900> fork<00:02:46.170> seals

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
ability the more often I blow fork seals

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.350 
ability the more often I blow fork seals
the<00:02:46.650> more<00:02:46.980> often<00:02:47.220> my<00:02:47.340> endows<00:02:47.640> turn<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.120> crap

the more often my endows turn to crap

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.630 
the more often my endows turn to crap
it's<00:02:49.020> a<00:02:49.260> great<00:02:49.740> advantage<00:02:50.099> that<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.280> have<00:02:50.340> it

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
it's a great advantage that I have it

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.250 
it's a great advantage that I have it
usually<00:02:50.910> keeps<00:02:51.090> me<00:02:51.209> low<00:02:51.510> down<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.840> placing<00:02:52.170> in

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
usually keeps me low down the placing in

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.470 
usually keeps me low down the placing in
competitions<00:02:52.830> but<00:02:53.310> but<00:02:54.060> in<00:02:54.150> all<00:02:54.270> seriousness

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480

to<00:04:27.450> borrow<00:04:27.630> one<00:04:27.840> from<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:28.080> friend<00:04:28.160> so<00:04:29.160> I<00:04:29.190> got

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
to borrow one from a friend so I got

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.420 
to borrow one from a friend so I got
lucky<00:04:29.760> for<00:04:30.030> that<00:04:30.770> but<00:04:31.770> that's<00:04:31.890> basically<00:04:32.100> your

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
lucky for that but that's basically your

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.190 
lucky for that but that's basically your
overall<00:04:32.760> stunt<00:04:33.000> bike<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.720> only<00:04:33.870> other<00:04:34.020> thing

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
overall stunt bike the only other thing

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.480 
overall stunt bike the only other thing
that<00:04:34.230> I<00:04:34.350> have<00:04:34.560> right<00:04:34.770> here<00:04:34.800> is<00:04:35.010> this<00:04:35.100> custom

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
that I have right here is this custom

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.540 
that I have right here is this custom
hard<00:04:35.700> wired<00:04:35.880> fan<00:04:36.860> literally<00:04:37.860> I<00:04:38.070> had<00:04:38.340> it<00:04:38.430> on<00:04:38.490> a

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
hard wired fan literally I had it on a

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.610 
hard wired fan literally I had it on a
toggle<00:04:38.790> switch<00:04:39.110> although<00:04:40.110> I<00:04:40.140> pulled<00:04:40.470> off<00:04:40.590> the

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
toggle switch although I pulled off the

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.050 
toggle switch although I pulled off the
toggle<00:04:41.040> switch<00:04:41.190> can<00:04:41.700> I<00:04:41.760> ever<00:04:41.880> seem<00:04:42.030> to

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
toggle switch can I ever seem to

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.310 
toggle switch can I ever seem to
remember<00:04:42.150> more<00:04:42.570> if<00:04:42.720> it's<00:04:42.870> just<00:04:43.080> literally

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
remember more if it's just literally

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.830 
remember more if it's just literally
exposed<00:04:43.710> wires<00:04:44.000> so<00:04:45.000> anytime<00:04:45.240> that<00:04:45.360> I<00:04:45.510> want<00:04:45.720> to

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
exposed wires so anytime that I want to

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.030 
exposed wires so anytime that I want to
I<00:04:45.870> can<00:04:46.050> hook<00:04:46.110> up<00:04:46.230> the<00:04:46.350> fan<00:04:46.530> and<00:04:46.740> have<00:04:46.830> it<00:04:46.920> blow

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
I can hook up the fan and have it blow

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.970 
I can hook up the fan and have it blow
and<00:04:47.430> with<00:04:48.390> start<00:04:48.660> riding<00:04:48.780> it's<00:04:49.020> a<00:04:49.110> lot<00:04:49.260> of<00:04:49.410> slow

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
and with start riding it's a lot of slow

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.550 
and with start riding it's a lot of slow
speed<00:04:50.280> to<00:04:50.370> high<00:04:50.520> speed<00:04:51.110> and<00:04:52.110> a<00:04:52.260> lot<00:04:52.410> of<00:04:52.440> the

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
speed to high speed and a lot of the

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.230 
speed to high speed and a lot of the
burnouts<00:04:52.890> will<00:04:53.070> overheat<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.790> engine<00:04:53.820> and

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
burnouts will overheat the engine and

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.390 
burnouts will overheat the engine and
having<00:04:54.540> the<00:04:54.630> fan<00:04:54.780> constantly<00:04:55.320> run<00:04:55.530> is<00:04:55.680> a<00:04:55.710> great

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
having the fan constantly run is a great

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.720 
having the fan constantly run is a great
tool<00:04:56.640> to<00:04:56.820> keep<00:04:56.970> the<00:04:57.030> engine<00:04:57.960> temperature<00:04:58.350> down

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
tool to keep the engine temperature down

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.940 
tool to keep the engine temperature down
or<00:04:59.730> coolant<00:05:00.000> temperature<00:05:00.300> that<00:05:00.420> is

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
or coolant temperature that is

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.860 
or coolant temperature that is
this<00:05:01.760> is<00:05:01.880> a<00:05:01.940> bike<00:05:02.120> that's<00:05:02.330> set<00:05:02.450> up<00:05:02.480> for<00:05:02.720> war

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
this is a bike that's set up for war

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.510 
this is a bike that's set up for war
basically<00:05:03.260> you<00:05:03.560> can<00:05:03.710> toss<00:05:04.040> this<00:05:04.250> thing<00:05:04.400> off<00:05:04.490> a

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
basically you can toss this thing off a

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.860 
basically you can toss this thing off a
cliff<00:05:04.850> you<00:05:05.060> can<00:05:05.210> bang<00:05:05.390> it<00:05:05.510> off<00:05:05.600> the<00:05:05.720> rev

are two of the staple bikes that we use
I<00:05:21.340> hate<00:05:22.340> to<00:05:22.460> say<00:05:22.640> but<00:05:22.850> a<00:05:22.970> lot<00:05:23.150> of<00:05:23.180> the<00:05:23.330> parts

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
that we do run we run them down to the

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.740 
that we do run we run them down to the
point<00:05:25.220> till<00:05:25.370> they<00:05:25.550> don't<00:05:25.760> work<00:05:25.850> no<00:05:26.000> more<00:05:26.030> we

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
point till they don't work no more we

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.090 
point till they don't work no more we
don't<00:05:26.840> change<00:05:27.080> them<00:05:27.260> until<00:05:27.500> they're<00:05:27.650> until

they're not working and a lot of times I
mean<00:05:30.110> it<00:05:30.500> could<00:05:30.650> just<00:05:30.740> be<00:05:30.890> our<00:05:31.010> shocks<00:05:31.400> or<00:05:31.760> rear

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
mean it could just be our shocks or rear

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.150 
mean it could just be our shocks or rear
shock<00:05:32.150> could<00:05:32.330> just<00:05:32.480> be<00:05:32.600> completely<00:05:33.560> blown<00:05:33.890> out

shock could just be completely blown out
and<00:05:34.520> and<00:05:35.120> it's<00:05:36.080> something<00:05:36.410> that<00:05:36.590> is<00:05:37.100> evolving

the more we're starting to look at

just one of those things that we're kind
of<00:05:55.460> we've<00:05:56.360> gotten<00:05:56.690> so<00:05:56.930> into<00:05:57.290> this<00:05:57.410> that<00:05:57.620> we're

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
of we've gotten so into this that we're

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.760 
of we've gotten so into this that we're
kind<00:05:57.920> of<00:05:57.980> learning<00:05:58.160> as<00:05:58.370> we<00:05:58.520> go<00:05:58.730> and<00:05:59.770> starting

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
kind of learning as we go and starting

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.490 
kind of learning as we go and starting
to<00:06:00.890> really<00:06:01.100> push<00:06:01.720> you<00:06:02.720> know<00:06:02.810> the<00:06:02.990> level<00:06:03.170> of<00:06:03.350> the

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
to really push you know the level of the

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.530 
to really push you know the level of the
bikes<00:06:03.740> and<00:06:04.100> the<00:06:04.400> level<00:06:04.670> of<00:06:04.730> our<00:06:04.880> riding<00:06:05.120> and

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:05.540 
bikes and the level of our riding and

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.860 
bikes and the level of our riding and
the<00:06:06.530> whole<00:06:06.680> level<00:06:06.860> of<00:06:07.010> the<00:06:07.160> sport<00:06:07.490> and<00:06:07.730> I<00:06:08.000> think

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
the whole level of the sport and I think

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.570 
the whole level of the sport and I think
as<00:06:08.990> we<00:06:09.110> go<00:06:09.260> on<00:06:09.500> you<00:06:09.710> know<00:06:09.830> suspension<00:06:10.400> some

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
as we go on you know suspension some

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.700 
as we go on you know suspension some
like<00:06:10.730> a<00:06:10.760> suspension<00:06:11.180> setting<00:06:11.720> and<00:06:12.260> you<00:06:12.590> know

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
like a suspension setting and you know

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.620 
like a suspension setting and you know
rebuilding<00:06:13.250> maybe<00:06:13.400> aftermarket<00:06:14.030> Springs<00:06:14.300> in

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
rebuilding maybe aftermarket Springs in

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.850 
rebuilding maybe aftermarket Springs in
suspension<00:06:15.170> maybe<00:06:15.290> an<00:06:15.500> aftermarket

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
suspension maybe an aftermarket

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.350 
suspension maybe an aftermarket
suspension<00:06:16.160> I<00:06:16.550> know<00:06:16.610> a<00:06:16.700> lot<00:06:16.880> of<00:06:16.970> riders<00:06:17.120> are

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
suspension I know a lot of riders are

everything and and that's definitely

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.730 
everything and and that's definitely
something<00:06:23.900> we're<00:06:24.050> gonna<00:06:24.140> start<00:06:24.410> looking<00:06:24.650> to

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
something we're gonna start looking to

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.470 
something we're gonna start looking to
in<00:06:24.830> the<00:06:24.890> future<00:06:25.220> anything<00:06:25.430> we've<00:06:25.970> even<00:06:26.270> talked

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:26.480 
in the future anything we've even talked

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.350 
in the future anything we've even talked
about<00:06:26.690> maybe<00:06:26.810> a<00:06:26.870> new<00:06:26.990> building<00:06:27.440> got<00:06:28.360> more

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
about maybe a new building got more

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.380 
about maybe a new building got more
performance<00:06:29.990> driven<00:06:30.830> most<00:06:31.010> motors<00:06:31.520> for<00:06:32.360> the

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:32.390 
performance driven most motors for the

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.000 
performance driven most motors for the
most<00:06:32.600> part<00:06:32.810> we<00:06:32.900> ruin<00:06:33.080> everything<00:06:33.320> stock<00:06:33.740> with

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
most part we ruin everything stock with

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.010 
most part we ruin everything stock with
maybe<00:06:34.220> you<00:06:34.550> know<00:06:34.670> the<00:06:34.790> biggest<00:06:35.150> the<00:06:35.870> biggest

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.020 
maybe you know the biggest the biggest

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.930 
maybe you know the biggest the biggest
thing<00:06:36.380> that<00:06:36.410> we<00:06:36.590> we<00:06:36.980> put<00:06:37.190> on<00:06:37.370> this<00:06:37.580> thing<00:06:37.640> may

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
thing that we we put on this thing may

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.280 
thing that we we put on this thing may
just<00:06:38.120> be<00:06:38.210> like<00:06:38.330> an<00:06:38.450> aftermarket<00:06:38.780> exhaust

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.290 
just be like an aftermarket exhaust

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.400 
just be like an aftermarket exhaust
which<00:06:39.590> isn't<00:06:39.800> isn't<00:06:40.130> the<00:06:40.340> mo

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410 
which isn't isn't the mo

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.110 
which isn't isn't the mo
you<00:06:41.950> know<00:06:42.040> think<00:06:42.310> it's<00:06:42.580> gonna<00:06:42.820> give<00:06:43.000> us<00:06:43.030> the

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 
you know think it's gonna give us the

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.930 
you know think it's gonna give us the
most<00:06:43.300> performance<00:06:43.870> so<00:06:44.110> I<00:06:44.590> think<00:06:45.310> as<00:06:45.580> a<00:06:45.610> sport

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940 
most performance so I think as a sport

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.340 
most performance so I think as a sport
grows<00:06:46.150> I<00:06:46.330> think<00:06:46.510> that<00:06:46.660> there's<00:06:47.080> going<00:06:47.230> to<00:06:47.290> be

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.350 
grows I think that there's going to be

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.770 
grows I think that there's going to be
more<00:06:47.530> avenues<00:06:47.890> we<00:06:48.070> start<00:06:48.340> to<00:06:48.400> eat<00:06:48.460> into<00:06:48.910> as<00:06:49.510> far

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:49.780 
more avenues we start to eat into as far

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.820 
more avenues we start to eat into as far
as<00:06:49.960> building<00:06:50.500> our<00:06:50.740> performance<00:06:51.220> on<00:06:51.460> the<00:06:51.640> bikes
