00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.599
 and friends let's start some 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:19.119
 exercises on equivalences 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:23.950
 see the next question only one sentence 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:30.700
 logic equivalent to if Ana is beautiful then 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:35.680
 karina is ugly is the issue of the ESAF 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:41.830
 pican applying equivalences as then 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:44.950
 the solution is solution 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.240
 then we have the sentence if beautiful then 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.600
 fall is not ugly 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:53.230
 we will receive visa using our 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:01:00.670
 connective is beautiful ana then face 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:05.700
 ugly flick the proposition ana had beautiful 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:09.610
 a proposition p is then 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.150
 Karina is a call for a 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:18.760
 proposition that we have then is that the 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:23.140
 proposition cp then which then 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:31.710
 always then that is equivalent 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:31.710
 this sentence is equivalent and that it 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.090
 It's good to be good, so I have 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:48.270
 an equivalence known as 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:55.600
 positive and is equivalent to only 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:59.920
 Then it is not equivalent to you. 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:03.939
 not that it does not have equivalence 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:09.509
 known as positive against here 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:14.730
 we are then using the positive counter to 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.730
 against positive
