00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
fact the game reminded me a lot of a mix

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.190 
fact the game reminded me a lot of a mix
of<00:01:53.579> between<00:01:53.850> blade<00:01:54.360> runner<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.840> goes<00:01:55.049> from

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
the shell which is a very cool combo if

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.420 
the shell which is a very cool combo if
you're<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.240> great<00:01:57.450> sci-fi<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.979> characters

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
you're in a great sci-fi the characters

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.130 
you're in a great sci-fi the characters
are<00:01:59.579> all<00:01:59.790> compelling<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.570> interesting<00:02:00.689> and

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
are all compelling and interesting and

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.410 
are all compelling and interesting and
well<00:02:01.259> voice<00:02:01.700> however<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.880> story<00:02:03.180> can<00:02:03.390> be

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
well voice however the story can be

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.899 
well voice however the story can be
slightly<00:02:03.719> confusing<00:02:04.200> at<00:02:04.380> times<00:02:04.729> but<00:02:05.729> it's

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
slightly confusing at times but it's

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.789 
slightly confusing at times but it's
still<00:02:06.180> very<00:02:06.540> good<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.140> really<00:02:07.439> wanted<00:02:07.680> to

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
still very good and I really wanted to

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.940 
still very good and I really wanted to
see<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.160> end<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.459> how<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.789> all<00:02:08.879> played<00:02:09.149> out

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
see the end and how it all played out

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.350

another<00:02:10.950> cool<00:02:11.190> feature<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.610> definitely<00:02:12.209> the

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
another cool feature is definitely the

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.490

action<00:02:56.430> however<00:02:57.090> there<00:02:57.630> is<00:02:57.780> a<00:02:57.810> major<00:02:58.020> problem

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
action however there is a major problem

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.560

with<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.830> lip<00:02:59.010> sync<00:02:59.250> it's<00:02:59.790> just<00:03:00.060> off<00:03:00.209> at<00:03:00.390> times

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
with the lip sync it's just off at times

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.840 
with the lip sync it's just off at times
and<00:03:00.989> while<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.709> game<00:03:01.890> may<00:03:02.070> look<00:03:02.250> great<00:03:02.550> it's

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
and while the game may look great it's

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.610 
and while the game may look great it's
not<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.450> best<00:03:03.600> looking<00:03:03.780> game<00:03:04.200> on<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.470> market

not the best looking game on the market
today<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:05.310> think<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.700> death<00:03:05.880> animations<00:03:06.450> are

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
today I think the death animations are

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.780 
today I think the death animations are
fair<00:03:06.870> however<00:03:07.590> there<00:03:07.739> are<00:03:07.800> only<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:08.100> handful<00:03:08.730> of

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
fair however there are only a handful of

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.790 
fair however there are only a handful of
melee<00:03:09.209> takedowns<00:03:09.720> which<00:03:09.959> does<00:03:10.200> limit<00:03:10.440> it's

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
melee takedowns which does limit it's

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.010 
melee takedowns which does limit it's
fun<00:03:11.239> however<00:03:12.239> there<00:03:12.450> are<00:03:12.540> plenty<00:03:12.690> of<00:03:12.870> other
