00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
that it does not have split screen

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
that it does not have split screen

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
gaming so other than that it is terribly

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.650 
gaming so other than that it is terribly
terribly<00:05:35.770> fun<00:05:36.190> so<00:05:36.910> I<00:05:36.940> definitely<00:05:37.240> recommend
