00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.960 
this area I think it's a great way to
determine<00:01:02.649> whether<00:01:02.829> or<00:01:02.950> not<00:01:03.100> this<00:01:03.340> is<00:01:03.489> really

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
determine whether or not this is really

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:04.899 
determine whether or not this is really
something<00:01:04.210> you<00:01:04.360> want
