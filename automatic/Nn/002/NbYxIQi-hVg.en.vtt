 Hi! I'm Akshay, Prince's Product Manager 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.500
 The Shadow and the Flame Today I have a chance to present to you all 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.820
 An inside look at the process of developing the game, interviewing team members and learning more about Prince 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.320
 of Persia the Shadow and Flame. Let's take a look together ... 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.310
 Prince of Persia is a very strong name, not only in Ubisoft but globally. 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.320
 After the success of Prince of Persia Classic on smartphones we had more to give him 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.980
 Prince's adventure and to this we offer you Prince of Persia Shadow and the Flame which is really 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.329
 The game was fantastic but we had to develop it a bit by hand 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.829
 Design and control method to keep pace with this era. 0: 01: 11.929,0: 01: 10.329 We are following together what changes are required 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.469
 To make the game keep up with this era. At first the question was, why 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.469
 We change the way Prince of Persia The Shadow and the Flame? The answer was very simple, 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:27.700
 Because of the evolution of players and devices, now the playing time is less and the players do not want to play at levels that require a lot of time to finish 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.459
 The devices we are directing are smartphones and tablets. But we were facing a difficult equation, we want 

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:39.289
 Create a game that is easy to play but also challenging and not going out 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.899
 About the basic game context. We wanted to create a game that has clear goals 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.929
 Can be achieved and do not contain blocked methods. Now let me introduce you to the person who supervised this trip 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.929
 From the beginning. 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.399
 Hi, I'm Sashi Menon and I'm the producer of Prince of Persia The Shadow and 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.079
 the Flame. Let me give you a quick overview of what the Shadow and Flame game was in the past and what 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.039
 It is now. Shadow and Flame events after eleven days 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.010
 From the end of the original Prince of Persia story and now Jaafar has returned from defeat and the kingdom 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.190
 All under his control and now required of the Prince to do what he is good at doing: save 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.690
 Kingdom and save the princess. 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.080
 I must say that we are very happy that we have reached this level between maintaining the original game spirit 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.390
 And applied to new devices at the same time. Well that's enough for today, thanks 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.070
 To see us. See you all next week to talk about more details about Prince of Persia: The 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.780
 Shadow and the Flame.
