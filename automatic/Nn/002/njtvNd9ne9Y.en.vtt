00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 ruben rochina blackburn player 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.340
 rovers how are you now that is very 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.010
 well the club 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.990
 good after tube tie I guess that 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.769
 happier than usual or is it a 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:18.730
 week especially important for you 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:20.890
 well the truth is that I can play 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.199
 in attacking positions because it is to put a 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.539
 goal is important it is important 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:29.759
 true to be able to take a point the team to 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:32.559
 lack of five minutes and good 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.180
 you are seconds right now if I do not 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.270
 I'm wrong you have two wins two 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.110
 draws the decline maybe it was a moment 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.000
 bitter but at the moment you are giving the 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.000
 expensive and trying to go back up that 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.520
 I guess it will be the goal 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.950
 directly there is no other not the objective 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.290
 is to try to upload try to upload 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.780
 editing playing the playoff 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.900
 either winning the league or with second 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.210
 position I think we have a very good 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.089
 team to be able to do it well let's 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.369
 work like this we can get it in the 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.500
 personal plan as you lived the year 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.740
 after that descent because there was good 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.630
 team 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.460
 if the truth that a descent is not 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.040
 nice for nobody but good they are 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.680
 things that go better in your career 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.810
 they make it stronger to learn things and 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.610
 Well the subject is that we have 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.619
 maintained the majority of the workforce and 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.020
 that's going to help us make things 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.460
 easier this year and this year if 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.460
 mechel salgado I suppose that when 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.869
 blackburn ago came to a couple of 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.450
 seasons and a half if I'm not wrong 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.450
 would act as a cicerone and would be a help for 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.730
 you that changed the barcelona- of all the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.890
 life for an English adventure 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.160
 and the truth that to me that I have a 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.440
 honey and I thanked you once from 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.980
 who behaved with me phenomenally 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.540
 as his family they caught right away and 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.900
 good with what I tell you that I have a lot 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.750
 honey if most or all and how it 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.480
 Rubén Rochina decides to say good not 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.120
 They are telling all I want the 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.380
 barcelona the subsidiary with me I made the 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.600
 preseason with the first team in 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.520
 some occasion I will undertake this 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.860
 Adventure the premiere as awareness 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.530
 one 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.720
 good what you say not the boat today in 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.330
 day is the best the best team in the 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.540
 world have the best players and 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.460
 well i am a boy i am realistic and 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.680
 I knew that getting to the first team was 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.080
 very very physical practically impossible and 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.710
 pores and me what interested me was 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.020
 become a soccer professional and 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.640
 well I had the opportunity and do not hesitate 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.640
 no time the first is a league 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.470
 that attracted me a lot and as soon as I had 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.930
 opportunity then I said why not 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.790
 they tried a new experience what 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.470
 difference you have found between the 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.470
 premier and the Spanish league 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.550
 surely the biggest difference is 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.680
 the level of rhythm that there are matches 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.320
 are we say a little more crazy more 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.010
 broken there is not so much approach 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.260
 practical if we generate and then already 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.380
 of what he referred to he played then the 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.790
 environment the first thing is it's crazy 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.650
 I think I 've never seen anything like that 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.530
 it seemed even going down to second 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.590
 division and remains the same you want 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.120
 attacker here we say that the best 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.090
 players of the world are in the league 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.680
 Spanish but which is the soccer player 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.320
 that you have faced there that you say 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.410
 this this is an out of series is for 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.570
 On top of what I faced 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.280
 well there are a few the truth but 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:41.920
 good silva surprised me a lot when 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:45.460
 I played against him and some now 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.830
 note that they play the ball well 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.480
 used to living in Barcelona you 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.000
 do you believe in valència 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.100
 how is everyday life in england 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.440
 which is almost always raining that 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.660
 you do not see much the sun the customs of 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.330
 meals 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.750
 good if all the time so you have 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:07.060
 The whole reason is not for me honestly 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:10.180
 of all but good I fit fast 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.340
 I do not have any problem and so in 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.470
 As for the food, I think it's 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.160
 more one thing that is said to be the reality 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.600
 itself not only eat very well also 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.220
 in any kind of problem for 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.020
 find what you want to eat 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.560
 for a young guy like you that you have 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.380
 21 years I guess I train with nuno 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.970
 gomes that is one of the biggest ones in 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.440
 portugal maybe that here in Spain but 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.140
 He is one of the great forwards of 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.640
 some years as experience for 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.650
 learn I guess in each 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.910
 training you take new things that 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.940
 tomorrow you can put in 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.160
 practice you 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.480
 yes the truth that yes the truth that apart 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.130
 to be a player 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.070
 no person is always us 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.500
 trying to help everyone and give advice 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.410
 and good and when you see training, you already notice 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.390
 that he has been a big football player and that 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.050
 Although it is a veteran still 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:04.830
 is in shape 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.830
 you miss Spain 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:11.010
 but my family 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.010
 good weather 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.960
 I guess you're the day 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.880
 present here in Spain as has 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.160
 lived there in england that bomb 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.170
 What does that Christian say? 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.930
 sad and the president told me 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.360
 I want to go as here and in England 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:31.400
 It was also front and there is also 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.259
 they look for the possible ones because it is 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.360
 follow the truth that has also stuck 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:37.970
 strong here the good thing is one thing 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.169
 that has sustained many people why 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.409
 do not 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:44.330
 and it has left the nava but good I do not know 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:46.400
 I think it's a situation that will have 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.189
 that solve the with the club and good 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.599
 both for him and for Madrid when 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:53.629
 before it is in a solution that 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:56.150
 it's the best and the barça that this team 

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:58.970
 will follow him from close 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.610
 if I continue now that is seven years 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.250
 there 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.199
 they stay in the memory and the sun team 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.270
 that I have a lot of love has given me 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:09.610
 very much and good I am very grateful to 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:13.270
 they get you to pose in some 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:15.819
 moment when you see basin when you see 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.969
 tello when you see alcántara sometime 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:21.430
 you think and because I do not or that fails or 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:23.750
 maybe I should not leave or I left too 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:27.710
 late 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:30.080
 good is inevitable the Sardinian had 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.070
 last if I had stayed but I 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.630
 I think that 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.850
 the industry has to make decisions 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.860
 important and what good but sometimes 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.660
 you know others I do not honestly do not 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.180
 regret of no time from which 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.230
 take but good yes it is true that that 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.720
 doubt then always previous 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.220
 so ruben thank you very much and that 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.320
 keep on being very lucky in the 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.720
 blackburn to keep getting great goals 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.360
 like the end of last weekend 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.640
 heel and hopefully get jce the 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.409
 promotion and some day we hope to see you from 

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:04.110
 new for Spain ' 

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:04.110
