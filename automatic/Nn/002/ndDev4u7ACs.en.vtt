all<00:00:02.550> right<00:00:02.669> well<00:00:03.629> what<00:00:03.810> we<00:00:03.899> got<00:00:04.080> here<00:00:04.440> is<00:00:04.710> a

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:04.850 
all right well what we got here is a

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.470 
all right well what we got here is a
1992<00:00:05.850> Honda<00:00:06.589> Accord<00:00:07.589> with<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.880> 2.2<00:00:09.450> liter

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
1992 Honda Accord with a 2.2 liter

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.180 
1992 Honda Accord with a 2.2 liter
engine<00:00:10.080> I<00:00:10.320> just<00:00:10.860> put<00:00:11.040> in<00:00:11.160> for<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> guy<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:13.190> it

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
engine I just put in for a guy and it

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.550 
engine I just put in for a guy and it
ran<00:00:14.519> great<00:00:14.839> except<00:00:15.839> for<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.990> little<00:00:16.080> idle<00:00:16.410> issue

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
ran great except for a little idle issue

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.740 
ran great except for a little idle issue
up<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.220> down<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.490> little<00:00:17.789> bit<00:00:18.029> until<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.480> warmed

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
up and down a little bit until it warmed

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.500 
up and down a little bit until it warmed
up<00:00:18.930> then<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.170> was<00:00:19.260> fine

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
up then it was fine

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.420 
up then it was fine
good<00:00:22.199> throttle<00:00:22.560> response<00:00:22.680> everything<00:00:23.340> was

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
good throttle response everything was

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.839 
good throttle response everything was
fine<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.269> was<00:00:24.600> charging<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.170> air<00:00:25.849> air

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
fine so I was charging the air air

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.599 
fine so I was charging the air air
conditioning<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.660> hit<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.680> key<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.400> made

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
conditioning and hit the key and it made

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.870 
conditioning and hit the key and it made
that<00:00:29.880> sound<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.900> know<00:00:31.399> like<00:00:32.399> there<00:00:32.579> was<00:00:32.669> no

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
that sound you know like there was no

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.340 
that sound you know like there was no
compression<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.690> just<00:00:33.899> stopped<00:00:34.110> right

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
compression and I just stopped right

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.540 
compression and I just stopped right
there<00:00:34.530> let<00:00:34.680> go<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.920> key<00:00:36.320> because<00:00:37.550> normally

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
there let go the key because normally

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.299 
there let go the key because normally
you<00:00:39.030> can<00:00:39.210> if<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.899> belt<00:00:40.140> goes<00:00:40.379> just<00:00:40.860> cranking

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
you can if the belt goes just cranking

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.740 
you can if the belt goes just cranking
the<00:00:41.430> engine<00:00:41.550> you'll<00:00:41.910> wipe<00:00:42.180> out<00:00:42.390> all<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
the engine you'll wipe out all the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.830 
the engine you'll wipe out all the
intake<00:00:43.079> valves<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.590> there's<00:00:43.739> eight<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.040> them

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
intake valves and there's eight of them

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.010 
intake valves and there's eight of them
this<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.050> four<00:00:46.320> valves<00:00:46.680> per<00:00:46.829> cylinder<00:00:47.629> so<00:00:48.629> I

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
this is four valves per cylinder so I

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.010 
this is four valves per cylinder so I
made<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.829> device<00:00:50.039> up<00:00:50.430> here<00:00:50.730> it's<00:00:51.120> basically

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
made this device up here it's basically

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.430 
made this device up here it's basically
just<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.680> tip<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.280> compression<00:00:54.149> gauge<00:00:54.440> some

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
just the tip of a compression gauge some

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.310 
just the tip of a compression gauge some
brass<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.129> copper<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.510> pressure

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
brass and copper and the pressure

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.660 
brass and copper and the pressure
regulator<00:00:59.030> so<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.899> could<00:01:01.680> inject<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.609> air

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
regulator so that I could inject the air

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.100 
regulator so that I could inject the air
into<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> cylinder<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.750> low<00:01:03.899> enough

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
into the cylinder and a low enough

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.350 
into the cylinder and a low enough
pressure<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.280> wouldn't<00:01:05.460> want<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.670> rotate

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
pressure that it wouldn't want to rotate

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.910 
pressure that it wouldn't want to rotate
the<00:01:06.510> engine<00:01:06.659> backwards<00:01:07.320> or<00:01:07.590> any<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.830> that

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
the engine backwards or any of that

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.399 
the engine backwards or any of that
weird<00:01:08.130> stuff<00:01:08.340> if<00:01:09.270> there<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.659> any<00:01:09.840> mechanical

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
weird stuff if there is any mechanical

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.000 
weird stuff if there is any mechanical
issues<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.890> didn't<00:01:11.100> want<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.869> so<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.010> rotated

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
issues I didn't want that so I rotated

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.030 
issues I didn't want that so I rotated
the<00:01:14.159> engine<00:01:14.490> we<00:01:14.610> was<00:01:14.729> already<00:01:15.000> at<00:01:15.090> TDC<00:01:16.040> top

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the engine we was already at TDC top

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.090 
the engine we was already at TDC top
dead<00:01:17.250> center<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:18.150> mark<00:01:18.390> was<00:01:18.570> dead<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:18.960> which<00:01:19.950> I

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
dead center the mark was dead on which I

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.340 
dead center the mark was dead on which I
had<00:01:20.220> checked<00:01:20.460> first<00:01:21.030> with<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.689> straw<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.229> there

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
had checked first with a straw in there

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.740 
had checked first with a straw in there
watching<00:01:22.920> these<00:01:23.040> rockers<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.850> everything

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
watching these rockers and everything

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.710 
watching these rockers and everything
was<00:01:24.869> fine<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.229> pulled<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.100> little<00:01:26.430> cover<00:01:26.720> to

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
was fine it pulled this little cover to

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.670 
was fine it pulled this little cover to
make<00:01:27.900> sure<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.229> up<00:01:28.409> was<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.990> cam

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
make sure the up was on the the cam

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.390 
make sure the up was on the the cam
sprocket<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.880> was<00:01:33.710> so<00:01:34.710> what<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> heck<00:01:35.280> is

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
sprocket it was so what the heck is

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.950 
sprocket it was so what the heck is
going<00:01:35.670> on<00:01:35.790> here<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.360> that's<00:01:36.570> why<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.720> made<00:01:36.930> that

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
going on here so that's why I made that

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.649 
going on here so that's why I made that
device<00:01:37.439> up<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.189> worked<00:01:38.400> great<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:39.600> I

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
device up and it worked great so I

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.210 
device up and it worked great so I
checked<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.049> cylinder<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:43.009> put<00:01:44.009> an<00:01:44.130> air

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
checked this cylinder and put an air

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.719 
checked this cylinder and put an air
through<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.579> check<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> radiator<00:01:46.399> the<00:01:47.399> intake

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
through it check the radiator the intake

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.249 
through it check the radiator the intake
plenum<00:01:47.909> which<00:01:48.210> I've<00:01:48.360> taken<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> airbox<00:01:48.960> off

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
plenum which I've taken the airbox off

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.880 
plenum which I've taken the airbox off
of<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:50.280> exhaust<00:01:50.610> pipe<00:01:51.079> nothing<00:01:52.079> no<00:01:52.649> air<00:01:52.860> a

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
of the exhaust pipe nothing no air a

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.380 
of the exhaust pipe nothing no air a
little<00:01:53.189> bit<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.460> noise<00:01:53.549> coming<00:01:53.820> out<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.149> here

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
little bit of noise coming out of here

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.010 
little bit of noise coming out of here
and<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:55.409> pull<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.860> dipstick<00:01:56.100> out<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.869> put<00:01:57.869> this

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
and I pull the dipstick out and put this

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.840 
and I pull the dipstick out and put this
hose<00:01:59.060> over<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.299> tube<00:02:00.509> put<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.500> my<00:02:01.619> ear<00:02:01.850> and

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
hose over the tube put it to my ear and

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.520 
hose over the tube put it to my ear and
there<00:02:03.659> was<00:02:03.780> something<00:02:04.020> we<00:02:04.079> are<00:02:04.170> going<00:02:04.409> by

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
there was something we are going by

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.089 
there was something we are going by
there<00:02:04.740> that's<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.399> be<00:02:05.490> expected<00:02:05.579> because<00:02:07.099> you

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
there that's to be expected because you

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.339 
there that's to be expected because you
know<00:02:08.220> those<00:02:08.310> ring<00:02:08.580> gaps<00:02:09.119> aren't<00:02:09.450> perfectly

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
know those ring gaps aren't perfectly

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.630 
know those ring gaps aren't perfectly
closed<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.069> it's<00:02:11.400> direct<00:02:11.849> air

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
closed and it's direct air

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.730 
closed and it's direct air
and<00:02:12.820> I<00:02:13.300> just<00:02:13.690> didn't<00:02:13.930> seem<00:02:14.050> sufficient<00:02:14.560> enough

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
and I just didn't seem sufficient enough

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.290 
and I just didn't seem sufficient enough
he's<00:02:15.010> looking<00:02:15.280> at<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.520> gauge<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:16.030> wasn't

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
he's looking at the gauge it wasn't

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.660 
he's looking at the gauge it wasn't
depleting<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.840> air<00:02:16.960> supply<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.430> thought

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
depleting the air supply and I thought

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.840 
depleting the air supply and I thought
this<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.360> really<00:02:19.630> weird<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:21.430> when<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.580> got<00:02:21.730> to

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
this is really weird so when I got to

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.180 
this is really weird so when I got to
number<00:02:22.120> three<00:02:22.450> cylinder<00:02:23.020> number<00:02:23.170> three<00:02:23.290> and

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
number three cylinder number three and

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.640 
number three cylinder number three and
I'm<00:02:24.310> watching<00:02:24.460> the<00:02:24.670> rocker<00:02:24.880> arms<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:27.400> see

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
I'm watching the rocker arms and I see

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.430 
I'm watching the rocker arms and I see
one<00:02:29.650> is<00:02:29.980> up<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:31.780> other<00:02:31.960> one<00:02:32.050> is<00:02:32.320> still

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
one is up and the other one is still

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.510 
one is up and the other one is still
down<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.520> I<00:02:33.700> wonder<00:02:34.000> what<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.330> heck<00:02:34.480> is<00:02:34.660> that

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
down and I wonder what the heck is that

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.420 
down and I wonder what the heck is that
so<00:02:36.520> I<00:02:37.000> came<00:02:37.240> over<00:02:37.630> and<00:02:37.870> felt<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:38.709> it<00:02:38.800> was<00:02:38.920> it

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
so I came over and felt it and it was it

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.390 
so I came over and felt it and it was it
was<00:02:39.550> loose<00:02:39.760> oh<00:02:41.430> my<00:02:42.430> god<00:02:42.640> I<00:02:42.850> bet<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.209> valve<00:02:44.400> and

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
was loose oh my god I bet the valve and

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.570 
was loose oh my god I bet the valve and
then<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.610> couple<00:02:45.940> of<00:02:46.709> seconds<00:02:47.709> later<00:02:47.920> I<00:02:48.130> checked

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
then a couple of seconds later I checked

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.400 
then a couple of seconds later I checked
it<00:02:48.730> again<00:02:48.970> wait<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.600> minute<00:02:49.900> what's<00:02:50.050> going<00:02:50.110> on

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
it again wait a minute what's going on

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.240 
it again wait a minute what's going on
so<00:02:50.820> I'll<00:02:51.820> do<00:02:52.030> a<00:02:52.060> reenactment<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:52.959> that

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
so I'll do a reenactment of that

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.460 
so I'll do a reenactment of that
situation<00:02:54.250> by<00:02:55.239> manually<00:02:55.810> opening<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.290> valve

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
situation by manually opening the valve

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.699 
situation by manually opening the valve
the<00:02:56.800> cylinder<00:02:57.130> is<00:02:57.220> act<00:02:57.430> top<00:02:57.640> dead<00:02:57.880> center<00:02:58.209> so

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
the cylinder is act top dead center so

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.620 
the cylinder is act top dead center so
we're<00:02:59.709> okay<00:03:00.010> there<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:01.570> I'll<00:03:01.690> open<00:03:01.900> this<00:03:02.140> up

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
we're okay there and I'll open this up

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.500 
we're okay there and I'll open this up
and<00:03:04.630> I'll<00:03:04.959> let<00:03:04.989> go<00:03:05.200> of<00:03:05.560> it<00:03:06.209> as<00:03:07.209> you<00:03:07.330> can<00:03:07.450> see

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
and I'll let go of it as you can see

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.510 
and I'll let go of it as you can see
know<00:03:08.380> how<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.160> play<00:03:09.430> there<00:03:09.820> and<00:03:11.070> as<00:03:12.070> I<00:03:12.280> do<00:03:12.340> this

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
know how to play there and as I do this

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.570 
know how to play there and as I do this
you'll<00:03:12.970> see<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.239> get<00:03:13.390> less<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:13.630> less<00:03:14.220> until<00:03:15.220> it

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
you'll see it get less and less until it

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.610 
you'll see it get less and less until it
finally<00:03:15.820> gets<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.209> normal<00:03:16.690> valve<00:03:16.930> lash<00:03:18.420> so<00:03:19.620> how

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
finally gets to normal valve lash so how

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.820 
finally gets to normal valve lash so how
did<00:03:20.830> that<00:03:20.950> happen<00:03:21.720> well<00:03:22.720> we<00:03:23.080> all<00:03:23.260> know<00:03:23.470> this

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
did that happen well we all know this

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.550 
did that happen well we all know this
could<00:03:24.040> be<00:03:24.070> grandpa's<00:03:24.670> motor<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:26.230> I<00:03:26.350> did

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
could be grandpa's motor and I did

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.430 
could be grandpa's motor and I did
detect<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.760> smell<00:03:28.030> of<00:03:28.060> some<00:03:28.420> pretty<00:03:28.720> rank<00:03:29.110> gas

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
detect the smell of some pretty rank gas

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.080 
detect the smell of some pretty rank gas
coming<00:03:29.830> out<00:03:30.010> of<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.220> exhaust<00:03:30.489> when<00:03:30.880> I<00:03:30.940> was

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
coming out of the exhaust when I was

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.680 
coming out of the exhaust when I was
back<00:03:31.269> -<00:03:31.450> see<00:03:31.780> that's<00:03:32.260> not<00:03:32.650> too<00:03:32.890> bad<00:03:33.690> it's

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
back - see that's not too bad it's

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.620 
back - see that's not too bad it's
alright<00:03:35.310> but<00:03:36.310> this<00:03:36.489> one<00:03:36.670> has<00:03:36.850> to<00:03:37.000> seal<00:03:37.180> -<00:03:37.450> if

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
alright but this one has to seal - if

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.780 
alright but this one has to seal - if
one<00:03:37.840> of<00:03:37.959> these<00:03:38.049> is<00:03:38.320> staying<00:03:38.560> open<00:03:38.799> you're<00:03:39.670> not

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
one of these is staying open you're not

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.280 
one of these is staying open you're not
gonna<00:03:39.910> get<00:03:40.120> compressional<00:03:41.850> so<00:03:42.850> I'm<00:03:43.750> not<00:03:44.019> sure

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
gonna get compressional so I'm not sure

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.430 
gonna get compressional so I'm not sure
what<00:03:44.470> to<00:03:44.590> do<00:03:44.739> here<00:03:44.769> you<00:03:45.370> know<00:03:45.489> I<00:03:45.519> could

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
what to do here you know I could

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.280 
what to do here you know I could
possibly<00:03:47.440> get<00:03:47.739> to<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.630> valves<00:03:50.040> through<00:03:51.040> the

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
possibly get to the valves through the

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.310 
possibly get to the valves through the
take<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.410> intake<00:03:53.680> manifold<00:03:54.100> off<00:03:54.310> I<00:03:55.170> know<00:03:56.170> I

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
take the intake manifold off I know I

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.140 
take the intake manifold off I know I
could<00:03:56.560> get<00:03:56.739> -<00:03:56.830> if<00:03:57.070> I<00:03:57.130> take<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.459> head<00:03:57.610> off<00:03:57.640> a<00:03:57.790> man

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
could get - if I take the head off a man

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.949 
could get - if I take the head off a man
I<00:03:58.180> don't<00:03:58.480> want<00:03:58.600> to<00:03:58.690> do<00:03:58.810> that<00:03:58.989> job<00:04:00.959> actually

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
I don't want to do that job actually

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.020 
I don't want to do that job actually
what<00:04:02.200> I<00:04:02.230> could<00:04:02.500> do<00:04:02.650> is<00:04:02.980> pull<00:04:03.489> this<00:04:03.610> injection

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
what I could do is pull this injection

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.680 
what I could do is pull this injection
rail<00:04:04.420> pull<00:04:05.049> the<00:04:05.140> injectors<00:04:05.910> take<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.150> rocker

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
rail pull the injectors take the rocker

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.390 
rail pull the injectors take the rocker
arms<00:04:08.080> off<00:04:08.260> so<00:04:08.440> all<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.829> valves<00:04:09.070> will<00:04:09.280> be

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
arms off so all the valves will be

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.840 
arms off so all the valves will be
closed<00:04:09.760> and<00:04:10.890> put<00:04:11.890> some<00:04:12.010> sea<00:04:12.190> foam<00:04:12.400> down<00:04:12.670> in

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
closed and put some sea foam down in

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.479 
closed and put some sea foam down in
there<00:04:13.030> and<00:04:13.150> let<00:04:13.269> it<00:04:13.390> sit<00:04:13.660> and<00:04:14.190> then<00:04:15.190> vacuum

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
there and let it sit and then vacuum

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.449 
there and let it sit and then vacuum
that<00:04:15.850> out<00:04:16.030> and<00:04:16.180> blast<00:04:16.630> it<00:04:16.810> with<00:04:16.930> air<00:04:17.400> try<00:04:18.400> the

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
that out and blast it with air try the

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.469 
that out and blast it with air try the
test<00:04:18.820> again

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
test again

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:23.060 
test again
and<00:04:19.810> maybe<00:04:20.620> that'll<00:04:20.890> do<00:04:21.099> it<00:04:21.270> well<00:04:22.270> we'll<00:04:22.510> see

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
and maybe that'll do it well we'll see

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.310 
and maybe that'll do it well we'll see
thanks<00:04:24.070> for<00:04:24.190> watching
