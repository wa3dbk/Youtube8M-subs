00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
and then we're going to go over here and

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.730 
and then we're going to go over here and
this<00:04:09.300> is<00:04:09.480> what<00:04:09.630> our<00:04:09.660> meat<00:04:09.930> looks<00:04:10.140> like<00:04:10.440> when

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
this is what our meat looks like when

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.140 
this is what our meat looks like when
it's<00:04:10.890> been<00:04:11.070> cooked<00:04:11.340> you<00:04:11.490> can<00:04:11.520> see<00:04:11.850> that<00:04:12.030> it's

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
it's been cooked you can see that it's

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.920 
it's been cooked you can see that it's
tender<00:04:12.750> it<00:04:13.380> flakes<00:04:13.830> apart<00:04:14.010> with<00:04:14.610> your<00:04:14.640> fork<00:04:15.600> so

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
tender it flakes apart with your fork so

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.170 
tender it flakes apart with your fork so
you<00:04:15.990> take<00:04:16.230> two<00:04:16.440> forks<00:04:16.739> you<00:04:17.430> pull<00:04:17.730> your<00:04:17.850> pork

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
favorite barbecue sauce it could be a

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.800 
favorite barbecue sauce it could be a
barbecue<00:04:29.910> sauce<00:04:29.940> that<00:04:30.270> you<00:04:30.330> make<00:04:30.480> on<00:04:30.630> your<00:04:30.660> own

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
barbecue sauce that you make on your own

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.870 
barbecue sauce that you make on your own

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
it could be store bought but basically

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.850 
it could be store bought but basically
this<00:04:33.240> is<00:04:33.300> going<00:04:33.600> to<00:04:33.660> infuse<00:04:34.140> into<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.530> pork

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
this is going to infuse into the pork

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.000 
this is going to infuse into the pork
and<00:04:35.070> then<00:04:35.580> two<00:04:36.360> options<00:04:36.810> here<00:04:36.900> you<00:04:37.620> can<00:04:37.800> use<00:04:37.980> it

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
and then two options here you can use it

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.770 
and then two options here you can use it
just<00:04:38.250> like<00:04:38.370> this<00:04:38.640> if<00:04:38.790> your<00:04:38.910> pork<00:04:39.180> is<00:04:39.300> still<00:04:39.540> hot

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
just like this if your pork is still hot

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.810 
just like this if your pork is still hot
this<00:04:40.500> can<00:04:40.740> go<00:04:40.860> right<00:04:41.160> back<00:04:41.340> into<00:04:41.610> your

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
this can go right back into your

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.400 
this can go right back into your
crock-pot<00:04:42.120> if<00:04:42.540> you're<00:04:42.660> serving<00:04:43.080> a<00:04:43.170> large

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
crock-pot if you're serving a large

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.040 
crock-pot if you're serving a large
party<00:04:43.950> and<00:04:44.190> then<00:04:44.760> you<00:04:44.880> serve<00:04:45.240> it<00:04:45.360> buffet<00:04:45.720> style

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
party and then you serve it buffet style

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.500 
party and then you serve it buffet style
so<00:04:46.500> you<00:04:46.590> have<00:04:46.800> your<00:04:46.830> pulled<00:04:47.160> pork<00:04:47.360> mixed<00:04:48.360> in
