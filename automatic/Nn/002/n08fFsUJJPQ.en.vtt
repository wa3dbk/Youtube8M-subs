helping us out and demonstrate some of

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.270 
helping us out and demonstrate some of
the<00:00:33.540> drills<00:00:33.690> today<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.890> first<00:00:35.100> principle

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
the drills today the first principle

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.549 
the drills today the first principle
we're<00:00:35.700> looking<00:00:35.969> for<00:00:36.270> with<00:00:37.170> our<00:00:37.290> running

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
we're looking for with our running

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.590 
we're looking for with our running
technique<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:38.190> having<00:00:38.489> nice<00:00:38.730> strong<00:00:39.270> stiff

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
technique is having nice strong stiff

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.290 
technique is having nice strong stiff
feet<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.590> really<00:00:40.860> our<00:00:40.890> feet<00:00:41.309> should<00:00:41.550> actors<00:00:41.940> a

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
feet so really our feet should actors a

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.049 
feet so really our feet should actors a
force<00:00:42.930> transfer<00:00:43.620> from<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.309> forces<00:00:44.820> generated

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
force transfer from the forces generated

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.279 
force transfer from the forces generated
in<00:00:45.270> our<00:00:45.360> pelvis<00:00:45.660> stretch<00:00:45.870> through<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
in our pelvis stretch through to the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.400 
in our pelvis stretch through to the
ground<00:00:47.000> so<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.030> want<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.510> see<00:00:48.750> good<00:00:49.110> runners

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
ground so I want to see good runners

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.639 
ground so I want to see good runners
having<00:00:49.739> nice<00:00:49.950> strong<00:00:50.489> stiff<00:00:50.850> feet<00:00:51.230> so<00:00:52.230> here

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
having nice strong stiff feet so here

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.689 
having nice strong stiff feet so here
are<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> few<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.129> drills<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.430> we<00:00:53.550> actually

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
are a few of the drills that we actually

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.760 
are a few of the drills that we actually
use<00:00:54.030> for<00:00:54.360> our<00:00:54.539> our<00:00:54.809> stiff<00:00:55.170> feet<00:00:55.379> now<00:00:55.559> foot

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
use for our our stiff feet now foot

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.850 
body and that will give us really nice
strong<00:02:22.600> hip<00:02:22.810> flexors<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.320> front<00:02:23.500> of<00:02:23.560> our<00:02:23.650> hip

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
strong hip flexors the front of our hip

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.100 
strong hip flexors the front of our hip
to<00:02:24.100> allow<00:02:24.370> us<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.730> get<00:02:25.120> our<00:02:25.239> stride<00:02:25.660> length<00:02:25.959> in

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
to allow us to get our stride length in

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.229 
to allow us to get our stride length in
the<00:02:26.140> front<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.560> us<00:02:26.730> while<00:02:27.730> we're<00:02:27.940> doing<00:02:28.060> all

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
the front of us while we're doing all

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.820 
the front of us while we're doing all
these<00:02:28.360> drills<00:02:28.600> working<00:02:28.810> really<00:02:29.170> hard<00:02:29.290> at<00:02:29.709> a

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
these drills working really hard at a

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.740 
these drills working really hard at a
little<00:02:30.430> forward<00:02:30.640> lean<00:02:31.000> posture<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:31.630> we're

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
little forward lean posture so we're

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.630 
little forward lean posture so we're
trying<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:32.110> use<00:02:32.140> gravity<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.070> our<00:02:33.340> advantage

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
trying to use gravity to our advantage

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.400 
trying to use gravity to our advantage
so<00:02:34.060> that<00:02:34.209> if<00:02:34.780> I'm<00:02:34.959> actually<00:02:35.050> going<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.380> be

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
so that if I'm actually going to be

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.140 
so that if I'm actually going to be
falling<00:02:35.770> for<00:02:35.800> words<00:02:36.280> I'm<00:02:36.430> going<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.700> travel<00:02:36.940> in

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
falling for words I'm going to travel in

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.240 
falling for words I'm going to travel in
the<00:02:37.239> direction<00:02:37.390> I<00:02:37.690> want<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:37.900> go<00:02:37.989> so<00:02:38.800> gravity<00:02:39.190> is

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
the direction I want to go so gravity is

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.710 
the direction I want to go so gravity is
like<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.459> little<00:02:39.730> bit<00:02:39.820> of<00:02:39.910> free<00:02:40.120> energy<00:02:40.360> if

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
like a little bit of free energy if

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.229 
like a little bit of free energy if
you're<00:02:40.870> like<00:02:41.459> so<00:02:42.459> our<00:02:42.610> butt<00:02:42.790> kick<00:02:43.000> then

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
you're like so our butt kick then

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.140 
you're like so our butt kick then
basically<00:02:44.160> progresses<00:02:45.160> to<00:02:45.459> a<00:02:45.489> foot<00:02:45.790> strike

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
basically progresses to a foot strike

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.030 
basically progresses to a foot strike
drill<00:02:46.480> and<00:02:46.660> what<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.200> like<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.530> see<00:02:47.560> what<00:02:47.769> effort

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
drill and what I like to see what effort

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.130 
drill and what I like to see what effort
strike<00:02:48.310> drill<00:02:48.610> is<00:02:48.790> a<00:02:48.820> nice<00:02:49.090> upright<00:02:49.540> stance

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
strike drill is a nice upright stance

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.600 
strike drill is a nice upright stance
posture<00:02:50.620> with<00:02:50.739> that<00:02:50.860> little<00:02:50.980> bit<00:02:51.160> of<00:02:51.190> forwards

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
posture with that little bit of forwards

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.479 
posture with that little bit of forwards
lean<00:02:51.820> and<00:02:52.170> my<00:02:53.170> foot<00:02:53.500> should<00:02:53.769> basically<00:02:54.220> be

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
lean and my foot should basically be

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.250 
lean and my foot should basically be
traveling<00:02:55.030> backwards<00:02:55.570> in<00:02:55.690> space<00:02:55.959> when<00:02:56.230> I

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
traveling backwards in space when I

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.710 
traveling backwards in space when I
strike<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.860> ground<00:02:57.100> so<00:02:58.090> you'll<00:02:58.239> see<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.540> boys

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
strike the ground so you'll see the boys

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.479 
strike the ground so you'll see the boys
going<00:02:59.019> to<00:02:59.170> do<00:02:59.320> this<00:02:59.470> quite<00:02:59.769> nicely<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.400> then

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
going to do this quite nicely and then

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:01.830 
going to do this quite nicely and then
hopefully<00:03:00.970> where<00:03:01.120> we're<00:03:01.510> going<00:03:01.630> to<00:03:01.690> progress

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
hopefully where we're going to progress

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.680 
hopefully where we're going to progress
that<00:03:02.230> into<00:03:02.560> a<00:03:03.160> little<00:03:03.850> bit<00:03:03.940> of<00:03:04.030> movement<00:03:04.239> drill

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
that into a little bit of movement drill

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.150 
that into a little bit of movement drill
so<00:03:05.019> we're<00:03:05.170> going<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.350> get<00:03:05.440> them<00:03:05.590> traveling

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
so we're going to get them traveling

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.009 
so we're going to get them traveling
along<00:03:06.459> getting<00:03:06.850> that<00:03:07.060> sensation<00:03:07.239> of<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.810> foot

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
along getting that sensation of the foot

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.990 
along getting that sensation of the foot
traveling<00:03:08.410> backwards<00:03:09.340> in<00:03:09.459> space<00:03:09.760> and

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
traveling backwards in space and

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.570 
traveling backwards in space and
striking<00:03:10.360> directly<00:03:10.870> underneath<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.380> hip<00:03:11.590> as

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
striking directly underneath the hip as

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.229 
striking directly underneath the hip as
they<00:03:13.570> pull<00:03:13.750> their<00:03:13.840> leg<00:03:14.019> backwards<00:03:14.350> in<00:03:14.470> space

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
they pull their leg backwards in space

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.250 
they pull their leg backwards in space
then<00:03:16.239> we're<00:03:16.360> going<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:16.510> actually<00:03:16.630> progress<00:03:16.900> to

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
then we're going to actually progress to

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.180 
then we're going to actually progress to
some<00:03:17.410> run<00:03:17.560> throughs<00:03:17.860> and<00:03:17.890> we're<00:03:18.040> going<00:03:18.160> to

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
some run throughs and we're going to

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.100 
some run throughs and we're going to
trying<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.489> utilize<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:19.390> feelings<00:03:19.900> that<00:03:19.959> we

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
trying to utilize the feelings that we

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.600 
trying to utilize the feelings that we
had<00:03:20.290> in<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.470> previous<00:03:20.560> drills<00:03:21.070> in<00:03:21.250> 12<00:03:21.489> run

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
had in the previous drills in 12 run

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.340 
had in the previous drills in 12 run
throughs<00:03:21.910> so<00:03:22.570> you'll<00:03:22.690> see<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.959> boys<00:03:23.110> here

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
throughs so you'll see the boys here

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.890 
throughs so you'll see the boys here
starting<00:03:23.950> with<00:03:23.980> some<00:03:24.459> about<00:03:25.180> butt<00:03:25.450> kick<00:03:25.720> high

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
starting with some about butt kick high

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.020 
starting with some about butt kick high
lifts<00:03:26.350> and<00:03:26.560> really<00:03:26.799> high<00:03:27.010> turnover<00:03:27.670> and

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
lifts and really high turnover and

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.190 
lifts and really high turnover and
progressing<00:03:28.480> that<00:03:28.600> through<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:29.019> a<00:03:29.049> normal

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
progressing that through to a normal

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.790 
progressing that through to a normal
running

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
running

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:48.790 
running
running<00:03:30.310> drew

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.500 

some<00:03:49.580> of<00:03:49.640> the<00:03:49.700> other<00:03:49.850> drills<00:03:50.090> that<00:03:50.180> we<00:03:50.300> can<00:03:50.480> use

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
some of the other drills that we can use

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.480 
some of the other drills that we can use
again<00:03:51.080> to<00:03:51.320> encourage<00:03:51.740> our<00:03:51.890> butt<00:03:52.040> kicks<00:03:52.310> is

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
again to encourage our butt kicks is

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.820 
again to encourage our butt kicks is
like<00:03:52.700> a<00:03:52.730> lunge<00:03:53.090> but<00:03:53.480> kick<00:03:53.720> so<00:03:54.350> the<00:03:54.440> boys<00:03:54.620> go

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
like a lunge but kick so the boys go

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.310 
like a lunge but kick so the boys go
into<00:03:55.040> a<00:03:55.070> lunge<00:03:55.340> and<00:03:55.730> then<00:03:55.790> but<00:03:56.330> kick<00:03:56.540> up<00:03:56.720> out

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
into a lunge and then but kick up out

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.910 
into a lunge and then but kick up out
lunge<00:03:57.890> but<00:03:58.280> kick<00:03:58.490> up<00:03:58.640> at<00:03:58.940> lunch<00:03:59.420> the<00:04:00.050> technique

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
lunge but kick up at lunch the technique

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.500 
lunge but kick up at lunch the technique
that<00:04:01.100> we're<00:04:01.220> working<00:04:01.370> on<00:04:01.670> in<00:04:01.820> these<00:04:02.120> running
