dragged<00:00:24.359> on<00:00:24.800> quite<00:00:25.800> long<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.640> thought<00:00:26.880> I

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
dragged on quite long so I thought I

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.960

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
would just you know take this round and

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.189 
would just you know take this round and
upload<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.300> because<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.720> have<00:00:30.840> something

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
started happening when i moved my setup

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.090 
started happening when i moved my setup
um<00:01:17.390> you<00:01:18.390> know<00:01:18.540> it's<00:01:18.960> not<00:01:19.290> recording<00:01:19.950> with

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
um you know it's not recording with

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.190 
um you know it's not recording with
audio<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> audio<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.270> getting<00:01:21.780> recorded

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
audio like the audio is getting recorded

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.130 
audio like the audio is getting recorded
but<00:01:22.950> it's<00:01:23.130> like<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.670> audios<00:01:24.090> off<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.930> it's

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
but it's like the audios off and it's

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.469 
but it's like the audios off and it's
delayed<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.920> then<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.549> not<00:01:26.759> showing<00:01:27.060> up<00:01:27.299> in

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
delayed and then it's not showing up in

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.899 
delayed and then it's not showing up in
Vegas<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.110> i'm<00:01:28.200> assuming<00:01:28.460> has<00:01:29.460> something<00:01:29.850> to

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
Vegas so i'm assuming has something to

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.359 
Vegas so i'm assuming has something to
do<00:01:30.030> with<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.270> codec<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.990> what<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:31.829> recording

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
do with the codec of what it's recording

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.249 
do with the codec of what it's recording
in<00:01:32.520> anyways<00:01:33.119> I've<00:01:33.329> tried<00:01:33.600> everything<00:01:33.960> I've

beta<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.650> think<00:03:40.890> that's<00:03:41.099> just<00:03:41.340> because<00:03:41.580> the

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
beta and I think that's just because the

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.229 
beta and I think that's just because the
game<00:03:42.330> was<00:03:42.360> you<00:03:43.200> know<00:03:43.319> it<00:03:43.470> was<00:03:43.530> closed<00:03:44.040> beta<00:03:44.819> and

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
game was you know it was closed beta and

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.199 
game was you know it was closed beta and
it<00:03:45.780> wasn't<00:03:46.319> getting<00:03:46.709> tested<00:03:47.549> by<00:03:47.700> anyone<00:03:48.180> who

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
it wasn't getting tested by anyone who

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.250 
it wasn't getting tested by anyone who
wasn't<00:03:48.690> under<00:03:49.379> you<00:03:49.920> know<00:03:49.950> NDA<00:03:50.519> so<00:03:50.670> um<00:03:51.260> the

wasn't under you know NDA so um the

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.539 
wasn't under you know NDA so um the
reason<00:03:52.379> I<00:03:52.680> think<00:03:52.769> we're<00:03:53.040> going<00:03:53.159> to<00:03:53.220> be<00:03:53.310> able<00:03:53.370> to

back in gears one but it got it has to
be<00:05:26.949> close<00:05:27.490> to<00:05:27.520> seven<00:05:27.970> to<00:05:28.060> eight<00:05:28.210> years<00:05:28.479> since

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
be close to seven to eight years since

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.330 
be close to seven to eight years since
they've<00:05:28.870> even<00:05:29.139> touched<00:05:29.410> a<00:05:29.590> Gears<00:05:29.830> of<00:05:29.889> War<00:05:29.979> game

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
they've even touched a Gears of War game

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.219 
they've even touched a Gears of War game
and<00:05:30.580> I<00:05:30.849> don't<00:05:31.000> even<00:05:31.090> know<00:05:31.300> about<00:05:31.449> tmartn<00:05:32.139> you

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
and I don't even know about tmartn you

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.659 
and I don't even know about tmartn you
know<00:05:32.380> so<00:05:33.310> why<00:05:33.639> why<00:05:34.330> are<00:05:34.690> they<00:05:34.930> invited<00:05:35.680> why<00:05:36.430> are

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
know so why why are they invited why are

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:37.950 
know so why why are they invited why are
they<00:05:36.789> going<00:05:36.940> to<00:05:37.000> be<00:05:37.120> there<00:05:37.330> and<00:05:37.419> I<00:05:37.510> think<00:05:37.780> the

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
they going to be there and I think the

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.020 
they going to be there and I think the
easiest<00:05:38.229> answer<00:05:38.740> is<00:05:39.099> that<00:05:39.310> it's<00:05:39.610> just<00:05:39.880> going

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
easiest answer is that it's just going

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.939 
easiest answer is that it's just going
to<00:05:40.060> be<00:05:40.120> playable<00:05:40.599> and<00:05:40.840> they<00:05:40.960> want<00:05:41.260> them<00:05:41.620> to

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:41.949 
to be playable and they want them to

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:44.460 
to be playable and they want them to
test<00:05:42.190> the<00:05:42.370> game<00:05:42.520> out<00:05:42.729> to<00:05:42.760> give<00:05:43.060> it<00:05:43.180> a<00:05:43.240> chance<00:05:43.479> so

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
test the game out to give it a chance so

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.899 
test the game out to give it a chance so
hopefully<00:05:44.860> that<00:05:45.070> they<00:05:45.190> like<00:05:45.430> it<00:05:45.669> and<00:05:45.820> they

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:45.909 
hopefully that they like it and they

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:48.839 
hopefully that they like it and they
share<00:05:46.210> it<00:05:46.300> with<00:05:46.360> their<00:05:46.449> fans<00:05:46.870> and<00:05:47.460> you<00:05:48.460> know<00:05:48.580> we

hype for the Gears of War franchise

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.500 
hype for the Gears of War franchise
which<00:06:14.740> is<00:06:14.889> good<00:06:15.099> that's<00:06:15.310> why<00:06:15.550> I<00:06:15.580> think<00:06:16.000> like

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510 
which is good that's why I think like

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.120 
which is good that's why I think like
some<00:06:16.930> of<00:06:16.960> the<00:06:17.080> competitive<00:06:17.590> players<00:06:17.830> in<00:06:18.039> the

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
some of the competitive players in the

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.680 
some of the competitive players in the
gears<00:06:18.340> community<00:06:18.789> didn't<00:06:19.030> really<00:06:19.240> understand

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
gears community didn't really understand

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.020 
gears community didn't really understand
why<00:06:19.870> they<00:06:20.080> weren't<00:06:20.229> invited<00:06:20.770> and<00:06:20.919> the<00:06:21.639> the

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.030 
why they weren't invited and the the

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.659 
why they weren't invited and the the
answer<00:06:22.419> is<00:06:22.630> because<00:06:23.080> you<00:06:23.949> don't<00:06:24.190> have<00:06:24.400> a<00:06:24.430> big

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:24.669 
answer is because you don't have a big

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:27.089 
answer is because you don't have a big
fan<00:06:24.970> base<00:06:25.210> and<00:06:25.479> it's<00:06:25.630> not<00:06:25.840> and<00:06:26.650> that's<00:06:26.949> not

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:27.099 
fan base and it's not and that's not

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:28.649 
fan base and it's not and that's not
something<00:06:27.340> that<00:06:27.669> can<00:06:27.760> change<00:06:28.030> but<00:06:28.330> it's<00:06:28.449> just

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:28.659 
something that can change but it's just

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:30.750 
something that can change but it's just
it's<00:06:28.960> just<00:06:29.080> the<00:06:29.440> truth<00:06:29.680> like<00:06:30.039> they're<00:06:30.580> not

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
it's just the truth like they're not

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.490 
it's just the truth like they're not
going<00:06:30.880> to<00:06:30.940> invite<00:06:31.240> somebody<00:06:31.630> who<00:06:31.960> is<00:06:32.080> popular
