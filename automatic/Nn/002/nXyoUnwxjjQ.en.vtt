because<00:03:00.230> we<00:03:00.350> have<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.500> system<00:03:00.770> now<00:03:01.130> obviously

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
because we have a system now obviously

because we have a system now obviously
we<00:03:01.820> gotta<00:03:01.970> teach<00:03:02.180> that<00:03:02.210> system<00:03:02.780> which<00:03:02.930> starts

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
we gotta teach that system which starts

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.560 
we gotta teach that system which starts
from<00:03:03.350> Ground<00:03:03.680> Zero<00:03:03.800> and<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:05.180> like<00:03:05.420> I<00:03:05.510> said

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
from Ground Zero and and like I said

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.360 
from Ground Zero and and like I said
we're<00:03:06.110> three<00:03:06.290> days<00:03:06.440> into<00:03:06.710> that<00:03:06.860> system<00:03:07.070> so

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
we're three days into that system so

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.980 
we're three days into that system so
we'll<00:03:07.550> keep<00:03:07.700> pounding<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.210> keep<00:03:08.390> grinding<00:03:08.810> and

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
we'll keep pounding to keep grinding and

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.050 
we'll keep pounding to keep grinding and
we'll<00:03:09.590> get<00:03:09.710> there<00:03:09.890> eventually<00:03:09.980> long<00:03:10.670> she<00:03:10.850> did

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
we'll get there eventually long she did

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.730 
we'll get there eventually long she did
some<00:03:11.300> good<00:03:11.420> things<00:03:11.480> that<00:03:11.990> time<00:03:12.350> specially

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
some good things that time specially

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.590 
some good things that time specially
laid<00:03:12.920> down<00:03:13.070> the<00:03:13.220> air<00:03:13.340> but<00:03:13.520> he's<00:03:14.090> kind<00:03:14.390> of<00:03:14.420> most

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
laid down the air but he's kind of most

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.970 
laid down the air but he's kind of most
important<00:03:14.900> things<00:03:15.050> in<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.260> spring<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.740> find

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
important things in the spring to find

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.610 
important things in the spring to find
consistency<00:03:16.520> is<00:03:17.030> kind<00:03:17.270> of<00:03:17.360> overall<00:03:17.660> yeah<00:03:18.590> a

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
consistency is kind of overall yeah a

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.230 
consistency is kind of overall yeah a
hundred<00:03:18.890> percent<00:03:19.130> you<00:03:19.490> know<00:03:19.520> talk<00:03:19.850> about<00:03:20.090> all

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
hundred percent you know talk about all

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.880 
hundred percent you know talk about all
the<00:03:20.330> time<00:03:20.570> you<00:03:20.780> know<00:03:20.930> just<00:03:21.260> not<00:03:21.470> making<00:03:21.710> the

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
the time you know just not making the

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.160 
the time you know just not making the
big<00:03:22.100> play<00:03:22.340> but<00:03:22.640> but<00:03:23.150> being<00:03:23.330> consistent<00:03:23.960> and

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
big play but but being consistent and

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.620 
big play but but being consistent and

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
you know they're well aware of their

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.230 
you know they're well aware of their
flaws<00:03:26.870> last<00:03:27.200> year<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:27.950> how<00:03:28.100> many<00:03:28.130> passes<00:03:29.120> we

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
flaws last year and how many passes we

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.960 
flaws last year and how many passes we
dropped<00:03:29.600> and<00:03:29.900> you<00:03:30.770> know<00:03:30.890> some<00:03:31.100> some<00:03:31.430> chances

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
dropped and you know some some chances

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.400 
dropped and you know some some chances
that<00:03:32.090> we<00:03:32.210> had<00:03:32.360> and<00:03:32.450> we<00:03:32.510> didn't<00:03:32.780> make<00:03:32.900> plays<00:03:33.170> on

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
that we had and we didn't make plays on

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.930 
that we had and we didn't make plays on
it<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:33.740> so<00:03:34.010> that's<00:03:34.430> why<00:03:34.610> we're<00:03:34.790> practicing

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
it and so that's why we're practicing

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.910 
it and so that's why we're practicing
extra<00:03:35.870> hard<00:03:36.050> right<00:03:36.230> now<00:03:36.260> you<00:03:36.410> know<00:03:36.620> I<00:03:36.650> think

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
extra hard right now you know I think

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.910 
extra hard right now you know I think
that<00:03:37.070> kind<00:03:37.310> of<00:03:37.400> gives<00:03:37.880> you<00:03:38.030> a<00:03:38.590> false<00:03:39.590> sense<00:03:39.680> of

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
that kind of gives you a false sense of

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.490 
that kind of gives you a false sense of
reality<00:03:40.100> like<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:41.450> bowl<00:03:41.660> game<00:03:41.870> did<00:03:42.080> last<00:03:42.350> year

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
reality like the bowl game did last year

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.470 
reality like the bowl game did last year
for<00:03:42.800> us<00:03:42.890> and<00:03:43.040> you<00:03:43.550> know<00:03:43.670> we're<00:03:43.820> fine-tuning<00:03:44.090> it

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
for us and you know we're fine-tuning it

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.960 
for us and you know we're fine-tuning it
right<00:03:44.660> now<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:45.050> and<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:46.370> know<00:03:46.400> Coach<00:03:46.730> chef

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
and I get to spend more one-on-one time

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.860
