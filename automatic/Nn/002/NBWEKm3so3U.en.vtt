fires from them they have a chance of

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.069 
fires from them they have a chance of
dropping<00:01:36.000> one<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.840> two<00:01:37.020> volatile<00:01:37.380> fires<00:01:37.619> /<00:01:38.040> and

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
dropping one to two volatile fires / and

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.539 
dropping one to two volatile fires / and
yeah<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.590> second<00:01:40.890> way<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.310> farm

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
yeah so the second way you can farm

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.889 
yeah so the second way you can farm
volatile<00:01:41.939> fires<00:01:42.150> here<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.659> by<00:01:42.840> killing

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
volatile fires here is by killing

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.600 
volatile fires here is by killing

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.410 
k health they die pretty quickly if
you're<00:01:49.920> kind<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.189> geared<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:51.270> good<00:01:51.390> thing

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
you're kind of geared and the good thing

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.550 
you're kind of geared and the good thing
about<00:01:51.540> these<00:01:51.810> guys<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.079> they<00:01:52.350> have<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
about these guys is they have the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.080 
about these guys is they have the
highest<00:01:52.710> chance<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.280> dropping<00:01:53.520> volatile

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
highest chance of dropping volatile

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.649 
highest chance of dropping volatile
fires<00:01:54.270> from<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.689> mob<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:56.280> they<00:01:57.240> have<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.420> chance

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
fires from a mob and they have a chance

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.399 
fires from a mob and they have a chance
of<00:01:57.719> dropping<00:01:57.869> 123<00:01:58.829> volatile<00:01:59.549> fires<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
of dropping 123 volatile fires so the

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.590 
of dropping 123 volatile fires so the
poles<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.860> get<00:02:02.009> one<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.280> two<00:02:02.460> but<00:02:02.820> these<00:02:03.270> guys

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
poles you get one to two but these guys

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.899 
poles you get one to two but these guys
are<00:02:03.869> definitely<00:02:04.049> good<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.530> farm<00:02:04.920> if<00:02:05.340> you're

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
are definitely good to farm if you're

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.729 
are definitely good to farm if you're
waiting<00:02:06.299> for<00:02:06.329> pools<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.409> respawn<00:02:07.829> and

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
waiting for pools to respawn and

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.630 
waiting for pools to respawn and
they<00:02:10.739> have<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> really<00:02:11.190> high<00:02:11.310> chance<00:02:11.550> of

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
they have a really high chance of

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.430 
they have a really high chance of
dropping<00:02:11.819> them<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.360> find<00:02:12.690> these<00:02:13.410> guys

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
dropping them and I find these guys

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.559 
dropping them and I find these guys
actually<00:02:13.860> drop<00:02:14.340> more<00:02:14.550> than<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.910> pools<00:02:15.239> but

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
actually drop more than the pools but

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.680 
actually drop more than the pools but
the<00:02:15.720> pools<00:02:15.959> is<00:02:16.080> always<00:02:16.379> a<00:02:16.410> chance<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:17.690> will

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
the pools is always a chance to will

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.750 
the pools is always a chance to will
always<00:02:18.989> give<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.230> volatile<00:02:19.800> fires<00:02:22.069> so<00:02:23.069> I'm

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
always give you volatile fires so I'm

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.220 
always give you volatile fires so I'm
right<00:02:24.090> now<00:02:24.209> as<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.420> see<00:02:24.540> on<00:02:24.569> my<00:02:24.750> timer<00:02:24.989> I'm
