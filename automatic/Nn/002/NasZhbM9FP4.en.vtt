today<00:00:05.650> I'm<00:00:05.770> gonna<00:00:05.950> demonstrate<00:00:06.310> how<00:00:07.000> easy<00:00:07.330> it

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:07.630 
today I'm gonna demonstrate how easy it

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.410 
today I'm gonna demonstrate how easy it
is<00:00:07.720> to<00:00:08.200> calibrate<00:00:08.680> your<00:00:09.010> new<00:00:09.280> Kerbal<00:00:09.940> or<00:00:10.090> mini

this button has two purposes when you

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.310 
this button has two purposes when you
push<00:00:44.500> it<00:00:44.530> and<00:00:44.980> your<00:00:45.160> sensor<00:00:45.699> is<00:00:45.730> aimed<00:00:46.329> at<00:00:46.719> an

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
push it and your sensor is aimed at an

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.970 
push it and your sensor is aimed at an
object<00:00:47.530> it<00:00:48.460> will<00:00:48.699> emit<00:00:49.090> a<00:00:49.120> tone<00:00:49.980> indicating

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
object it will emit a tone indicating

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.959 
object it will emit a tone indicating
that<00:00:51.010> the<00:00:51.309> unit<00:00:51.670> is<00:00:51.850> in<00:00:52.180> the<00:00:52.359> calibration<00:00:52.960> mode

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
that the unit is in the calibration mode

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.110 
that the unit is in the calibration mode
pushing<00:00:54.969> it<00:00:55.180> will<00:00:55.390> also<00:00:55.960> set<00:00:56.289> the<00:00:56.469> distance<00:00:57.120> of

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
pushing it will also set the distance of

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.750 
pushing it will also set the distance of
alert<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.949> the<00:01:00.070> object<00:01:01.679> once<00:01:02.679> the<00:01:02.920> tone<00:01:03.460> is

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
alert to the object once the tone is

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.570 
alert to the object once the tone is
heard<00:01:03.789> you<00:01:04.660> can<00:01:04.870> shut<00:01:05.230> off<00:01:05.410> the<00:01:05.710> vehicle<00:01:06.340> and

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.850 
box bringing it down vertically and
measuring<00:02:37.660> from<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:38.019> bottom<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.739> the

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
measuring from the bottom to the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:47.059 
measuring from the bottom to the
pavement<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.750> we're<00:02:41.050> right<00:02:41.290> at<00:02:41.470> four<00:02:41.830> inches

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.559 

so<00:02:48.069> we're<00:02:48.250> basically<00:02:48.730> done<00:02:49.209> with<00:02:49.450> the

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
so we're basically done with the

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.150 
so we're basically done with the
calibration<00:02:50.819> we<00:02:51.819> can<00:02:52.260> allow<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.319> car<00:02:53.709> to<00:02:53.739> set

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
calibration we can allow the car to set

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.120 
calibration we can allow the car to set
for<00:02:54.459> 10<00:02:54.700> minutes<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.870> it<00:02:56.709> will<00:02:56.860> then

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
for 10 minutes and it will then

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.900 
for 10 minutes and it will then
automatically<00:02:57.970> go<00:02:58.330> into<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:59.290> alert<00:02:59.620> mode<00:02:59.950> I'm

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
automatically go into the alert mode I'm

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.130 
automatically go into the alert mode I'm
going<00:03:01.269> to<00:03:01.420> simulate<00:03:01.690> that<00:03:02.019> by<00:03:02.530> turning<00:03:03.340> it<00:03:03.489> off

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
going to simulate that by turning it off

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:12.570 
going to simulate that by turning it off
turning<00:03:05.140> it<00:03:05.350> back<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:07.720> we'll<00:03:07.989> test<00:03:08.260> it<00:03:11.580> alert

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
turning it back and we'll test it alert

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.830 
turning it back and we'll test it alert
at<00:03:12.940> 20<00:03:13.420> inches<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.790> we<00:03:15.910> know<00:03:16.120> from<00:03:16.299> our<00:03:16.510> prior

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
at 20 inches and we know from our prior

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.569 
at 20 inches and we know from our prior
measurement<00:03:17.560> that<00:03:17.680> we're<00:03:17.859> at<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.010> curved<00:03:18.280> bite

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
measurement that we're at a curved bite

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.949 
measurement that we're at a curved bite
to<00:03:18.790> 4<00:03:19.090> inches<00:03:19.600> you<00:03:20.260> can<00:03:20.410> always<00:03:20.620> remove<00:03:21.250> it

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
to 4 inches you can always remove it

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.280 
to 4 inches you can always remove it
should<00:03:22.959> you<00:03:23.290> want<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:24.880> lower<00:03:25.209> that<00:03:25.359> or<00:03:25.870> change

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
should you want to lower that or change

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.370 
should you want to lower that or change
the<00:03:26.620> curve<00:03:26.890> light<00:03:27.160> setting<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.900> simply

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
the curve light setting you simply

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.250 
the curve light setting you simply
rotate<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:29.920> sensor<00:03:30.640> and<00:03:31.030> measure<00:03:31.840> the

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
rotate the sensor and measure the

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.590 
rotate the sensor and measure the
vertical<00:03:32.739> distance<00:03:33.280> between<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:34.150> bottom<00:03:34.359> of

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
vertical distance between the bottom of

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.400 
vertical distance between the bottom of
the<00:03:34.720> box<00:03:34.989> and<00:03:35.829> the<00:03:36.400> pavement<00:03:37.140> hope<00:03:38.140> you

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
the box and the pavement hope you

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.329 
the box and the pavement hope you
enjoyed<00:03:38.799> this<00:03:39.100> thanks<00:03:39.880> very<00:03:40.090> much
