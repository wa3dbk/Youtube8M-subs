 how to uninstall extensions for 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.029
 completely eliminate an extension of 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.639
 browser must install it following the 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.559
 following steps click on the menu 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.780
 chrome located in the bar 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.890
 tools in the librador well then 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.140
 we are going to open a new 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.540
 a new tab let's go to where 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.120
 indicates us in tools in 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.340
 extensions 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.560
 ok that in my extensions that I have 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.430
 currently installed 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.539
 then it says we click on 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.980
 tools then we select 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.630
 extensions that is what we have done 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.370
 I'm going to do it again 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.540
 extensions tools 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.399
 and we fall to this page then it tells us 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.690
 click on the trash can icon located 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.660
 next to the extension you want 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.519
 completely eliminate then the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.730
 suggestion is to eliminate one by one 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.649
 then I have only activated I know 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.649
 that windows media player is not 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.010
 hurting I know that that is not but 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.690
 I'm still had this yes I do not know 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.290
 then this is what I'm going to 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.290
 deactivate 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.520
 the first one deactivated it with that 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.899
 enough to make the page 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.810
 I'm going to open the page that I had 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:20.909
 previously we will see good then 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.009
 this reproduction of the same video and already 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.350
 we see that not even the advertising 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.780
 appears unintentionally many times 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.299
 Bears tours install certain 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.310
 programs and that's their joke 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.500
 these programs like the ares and some 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.569
 others at the end of the installation 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.299
 always comes paula activated one 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:40.950
 tab a popcorn where where you are 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.340
 using by us thing 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.289
 that the installation of such is not true 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.500
 programs like the tour bar or in this 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.929
 case these extensions that we do not 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.429
 we have given authorization but for 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.869
 please well then thank you very much for 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.360
 give next following next the 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.979
 installation this one we do not realize and 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.090
 Well, my problem has been 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.890
 solved I hope that 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.500
 do not have your problem at all 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.369
 solve yours and how do I tell you this 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.440
 and if you continue with that annoyance that 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.840
 annoying the repositor videos and you can not 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.760
 listen to the original audio of the video that 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.790
 is rising because of the consequence that 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.830
 there's that good advertising whistle 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.209
 I suggest it's a scan against the 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.190
 of glasses to your team, well, that's 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.599
 may be another good problem my
