to zigs I like cigs haven't actually

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.790 
to zigs I like cigs haven't actually
seen<00:00:26.430> him<00:00:26.580> as<00:00:26.789> much<00:00:27.210> as<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:28.019> would<00:00:28.230> think<00:00:28.289> at

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
seen him as much as you would think at

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.710 
seen him as much as you would think at
the<00:00:28.920> beginning<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.640> season<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.210> think<00:00:30.599> he

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
the beginning of the season I think he

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.130 
the beginning of the season I think he
got<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:31.050> few<00:00:31.730> small<00:00:32.730> nerve<00:00:33.450> she<00:00:33.780> would<00:00:33.930> call

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
got a few small nerve she would call

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.170 
got a few small nerve she would call
them<00:00:34.260> at<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.739> end<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.340> season<00:00:35.550> four<00:00:35.969> but<00:00:36.149> he's

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
them at the end of season four but he's

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.819 
them at the end of season four but he's
still<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.750> really<00:00:36.930> good<00:00:37.020> spot<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.770> think

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
still in a really good spot and I think

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.560 
still in a really good spot and I think
he's<00:00:38.040> probably<00:00:38.309> getting<00:00:38.570> underutilized

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
he's probably getting underutilized

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.569 
he's probably getting underutilized
because<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.440> few<00:00:41.040> things<00:00:41.190> he<00:00:41.399> does

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
because of it a few things he does

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.549 
because of it a few things he does
really<00:00:41.910> well<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.660> I've<00:00:42.809> talked<00:00:43.320> about

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
really well that I've talked about

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.250 
really well that I've talked about
before<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.980> his<00:00:44.460> seating<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.570> his<00:00:45.750> clearing

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
before is his seating and his clearing

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.290 
before is his seating and his clearing
kind<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.649> his<00:00:46.770> kiting<00:00:47.340> almost<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.969> little<00:00:48.210> bit

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
kind of his kiting almost a little bit

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.750 
kind of his kiting almost a little bit
he's<00:00:49.020> got<00:00:49.170> some<00:00:49.320> good<00:00:49.469> disengage<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.039> engage

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
he's got some good disengage and engage

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.029 
he's got some good disengage and engage
when<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.090> comes<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.539> team<00:00:52.050> fights<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.829> think

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
when it comes to team fights and I think

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.860 
when it comes to team fights and I think
people<00:00:53.460> kind<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.850> forgot<00:00:54.059> about<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.510> when<00:00:54.780> it

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
people kind of forgot about this when it

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.799 
people kind of forgot about this when it
comes<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.230> playing<00:00:55.410> zigs<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.719> think<00:00:57.719> he

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
comes to playing zigs and I think he

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.090 
comes to playing zigs and I think he
should<00:00:58.260> be<00:00:58.350> picked<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.680> should<00:00:58.829> be<00:00:58.890> played

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
should be picked you should be played

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.049 
should be picked you should be played
he's<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.309> good<00:00:59.430> champion<00:00:59.760> if<00:00:59.850> you've<00:00:59.940> never

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
he's a good champion if you've never

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.670 
he's a good champion if you've never
played<00:01:00.270> before<00:01:00.480> trim<00:01:01.079> out<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.379> week<00:01:01.530> he

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
played before trim out this week he

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.810

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
you don't have to worry about trying to

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.390 
you don't have to worry about trying to
get<00:03:11.379> from<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.680> jungle<00:03:11.950> camps<00:03:12.159> that<00:03:12.220> could

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
get from the jungle camps that could

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.640 
get from the jungle camps that could
kill<00:03:12.579> you<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:12.940> it's<00:03:13.870> just<00:03:14.049> good<00:03:14.170> overall<00:03:14.440> it

because<00:03:19.000> of<00:03:19.030> these<00:03:19.209> reasons<00:03:19.269> I<00:03:19.780> think<00:03:20.169> he's

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
because of these reasons I think he's

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.009 
because of these reasons I think he's
slightly<00:03:20.950> viable<00:03:21.489> currently<00:03:21.849> I<00:03:22.000> know<00:03:22.630> a<00:03:22.750> lot

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
slightly viable currently I know a lot

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.750 
slightly viable currently I know a lot
of<00:03:23.079> people<00:03:23.230> have<00:03:23.560> complained<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.190> lot<00:03:24.549> of

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
of people have complained a lot of

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.059 
of people have complained a lot of
people<00:03:25.120> it<00:03:25.510> was<00:03:25.720> just<00:03:26.290> everybody<00:03:26.680> pretty<00:03:26.950> much

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
people it was just everybody pretty much

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.159 
people it was just everybody pretty much
that<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.489> jungle<00:03:27.879> needs<00:03:28.209> fixed<00:03:28.750> in<00:03:28.870> some<00:03:29.049> way

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
that the jungle needs fixed in some way

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:30.809 
that the jungle needs fixed in some way
to<00:03:29.230> make<00:03:29.379> everybody<00:03:29.769> better<00:03:30.160> in<00:03:30.459> it<00:03:30.579> again

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
to make everybody better in it again

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.089 
to make everybody better in it again
because<00:03:31.150> no<00:03:31.359> one<00:03:31.510> feels<00:03:31.870> viable<00:03:32.349> if<00:03:32.680> there<00:03:32.919> are

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
because no one feels viable if there are

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.949 
because no one feels viable if there are
slight<00:03:33.310> tweaks<00:03:33.609> in<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.790> future<00:03:34.060> that<00:03:34.209> come<00:03:34.450> to

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
slight tweaks in the future that come to

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.900 
slight tweaks in the future that come to
affect<00:03:35.260> all<00:03:35.410> junglers<00:03:35.919> I<00:03:36.069> think<00:03:36.609> they<00:03:36.760> could

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
affect all junglers I think they could

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.280 
affect all junglers I think they could
favor<00:03:37.150> him<00:03:37.359> as<00:03:37.510> well<00:03:37.750> so<00:03:37.959> that's<00:03:38.049> another

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
favor him as well so that's another

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.210 
favor him as well so that's another
reason<00:03:38.470> so<00:03:38.650> if<00:03:38.709> you<00:03:38.769> haven't<00:03:38.889> tried<00:03:39.069> them<00:03:39.129> out

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
reason so if you haven't tried them out

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.159 
reason so if you haven't tried them out
