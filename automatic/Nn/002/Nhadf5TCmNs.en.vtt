00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:30.390 

so<00:03:20.770> I<00:03:20.800> cannot<00:03:21.190> see<00:03:21.430> my<00:03:21.580> videos

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.510 

but<00:03:31.000> I<00:03:31.239> know<00:03:31.360> that<00:03:31.750> I<00:03:31.959> can

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.059 

distri<00:03:35.520> here<00:03:35.850> huh

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.300 

where<00:03:39.670> did

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.100 

and

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.030 

these<00:03:49.710> two<00:03:50.070> were<00:03:50.370> me<00:03:51.030> see<00:03:51.210> what<00:03:51.360> is<00:03:51.510> this<00:03:51.720> oh<00:03:52.040> no

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040

it<00:03:53.160> can't<00:03:53.370> open<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:54.030> of<00:03:54.180> course<00:03:54.480> because<00:03:54.780> the

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
it can't open it of course because the

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.230 
it can't open it of course because the
hard<00:03:55.170> drive<00:03:55.410> is<00:03:55.620> not<00:03:55.650> fast<00:03:56.130> enough<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.520> open<00:03:56.880> it

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
hard drive is not fast enough to open it

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.640 
hard drive is not fast enough to open it
let's<00:03:57.990> see<00:03:58.200> what<00:03:58.320> this<00:03:58.500> was

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:10.140 

copying

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.150 

okay<00:04:10.750> this<00:04:11.349> was<00:04:11.530> a<00:04:11.830> fight<00:04:12.159> for<00:04:12.190> the<00:04:12.640> ladies

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.970 

the<00:04:15.670> lead

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.850 

eleven<00:04:19.790> megabyte<00:04:21.970> 488<00:04:22.970> megabyte<00:04:23.860> one

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
eleven megabyte 488 megabyte one

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.650 
eleven megabyte 488 megabyte one
gigabyte<00:04:25.490> oh<00:04:25.730> my<00:04:26.060> god

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
gigabyte oh my god

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.890 
gigabyte oh my god
this<00:04:26.900> is<00:04:27.050> a<00:04:27.080> big<00:04:27.350> one

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:38.929 

I<00:04:29.960> think<00:04:30.680> these<00:04:30.830> are<00:04:30.889> the<00:04:31.250> files<00:04:31.520> that

00:04:38.929 --> 00:04:38.939 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:51.470 

I<00:04:38.969> think<00:04:39.419> I<00:04:39.539> can<00:04:39.749> remove<00:04:40.020> these

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.820 

you<00:04:51.960> go

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
you go

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.510 
you go
so<00:04:54.190> I<00:04:54.220> deleted<00:04:54.580> enough<00:04:55.210> now

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
so I deleted enough now

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.560 
so I deleted enough now
that's<00:04:57.030> clear

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.800 

for<00:05:02.110> either<00:05:02.290> lost<00:05:02.890> couple<00:05:03.310> of<00:05:03.570> color<00:05:04.570> back

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
for either lost couple of color back

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:13.689 
for either lost couple of color back
later

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.330 

now<00:05:14.740> you<00:05:15.740> can<00:05:15.919> see

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
now you can see

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.659 
now you can see
that<00:05:17.910> in<00:05:18.150> fact<00:05:18.480> we<00:05:19.350> could<00:05:19.560> get<00:05:20.370> to<00:05:20.520> our
