Croatia<00:04:58.429> has<00:04:58.849> a<00:04:58.879> terrible<00:04:59.689> travel<00:05:00.289> schedule

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
Croatia has a terrible travel schedule

Croatia has a terrible travel schedule
first<00:05:01.489> they<00:05:01.729> go<00:05:01.879> to<00:05:01.939> natal<00:05:02.419> then<00:05:03.229> Manaus<00:05:03.679> then

first they go to natal then Manaus then

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:07.509 
first they go to natal then Manaus then
Brasilia<00:05:04.939> so<00:05:05.869> they'll<00:05:06.199> also<00:05:06.499> be<00:05:06.949> tired<00:05:07.219> from

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:07.519 
Brasilia so they'll also be tired from

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:10.629 
Brasilia so they'll also be tired from
travel<00:05:07.999> but<00:05:08.539> unlike<00:05:09.379> Croatia<00:05:09.889> they<00:05:10.249> will<00:05:10.459> have

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
travel but unlike Croatia they will have

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.149 
travel but unlike Croatia they will have
left<00:05:10.879> the<00:05:11.029> worst<00:05:11.419> for<00:05:11.749> last<00:05:11.889> which<00:05:12.889> in<00:05:13.069> this

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:13.159 
left the worst for last which in this

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:15.339 
left the worst for last which in this
case<00:05:13.399> may<00:05:13.610> actually<00:05:13.789> work<00:05:14.269> in<00:05:14.449> their<00:05:14.599> favor<00:05:14.869> if

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
case may actually work in their favor if

case may actually work in their favor if
they<00:05:15.559> can<00:05:15.739> clinch<00:05:16.039> three<00:05:16.369> points<00:05:16.729> vs.<00:05:17.089> Mexico

they can clinch three points vs. Mexico
in<00:05:17.809> natal<00:05:18.169> and<00:05:18.529> then<00:05:19.009> beat<00:05:19.279> a<00:05:19.309> beaten-down

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:24.949 
guaranteed second spot and thus a spot

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.739 
guaranteed second spot and thus a spot
in<00:05:25.099> the<00:05:25.189> knockout<00:05:25.550> stages<00:05:25.909> then<00:05:26.449> they<00:05:26.599> can

00:05:26.739 --> 00:05:26.749 
in the knockout stages then they can

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:28.629 
in the knockout stages then they can
just<00:05:26.779> relax<00:05:27.289> against<00:05:27.800> Brazil<00:05:28.129> in<00:05:28.159> their<00:05:28.399> third

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
just relax against Brazil in their third

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.149 
just relax against Brazil in their third
game<00:05:28.909> it'll<00:05:29.779> all<00:05:29.989> depend<00:05:30.169> on<00:05:30.589> what<00:05:30.860> shape

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:31.159 
game it'll all depend on what shape

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:32.769 
game it'll all depend on what shape
they're<00:05:31.399> in<00:05:31.579> by<00:05:31.759> the<00:05:31.819> time<00:05:32.149> they<00:05:32.329> arrive<00:05:32.599> in

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:32.779 
they're in by the time they arrive in

they're in by the time they arrive in
Brasilia<00:05:33.490> personally<00:05:34.490> I<00:05:34.519> see<00:05:34.909> a<00:05:34.939> lot<00:05:35.209> of<00:05:35.240> tough

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:35.779 
Brasilia personally I see a lot of tough

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:38.589 
Brasilia personally I see a lot of tough
one-two<00:05:36.439> one-two<00:05:37.099> two-two<00:05:37.309> ties<00:05:37.759> happening<00:05:38.479> I

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
one-two one-two two-two ties happening I

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:41.109 
one-two one-two two-two ties happening I
think<00:05:38.809> the<00:05:39.079> match<00:05:39.379> sequence<00:05:40.039> favors<00:05:40.550> Cameroon

00:05:41.109 --> 00:05:41.119 
think the match sequence favors Cameroon

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:43.449 
think the match sequence favors Cameroon
the<00:05:41.419> travel<00:05:42.019> schedule<00:05:42.169> definitely<00:05:43.009> favors

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:43.459 
the travel schedule definitely favors

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:46.149 
the travel schedule definitely favors
Mexico<00:05:44.059> but<00:05:44.389> Mexico<00:05:44.990> has<00:05:45.199> Brazil<00:05:45.709> right<00:05:45.979> as

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:46.159 
Mexico but Mexico has Brazil right as

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:47.859 
Mexico but Mexico has Brazil right as
their<00:05:46.369> second<00:05:46.909> match<00:05:47.059> which<00:05:47.389> could<00:05:47.659> prove

00:05:47.859 --> 00:05:47.869 
their second match which could prove

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:50.019 
their second match which could prove
disastrous<00:05:48.139> for<00:05:48.889> their<00:05:49.009> momentum<00:05:49.369> and<00:05:49.789> their

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:50.029 
disastrous for their momentum and their

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:52.119 
disastrous for their momentum and their
morale<00:05:50.209> the<00:05:51.079> match<00:05:51.289> that<00:05:51.559> will<00:05:51.679> decide<00:05:52.069> the

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:52.129 
morale the match that will decide the

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:54.219 
morale the match that will decide the
fate<00:05:52.490> of<00:05:52.550> the<00:05:52.759> group<00:05:52.969> in<00:05:53.149> my<00:05:53.269> opinion<00:05:53.749> will<00:05:54.019> be

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229 
fate of the group in my opinion will be

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.469 
fate of the group in my opinion will be
the<00:05:54.439> Mexico<00:05:54.649> vs.<00:05:55.309> Cameroon<00:05:55.579> match<00:05:56.089> in<00:05:56.300> the

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
the Mexico vs. Cameroon match in the

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:59.109 
the Mexico vs. Cameroon match in the
towel<00:05:56.719> for<00:05:57.589> even<00:05:57.889> a<00:05:58.009> tie<00:05:58.399> would<00:05:58.729> be<00:05:58.909> more

00:05:59.109 --> 00:05:59.119 
towel for even a tie would be more

00:05:59.119 --> 00:06:01.029 
towel for even a tie would be more
convenient<00:05:59.539> for<00:05:59.779> Cameroon<00:06:00.409> than<00:06:00.679> it'll<00:06:00.889> be

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
convenient for Cameroon than it'll be

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:01.899 
convenient for Cameroon than it'll be
for<00:06:01.279> Mexico

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:01.909 
for Mexico

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:04.419 
for Mexico
I<00:06:01.939> think<00:06:02.869> Croatia<00:06:03.319> once<00:06:03.769> again<00:06:04.099> has<00:06:04.279> been

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:04.429 
I think Croatia once again has been

00:06:04.429 --> 00:06:07.209 
I think Croatia once again has been
shafted<00:06:04.729> now<00:06:05.689> a<00:06:05.959> surprised<00:06:06.379> elimination<00:06:07.099> of

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:07.219 
shafted now a surprised elimination of

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:09.459 
shafted now a surprised elimination of
Brazil<00:06:07.579> and<00:06:07.759> group<00:06:07.939> stages<00:06:08.269> could<00:06:08.899> happen

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:09.469 
Brazil and group stages could happen

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.019 
Brazil and group stages could happen
simply<00:06:09.800> due<00:06:10.129> to<00:06:10.159> the<00:06:10.369> fact<00:06:10.399> that<00:06:10.729> all<00:06:10.909> these

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:11.029 
simply due to the fact that all these

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:12.699 
simply due to the fact that all these
teams<00:06:11.360> will<00:06:11.599> feel<00:06:11.869> like<00:06:12.079> they<00:06:12.259> need<00:06:12.439> to<00:06:12.469> at

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:12.709 
teams will feel like they need to at

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:14.979 
teams will feel like they need to at
least<00:06:12.739> Iike<00:06:13.489> tie<00:06:13.729> against<00:06:14.119> Brazil<00:06:14.569> just<00:06:14.809> to

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:14.989 
least Iike tie against Brazil just to

00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:17.489 
least Iike tie against Brazil just to
have<00:06:15.139> a<00:06:15.169> little<00:06:15.349> more<00:06:15.589> leverage<00:06:16.149> but<00:06:17.149> Brazil

00:06:17.489 --> 00:06:17.499 
have a little more leverage but Brazil

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:20.529 
have a little more leverage but Brazil
eliminated<00:06:18.499> at<00:06:18.619> home<00:06:19.099> in<00:06:19.399> group<00:06:19.699> stages<00:06:20.089> I

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:20.539 
eliminated at home in group stages I

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:22.149 
eliminated at home in group stages I
don't<00:06:21.019> think<00:06:21.199> the<00:06:21.289> fans<00:06:21.589> would<00:06:21.800> let<00:06:22.039> them

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:22.159 
don't think the fans would let them

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:24.279 
don't think the fans would let them
leave<00:06:22.339> the<00:06:22.579> stadium<00:06:22.819> alive<00:06:23.389> don't<00:06:23.809> count<00:06:24.169> on

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:24.289 
leave the stadium alive don't count on

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:25.109 
leave the stadium alive don't count on
that<00:06:24.439> happening

00:06:25.109 --> 00:06:25.119 
that happening

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:28.389 
that happening
so<00:06:26.119> my<00:06:26.389> map<00:06:26.599> for<00:06:26.899> the<00:06:26.989> group<00:06:27.199> looks<00:06:27.499> like<00:06:27.739> this

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:28.399 
so my map for the group looks like this

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:30.279 
so my map for the group looks like this
Brazil<00:06:28.939> breezing<00:06:29.449> to<00:06:29.599> three<00:06:29.869> victories

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289

Brazil breezing to three victories
Cameroon<00:06:31.099> tying<00:06:31.519> Mexico<00:06:32.179> and<00:06:32.389> beating

Cameroon tying Mexico and beating

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:34.509 
Cameroon tying Mexico and beating
Croatia<00:06:33.169> simply<00:06:33.800> due<00:06:33.979> to<00:06:34.009> their<00:06:34.279> match

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:34.519 
Croatia simply due to their match

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:37.269 
Croatia simply due to their match
sequence<00:06:35.229> Mexico<00:06:36.229> is<00:06:36.349> coming<00:06:36.679> to<00:06:36.769> world<00:06:37.009> cup

00:06:37.269 --> 00:06:37.279 
sequence Mexico is coming to world cup

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:39.159 
sequence Mexico is coming to world cup
with<00:06:37.459> no<00:06:37.759> momentum<00:06:38.360> and<00:06:38.539> a<00:06:38.629> team<00:06:38.839> that<00:06:39.050> is

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:39.169 
with no momentum and a team that is

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:41.619 
with no momentum and a team that is
anything<00:06:39.409> but<00:06:39.619> consistent<00:06:40.459> Croatia<00:06:41.089> just<00:06:41.449> has

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:41.629 
anything but consistent Croatia just has

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:44.170 
anything but consistent Croatia just has
terrible<00:06:42.139> luck<00:06:42.379> and<00:06:42.680> history<00:06:43.309> that<00:06:43.519> suggests

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
terrible luck and history that suggests

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.120 
terrible luck and history that suggests
that<00:06:44.360> it<00:06:44.479> may<00:06:44.630> very<00:06:44.930> well<00:06:45.050> be<00:06:45.229> faded<00:06:45.800> to<00:06:45.919> lose

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.130 
that it may very well be faded to lose

that it may very well be faded to lose
