00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello by this video i will you 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.410
 show how to make a delicious 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.730
 mushroom risotto to start 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.160
 for four people 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:17.070
 you will need 200 g of mushrooms 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:19.949
 fresh 250 g of rice I recommend 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.270
 to use risotto special rice that 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.650
 we now find in all 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:29.010
 large areas of salt and pepper 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:34.350
 a pinch of provence herbs a cube 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.840
 broth and a liter of water and 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.370
 to finish 10 g of butter and a 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.620
 tablespoon of fresh cream in 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.950
 a pan I start by preparing 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.160
 my broth a liter of water as well as 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:56.039
 my two little cubes and I'm doing 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:58.980
 heat everything during that time I 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:03.539
 prepare my mushrooms I wash them and 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.610
 I thin them thinly once 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:12.119
 my broth is ready I stop the 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:14.640
 cooking and I put aside I prepare my 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:19.200
 recipe in a stew I start with 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:25.530
 melt the butter and I make it 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:28.970
 come back my bed I mix well using 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.970
 of a spoon in voice 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.109
 and after 2 minutes you will see 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.109
 that the riba become completely 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:38.109
 translucent 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:48.140
 that's when I add my 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:54.490
 mushrooms and mint and as well 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.490
 the provence grass salt and pepper 

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:11.959
 I mix well using macri yesterday 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:15.489
 in me and I'm going to water with a 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.489
 fly 2 pouillon 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:31.989
 I mix continuously and like Henry 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.760
 has absorbed all the broth kind but 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:44.079
 a fly 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:47.110
 it should never be the Soitec and rice 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:50.099
 I repeat the operation until I 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.099
 no longer have broth 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.769
 thanks to this cooking technique the 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:01.109
 rice is perfectly cooked and 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.109
 mushrooms keep all their flavor 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:08.590
 so I leave maury well absorb all 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:15.579
 the broth and I put fishy by 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:17.159
 ladle counted in all 25 minutes of 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.560
 baking 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:23.620
 I just added my last ladle of 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.720
 broth my rice is perfectly cooked 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.859
 but mushrooms were held 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.799
 impeccable 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:38.579
 I just have to add the 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:38.579
 fresh cream salt and pepper 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:55.200
 I mix and I cut my goats my 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:04.470
 risotto is finished it only remains for me 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:09.060

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:11.070

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.940
