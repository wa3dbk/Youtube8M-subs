00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 and we need 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.600
 often when fishing, there will be a bunch or 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.000
 here from a great depth 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.340
 after we get him a boat and 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.580
 let's put it in some special 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.420
 aquarium to keep fish alive and 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.420
 hand over and on weighing 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.320
 he is in the air bubble 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.570
 too much air respectively 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.660
 to adjust himself he does not have time because 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.739
 this loses a lot of strength swim belly 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:46.040
 up tomchuk or perch and then in 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:50.440
 it may end up like that 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.730
 precisely because of fatigue die the most 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.680
 the most effective way in this 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.370
 situations is to use a needle at 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.960
 me in the hands of a special needle for 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.960
 piercing fish is possible in principle 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.810
 take advantage and ordinary needle and there 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.330
 30 40 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:11.810
 vat syringe with large enough 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.869
 the flow cross section is exactly what and how 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.560
 I will now try to show us 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.240
 have pike perch 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.950
 his weight is about a kilogram he 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.750
 does not feel well my 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.149
 caught with enough decent depth 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.710
 we will puncture him a little bit now 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:30.450
 and air and after that it will take 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.799
 upright position and i hope not 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.619
 everything will be fine i am a fish brisk fish 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.960
 afraid to take barehanded because not 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.549
 times already cut especially about the island 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:49.080
 gill covers perch therefore use 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.789
 glove you have a special system 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.850
 that is, you need to attach 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.670
 pectoral fin to the body in front of 4 scales and 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.549
 in this area prick zander by pike 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.729
 Of course there is no such data in Russia 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:08.100
 you take nowhere 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.959
 intuition usually prick here, too, where something like this 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.610
 I put the fin still add 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.410
 centimeter maximum other 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.510
 and in this area, first under the scales under 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.760
 Scale a little bit later 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.100
 we turn degrees under 60 and we enter 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.500
 deeper everything and the air went better this 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:30.030
 do everything enough for kilogram fish 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.920
 using special needles from her 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.989
 rather large cross section but 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:40.260
 literally two seconds is needed to 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:42.750
 pull the extra excess air if 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.340
 let's say in fish two three four five 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.250
 six seven or more kilograms 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.750
 respectively the larger and would 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.640
 the more 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.650
 swimming bubbles so respectively 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.350
 need to wait longer 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.000
 Well, probably not to be unfounded 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.230
 give an example 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 pike perch in the area of four kilograms under 4 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.890
 kilograms well, probably a total 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.480
 10-12 seconds 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.460
 but very important extra it’s very important that 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.500
 better pierce a few times and 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.510
 see how the fish behaves after 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.790
 each injection than once perry 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.490
 pull it down if we reload let it go 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.410
 let's say it will lie to the bottom and that too 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.510
 there is good because it is not always 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.850
 can keep again vertical 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.890
 his position will begin to fill him up 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.780
 on his side he will again spend extra strength 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.959
 in the end, may again die 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.130
 so pierced once 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.920
 experimentally there waited two three 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:42.209
 seconds again you need to make sure 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:46.020
 that air goes so pierce in 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.830
 principle can be and well in the air up to how i 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.020
 now showed 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.910
 but then immediately put the fish under 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.830
 water to be seen air goes or not 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.220
 there is air respectively comes you 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:00.500
 don't get here you need to prick again so 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.610
 here are a few of these approaches probably 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.250
 as accurately as possible 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.160
 get that extra air to the fish 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.080
 further calmed down here he can his 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.230
 You can see it is completely calm 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.360
 he began to actively move the gill 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.850
 lids wiggles with fins before 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.000
 I could not go to the depth of it, as it were prevented 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:25.290
 excess air and again 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.720
 a very important point not to wait when 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.669
 when the fish will become that is if you 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.240
 caught from great depth there more 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.919
 four five meters she is a little there 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.729
 let's say floundering in some 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:40.680
 Capacity in this case, the aquarium and the 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:43.770
 it can be seen that he turns it up 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.380
 Belly well wait there 5 maximum 10 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.220
 minutes she will calm down so let's say 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.680
 so tame 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.270
 at this moment it is best to prick her 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.050
 again i base my own 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.850
 experience pierced seemingly good she 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.280
 one side calmed down the other side 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.240
 still not able to lose too much strength 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.759
 because 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.300
 if you think about it only in half an hour 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:09.759
 in an hour it is sometimes too late 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.620
 late too much fish loses strength and 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:14.169
 then we 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.970
 pierce the bubbles you can do everything 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:19.419
 ideally bleed the air 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.789
 but she just doesn’t have enough strength 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:25.949
 know to continue my life that is she 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:29.500
 don't even try to take something 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:33.449
 upright position it means we 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.449
 just late now don't be late
