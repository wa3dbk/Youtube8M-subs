00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
firmware at the bottom here under the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.249 
firmware at the bottom here under the
firmware<00:01:18.119> there's<00:01:18.570> two<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:18.990> them<00:01:19.110> one<00:01:21.049> for<00:01:22.049> Mac

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
firmware there's two of them one for Mac

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.859 
firmware there's two of them one for Mac
one<00:01:22.590> for<00:01:22.799> Windows<00:01:27.140> accept<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.320> agreement<00:01:29.130> and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
download so once your download you get

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.580 
download so once your download you get
two<00:01:37.110> files<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:38.390> PDF<00:01:39.390> files<00:01:39.659> with<00:01:39.990> instruction

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
two files a PDF files with instruction

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.139 
two files a PDF files with instruction
and<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:42.119> 6d<00:01:42.750> firmware<00:01:43.350> upgrade<00:01:43.909> so<00:01:44.909> what<00:01:45.060> you

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
and the 6d firmware upgrade so what you

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.730 
and the 6d firmware upgrade so what you
can<00:01:45.270> do<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.570> going<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.869> throw<00:01:46.110> into<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.530> root

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
can do is going to throw into the root

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.200 
can do is going to throw into the root
directory<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.250> your<00:01:47.369> card<00:01:47.759> just<00:01:50.090> drag<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.270> a

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
directory of your card just drag it a

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.209 
directory of your card just drag it a
copy<00:01:54.210> over<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:55.140> what<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.590> mean<00:01:55.829> by<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.979> root

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
copy over so what I mean by a root

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.569 
copy over so what I mean by a root
directory<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.909> not<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.390> subfolders<00:01:58.579> but

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
directory is not in the subfolders but

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.700 
directory is not in the subfolders but
right<00:01:59.820> on<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.000> card<00:02:00.360> now<00:02:01.170> you're<00:02:01.409> ready<00:02:01.590> to

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
right on the card now you're ready to

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.289 
right on the card now you're ready to
take<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:01.979> card<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.610> put<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:02.939> into<00:02:03.119> your

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
menu go to the firmware which is the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.160 
menu go to the firmware which is the
fourth<00:02:48.950> side<00:02:49.190> up

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
fourth side up

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.780 
fourth side up
this<00:02:51.170> is<00:02:51.380> your<00:02:51.560> current<00:02:51.920> one<00:02:52.040> is<00:02:52.310> one<00:02:52.519> point

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
this is your current one is one point

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:03.199 
this is your current one is one point
one<00:02:52.940> four<00:02:53.180> three<00:02:54.940> update<00:02:55.940> firmware<00:02:56.180> click<00:02:56.750> OK
