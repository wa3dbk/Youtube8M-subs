00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
I'm cutting towards there one of my

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.200 
I'm cutting towards there one of my
children<00:02:33.530> should<00:02:34.010> not<00:02:34.220> stick<00:02:34.520> his<00:02:34.640> fingers<00:02:35.030> in

there

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:03:12.160 

where<00:02:46.130> did<00:02:46.280> we<00:02:46.310> get<00:02:46.960> so<00:02:47.960> where<00:02:48.140> it<00:02:48.260> is

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.810 

so<00:03:12.710> you<00:03:12.800> just<00:03:12.950> keep<00:03:13.160> running<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.610> knives

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
so you just keep running the knives

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.280 
so you just keep running the knives
closer<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.450> closer<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:16.660> you<00:03:17.660> can<00:03:17.840> cut<00:03:18.050> more

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
closer and closer and you can cut more

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.920 
closer and closer and you can cut more
and<00:03:18.470> more<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:18.890> more<00:03:19.120> because<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.390> glass<00:03:20.570> does

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
and more and more because the glass does

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.810 
and more and more because the glass does
flex<00:03:21.230> a<00:03:21.470> little<00:03:21.710> bit<00:03:23.740> now<00:03:24.740> this<00:03:25.100> is<00:03:25.250> tempered

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
flex a little bit now this is tempered

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.040 
flex a little bit now this is tempered
glass<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:27.680> if<00:03:27.830> it<00:03:27.980> breaks<00:03:28.250> it<00:03:29.210> shatters<00:03:29.750> into

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
glass so if it breaks it shatters into

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:36.190 
glass so if it breaks it shatters into
lift<00:03:32.260> no<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:33.290> didn't<00:03:33.650> cut<00:03:33.800> myself<00:03:34.990> you<00:03:35.990> thought
