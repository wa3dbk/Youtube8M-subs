00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:21.160
 Hello I love you today 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.829
 little exercise video for you and though 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.009
 I'll wear you the elephant once 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:29.739
 So imagine how to treat the dog 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:35.260
 can improve footwork and backhand 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:37.300
 softer gets a lot of fun with the video so 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.180
 First, I want you first things 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.329
 show that he naturally needed 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:47.280
 their leckerlis you do not scatter 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:50.140
 then you should also need the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.569
 clicks so I work with one click 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.319
 Of course you can also be normal with 

00:00:52.569 --> 00:01:00.969
 work a reward place and then 

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:02.469
 Do you buy an item on the 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.879
 dog with whom two calls for her 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.010
 So it did fit her one now 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.800
 For example, Kleinod is enough for one 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.150
 small shots from but still have now 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.670
 For a bigger reason, for example 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.610
 take a book which I am doing now 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:20.800
 with a big atlas and then catch 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:25.390
 you just to link the book to the 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.430
 earth and shows him down with the 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.990
 set it up forefoot and say 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.820
 best ever is what you later 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.430
 want to say for it and then put 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.080
 as soon as the dog really with the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.080
 preliminary draufsteht back 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:05.610
 the girl back on it and leave that 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.710
 restless by tasting what they are from 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.149
 They wanted him to really compare 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.709
 the right thing is that he with the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.890
 two rivers demand the object 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.890
 touched 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:46.310
 Great if you did that now 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.140
 and the dog really knows you 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.270
 wanted to pass it is it is with 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:55.760
 the folder feet you can because sometimes you 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:58.790
 hin hin and the dog normal diffuse 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.940
 position and teach the mum 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.180
 that he does not keep the book 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.180
 should 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:29.040
 You have to go on step by step 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.040
 handle that dog then really well 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.230
 the back legs moved 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.790
 If the prices around the book promptly the 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.180
 key depending on what you took 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.180
 Has 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:22.180
 then you can sit him down and sit down 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:25.120
 put it a bit further away so 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.190
 the dog has to learn that he only has the po 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.020
 with Reinhold that he did not before 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.020
 anything at the position changes 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.690
 so and that's almost the whole thing 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.660
 secret and the elephant trick the 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.280
 would of course have to practice that the dog 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.020
 really that he needs the position 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.380
 understand that he is on this book 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.450
 should 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.830
 because you can not do that yet 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.580
 keep going that I'm already around 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:10.010
 runs at the really should understand 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.110
 that must be there on the front and so on 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.930
 long until he does not do so until he dies 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.640
 then internalized and then could 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.080
 really good with this elephant trick 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.720
 that really works over that 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.540
 The dog will also pick up and have pores 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.580
 behind in the backhand important because 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.220
 I hope you liked the tip and 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:32.650
 you can do something with it 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.650
 yes, until my next video
