00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.439
 Hello everyone and shared this 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.250
 always with androids is going to bring the 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:10.219
 Huawei ascend 750 that I saw as a novelty in 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.980
 the wild world congress 2014 of barcelona 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.830
 is a phone with an 8-core CPU 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.210
 well now let's see how it behaves 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.880
 whatever it is without finishing in the end I'll tell you 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.340
 the characteristics good as you see 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.320
 has everything pretty much with some 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.929
 differences to the other versions of 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.440
 huawei and let's johnny here you see that 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:33.590
 something takes eight cores plus 7 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.520
 and going down to the gigas of ram 8 gb of 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:41.980
 storage resolution 720p 1280 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.620
 Android 4.22 and mobile motion with 2.0 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.140
 well I'll give it to see yeah 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.800
 the main menu and good has it's 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.019
 for a hand glove mode for the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.239
 notifications the buttons are not in 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.680
 screen are below are resisted not 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.170
 I know very well why be the black model 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.000
 and they are what it looks like when 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.780
 they illuminate more than if you illuminate them you can not see 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.059
 very good 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.740
 and good to see let's see what I teach you 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.880
 in camera mode I like to seal it 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.700
 the truth that has many possibilities 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.610
 the camera mode has a rear camera 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.010
 of 3 megapixels to see if I put the 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.040
 maximum resolution of 23 megapixels 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.720
 We have the truth timer option 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.490
 what of the last games I've seen 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.800
 is I think it has more options 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.070
 everything I've seen has we can 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.620
 use a way that whistling audition 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.650
 some word does capture the photo 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.300
 in stabilized to the video bio to full hd 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.000
 1080 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.920
 he says it's 16 9 what he tells us that's 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.950
 the refresh styles shapes per second 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.260
 that we can stop lgp the gps tag 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.350
 in two lessons 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.390
 in the photo modes to see if they come out 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.619
 to know that there is a normal loads the 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.729
 Smart is beauty hdr panoramic 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.770
 integration very well then the map this 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.200
 it's like a 360-degree image of a 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.210
 object we give to make the photo and we 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.820
 says what is the interface that we have 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.080
 have to move it around the object and 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.000
 then it will be like the typical 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.459
 360-degree photos that there are in many 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.520
 online stores and we do like that we would do 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.380
 the 360 ​​degrees or we can install the 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.680
 phone in some support that will turn the 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:24.310
 360 degrees the best it does in 160 low 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.200
 to 180 according to the mode icon and then on 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.450
 the gallery we see the photo and below it appears 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.519
 as an after as a scroll I am 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.650
 at pleasure to catch the works there are common 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.020
 but now blue me here to once given 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.580
 I was back there trying my mobile 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.620
 gave him to spin what was going the 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.900
 next picture but do not see below there 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.460
 a blue wait a bar let's say where 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.590
 it is by that bar we move them and what 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:49.170
 we do is move the different 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.069
 let's say as if they were the 360 180 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.940
 degrees of the photo there are more ways to see if 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.190
 in the focus 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.570
 there is a way that we put comments to the 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.980
 photo we are the photo and then it leaves us 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.110
 record a few seconds of comments 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.230
 about the photo where we are as things 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.909
 A) Yes 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.409
 It costs a bit to record at the same time 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:15.440
 while with the mobile recording 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:15.440
 a bit the front of 5 megapixels 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.430
 let's see the modes pretty much in 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.190
 panoramic then resolution 5 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.260
 megapixels 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:30.500
 in a video then do also with the 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:32.120
 frontal 2 thousand 80 or 720 but good now 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.580
 I'm going to tell you the vials 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.030
 characteristics and good as you see it takes 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.520
 there is a version that gets that 902 1900 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.320
 2100 megahertz frequency and other 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.870
 that carries the most but another very form 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.620
 Frequently but apart from this scm 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.910
 at 2100 1900 that's already for the market 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.040
 what is the product aimed at 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:57.560
 we do not care about the screens of 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:01.360
 5.5 inches HD 1280 x 720 sorry 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:05.590
 ips ie it is hd full hd 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:09.220
 then take what is the cpu a mtk mt 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.560
 65 92 of 8 cores at 1.7 13 megapixels 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.830
 of front camera and I say back forgiveness 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.590
 with autofocus plus 5 out of 5 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.329
 megapixel front android 4.2 and the 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.820
 living with the monkey and 2.0 as I have 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:25.060
 said 2 gigas of ram 8 gb of memory 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.280
 internal 3000 milliamperes of battery that 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:32.410
 not bad the measures are a thousand thousand 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:37.320
 forgive me 149 5 millimeters for 77 4 for 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:42.510
 89 and a weight of 160 grams carries wifi 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:45.760
 802.11 bgn bluetooth 4.0 sensor 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:49.800
 georges say of gravity 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:52.110
 gps to gps proximity sensor and light 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.430
 and the compass that are a compass is a 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.069
 resort more than taking them in the 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:59.430
 device and tells us to bring hs 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:01.550
 h spam plus that gives us up to 21 megabytes of 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.550
 descent 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.430
 and if down 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.960
 and good little more can I say about this 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.410
 device that the truth is that I 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.630
 liked quite to the touch and 8 8 cores 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.790
 I think it is the most powerful that the 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.050
 currently game and well then I 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.210
 like this video and thus leave a like 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.100
 leave me comments for favorites and 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.400
 especially subscribe to the channel come 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.400
