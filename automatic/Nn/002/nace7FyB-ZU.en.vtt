00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.840
 hey people of mine are painting today but 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:13.320
 Honestly, I do not have it 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.299
 prepared 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.619
 I have to honest about it I do not have it 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.029
 prepared and I will take care of myself 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.449
 I would say in terms begin with 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:28.260
 The first question is when will you become 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:31.260
 never never so I become obnoxious 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.180
 when I am hungry that is quite complete 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.800
 very bad I'm hungry then 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.940
 I really really want to be unbearable 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.590
 and otherwise i can actually 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.410
 be pretty bitchy if someone me 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.160
 contradicts knowledge, however, I have 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.960
 he has real flaps so I am 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.020
 actually quite a few moves 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.090
 not visitors but also in that case 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.050
 also to notice that I then that 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.660
 correct 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.530
 it's a shitty thing to be 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.640
 is uncool but which musicians which 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.240
 band growth 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.470
 which others feel embarrassed 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:12.119
 Maybe but I get up so much 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.900
 these oldies and respectively has 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.580
 Just listen to this old rock music around the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.799
 dismantling and so on and I think so 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.800
 can not do anything with it 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.720
 to begin 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.090
 that would be so damn honest 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.370
 be how superficial is youtube 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.530
 actually that the holsten kick the 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.260
 Most subscribers have no idea 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:37.000
 when that means no runner 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:39.310
 because I am so much it's just 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.750
 simply because the master 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.720
 moment has no idea 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:48.130
 pure entertainment also has times 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:52.990
 nonsense and it's entertaining and 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.640
 This mostly in groups and can 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.320
 one also holds much more out of one 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.160
 channel has rausholen if you like that 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.220
 but alone is the mph what funny 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.870
 that is somehow already has one 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.700
 bit reported to do with what 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:12.190
 even with the rink is a man that 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:14.920
 so great is the sensation was true 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.140
 actually the people are these customers 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.380
 I'm sorry I do not have any books right now 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.630
 but a win so for me has been 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.080
 a bit of sensationalism too 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.959
 do 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.430
 to watch the video and then too 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.810
 I still understand that 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.190
 Of course I do not say that it is 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.920
 But for the band, if we are honest 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.980
 are how many of them really 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.810
 then have made this challenge 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.670
 I also think I donated the times 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:47.010
 half of you are lying so I hope I 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.010
 really really never try to lie 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.739
 sometimes if it is a small emergency lie 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.959
 then it is alright for example yes 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.090
 if if you made from peeping times 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.459
 at the and who knows that still me 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.290
 So please tell the nix then yeah there 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.660
 You really have to lie like that, though 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.130
 that's not really analytics 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.170
 but actually just tells you 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.010
 not yet and that has for me in 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.750
 others resisted 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.720
 what do you find in other girls 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.620
 terrible that's pretty easy 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.879
 I think it's very bad 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.849
 screech 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:24.890
 I think that's what turns me on 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.739
 hackles hair high what they are bad 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.349
 find if is the example of a 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.510
 normal day so mega too bursting you 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:37.250
 run over pasted 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.349
 or if they are totally drowned 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.049
 I find that right refutes good that 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.430
 not even in men but I like girl 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.599
 I do not know so there is a lot 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.420
 that family does not like it 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.470
 and that he can just do the three 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:54.049
 worst things maybe that way 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:56.030
 that contrived laugh if that 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.049
 friend has said something or looking 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.690
 I think that's very bad, too 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:06.700
 total striking is that goes in males 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:10.430
 Do not even think about spitting on the floor 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:13.010
 to store perverted and somehow 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:19.549
 no army japan or just do it 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:21.260
 just stupid turn on and which 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.720
 characteristics brings you in men 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.570
 even the palm almost the same but so 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.970
 characteristics as if you have a system 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.949
 make or feel the feeling that you 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.130
 are so I still have with what 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:36.979
 they have done or to hear 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.199
 ex-boyfriend actually totally that 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.660
 to be mother's son 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:43.430
 that can really get worse for me 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.289
 do not do anything without mom 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.360
 him 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:50.020
 okay, but maybe not 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.599
 even if you want to know something when 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.379
 google not soon after it's about mom 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:58.449
 and ask the halo 3 times a bit 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:03.219
 Independent mister know so in the 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:08.020
 others at you first I can sometimes 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:10.629
 I am quite knowledgeable 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.610
 think that's pretty annoying and yes 

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:14.710
 I sometimes say things without synonymous 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.020
 really thinking about that 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.050
 others could hurt but yes I say 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:23.399
 my opinion and that is but I was 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.779
 hurt I think that annoys others 

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:27.249
 or let me decide 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:28.539
 also in a very bad decision 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:30.279
 I think that's right 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.520
 really bad which bad 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:37.779
 habit round you get used to 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.830
 i have a bad habit i 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:41.379
 do not say anything 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.639
 but I am and overexploitation when I am 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:45.669
 have a day off 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.770
 because like me the whole day bedroom and 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.809
 that also excites my head sometimes 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.449
 that is what I am supposed to do 

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:54.699
 then really get up the valley and what 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:58.149
 I just do that with the 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:06:03.899
 all day in bed this but that is so 

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:07.779
 hard because that often you do so as 

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:11.189
 you would know what it's about just so 

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:15.639
 the other does not tell more 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:18.869
 it's bad but sometimes he wants 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.869
 simply not be heard 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:25.329
 610 yes I know it's not far 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:27.549
 or if you somehow something 

00:06:25.329 --> 00:06:29.769
 amazon is and thus interrupted and 

00:06:27.549 --> 00:06:32.309
 the other load lammert data consumption 

00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:35.199
 so yes i hi I know I once 

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:39.969
 I tell you, I'll do it 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:42.429
 quite often frankly, but me 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:44.619
 do not do that the worst thing 

00:06:42.429 --> 00:06:47.409
 you ever did a date 

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:50.649
 absolutely nothing at all 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:52.719
 I was almost never gates I 

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:54.989
 maybe have a date or year per year 

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:59.469
 if any 

00:06:54.989 --> 00:07:02.379
 daytime no types somehow i meet 

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:03.389
 just make an appointment with them but know 

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:06.719
 her no dates 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:09.219
 That's why I really can not 

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:11.109
 Imagine what the worst part is 

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:15.039
 ever thought of 1 

00:07:11.109 --> 00:07:16.599
 maybe without realizing it as an officer 

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:19.869
 Flirting that is something 

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:22.659
 i do not like it when i'm flirting but 

00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:29.439
 otherwise something bad for 

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:35.949
 mega maybe on his start at 

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:38.649
 first date what needs to vote against 

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:39.429
 unfortunately with the questions are more 

00:07:38.649 --> 00:07:41.409
 not in there 

00:07:39.429 --> 00:07:43.479
 you may feel as if you are packed 

00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:43.980
 if you want to do that too 

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:45.590
 I would say 

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:49.080
 you come to the last video for this 

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:51.270
 playlist text i wish you one 

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.480
 nice evening still so beautiful remaining 

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.480
 Day
