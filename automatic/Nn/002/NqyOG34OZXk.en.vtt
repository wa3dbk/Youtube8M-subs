00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
I also found myself it's generally a

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.200 
I also found myself it's generally a
huge<00:05:29.070> generalization<00:05:29.400> with<00:05:29.790> people<00:05:30.090> before

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
huge generalization with people before

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.210 
huge generalization with people before
open<00:05:30.930> mind<00:05:31.170> it's<00:05:31.380> all<00:05:31.530> cards<00:05:31.860> of<00:05:31.950> different

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
open mind it's all cards of different

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.300

things<00:05:33.060> on<00:05:33.540> the<00:05:33.660> concert<00:05:33.960> UK<00:05:34.500> can<00:05:34.740> be<00:05:34.830> a<00:05:34.860> bit<00:05:35.040> I

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
things on the concert UK can be a bit I

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.350 
things on the concert UK can be a bit I
think

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
think

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.210 
think
box<00:05:36.780> I<00:05:36.990> think<00:05:37.050> in<00:05:37.320> England<00:05:37.620> is<00:05:37.710> much<00:05:38.070> more

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
box I think in England is much more

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.030 
box I think in England is much more
insular<00:05:38.580> maybe<00:05:38.760> maybe<00:05:39.090> because<00:05:39.450> of<00:05:40.040> the

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
insular maybe maybe because of the

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.980 
insular maybe maybe because of the
independent<00:05:41.700> music<00:05:41.940> scene<00:05:41.970> is<00:05:42.240> so<00:05:42.540> much<00:05:42.690> more

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
independent music scene is so much more

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.240 
independent music scene is so much more
reliant<00:05:43.530> upon<00:05:43.740> the<00:05:44.450> music<00:05:45.450> press<00:05:45.950> yeah<00:05:46.950> you
