don't cost much I mean if you take this

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.469 
don't cost much I mean if you take this
for<00:04:55.330> example<00:04:55.620> this<00:04:56.620> cost<00:04:56.919> me<00:04:57.099> this<00:04:57.370> cost<00:04:57.699> my

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
for example this cost me this cost my

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.080 
for example this cost me this cost my
parents<00:04:58.509> six<00:04:58.960> pounds<00:04:59.289> so<00:04:59.469> that's<00:04:59.650> all<00:04:59.800> right

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090
