00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello friends welcome to another video of 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.960
 accessibility project and such technology 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.389
 for all of the foundation we can all 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.249
 help on this occasion we will continue with 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.829
 our technology news since 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:15.360
 during the international event ihf have 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:18.720
 there have been several releases 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.360
 interesting as the galaxy no 4 in his or 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.950
 nice with the xperia z 3 and at this moment 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.280
 we will be talking about his younger brother 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.920
 the z3 compact something like when in 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.320
 samsung we talk about him is 5 and that 5 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.030
 mini is 4 is four mini-vigil 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.010
 after all the mini range that come 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:41.280
 coming out good here you can see the team 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.920
 there were no compact states or the 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.350
 z1 compact was the version that came out 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.289
 compact the z1 and then they jumped the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.940
 z3 compact and we will be showing 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.940
 some characteristics of this equipment 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.950
 the size is still exactly the same 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.190
 that is, the size of the equipment is the same 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.440
 team let's say what there is not a change 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.530
 the screen within the same frame will 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.630
 they enlarged a bit but but it continues with 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.290
 the same resolution that changes the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.820
 amount then of pixels per inch 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.920
 but let's say it does not show much so 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.140
 in the team they put the same z3 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.900
 of the brightness then a high power brightness 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.910
 of 600 nits then that kind of brightness 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.650
 Well, it will help us in a 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.750
 so I do not know outdoors 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.170
 when you are with a lot of sun to see better 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.170
 let say 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.570
 Let's see 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:39.030
 it is a little thinner the z1 companion 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.470
 of 8 points of 9.5 millimeters is 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:47.940
 new forgiveness of the 9.5 this is 8.6 the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.680
 another weighs 137 grams this one weighs 129 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.860
 grams then we get an improvement 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.900
 well also in the rest weight you can 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.010
 know what changes I can tell you 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.010
 as interesting 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.350
 in the housing that the rear glass have 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.970
 attached to the front part by carbonate 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.950
 polycarbonate and it's going to work for 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.950
 remote play then the same function 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.470
 that is said to note to no 4 forgiveness 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.930
 to 7 to 3 that comes with the remote play 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.190
 to be able to play playstation 4 from the 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.830
 team then transmit the contents 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.390
 This also will have the camera if 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.010
 they screwed up they will continue to be 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.040
 exactly the same but they got him 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.890
 software that is going to have the z3 the 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.780
 battery better a little 2,300 1600 but 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.910
 as improved screen because there too 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.530
 let's say what is lost a little follows 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.390
 being thus resistant to water 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.819
 good the characteristics are similar 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.160
 expect a price more or less than 500 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.200
 euros what can you say that is high 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.150
 for a team of these who think about 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.390
 this team would buy it what is their 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.010
 opinion and we listen to your comments 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.180

 analysis about an article with a lot

 We do it, some of us buy it 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.709

 It gives us where we get this information 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.360
 where we go knowing in this case was 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.010
 x mode is mode but we are also
