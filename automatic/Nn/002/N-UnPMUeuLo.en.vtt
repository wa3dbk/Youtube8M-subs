formatted but just why I chose this med
this<00:00:59.969> method<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.449> very<00:01:00.539> easy<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.170> do<00:01:01.289> because

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
this method is very easy to do because

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.729

midfielder<00:01:05.060> but<00:01:06.060> they<00:01:06.630> will<00:01:06.780> be<00:01:07.020> better<00:01:07.860> or

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
midfielder but they will be better or

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.370

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
they will come out better as a central

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.620 
they will come out better as a central
defensive<00:01:11.159> midfielder<00:01:12.150> because<00:01:12.390> they<00:01:12.540> have

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
defensive midfielder because they have

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.140 
defensive midfielder because they have
good<00:01:14.689> defending<00:01:15.689> stats<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.229> good<00:01:17.150> heading
