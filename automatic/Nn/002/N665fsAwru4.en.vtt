Logitech m2 80 mouse this is a mouse
that<00:00:05.759> aims<00:00:06.060> to<00:00:06.240> combine<00:00:06.450> wireless

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
that aims to combine wireless

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:18.960 
that aims to combine wireless
with<00:00:07.649> portability<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.519> productivity

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.300 

so<00:00:19.660> the<00:00:19.960> design<00:00:20.290> is<00:00:20.320> actually<00:00:20.590> really<00:00:21.100> really

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
so the design is actually really really

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.100 
so the design is actually really really
nice<00:00:21.550> and<00:00:21.820> it's<00:00:21.910> really<00:00:22.090> comfy<00:00:22.420> for<00:00:22.600> me<00:00:22.720> which

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
nice and it's really comfy for me which

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.300 
nice and it's really comfy for me which
is<00:00:23.260> quite<00:00:23.440> surprising<00:00:23.680> because<00:00:24.070> I<00:00:24.160> have

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
is quite surprising because I have

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.520 
is quite surprising because I have
fairly<00:00:25.030> big<00:00:25.180> hands<00:00:25.570> now<00:00:25.930> for<00:00:26.080> us<00:00:26.200> we're<00:00:26.320> really

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:26.530 
fairly big hands now for us we're really

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.840 
fairly big hands now for us we're really
impressive<00:00:26.980> so<00:00:27.190> I<00:00:27.220> think<00:00:27.340> it<00:00:27.550> could<00:00:27.700> for

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850 
impressive so I think it could for

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.970 
impressive so I think it could for
anyone<00:00:28.150> and<00:00:28.630> it<00:00:28.720> starts<00:00:29.050> off<00:00:29.230> with<00:00:29.440> the<00:00:29.740> some

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
anyone and it starts off with the some

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.010 
anyone and it starts off with the some

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.750 
rest it's got a really nice texture in
it<00:00:32.169> it's<00:00:32.380> got<00:00:32.529> a<00:00:32.560> diamond<00:00:32.770> pattern<00:00:33.160> or

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
it it's got a diamond pattern or

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.370

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.080 
nice
and<00:00:35.860> it<00:00:36.010> carries<00:00:36.309> on<00:00:36.340> to<00:00:36.550> the<00:00:36.640> right<00:00:36.820> hand<00:00:36.850> side

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
and it carries on to the right hand side

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.940 
and it carries on to the right hand side
and<00:00:37.450> in<00:00:37.780> between<00:00:37.930> that<00:00:38.260> you've<00:00:38.440> got<00:00:38.620> a<00:00:38.770> nice
