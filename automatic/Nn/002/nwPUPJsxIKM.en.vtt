inverted power slide so you need to be
able<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.340> do<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.460> good<00:00:11.700> power<00:00:11.940> slide<00:00:12.269> first<00:00:12.660> just

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
able to do a good power slide first just

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.079 
able to do a good power slide first just
normal<00:00:13.920> power<00:00:14.219> slide<00:00:14.490> back<00:00:14.670> with<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:14.969> is

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
normal power slide back with this is

normal power slide back with this is
your<00:00:15.210> prerequisite<00:00:15.990> skill

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.000 

okay<00:00:24.490> so<00:00:24.550> now<00:00:25.030> let's<00:00:25.270> try<00:00:25.480> the<00:00:25.960> inverted<00:00:26.740> power

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010 
okay so now let's try the inverted power

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.610 
okay so now let's try the inverted power
slide<00:00:30.270> so<00:00:31.270> let's<00:00:31.540> start<00:00:31.810> statically<00:00:32.349> first

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:32.620 
slide so let's start statically first

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.200 
slide so let's start statically first
and<00:00:32.890> it's<00:00:33.010> definitely<00:00:33.460> easier<00:00:33.850> if<00:00:33.970> you<00:00:34.060> have

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
and it's definitely easier if you have

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.210 
and it's definitely easier if you have
something<00:00:34.510> to<00:00:34.630> hold<00:00:34.780> on<00:00:35.020> to<00:00:35.050> so<00:00:35.860> if<00:00:36.070> my

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
something to hold on to so if my

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.460 
something to hold on to so if my
favorite<00:00:36.490> power<00:00:36.820> sliding<00:00:37.240> leg<00:00:37.600> is<00:00:38.020> sliding

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
favorite power sliding leg is sliding

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.700 
favorite power sliding leg is sliding
the<00:00:38.590> left<00:00:38.770> then<00:00:39.520> struck<00:00:40.120> in<00:00:40.270> a<00:00:40.360> big<00:00:40.630> deep<00:00:41.050> toe

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
the left then struck in a big deep toe

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.979 
the left then struck in a big deep toe
roll<00:00:41.890> lunge<00:00:42.220> position<00:00:42.489> and<00:00:42.970> then<00:00:43.300> drop<00:00:43.720> that

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
roll lunge position and then drop that

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.630 
roll lunge position and then drop that
heel<00:00:44.520> okay<00:00:45.520> so<00:00:46.390> try<00:00:46.450> that<00:00:46.660> tour<00:00:47.440> or<00:00:47.680> drop<00:00:48.460> the

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
heel okay so try that tour or drop the

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.940 
heel okay so try that tour or drop the
heel<00:00:48.900> now<00:00:49.900> you<00:00:49.960> still<00:00:50.290> got<00:00:50.440> eighty<00:00:50.680> or<00:00:50.920> ninety

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
heel now you still got eighty or ninety

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.729 
heel now you still got eighty or ninety
percent<00:00:51.370> on<00:00:51.730> this<00:00:51.879> knee<00:00:52.180> and<00:00:52.420> super<00:00:53.320> knee<00:00:53.500> bet

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
percent on this knee and super knee bet

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.550 
percent on this knee and super knee bet
now<00:00:54.160> this<00:00:54.489> straight<00:00:55.239> leg<00:00:55.540> must<00:00:56.020> be<00:00:56.110> straight

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560 
now this straight leg must be straight

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.740 
now this straight leg must be straight
you<00:00:56.800> don't<00:00:57.010> bend<00:00:57.280> that<00:00:57.400> name<00:00:57.730> you<00:00:58.180> actually

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
you don't bend that name you actually

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.130 
you don't bend that name you actually
straighten<00:00:59.560> it<00:00:59.850> okay<00:01:00.880> so<00:01:01.300> eighty<00:01:01.750> ninety

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
straighten it okay so eighty ninety

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.420 
straighten it okay so eighty ninety
percent<00:01:02.260> here<00:01:02.680> super<00:01:03.430> bent<00:01:03.640> super<00:01:04.509> straight

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
percent here super bent super straight

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.550 
percent here super bent super straight
so<00:01:06.430> first<00:01:06.759> statically<00:01:07.450> take<00:01:07.690> the<00:01:07.840> toe<00:01:08.050> off<00:01:08.290> the

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
so first statically take the toe off the

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.340 
so first statically take the toe off the
ground<00:01:08.830> and<00:01:09.100> rotate<00:01:09.970> your<00:01:10.180> hip<00:01:10.420> to<00:01:11.020> get<00:01:11.200> your

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
skates at ninety degrees you want to ask

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.969 
skates at ninety degrees you want to ask
a<00:01:15.880> friend<00:01:16.090> to<00:01:16.360> hold<00:01:16.660> both<00:01:16.960> hands<00:01:17.350> whilst<00:01:17.710> you
