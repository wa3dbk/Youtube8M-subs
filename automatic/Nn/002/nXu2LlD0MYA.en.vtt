rained take a look inside and see that
we're<00:01:18.840> not<00:01:19.050> leaking<00:01:19.470> anywhere<00:01:26.780> got<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> little

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
we're not leaking anywhere got a little

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.690 
we're not leaking anywhere got a little
issue<00:01:28.200> with<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.590> dash<00:01:28.770> there<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.520> think

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
issue with the dash there I think

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.700 
issue with the dash there I think
there's<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.940> crack<00:01:30.240> right<00:01:31.080> there

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.120 

what<00:01:37.190> we<00:01:37.310> look<00:01:37.460> like

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:53.450 

okay<00:01:44.860> decent<00:01:45.860> interior

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:04.319 

okay

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.469 

and<00:02:04.479> that's<00:02:05.020> pretty<00:02:05.229> much<00:02:05.350> it<00:02:05.530> so<00:02:06.299> if<00:02:07.299> you're

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
and that's pretty much it so if you're

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.349
