00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.840
 American firm chlorine through makeup 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.550
 from where 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:21.650
 for testing hybrid hf r46 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:24.029
 one dark flesh is not a dark shirt 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.020
 different from the shirts that are now in 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:35.400
 we are here so dark streaks of 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:39.530
 bright good for this time 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.579
 or plant developmental stage size 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.010
 only seems to be like here 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:50.309
 Tatars as if this is probably up to 10 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:53.370
 kilogram today is 84 days that no 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.789
 a decent rain one rain was here 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:01.489
 somewhere 68 centimeters but he only 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:07.680
 watered moisture supply of moisture he did not 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:09.260
 roughly speaking, dissolved some fertilizers 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.710
 will taste 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.330
 unknown when compared to viking 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:21.630
 probably a shirt a little closer to the viking 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:24.200
 if you compare to the viking it is larger 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.200
 viking 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:37.130
 viking is also a watermelon firm 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:41.640
 cold from early lumps on red flesh 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:46.310
 that's probably only one drawback 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.310
 that a little bit ovary a little 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:02.560
 this is hf r46 51 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.830
 we shot him when he was still not ripe 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:10.600
 he has ripened like that 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:14.880
 sending an interesting here black mustache 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.880
 come on it's own this Watermelon charged 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.270
 court see it here somewhere around 8 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.010
 kilo and show too 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:31.470
 here is a yellow beautiful spot 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:34.470
 yellow orange now see it 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.470
 the pulp 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.560
 that's how it looks 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:54.660
 he was earlier among the hybrids on this field he 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.780
 ripened a little earlier to you it means 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:06.330
 before you go between crimson cut and 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:11.910
 you to the dark red flesh it is necessary 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:15.650
 Try as before, do not like it 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:20.030
 he likes the same color 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:23.010
 you try just try to connect 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.690
 sweet we tasting him whether we 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.690
 I liked sweets 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:39.420
 how sweet downs he's sweet that's watch 46 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:45.160
 51 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:49.510
 This firm Howar gave on test I his 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:54.360
 I will not kill you, you must look again 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:59.069
 He is still a license plate here is this hybrid and somewhere 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.069
 more than 10 kilograms can be kilograms 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:11.590
 watermelon will soon be 12 here 46 51 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:16.870
 him 1 branch dark red flesh he doesn't 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:20.320
 shallow he earlier like that he looks in 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.570
 a number from the heads given many times 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:28.530
 I repeat that this is a natural drought 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.530
 disaster on the sinking looks good 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:35.139
 here 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:38.099
 about such sizes and this lie more than 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.099
 10 kilogram 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.779
 uzip punch 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:56.040
 this 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:05:02.950
 sr 40 651 is this firm color american 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:08.650
 round diane shape external aspects 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:11.590
 I liked it and I like red here 46 51 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:15.310
 you have to try it 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.480
 sympathetic coloring about ten 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.460
 powers 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:32.320
 yes well it is well it is not watermelon wine yes 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:37.690
 This is a beautiful form. This is how it is. 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:40.530
 here I think even the rain got in here 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.530
 the idea did not rest 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:48.310
 here is hf r46 51 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.780
 We will need to focus on it and to 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:59.230
 draw his form 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:06:02.980
 that he is the smooth color of his hf r46 51 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:04.030
 that's how it looks at the sun on us 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:10.590
 it will be interesting 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:10.590
 says bilyk and so he
