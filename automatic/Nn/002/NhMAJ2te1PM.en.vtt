00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
holidays in my family business gone so

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.370 
holidays in my family business gone so
how<00:02:44.040> do<00:02:44.100> we<00:02:44.580> approach<00:02:44.910> some<00:02:45.380> conceptualizes

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
how do we approach some conceptualizes

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.620 
how do we approach some conceptualizes
we<00:02:46.860> think<00:02:47.070> about<00:02:47.160> scoring<00:02:47.790> that<00:02:48.120> resonates

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
we think about scoring that resonates

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.390 
we think about scoring that resonates
across<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:49.709> then<00:02:49.860> we<00:02:49.980> think<00:02:50.160> about<00:02:50.220> the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
across and then we think about the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.910 
across and then we think about the
materials<00:02:50.970> or<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.780> colorway

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
materials or the colorway

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.220 
materials or the colorway
defective<00:02:53.489> leaked<00:02:53.700> out<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.060> story<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.720> then

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
defective leaked out the story and then

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.410 
defective leaked out the story and then
finally<00:02:55.470> we<00:02:55.590> apply<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.430> then<00:02:56.670> so<00:02:57.209> that<00:02:57.360> you

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
finally we apply it and then so that you

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.870 
finally we apply it and then so that you
can<00:02:57.600> finally<00:02:57.810> be<00:02:58.110> shown<00:02:58.769> us<00:02:59.010> something<00:02:59.850> that

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
can finally be shown us something that

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.479 
can finally be shown us something that
is<00:03:00.030> inspired<00:03:00.540> by<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.780> story<00:03:01.010> so<00:03:02.010> we<00:03:02.340> know<00:03:02.459> that

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
is inspired by a story so we know that

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.540 
is inspired by a story so we know that
in<00:03:02.760> 2013<00:03:03.750> is<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:03.959> year<00:03:04.080> of<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.470> snake<00:03:04.530> so<00:03:05.250> we

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
in 2013 is the year of the snake so we

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.400 
in 2013 is the year of the snake so we
wanted<00:03:05.820> to<00:03:05.880> tell<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.300> story<00:03:06.600> that<00:03:07.110> snake

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
wanted to tell a story that snake

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.550 
wanted to tell a story that snake
inspired<00:03:07.830> so<00:03:08.459> what<00:03:08.850> what<00:03:09.600> we<00:03:10.320> find

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
inspired so what what we find

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.370 
inspired so what what we find
interesting<00:03:10.709> about<00:03:11.040> snakes<00:03:11.640> is<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:11.790> they

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
interesting about snakes is that they

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.560 
interesting about snakes is that they
remove<00:03:13.380> so<00:03:13.829> this<00:03:14.070> at<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.370> shed<00:03:14.610> skin<00:03:14.790> our<00:03:15.360> new

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
remove so this at the shed skin our new

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.050 
remove so this at the shed skin our new
group<00:03:15.810> with<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:16.920> design<00:03:17.250> that's<00:03:17.579> what<00:03:17.730> we<00:03:17.850> try

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
group with the design that's what we try

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.640 
group with the design that's what we try
to<00:03:18.140> visually<00:03:19.140> we<00:03:19.410> wanted<00:03:19.829> to<00:03:19.980> have<00:03:20.540> double<00:03:21.540> a

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
to visually we wanted to have double a

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.710 
to visually we wanted to have double a
material<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:23.130> allows<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:24.090> upper<00:03:24.329> layer<00:03:24.480> to

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
material that allows the upper layer to

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.000 
material that allows the upper layer to
get

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
get

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.050 
get
-<00:03:26.730> we're<00:03:26.970> to<00:03:27.720> review<00:03:28.080> a<00:03:28.110> Hanalei<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:29.069> that<00:03:29.250> it

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
- we're to review a Hanalei so that it

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.900 
- we're to review a Hanalei so that it
kind<00:03:30.330> of<00:03:30.450> simulates<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.410> snake<00:03:32.340> shape<00:03:32.610> our

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
kind of simulates the snake shape our

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.960 
kind of simulates the snake shape our
skin<00:03:33.270> sharing<00:03:33.630> of<00:03:33.720> snakes<00:03:34.110> but<00:03:34.550> how<00:03:35.550> about<00:03:35.610> it

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
skin sharing of snakes but how about it

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.510 
skin sharing of snakes but how about it
couldn't<00:03:36.209> be<00:03:36.300> executed<00:03:37.050> so<00:03:37.680> in<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.130> end<00:03:38.280> we

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
couldn't be executed so in the end we

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.140 
couldn't be executed so in the end we
split<00:03:39.650> two<00:03:40.650> different<00:03:41.069> thick<00:03:41.580> texture

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
split two different thick texture

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:50.830 
split two different thick texture
material<00:03:42.660> of<00:03:43.110> death<00:03:43.350> so<00:03:43.770> that's<00:03:44.010> like<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.280> layer

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.540 

and<00:03:51.840> then<00:03:51.989> a<00:03:52.380> multicolor<00:03:52.890> snake<00:03:53.819> texture<00:03:55.550> we

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
and then a multicolor snake texture we

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.940 
and then a multicolor snake texture we
had<00:03:56.730> like<00:03:57.920> like<00:03:58.920> effective<00:03:59.810> piping<00:04:00.810> on<00:04:01.709> the

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
had like like effective piping on the

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.490 
had like like effective piping on the
sides<00:04:02.610> and<00:04:02.940> on<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.150> tongue<00:04:03.450> to<00:04:04.200> kind<00:04:04.410> of

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
sides and on a tongue to kind of

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.039 
sides and on a tongue to kind of
simulate<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:05.330> nocturnal<00:04:06.330> nature<00:04:06.450> of<00:04:06.720> snakes

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
simulate the nocturnal nature of snakes

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.259 
simulate the nocturnal nature of snakes
they<00:04:07.650> have<00:04:07.769> like<00:04:07.950> SHINee<00:04:08.250> album<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:08.819> sunny

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
they have like SHINee album and sunny

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.440 
they have like SHINee album and sunny
eyes<00:04:09.560> that<00:04:10.560> catchy<00:04:10.890> glows<00:04:11.280> in<00:04:11.819> the<00:04:11.880> dark

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
eyes that catchy glows in the dark

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.870 
eyes that catchy glows in the dark
also<00:04:13.110> -<00:04:13.170> Erin<00:04:13.560> we<00:04:13.739> have<00:04:13.920> we<00:04:14.190> have<00:04:14.310> like<00:04:14.519> growing

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
also - Erin we have we have like growing

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.599 
also - Erin we have we have like growing
data<00:04:15.150> elements<00:04:15.569> as<00:04:15.660> well<00:04:15.840> on<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.260> few<00:04:16.739> gogo

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
data elements as well on the few gogo

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.580 
data elements as well on the few gogo
the<00:04:17.880> site<00:04:18.120> logo<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.660> then<00:04:18.780> audio<00:04:18.989> so<00:04:19.410> I<00:04:21.590> think

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
the site logo and then audio so I think

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.280 
the site logo and then audio so I think
plastic<00:04:23.070> is<00:04:23.460> a<00:04:23.490> very<00:04:23.790> overused<00:04:24.180> word<00:04:24.690> but<00:04:24.720> in

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
plastic is a very overused word but in

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.360 
plastic is a very overused word but in
this<00:04:25.530> case<00:04:25.860> I<00:04:26.190> think<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:28.860> fact<00:04:29.100> that's<00:04:29.190> been

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
this case I think the fact that's been

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.500 
this case I think the fact that's been
around<00:04:29.610> for<00:04:29.910> 30<00:04:30.090> years<00:04:30.330> is<00:04:31.100> deserving<00:04:32.100> of<00:04:32.510> you
