 subtitled to artifacts of power 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.750
 unexpected thing it unexpectedly 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.670
 announced unexpectedly released in 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.310
 early access and then no less 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.590
 unexpectedly released in the release itself 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.769
 the game contains a couple of surprises and 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.420
 so you are in the playgame.ru theater 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.469
 on stage Ivan Loyev 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.390
 and let's talk about fairy tales 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.700
 know to fit right into the third 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.160
 part troy on and don't feel 5 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.219
 foot or like a birthday at the far 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.100
 Relatives Ie torment questions who 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.460
 all these people and why exactly is happening 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.160
 it is here unlike the fifth part mgs all 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.230
 extremely simple there are three heroes 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.079
 cum blockheads joe i'm a thief and 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.789
 witchcraft master a model and there is 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.219
 artifact troika who loves them 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.159
 call for the salvation of the world as much as possible 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.369
 understand by number 3 in the name of the game to 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.260
 this world we saved our two heroes 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.869
 travel together and at the expense of 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.880
 alternation of different abilities 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.290
 overcome all sorts of obstacles 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.799
 anti skillfully swinging his sword 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.720
 hiding behind a shield and generally strong zoe 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.090
 skillful thief acrobat excellent 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.659
 bowing and climbing on 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.060
 walls and ropes but the model can 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.920
 find a moan while in spells conjures 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.049
 owns telekinesis that is able 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.869
 move objects by mouse but or 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.939
 gamepad news to and can alchemical 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.390
 by emitting metal from the air 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.939
 cubes 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.159
 but to talk about abilities we still 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.630
 back run these three by 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.950
 traditional platformer level 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.710
 although no ran before ran because 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.770
 In Trayan 3, the platformer suddenly found another 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.079
 one dimension depth that is usually we 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.659
 still moving forward on the left 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.939
 screen on the right but quite often will 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.210
 meet pieces where you can go 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.849
 power from the camera or to her as for me 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.250
 The solution is quite original and real. 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.170
 influencing gameplay to 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.330
 this is a new dimension it is not easy for 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.099
 beauty camera appeared in the cut-scenes 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.620
 now not afraid to drive up or 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.540
 drive away from the heroes every third puzzle 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.819
 somehow involves the ability 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.010
 maneuver in the interior of the structure but also 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.840
 levels become more interesting in general 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.849
 as for me solid pluses 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.049
 And the fans on the Internet made a howl about 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.540
 some not canons 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.440
 how do I need to make a howl 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.390
 another occasion, well, the truth of it, I'm so 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.269
 whining out of the game completely 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.700
 disappeared pumping limited set 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.920
 abilities of each hero we master 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.060
 for the first three levels and then 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.850
 everything 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.510
 nothing new or improved wait 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.060
 have to 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.190
 and part of the missing prikolyuh 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.829
 replaced by very strange alternatives 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.120
 for example chubby ponte learned through 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:06.750
 its not so extensive account 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.160
 plan on becoming an acrobat cleaner zorik 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.670
 in the other hand the thief can now 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.120
 link items and here it is real 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.530
 cool second most important sin 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.400
 duration if earlier game 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.680
 Well passed at least a couple 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.859
 pleasant evenings with friends 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.410
 now two three hours is enough 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:31.870
 especially if the forward is the only one 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.660
 In this regard, the deterrent factor is 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.120
 luminous triangles because all 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.350
 both plot and third-party tasks 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.880
 unlocked after dialing 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.190
 a certain amount of these 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:51.440
 triangle 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:53.630
 and this is a squirrel 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.430
 in fact this system is pretty stupid 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.440
 and because before the last missions 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.600
 corny forces you to be distracted by 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.970
 additional task to dial 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.650
 of this very local currency while 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.750
 these optional level themselves are not 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.990
 represent absolutely no 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.240
 of interest they are short calculated only 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.460
 on one character that is if you 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.280
 You play in to api then on the dungeon will be 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.400
 run three identical heroes and no 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.900
 do not carry the semantic load 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.760
 generally it seems that the game 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.030
 stupidly did not finish because of some problems 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:29.300
 with funding or something like that was enough 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:33.440
 money for a third of the plot and all because of this 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:36.140
 and in the early access rushed and the final say 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.780
 softly he is very unexpected that is 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.880
 history is clearly where to go ahead on 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.980
 just ends like another 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.260
 telltale games episode 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.720
 only here is the next episode no one 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.400
 promised a situation with duration 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.010
 mainstream companies can of course 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:56.210
 somewhat soften the presence of the editor and 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:58.520
 steam workshop support but we are all 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.030
 aware that among the creativity 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:05.210
 users attention worthy of the best 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.970
 case 1 out of 10 cards and if a little more 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.550
 realistically judge something out of 50 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.060
 and let it be the third that they gave us 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.940
 the result is quite beautiful merry fabulous 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.740
 and giving hope to commendable not 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.880
 less frustrated by the sudden 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.020
 ending and Abilene sculpt their bugs 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.780
 lower the bar to prohodnya 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.750
 I hope this game will not become a swan 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.360
 song adventures of pontius a model and for 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.230
 and because other such fabulous and 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:38.600
 I personally do not know operational platforms 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.669
 at the same time I will spend all whether the remainder 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.440
 so that the beginning of the school year is not 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:47.080
 it was painfully embarrassing for aimlessly 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:50.980
 spent days and see you on the feet 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.980
 game room 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.630
 didn't touch
