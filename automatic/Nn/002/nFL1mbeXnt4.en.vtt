there's a couple key design elements on
the<00:01:41.160> frame<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.760> we<00:01:41.880> did<00:01:42.530> that<00:01:43.530> are<00:01:43.770> basically

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
the frame that we did that are basically

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.070 
the frame that we did that are basically
some<00:01:45.120> of<00:01:45.180> them<00:01:45.360> are<00:01:45.450> hidden<00:01:45.630> from<00:01:45.750> view<00:01:45.810> and

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
some of them are hidden from view and

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.020 
some of them are hidden from view and
some<00:01:46.230> of<00:01:46.320> them<00:01:46.440> are<00:01:46.500> very<00:01:46.710> easy<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.040> tell<00:01:47.220> one

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
some of them are very easy to tell one

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.490 
some of them are very easy to tell one
of<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.180> main<00:01:48.300> things<00:01:48.510> is<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:48.780> shaping<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
of the main things is the shaping of the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.580 
of the main things is the shaping of the
tube<00:01:50.100> shapes<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.790> lot<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.600> frame<00:01:52.080> designers

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
tube shapes a lot of frame designers

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.350 
tube shapes a lot of frame designers
will<00:01:52.980> design<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.400> frame<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.790> looks<00:01:53.850> really

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
will design the frame that looks really

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.780 
will design the frame that looks really
cool<00:01:54.660> and<00:01:54.990> has<00:01:55.110> really<00:01:55.320> swoopy<00:01:55.740> lines<00:01:56.010> that's

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
cool and has really swoopy lines that's

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.280 
cool and has really swoopy lines that's
great<00:01:57.120> and<00:01:57.360> then<00:01:57.540> what<00:01:57.660> you<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:57.900> do<00:01:58.020> with

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
great and then what you can do with

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.900 
great and then what you can do with
carbon<00:01:58.500> fiber<00:01:58.800> is<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.130> can<00:01:59.250> then<00:01:59.400> reinforce

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
carbon fiber is you can then reinforce

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.370 
carbon fiber is you can then reinforce
it<00:02:00.030> internally<00:02:00.570> where<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.810> can't<00:02:01.050> see<00:02:01.230> it<00:02:01.290> you

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
it internally where you can't see it you

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.610 
it internally where you can't see it you
can<00:02:01.500> add<00:02:01.680> carbon<00:02:02.070> fiber<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.530> to<00:02:04.530> the

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
can add carbon fiber and and to the

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.220 
can add carbon fiber and and to the
frame<00:02:04.830> to<00:02:05.010> stiffen<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.430> up<00:02:05.550> in<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.630> design<00:02:07.020> out

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
frame to stiffen it up in and design out

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.470 
frame to stiffen it up in and design out
the<00:02:07.380> weak<00:02:07.530> points<00:02:07.920> what<00:02:08.520> we<00:02:08.760> decided<00:02:09.180> was<00:02:09.300> from

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:09.480 
the weak points what we decided was from

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.820 
the weak points what we decided was from
the<00:02:09.570> reverse<00:02:09.750> angle<00:02:09.960> we're<00:02:10.440> going<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.649> take<00:02:10.740> it

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
the reverse angle we're going to take it

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.380 
the reverse angle we're going to take it
from<00:02:10.890> an<00:02:11.070> engineering<00:02:11.460> standpoint<00:02:11.790> we're

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
from an engineering standpoint we're

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.390 
from an engineering standpoint we're
gonna<00:02:12.480> basically<00:02:12.720> design<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.800> proper<00:02:14.160> tube

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
gonna basically design the proper tube

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.210 
gonna basically design the proper tube
shape<00:02:14.790> first<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:16.080> basically<00:02:16.560> all<00:02:16.650> these<00:02:16.980> tube

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
shape first so basically all these tube

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.430 
shape first so basically all these tube
shapes<00:02:17.460> are<00:02:17.790> designed<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.390> optimize<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.410> use

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
shapes are designed to optimize the use

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.130 
shapes are designed to optimize the use
of<00:02:19.710> carbon<00:02:19.890> fiber<00:02:20.330> within<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.600> frame<00:02:21.870> and

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
of carbon fiber within the frame and

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.140 
of carbon fiber within the frame and
then<00:02:22.590> what<00:02:22.920> allows<00:02:23.160> us<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.550> do<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:23.880> we<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.120> use

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
then what allows us to do is we can use

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.450 
then what allows us to do is we can use
the<00:02:24.390> least<00:02:24.570> amount<00:02:24.720> of<00:02:24.960> carbon<00:02:25.290> fiber<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:26.160> get

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
the least amount of carbon fiber to get

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.680 
the least amount of carbon fiber to get
the<00:02:26.550> strength<00:02:26.880> that<00:02:27.060> we<00:02:27.180> need<00:02:27.210> out<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.510> the

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
the strength that we need out of the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.780 
the strength that we need out of the
frame<00:02:27.960> so<00:02:28.710> you'll<00:02:28.890> see<00:02:29.100> we<00:02:29.310> have<00:02:29.400> large<00:02:29.610> flat

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
frame so you'll see we have large flat

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.870 
frame so you'll see we have large flat
surfaces<00:02:30.390> on<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.500> frame<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:32.310> help<00:02:32.460> with<00:02:32.790> the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
surfaces on the frame to help with the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.930 
surfaces on the frame to help with the
dampening<00:02:33.240> effect<00:02:33.360> of<00:02:33.690> carbon<00:02:33.990> fiber<00:02:34.940> another

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
dampening effect of carbon fiber another

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.690 
dampening effect of carbon fiber another
key<00:02:36.240> design<00:02:37.050> element<00:02:37.530> about<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:38.040> frame<00:02:38.280> is

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
key design element about the frame is

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.460 
key design element about the frame is
that<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:39.180> construction<00:02:39.570> although<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.140> can't

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
that the construction although you can't

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.500 
that the construction although you can't
see<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:41.250> frame<00:02:41.490> is<00:02:41.640> only<00:02:41.910> two<00:02:42.090> pieces

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
see it this frame is only two pieces

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.540 
see it this frame is only two pieces
it's<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.870> monocoque<00:02:43.350> structure<00:02:43.709> so<00:02:44.250> basically

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
it's a monocoque structure so basically

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.250 
it's a monocoque structure so basically
from<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.880> front<00:02:45.120> head<00:02:45.240> tube<00:02:45.450> back<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.870> here<00:02:46.110> is

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
from the front head tube back to here is

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.500 
from the front head tube back to here is
one<00:02:46.680> piece<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.220> then<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:47.610> rear<00:02:47.820> triangle<00:02:48.120> is

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
one piece and then the rear triangle is

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.390 
one piece and then the rear triangle is
one<00:02:49.050> piece<00:02:49.380> there<00:02:49.920> are<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.010> couple<00:02:50.130> ways<00:02:50.340> to

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
one piece there are a couple ways to

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.000 
one piece there are a couple ways to
design<00:02:51.240> carbon<00:02:51.750> fiber<00:02:51.959> one<00:02:52.470> is<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.770> cut<00:02:52.920> the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
design carbon fiber one is to cut the

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.220 
design carbon fiber one is to cut the
tubes<00:02:53.220> up<00:02:53.370> in<00:02:53.459> them<00:02:53.940> in<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.330> different<00:02:54.930> pieces

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
tubes up in them in the different pieces

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.650 
tubes up in them in the different pieces
and<00:02:55.590> then<00:02:55.860> glue<00:02:56.040> them<00:02:56.160> all<00:02:56.340> together<00:02:56.489> well<00:02:57.450> the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
and then glue them all together well the

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.090 
and then glue them all together well the
problem<00:02:57.959> with<00:02:58.050> gluing<00:02:58.320> it<00:02:58.410> together<00:02:58.530> is<00:02:58.950> that

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
problem with gluing it together is that

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.310 
problem with gluing it together is that
you<00:02:59.489> have<00:02:59.670> sleeves<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.600> sleeves<00:03:00.900> add<00:03:01.080> weight

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
you have sleeves the sleeves add weight

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.140 
you have sleeves the sleeves add weight
because<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.800> have<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.100> bond<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.730> material

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
because you have to bond the material

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.510 
because you have to bond the material
together<00:03:03.300> so<00:03:03.690> pieces<00:03:04.020> have<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.290> overlap<00:03:04.709> also

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
together so pieces have to overlap also

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.010 
together so pieces have to overlap also
you<00:03:05.580> basically<00:03:05.940> have<00:03:06.120> interruption<00:03:06.690> between

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
you basically have interruption between

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.420 
you basically have interruption between
the<00:03:07.140> carbon<00:03:07.440> fiber<00:03:07.650> when<00:03:07.950> you're<00:03:08.070> doing<00:03:08.310> that

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
the carbon fiber when you're doing that

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.699 
the carbon fiber when you're doing that
but<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.810> reason<00:03:09.930> why<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.200> don't<00:03:10.320> see<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.530> lot

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
but the reason why you don't see a lot

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.350 
but the reason why you don't see a lot
of<00:03:10.739> monocoque<00:03:11.190> manufacturing<00:03:11.880> being<00:03:12.090> done<00:03:12.239> is

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
of monocoque manufacturing being done is

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.060 
of monocoque manufacturing being done is
because<00:03:12.540> it's<00:03:12.720> very<00:03:12.930> expensive<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.650> do<00:03:13.800> it's

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
because it's very expensive to do it's

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.310 
because it's very expensive to do it's
much<00:03:14.250> it's<00:03:14.670> much<00:03:15.000> it's<00:03:15.720> much<00:03:15.959> more

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
much it's much it's much more

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.500 
much it's much it's much more
inexpensive<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:17.340> just<00:03:17.550> build<00:03:17.760> one<00:03:18.000> long<00:03:18.209> top

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
building a carbon fiber bike can also be

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.960 
building a carbon fiber bike can also be
run<00:05:47.610> with<00:05:48.210> a<00:05:48.240> suspension<00:05:48.690> fork<00:05:49.050> or<00:05:49.289> we're<00:05:49.620> now

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
run with a suspension fork or we're now

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.909 
run with a suspension fork or we're now
have<00:05:50.970> available<00:05:51.479> a<00:05:51.660> tapered<00:05:52.050> custom<00:05:52.440> tapered

have available a tapered custom tapered
steer<00:05:53.190> tube<00:05:53.430> fork<00:05:53.699> so<00:05:54.389> this<00:05:54.539> fork<00:05:54.780> has<00:05:54.960> a<00:05:54.990> 1.5

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
steer tube fork so this fork has a 1.5

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.400 
steer tube fork so this fork has a 1.5
101a<00:05:56.190> weight<00:05:56.940> the<00:05:57.060> same<00:05:57.300> as<00:05:57.539> the<00:05:57.930> 101<00:05:58.199> eighth

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
101a weight the same as the 101 eighth

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.200 
101a weight the same as the 101 eighth
fork<00:05:58.740> but<00:05:59.460> it's<00:05:59.639> basically<00:06:00.000> designed

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
fork but it's basically designed

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:09.810 
fork but it's basically designed
specifically<00:06:00.930> for<00:06:01.050> the<00:06:01.320> air<00:06:01.410> 9<00:06:01.590> carbon

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.280 

so<00:06:09.940> again<00:06:10.210> they're<00:06:10.420> trying<00:06:10.570> to<00:06:10.690> point<00:06:10.900> out<00:06:11.050> the

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
so again they're trying to point out the

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.170 
so again they're trying to point out the
1.5

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.989 

lower<00:06:14.920> and<00:06:15.920> one<00:06:16.550> in<00:06:16.670> 1/8<00:06:16.970> upper

00:06:18.989 --> 00:06:18.999 
lower and one in 1/8 upper

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:21.809 
lower and one in 1/8 upper
the<00:06:19.509> rear<00:06:19.719> dropouts<00:06:20.219> again<00:06:21.219> the<00:06:21.369> rear<00:06:21.549> end<00:06:21.699> of

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:21.819 
the rear dropouts again the rear end of

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:26.669 
the rear dropouts again the rear end of
the<00:06:21.909> bike<00:06:22.019> is<00:06:23.019> 100%<00:06:23.589> carbon<00:06:24.519> fiber<00:06:24.879> you<00:06:25.679> can

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:26.679 
the bike is 100% carbon fiber you can

00:06:26.679 --> 00:06:29.489 
the bike is 100% carbon fiber you can
see<00:06:26.919> the<00:06:27.039> dropouts<00:06:27.569> are<00:06:28.569> carbon<00:06:28.959> fiber<00:06:28.989> and

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:29.499 
see the dropouts are carbon fiber and

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:31.709 
see the dropouts are carbon fiber and
basically<00:06:30.309> steel<00:06:30.849> inserts<00:06:31.269> have<00:06:31.360> been<00:06:31.479> put<00:06:31.629> on

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:31.719 
basically steel inserts have been put on

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:33.809 
basically steel inserts have been put on
each<00:06:31.899> edge<00:06:32.079> just<00:06:32.379> protect<00:06:32.739> it<00:06:32.889> against<00:06:33.699> a

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:33.819 
each edge just protect it against a

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:38.339 
each edge just protect it against a
quick-release<00:06:35.309> the<00:06:36.309> frame<00:06:36.929> will<00:06:37.929> be<00:06:38.019> designed

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:38.349 
quick-release the frame will be designed

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:40.439 
quick-release the frame will be designed
this<00:06:38.860> piece<00:06:39.189> has<00:06:39.339> a<00:06:39.369> single<00:06:39.699> speed<00:06:39.879> insert<00:06:40.239> and

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:40.449 
this piece has a single speed insert and

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:42.059 
this piece has a single speed insert and
then<00:06:40.539> will<00:06:40.659> obviously<00:06:40.929> have<00:06:41.229> a<00:06:41.499> derailleur

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:42.069 
then will obviously have a derailleur

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:43.679 
then will obviously have a derailleur
hanger<00:06:42.099> available<00:06:42.789> you<00:06:42.879> saw<00:06:43.059> on<00:06:43.389> the<00:06:43.569> other

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:43.689 
hanger available you saw on the other

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:47.189 
hanger available you saw on the other
bike<00:06:43.959> and<00:06:44.889> these<00:06:45.069> you<00:06:45.729> can<00:06:45.879> see<00:06:46.059> are<00:06:46.869> the<00:06:47.019> post

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:47.199 
bike and these you can see are the post

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:49.139 
bike and these you can see are the post
mount<00:06:47.439> dropouts<00:06:47.889> with<00:06:48.399> aluminum<00:06:48.789> inserts

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:49.149 
mount dropouts with aluminum inserts

00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:51.259 
mount dropouts with aluminum inserts
which<00:06:49.360> allows<00:06:49.659> us<00:06:49.899> to<00:06:50.079> machine<00:06:50.769> these<00:06:50.979> down

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:51.269 
which allows us to machine these down

00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:54.179 
which allows us to machine these down
after<00:06:52.269> after<00:06:53.049> the<00:06:53.139> construction<00:06:53.439> so<00:06:54.039> that

00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:54.189 
after after the construction so that

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:59.219 
after after the construction so that
these<00:06:54.369> are<00:06:54.610> square<00:06:54.909> with<00:06:55.649> the<00:06:56.649> rear<00:06:56.829> dropouts
