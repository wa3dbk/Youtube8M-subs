 I do not Kawakan that can be well explained than of February we would like to do but 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:33.670
 The first thing I want to introduce is this 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:33.670
 Deep shadow color of Excel will Fuchsia Brown 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.760
 Like this 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:41.460
 I'm on the back of my hand 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.500
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:52.800
 It becomes a little reddish brown 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:56.040
 So i think this 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:02.030
 I say I'm not sorry for such a little dirty 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:05.270
 I put a blending brush tapping Luke Caro good color in the nacelle feeling 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.770
 I have some eye shadows recently 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:12.750
 I 'm having trouble putting 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:17.850
 Recently, I have a candle so dark eye makeup 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:21.150
 Because without me Hama likes feeling to dispense me the other daddy 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.420
 I previously have been using the other much this eye shadow 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.930
 Since the softening become quite fashionable feel even one meal 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:32.300
 I really like these days and the price is 1000 yen 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:36.040
 1080 It is not high at all in the yen 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.950
 It is very recommended because it is great to develop color 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:43.370
 Here is what I want to introduce next 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:46.180
 It is the honey last of the small car of 8 Macs 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:51.160
 The color is like this 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:57.480
 I feel like a little pink gold 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:02:00.020
 I mainly use it as a highlighter for that tear bag 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.020
 The color is 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.900
 Do you understand such a feeling 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:13.660
 The moving lame is really beautiful as soon as it is placed on the beautiful tear bag 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:19.840
 Eyes will be great festive feel like a sparkling 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:21.820
 Because the lame is so strong, it won't go to the bill or the highlight of your Majesty with this bill 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.810
 But it's amazing 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.140
 I wonder what 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.540
 Because it looks gorgeous and pretty 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.920
 Hmm 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:38.130
 I used this combination very well in February 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:40.260
 Because this combination was also used in the video of the license of Valentine who started Uno completely 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.130
 Please take a look if you like 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.780

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.590
 This is the third place I would like to introduce our company 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.440
 a 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:56.060
 Hey 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:59.180
 Demel pu zuler of ghosts 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.870
 It will hate teak 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:07.310
 I do not know the color numbers 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:09.030
 I'll check and put it on my mind like this 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.010
 Cola rue 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.240
 pink 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:21.030
 It is a wonderful cute color I hate this 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:25.550
 What if I'd had you as a gift to last year's Christmas not be this year 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:30.410
 Something like that initially got 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.560
 Was the immediate glad Tan got in four did not have that level of teak in the feeling 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.110
 but 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:40.370
 Because something has at all I color of Coral system to another 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:47.690
 I thought so and I did not use it so much but recently 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:48.980
 Well great If you started to use I suddenly become I want to use teak Speaking Aso 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.769
 Ummm 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:04:00.349
 I have a brush like this, but it 's fine for a marvelous couple 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:03.730
 Even if you hit a little thick makeup, it will look perfect 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:06.200
 What do today's trendy florid makeup 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:11.050
 no larger as teak 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:15.180
 It can be used great as a cheek of pale makeup and this is true 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:18.100
 Super I love that we use all the way It's dangerous now 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.290
 He is okay also amazing eyes easy to see eye 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.920
 Package also is not it super cute 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:28.950
 Just putting it in the porch is ridiculous 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:32.300
 Like this is amazing recommend You have put later color number 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:37.190
 Here is what I want to introduce next 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:40.280
 This mascara base of head White Kate 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:44.810
 This is recommended by many people 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.650
 I think there are a lot of people who have or do not have it, but it is great. 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.070
 Ummm 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:55.070
 What also the white 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:59.480
 At all It is not color the way even when you want to use color, for example, color mascara the next cell mascara 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:06.590
 Above all I think that the curling ability of curl is great 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:07.919
 The real drop at all put something also at all the softening use this mascara base even if much has come out to the outside 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.759
 There is no 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:14.879
 The volume also comes out and the scene length comes out 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:15.950
 I think it's very good The price is great too 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:17.000
 Cheap 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.169
 I think it's good 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.560
 Just do something 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:26.650
 here 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:30.990
 I think it 's kind of dirty that it 's kind of dirty that it 's attached here when you open it 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:36.270
 I 'm fine but I 'm worried but only there 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:40.710
 It is such a feeling and it is this that I want to introduce in the end 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:45.260

 If we are people of that dynamic Girl introduction 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:51.590

 The other really come florid sense of makeup Mito even in diluted like a well something today in dark makeup 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:20.190
 I think it is very interesting to say that the color of this lip changes depending on the person I use 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.940
 Do you think 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:28.450
