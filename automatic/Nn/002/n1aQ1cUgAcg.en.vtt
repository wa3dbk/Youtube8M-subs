00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.030 
projects
on<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:20.210> road<00:02:20.390> we<00:02:21.200> would<00:02:21.350> simply<00:02:21.770> have<00:02:21.800> to

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
on the road we would simply have to

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.690 
there are many other off-site events
that<00:02:29.780> we<00:02:29.959> could<00:02:30.200> do<00:02:30.440> if<00:02:30.709> we<00:02:30.770> had<00:02:31.130> a<00:02:31.160> production

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
that we could do if we had a production

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.380 
that we could do if we had a production
truck<00:02:31.970> for<00:02:32.810> example<00:02:33.230> our<00:02:33.410> yearly<00:02:33.740> summits<00:02:34.390> we

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
truck for example our yearly summits we

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.650 
truck for example our yearly summits we
could<00:02:35.569> do<00:02:35.780> at<00:02:36.230> different<00:02:37.130> locations<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.000> we

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
could do at different locations and we

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.390 
could do at different locations and we
could<00:02:38.870> just<00:02:39.110> simply<00:02:39.350> take<00:02:39.740> the<00:02:39.770> van<00:02:40.130> and

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
could just simply take the van and

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.150 
could just simply take the van and
produce<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.450> lectures<00:02:41.870> that<00:02:42.080> are<00:02:42.320> given<00:02:42.980> at

produce the lectures that are given at

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.430 
produce the lectures that are given at
the<00:02:43.190> summit<00:02:43.670> we<00:02:44.570> also<00:02:44.780> could<00:02:45.230> do<00:02:45.410> our

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
the summit we also could do our

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.370 
the summit we also could do our
week-long<00:02:46.190> anchor<00:02:47.180> theology<00:02:47.780> school<00:02:47.840> and

week-long anchor theology school and

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.640 
week-long anchor theology school and
this<00:02:49.190> means<00:02:49.489> that<00:02:49.670> we<00:02:49.880> could<00:02:50.060> do<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:50.930> in<00:02:51.319> other

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
this means that we could do it in other

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.920 
this means that we could do it in other
places<00:02:51.980> other<00:02:52.400> than<00:02:52.700> here<00:02:53.270> at<00:02:53.390> our

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
places other than here at our

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.780 
places other than here at our
headquarters<00:02:54.140> in<00:02:54.739> Fresno<00:02:55.280> this<00:02:55.489> would<00:02:55.670> make

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
headquarters in Fresno this would make

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.350 
headquarters in Fresno this would make
