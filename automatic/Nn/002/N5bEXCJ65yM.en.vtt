they'll be indicated as such for the
purpose<00:01:05.360> of<00:01:05.570> this<00:01:05.690> demo<00:01:06.110> we<00:01:06.350> are<00:01:06.380> going<00:01:06.800> to

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
purpose of this demo we are going to

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.399 
purpose of this demo we are going to
ignore<00:01:07.159> all<00:01:07.640> character<00:01:08.360> effects<00:01:08.659> just<00:01:09.229> for

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
ignore all character effects just for

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.020 
ignore all character effects just for
the<00:01:09.470> purpose<00:01:09.740> of<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:09.890> demo<00:01:10.040> so<00:01:10.490> basically

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
the purpose of the demo so basically

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.660 
the purpose of the demo so basically
we're<00:01:11.180> gonna<00:01:11.270> assume<00:01:11.510> that<00:01:11.720> these<00:01:11.870> are<00:01:11.930> all

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
we're gonna assume that these are all

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.899 
we're gonna assume that these are all
playing<00:01:13.670> characters<00:01:15.250> each<00:01:16.250> character<00:01:16.700> has<00:01:16.729> a

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
playing characters each character has a

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.650 
playing characters each character has a
few<00:01:17.360> values<00:01:20.170> to<00:01:21.170> consider<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:23.090> very<00:01:23.480> top

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
few values to consider the very top

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.030 
few values to consider the very top
number<00:01:23.990> is<00:01:24.200> called

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
number is called

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.700 
number is called
their<00:01:25.280> cost<00:01:25.520> that<00:01:26.270> is<00:01:26.450> how<00:01:26.660> much<00:01:26.840> it<00:01:27.050> costs<00:01:27.500> to

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
their cost that is how much it costs to

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.430 
their cost that is how much it costs to
bring<00:01:28.370> that<00:01:28.550> character<00:01:28.700> out<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:31.610> Tuileries

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
bring that character out the Tuileries

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.650 
bring that character out the Tuileries
these<00:01:33.440> are<00:01:33.560> basically<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.010> older<00:01:34.400> type<00:01:34.660> cards

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
these are basically the older type cards

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.080 
these are basically the older type cards
where<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:36.650> top<00:01:36.830> number<00:01:37.130> is<00:01:37.160> attacked<00:01:37.730> the

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
where the top number is attacked the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.410 
where the top number is attacked the
bottom<00:01:38.390> number<00:01:38.510> is<00:01:38.690> the<00:01:39.410> defense<00:01:40.400> the<00:01:41.180> newer

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
bottom number is the defense the newer

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.750 
bottom number is the defense the newer
format<00:01:41.870> of<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.020> cards<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.770> attack<00:01:43.220> is<00:01:43.460> on<00:01:43.610> the

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
format of the cards the attack is on the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.490 
format of the cards the attack is on the
left<00:01:44.210> side<00:01:44.450> I<00:01:44.480> believe<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.050> defense<00:01:45.350> is

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
left side I believe and the defense is

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.350 
left side I believe and the defense is
on<00:01:45.620> the<00:01:45.710> right<00:01:46.040> side<00:01:46.370> or<00:01:46.550> might<00:01:46.820> be<00:01:46.910> vice<00:01:47.090> versa

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
on the right side or might be vice versa

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.500 
on the right side or might be vice versa
I<00:01:47.480> forgot

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
I forgot

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.120

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
it's done

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.850 
it's done

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
unless if the plot twist says that's

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.010 
unless if the plot twist says that's
ongoing<00:05:09.460> which<00:05:09.790> is<00:05:09.940> symbolized<00:05:10.240> by<00:05:10.510> a<00:05:10.630> clock

ongoing which is symbolized by a clock

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.920 
ongoing which is symbolized by a clock
and<00:05:11.500> it<00:05:12.400> usually<00:05:12.970> the<00:05:13.810> keyword<00:05:14.170> ongoing

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
and it usually the keyword ongoing

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.930 
and it usually the keyword ongoing
basically<00:05:16.930> on<00:05:17.050> an<00:05:17.170> ongoing<00:05:17.350> plot<00:05:17.800> twist<00:05:18.100> apply

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
basically on an ongoing plot twist apply

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.790 
basically on an ongoing plot twist apply
the<00:05:19.000> effect<00:05:19.420> of<00:05:19.600> the<00:05:19.750> word<00:05:19.960> after<00:05:20.200> the<00:05:20.590> words

the effect of the word after the words

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.100 
the effect of the word after the words
ongoing<00:05:21.610> so<00:05:22.150> this<00:05:22.300> one<00:05:22.480> says<00:05:22.600> crossover

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110

go back so for me to bring lady Vic out
I<00:05:31.750> must<00:05:32.020> have<00:05:32.170> at<00:05:32.260> least<00:05:32.290> one<00:05:32.680> resource<00:05:32.860> to

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
I must have at least one resource to

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.960 
I must have at least one resource to
spend<00:05:35.040> pretending<00:05:36.040> I<00:05:36.100> have<00:05:36.220> three<00:05:36.460> resources

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
spend pretending I have three resources

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.180 
spend pretending I have three resources
right<00:05:37.090> now<00:05:37.150> I<00:05:37.480> spend<00:05:38.110> one<00:05:38.290> I<00:05:38.500> can<00:05:38.740> spend<00:05:38.950> two

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
right now I spend one I can spend two

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.390 
right now I spend one I can spend two
more<00:05:39.400> this<00:05:39.760> turn<00:05:39.970> so<00:05:40.710> if<00:05:41.710> I<00:05:41.800> bring<00:05:42.070> Silver

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
more this turn so if I bring Silver

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.130 
more this turn so if I bring Silver
Surfer<00:05:42.580> out<00:05:42.850> I<00:05:43.090> can<00:05:43.360> do<00:05:43.510> so<00:05:43.720> because<00:05:43.960> I<00:05:44.020> have

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.140 
Surfer out I can do so because I have

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.170 
Surfer out I can do so because I have
two<00:05:44.290> more<00:05:44.440> to<00:05:44.560> spend<00:05:44.740> at<00:05:45.520> the<00:05:45.670> start<00:05:45.910> of<00:05:45.970> each

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
two more to spend at the start of each

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.810 
two more to spend at the start of each
turn<00:05:46.240> during<00:05:46.900> the<00:05:46.990> build<00:05:47.200> phase<00:05:47.410> you<00:05:48.010> get<00:05:48.250> one

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
turn during the build phase you get one

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.120 
turn during the build phase you get one
resource<00:05:49.150> point<00:05:49.390> for<00:05:49.540> edge<00:05:49.720> resource<00:05:50.710> on<00:05:50.920> your

resource point for edge resource on your

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.540 
resource point for edge resource on your
research<00:05:52.800> the<00:05:53.800> silver<00:05:54.070> cost<00:05:54.280> is<00:05:54.460> the

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
research the silver cost is the

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.030 
research the silver cost is the
threshold<00:05:54.730> cost<00:05:55.140> what<00:05:56.140> that<00:05:56.320> basically<00:05:56.590> says

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
threshold cost what that basically says

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.710 
threshold cost what that basically says
is<00:05:57.280> you<00:05:57.610> need<00:05:57.760> to<00:05:57.850> be<00:05:57.970> able<00:05:58.060> to<00:05:58.180> see<00:05:58.360> that<00:05:58.570> many

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
is you need to be able to see that many

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.120 
is you need to be able to see that many
resources<00:05:59.110> for<00:05:59.590> you<00:06:00.070> to<00:06:00.160> activate<00:06:00.520> that<00:06:00.580> card

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.200 
resources for you to activate that card
let's<00:06:03.130> assume<00:06:03.340> that's<00:06:03.580> the<00:06:03.640> only<00:06:03.850> card<00:06:04.030> I<00:06:04.090> have

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
let's assume that's the only card I have

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.570 
let's assume that's the only card I have
down<00:06:04.420> on<00:06:04.720> the<00:06:04.780> field<00:06:05.040> for<00:06:06.040> me<00:06:06.190> to<00:06:06.310> activate

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
down on the field for me to activate

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.520 
down on the field for me to activate
district<00:06:07.030> X<00:06:07.240> I<00:06:07.450> must<00:06:07.750> be<00:06:07.840> able<00:06:07.930> to<00:06:08.020> see<00:06:08.200> one

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
district X I must be able to see one

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.820 
district X I must be able to see one

resource district X cost as a song

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.790 
resource district X cost as a song
resource<00:06:12.570> so<00:06:13.570> I<00:06:13.810> can<00:06:13.990> see<00:06:14.170> that<00:06:14.200> one<00:06:14.440> resource

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
resource so I can see that one resource

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.420 
resource so I can see that one resource
I<00:06:15.040> can<00:06:15.370> activate<00:06:15.610> its<00:06:15.820> effect

resources before I can activate a messy
one<00:06:36.650> I<00:06:36.830> see<00:06:37.100> two<00:06:37.280> I<00:06:37.520> can<00:06:38.270> activate<00:06:38.509> both

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.250 
locations or that many resources so you

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.590 
locations or that many resources so you
don't<00:06:43.400> have<00:06:43.460> to<00:06:43.669> actually<00:06:43.940> use<00:06:44.120> a<00:06:44.150> researcher

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600 
don't have to actually use a researcher

you<00:06:44.780> just<00:06:45.080> have<00:06:45.199> to<00:06:45.289> see<00:06:45.500> that<00:06:45.650> make<00:06:45.860> it

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:46.009
