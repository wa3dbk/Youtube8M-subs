00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.199
 well, dance 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:18.420
 what's up kids today we finally went 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.520
 I came back after so long to forgive 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.070
 the wait all this time but it is that 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.630
 I 'm a little bit messed up lately 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:31.890
 in a few projects in the in my 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.690
 life and still good then to see it like that 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.750
 make a summary for me I need a 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.270
 mid- career job to see 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.850
 if I get a job and good 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.560
 before continuing match against 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.180
 sporting de gijón first match as already 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.250
 you know, they have already scored a goal for me 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.890
 9 minute to open your mouth 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.989
 -parties regularcillo and I told you that 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.510
 this team, well, we can not 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.700
 do much nothing but good here 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.790
 you have a chance of mine, precisely because 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.010
 that is, I was dedicating myself to center 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.530
 balls and I was already realizing in 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.600
 this moment that I get in the middle 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.630
 and I'm the one who pulls and the one who does the 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.690
 plays or this or not does not go well as 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.610
 you can see then good few plays to 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.760
 highlight here you do not have rest 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.740
 of the first part of this match and 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.899
 good as it was saying that if you see 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.270
 which is that I do not upload many matches and such 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.850
 I know what man gives you illusion too 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.009
 that comes up from nba and there is no way here 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.930
 you have another chance that I 'm alone 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.960
 but look good because little is going 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.640
 outside haha waiting for nothing I know that 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.250
 you are looking forward to seeing my videos that 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.610
 Many of you ask me to climb up 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.250
 fifa but that understand that if I do not upload it 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.470
 because rather I can not give 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.810
 lately read addy that I would like 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.789
 to upload more videos and well then here 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.890
 You see the first match this first 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.220
 we will lose it 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.110
 no, that's not a very good team 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.630
 we can not ask for much second either 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.930
 match against the palmas the team of 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.560
 valerón I remember you good valerón that no 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.270
 You know what it is that you have valero is not it 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.420
 one of the best midfielders that 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.450
 has been in Spain was playing between 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.280
 other teams in the athletics with draletti 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.840
 it descended then it happened to other equipment 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.170
 I do not know if it went directly to the depor and 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.390
 there he was already almost the rest of his 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.239
 career does not remember right now very well 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.250
 but well there you see that we have marked a 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.470
 nice it seems that this time yes that 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.550
 we can do something important and good 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.930
 as if he's talking a little bit about 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.380
 valerón then that 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.260
 to see that he does not know him not this year 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.239
 good wanted to retire wanted to leave the 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.360
 Depor wanted to rest and good came 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:49.450
 an offer from your city team the 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.190
 team where he started from the palms and 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.410
 He said well then I join the project 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.660
 and see what comes out not 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.819
 and the truth is that he carries the ball and 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.280
 they set is that 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.260
 elaborate plays or valerón the one that 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.689
 has seen play at valerón knows almost a 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.719
 crack and well there you see that we are tied 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:10.150
 in minute 47 nothing else start do not know by 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:12.939
 what happens a lot that to the principles of 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.629
 of matches or finals before the 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:18.219
 breaks before the end of the game 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.500
 principle of party principle 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:23.019
 rest is usually when the 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.000
 goals I do not know very well why and here you see 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.249
 how good they put us in a bind there 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.379
 you have a valero as saying principal 

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:32.680
 weapon of this team because it is the 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:35.109
 hook with everyone and well then there 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.409
 Look how we scored that goal in 81 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:41.139
 as I told you it 's almost reaching the end and 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:42.699
 nothing then another party that we lost a 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.709
 bad streak that we go through but 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:47.349
 you have to be aware that the team 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.849
 does not throw beyond third game against 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.000
 the mirandés hopefully in this one 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:54.400
 let's have more luck and nothing and little 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.739
 more is that this team can not either 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.629
 throw a lot the most media has and 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.610
 I think it's dani grandson the extreme 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.710
 left and they are 70 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.270
 of valuation that is very little then 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.650
 Well, we have to throw a little 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.810
 the means try to do it in our 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.110
 so we are able to pull 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.430
 us and good that we stir such 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.359
 to see who dares to throw good is 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.730
 he gets a ball out and nothing, because that's too much 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.250
 difficult and you have that is the most average 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.110
 have I do not know if by now I'll have 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.180
 me more or not but see what goal of 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.540
 head in gesture to the pass of dani grandson 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.300
 now saying the best of the team and that 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.210
 the head shot attention looks at the 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.180
 good celebration a disastrous poquillo 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.710
 not that it's over and there you have to stay 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.310
 up on the stick and all that shot of 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.110
 impressive head 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.550
 the two best of the team both in 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.510
 attack and well then there that we arrived at the 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.629
 break 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.250
 nothing 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:53.849
 to fix there that occasion that they have for 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.879
 they 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:58.680
 to put moneta then look how good 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:01.050
 What we have done well not this time 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.729
 these three games that we have gone well 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.970
 the truth is that they have been split 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:08.400
 disastrous the very slow team pulls us out 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.610
 a play in conditions is worked 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.650
 a lot in defense they tend to bundle 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.110
 there is the one that jumps and when it should not 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.360
 have jumped and well then yes that we 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.280
 they put in many straits and in many 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.110
 problems that remain for us because we 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.490
 get in there and notice there I tried to unmark 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.340
 but nothing so that they give us a 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.930
 pass or anything and there's going to be a 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.880
 little bit if we want to do something not to 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.340
 final in definite that you want or not it is 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.020
 that force you to seize the ball to 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.569
 that you make all the plays set here 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.979
 to give the pass I want it to look like 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:40.080
 that I will arrive today to see if I throw and 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:42.300
 looked at the stick can not be returns the 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.810
 damned stick 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:48.599
 ay is that not what you know of the 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.690
 ultimate team what happened to me about the 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:54.690
 sticks with me is something I can not help it 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:57.990
 I am when I saw that in the boat 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:00.210
 I can not help it , the clubs are 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.120
 my fault last game that I'm going to 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.229
 teach however to notice even though it is not 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.259
 a team that we can do a lot 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:09.360
 we are there sixth are not either very 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:11.370
 bad we will not be able to ascend 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.979
 we should not be able to ascend because I think 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.539
 that you can not but I think that if 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:16.560
 we get to qualify if we 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:18.270
 we get 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.360
 we could get to first I do not know if 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.360
 I will endure 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.500
 I do not know, I think I'm going to ask for the 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.860
 I do not know how you see it like that 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.880
 see how the incredible ball is going 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.910
 As you see, we ask for a 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.070
 transfer an assignment we ask for 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:38.330
 another team on a team where 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:41.200
 let's have more joys where we have more 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.670
 goal opportunities I do not know that I leave it to 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:47.030
 fixed selection the pass is there and in 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:49.430
 Instead of pulling it gives me a pass to him there 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.620
 gave the goalkeeper practically and with this 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.600
 Well, little more than finishing the 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.360
 rest is already ending the game already 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:59.540
 there are very few moves well I leave you 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.970
 there the doubt I leave it there I leave you there 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.500
 choose you if you want that now in 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.330
 the winter market should go in 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.700
 another team to improve to follow 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.580
 progressing and while we were going to have 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.920
 a play and that penalty there that you could 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.330
 to have called referee and you have eaten 

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:17.180
 well nothing nothing happens there we see that it 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:19.400
 notices javi thorny is that 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.440
 we got the goal we finally won 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.080
 party finally had to be the last 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.210
 after four games we break the 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.979
 run of defeats 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:30.199
 nothing because here the game will end 

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:32.509
 as a short video is saying 

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:34.639
 time to the next good a little bit of the 

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:36.560
 idea that I was already saying goodbye and 

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:40.210
 nothing I hope you liked and we 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.210
 we see the next see you later
