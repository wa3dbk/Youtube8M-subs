00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.919 

here<00:00:00.989> is<00:00:01.260> a<00:00:01.439> base<00:00:01.890> 10<00:00:02.429> counter<00:00:03.090> and<00:00:03.330> mine<00:00:03.600> craft

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
here is a base 10 counter and mine craft

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.849 
here is a base 10 counter and mine craft
and<00:00:04.920> i<00:00:05.040> believe<00:00:05.069> this<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:06.109> first<00:00:07.109> base<00:00:07.470> 10

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
and i believe this is a first base 10

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.180 
and i believe this is a first base 10
counter<00:00:08.730> ever<00:00:09.090> created<00:00:09.690> using<00:00:10.139> pure<00:00:10.710> red

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
counter ever created using pure red

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.530 
counter ever created using pure red
stone<00:00:11.960> for<00:00:12.960> another<00:00:13.230> project<00:00:13.590> i<00:00:14.040> did<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.759> mob

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
stone for another project i did the mob

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.340 
stone for another project i did the mob
counter<00:00:16.080> i<00:00:16.320> also<00:00:16.680> made<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.160> base<00:00:17.670> 10<00:00:18.650> counter<00:00:19.650> um

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
counter i also made a base 10 counter um

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.910 
counter i also made a base 10 counter um
but<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.500> use<00:00:22.769> mine<00:00:23.250> carts<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.920> wasn't

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
but that use mine carts and it wasn't

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.589 
but that use mine carts and it wasn't
all<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.400> reliable<00:00:27.890> but<00:00:28.890> here<00:00:29.310> let<00:00:30.029> me<00:00:30.179> reset

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
all that reliable but here let me reset

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:39.650 
all that reliable but here let me reset
this<00:00:32.660> I<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:35.630> base<00:00:36.630> tan<00:00:36.960> counter<00:00:37.969> which<00:00:38.969> is

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
this I have a base tan counter which is

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:47.029 
this I have a base tan counter which is
much<00:00:40.290> more<00:00:40.760> compact<00:00:41.760> then<00:00:42.829> um<00:00:44.000> a<00:00:46.039> binary

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
much more compact then um a binary

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.130 
much more compact then um a binary
counter<00:00:47.309> where<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.940> have<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.300> have<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> binary

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
counter where you have to have a binary

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.200 
counter where you have to have a binary

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
possible button increases the number by

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:08.390 
possible button increases the number by
one<00:01:03.350> that's<00:01:04.350> mostly<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:04.979> what's<00:01:06.890> this<00:01:07.890> aside

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
one that's mostly it what's this aside

view of the thing um yeah this device
uses<00:01:14.159> shift<00:01:15.470> registers<00:01:16.700> that's<00:01:17.700> 10<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.330> them

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
uses shift registers that's 10 of them

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.469 
uses shift registers that's 10 of them
this<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.310> one<00:01:20.520> shift<00:01:20.790> register<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.810> shifts

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
this is one shift register and shifts

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.090 
this is one shift register and shifts

not<00:01:33.329> plug<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.750> fall<00:01:34.040> this<00:01:35.040> was<00:01:35.220> inspired<00:01:35.430> by

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
not plug this fall this was inspired by

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.700 
not plug this fall this was inspired by
71<00:01:37.770> gaming<00:01:39.500> yeah<00:01:41.000> um<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:43.200> there's<00:01:43.409> ton<00:01:43.680> of

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
71 gaming yeah um so there's ton of

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.179 
71 gaming yeah um so there's ton of
these<00:01:43.950> I'm<00:01:44.310> labeled<00:01:44.880> them<00:01:45.200> according<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.229> what

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
these I'm labeled them according to what

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.120 
these I'm labeled them according to what
number<00:01:47.369> they<00:01:47.700> represent<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.590> but<00:01:52.590> then

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
number they represent and so on but then

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.990 
number they represent and so on but then
goes<00:01:53.430> up<00:01:53.460> here<00:01:55.310> through<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.399> vertical

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
goes up here through a vertical

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.609 
goes up here through a vertical
transmission<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:58.670> into<00:01:59.670> this<00:02:00.350> thing<00:02:01.350> I

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
transmission and into this thing I

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.780 
transmission and into this thing I
actually<00:02:02.549> created<00:02:03.420> just<00:02:03.840> today<00:02:04.579> which<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.610> a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
actually created just today which is a

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.440 
actually created just today which is a
more<00:02:06.030> compact<00:02:06.630> design<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:08.239> a<00:02:09.239> seven<00:02:10.200> segment

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
more compact design of a seven segment

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.280 
more compact design of a seven segment
display<00:02:12.870> decoder<00:02:16.190> so<00:02:17.190> this<00:02:17.400> one<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.849> only<00:02:18.390> 10

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
display decoder so this one is only 10

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.990 
display decoder so this one is only 10
white<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.980> believe<00:02:22.160> no<00:02:23.160> this<00:02:23.519> one<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:23.730> actually

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
white I believe no this one is actually

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.640 
white I believe no this one is actually
9<00:02:24.420> wide<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.440> actual<00:02:25.769> decoder<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:27.650> then

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
9 wide the actual decoder and then

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:36.530 
9 wide the actual decoder and then
normal<00:02:29.099> decoder<00:02:29.519> you<00:02:29.760> have<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.269> as<00:02:32.120> 14<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:35.540> that

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
normal decoder you have a as 14 and that

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.930 
normal decoder you have a as 14 and that
actually<00:02:37.170> limits<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.620> width<00:02:37.800> of<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.310> screen

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
actually limits the width of the screen

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.160 
actually limits the width of the screen
so<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.599> screen<00:02:39.870> is<00:02:40.019> 11<00:02:40.709> wide<00:02:41.780> whereas<00:02:42.780> another

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
so the screen is 11 wide whereas another

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.059 
so the screen is 11 wide whereas another
screen<00:02:43.860> would<00:02:44.069> be<00:02:44.390> at<00:02:45.390> least<00:02:45.690> 14<00:02:46.380> because<00:02:46.830> of

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
screen would be at least 14 because of

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.940 
screen would be at least 14 because of
stuff<00:02:47.310> behind<00:02:47.660> is<00:02:49.280> 14<00:02:50.280> wide<00:02:51.260> this<00:02:52.260> enables<00:02:52.769> me

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
stuff behind is 14 wide this enables me

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.830 
stuff behind is 14 wide this enables me
to<00:02:52.980> put<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.819> screen<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.299> bit<00:02:54.480> closer

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
to put the screen is a bit closer

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.280 
to put the screen is a bit closer
together<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.769> it<00:02:56.250> becomes<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.510> bit<00:02:58.110> more

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
together and it becomes a bit more

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.160 
together and it becomes a bit more

thing<00:03:56.069> here<00:03:57.440> there's<00:03:58.440> only<00:03:58.620> one<00:03:58.769> problem<00:03:59.130> with

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
thing here there's only one problem with

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.849 
thing here there's only one problem with
it<00:03:59.700> really<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.239> that's<00:04:00.389> the<00:04:01.019> response<00:04:01.139> time

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
it really and that's the response time

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:06.319 
it really and that's the response time
because<00:04:02.639> I<00:04:02.849> have<00:04:03.630> to<00:04:03.959> use<00:04:04.139> these<00:04:04.470> delays<00:04:05.329> where

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
because I have to use these delays where

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:15.460 
because I have to use these delays where
else<00:04:06.480> um<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:08.400> signals<00:04:08.880> get<00:04:09.269> all<00:04:12.410> jumbled<00:04:13.410> up

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
else um the signals get all jumbled up

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.590 
else um the signals get all jumbled up

so I press on them there's a bit of a

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.460
