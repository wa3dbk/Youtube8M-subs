00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:06.180
 cutout friends of today I'm with 

00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:06.180
 let's go mountain biking 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.660
 very good and happy to have someone 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:17.650
 at home thank you very much for the 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:20.230
 invitation to see us if we tell 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.680
 this taste then I told you next that 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.270
 I was born the taste for this sport for 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.970
 my wife's cousins ​​that they 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.649
 already practice a little more in shape and 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.579
 well they invited you to do something 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:36.340
 calm and we for the risk not 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:39.519
 we can be as they practice it and 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.640
 I liked the bike I liked pedaling 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:45.820
 liked the coexistence that is done and more 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.359
 that nothing is a sport where the 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.210
 unless it relaxes me because because good 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:55.749
 it is the bike and you are the environment is the 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.329
 environment I normally use it as 

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:00.879
 to do more regenerative as to 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.739
 distract me to spread me and the truth 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.050
 that helped me a lot helped me a lot 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.000
 also of the physical because it is like a 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.740
 degenerative sport 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.570
 it's as if they were slogans and you study 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.470
 static analysis or with a treadmill 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.620
 but 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.690
 the environment so against the taste 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.260
 because the truth does not help to distract me and 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.720
 and to feel liberated also from the 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.390
 things sometimes that things are not so 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.100
 well even if they are well it is a very 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.580
 neighborhood that you enjoy only the 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.580
 visit 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.520
 I usually practice it from places 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.530
 planes is by their planes for the same of 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.110
 my profession and that 's what helps me 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.560
 be like regenerative work in 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.260
 very parent environments either dirt 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.960
 but with costs and plans like 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.700
 I mentioned that good what types of 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.040
 with accessories required to exercise 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.600
 and today I'm with a plan I do not know while 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.980
 staff you can truly tell what 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.980
 traditional is another that bring more 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.270
 accessories but I have the basics 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.340
 first use the helmet as some 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.619
 fall you will not see strong to the 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.520
 head that with the many risk in the 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.590
 falls from that the helmet we have to see the 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.320
 lenses that are like to protect you from 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.740
 dust that before you get a 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:19.160
 because it's like an interior and a 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.870
 more long-sleeved the league that is with a 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.030
 special cotton here in medium to 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.120
 that the seat notice how much and that 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.770
 consume a little bit and you have more meshes 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.260
 long can be with pure lycra 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.750
 You can use some short tights I use it 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.550
 they put long mayos when they too 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.540
 to your annually I very very protected 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.579
 they are elbow 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.609
 and good the gloves that have a gel 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:42.439
 special so that therefore I handle and for 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:45.650
 so much jump does not hurt you too 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:48.560
 apart from the wrists of the quills 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.049
 of the fingers and good shoes and tastes 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.109
 are the special shoes that 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.989
 pedals of the visit more staples all 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.430
 is your mind is the pedal of the shoe where 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.470
 the pedal 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.569
 Well, they show a warning and we're going to 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.710
 practice a little and we give a class 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.170
 appointment 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.820
 good our bicycle is semi 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.430
 professional as I mentioned it what 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.610
 I practice at the amateur level but it's a 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.280
 very attractive bicycle has a scissor 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.470
 that can be blocked for example when 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.050
 you go in your life you do things 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.760
 also in the hands then the scissors 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.250
 which has shock absorber is not blocked 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.490
 more lifting the bike and is more tired 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.240
 then he has a way to block himself 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:39.150
 so that the scissors do not make the movement 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:41.640
 of cushioning these decreases in 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.100
 This is a medium size 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.350
 sizes also part of medium girl and 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.760

 a medium size that is the same 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.170
