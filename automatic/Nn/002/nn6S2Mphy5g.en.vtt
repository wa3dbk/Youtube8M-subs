00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.319 
and pat dry does help if your face is a
little<00:01:55.140> bit<00:01:55.380> wet<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.829> then<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:57.149> add<00:01:57.299> a

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
little bit wet and then just add a

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.260 
little bit wet and then just add a
hairband<00:01:57.810> because<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.680> little<00:01:59.610> honey<00:01:59.850> scrub

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
hairband because the little honey scrub

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.030 
hairband because the little honey scrub
it<00:02:00.479> will<00:02:00.689> get<00:02:00.869> on<00:02:01.049> your<00:02:01.079> hair<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:01.770> really

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
it will get on your hair and it's really

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.380 
it will get on your hair and it's really
gross<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.460> just<00:02:02.640> make<00:02:02.880> sure<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.180> wear<00:02:03.329> a

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
gross so just make sure you wear a

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.080 
gross so just make sure you wear a
headband<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.950> then<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.520> just

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
headband and then I just
