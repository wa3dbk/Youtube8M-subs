I'm not forgot the little drop of

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:20.860 
I'm not forgot the little drop of
superglue

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.690 

this<00:01:21.470> one<00:01:21.710> I'm<00:01:21.860> not<00:01:21.920> going<00:01:22.190> to<00:01:22.280> fold<00:01:22.460> over

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
this one I'm not going to fold over

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.390 
this one I'm not going to fold over
because<00:01:23.090> I'm<00:01:23.240> getting<00:01:23.390> these<00:01:23.540> eyes<00:01:23.780> in<00:01:24.080> here

because I'm getting these eyes in here
and<00:01:25.400> this<00:01:25.580> is<00:01:25.730> gonna<00:01:25.910> come<00:01:26.150> back<00:01:26.330> over<00:01:26.630> kind<00:01:27.470> of

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
and this is gonna come back over kind of

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.060 
and this is gonna come back over kind of
like<00:01:27.680> a<00:01:27.800> thunder<00:01:28.220> creek<00:01:28.460> series<00:01:28.910> with<00:01:29.090> eyes

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
like a thunder creek series with eyes

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.930 
like a thunder creek series with eyes
normally<00:01:31.070> they<00:01:31.190> tell<00:01:31.400> you<00:01:31.490> to<00:01:31.550> figure<00:01:31.850> a

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
normally they tell you to figure a

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.640 
normally they tell you to figure a
termite<00:01:32.240> take<00:01:32.450> three<00:01:32.810> right<00:01:33.020> there<00:01:33.050> put<00:01:33.470> one

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
termite take three right there put one

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.850 
termite take three right there put one
in<00:01:33.830> front<00:01:34.100> or<00:01:34.850> two<00:01:35.120> that<00:01:35.570> way<00:01:35.750> it<00:01:35.900> doesn't<00:01:36.110> spin

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.410 

let's<00:01:39.860> see<00:01:39.980> that's<00:01:40.160> at<00:01:40.340> a<00:01:40.370> little<00:01:40.640> angle<00:01:40.790> I'll

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
let's see that's at a little angle I'll

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.890 
let's see that's at a little angle I'll
move<00:01:41.660> it<00:01:41.780> over<00:01:41.870> this<00:01:42.080> way<00:01:42.140> one<00:01:42.620> two<00:01:42.920> three<00:01:43.280> four

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
move it over this way one two three four

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.490 
move it over this way one two three four
get<00:01:44.900> it<00:01:44.990> back

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
get it back

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.840 
get it back
same<00:01:45.860> with<00:01:46.040> Beach<00:01:46.250> a<00:01:46.520> nice<00:01:47.230> barbells<00:01:48.230> for<00:01:48.850> two

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
same with Beach a nice barbells for two

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.800 
same with Beach a nice barbells for two
in<00:01:50.000> front<00:01:50.770> two<00:01:51.770> and<00:01:51.920> back<00:01:52.330> that<00:01:53.330> keeps<00:01:53.630> it<00:01:53.780> from

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
in front two and back that keeps it from

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:54.310 
in front two and back that keeps it from
moving

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
moving

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.610 
moving
she'll<00:01:54.710> never<00:01:54.920> move<00:01:55.250> on<00:01:55.460> yeah<00:01:56.080> of<00:01:57.080> course<00:01:57.350> once

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
she'll never move on yeah of course once

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.380 
she'll never move on yeah of course once
the<00:01:57.740> superglue<00:01:58.190> breaks<00:01:58.550> loose<00:01:58.820> after<00:01:59.210> about<00:01:59.330> a

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
the superglue breaks loose after about a

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.410 
the superglue breaks loose after about a
half<00:01:59.630> dozen<00:01:59.930> good<00:02:00.290> fish<00:02:01.240> because<00:02:02.240> it's<00:02:02.390> a

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
half dozen good fish because it's a

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.120 
half dozen good fish because it's a
slick<00:02:02.690> coating<00:02:02.900> they<00:02:03.170> have<00:02:03.380> on<00:02:03.590> there<00:02:03.860> well

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
slick coating they have on there well

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.090 
slick coating they have on there well
then<00:02:05.030> you<00:02:05.330> just<00:02:05.510> whip<00:02:05.690> finish<00:02:06.050> it

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.200 

you<00:02:09.700> could<00:02:11.280> whip<00:02:12.280> finish<00:02:12.670> it<00:02:12.820> I'll<00:02:12.940> put<00:02:13.120> it

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
you could whip finish it I'll put it

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.050 
you could whip finish it I'll put it
that<00:02:13.360> way<00:02:14.310> if<00:02:15.310> you<00:02:15.520> wanted<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:17.260> could<00:02:18.060> put

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
that way if you wanted to you could put

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.260 
that way if you wanted to you could put
some<00:02:19.240> hot<00:02:19.360> milk<00:02:19.570> move<00:02:19.870> out<00:02:20.110> there

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
some hot milk move out there

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.860 
some hot milk move out there
twist<00:02:22.270> this<00:02:22.480> up<00:02:22.770> pull<00:02:23.770> it<00:02:23.920> through<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.870> then

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
twist this up pull it through and then

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.490 
twist this up pull it through and then
get<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:27.060> stuck<00:02:28.060> in<00:02:28.390> there<00:02:28.870> hold<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:29.290> for<00:02:29.440> a

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
get that stuck in there hold it for a

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.340 
get that stuck in there hold it for a
second<00:02:30.360> but<00:02:33.450> this<00:02:34.450> one<00:02:34.690> here<00:02:34.900> we're<00:02:35.050> gonna<00:02:35.170> use

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
second but this one here we're gonna use

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.050 
second but this one here we're gonna use
hits<00:02:35.560> men<00:02:35.860> on<00:02:36.040> them<00:02:36.250> we're<00:02:36.340> gonna<00:02:36.400> use<00:02:36.700> regular

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
hits men on them we're gonna use regular

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.500 
hits men on them we're gonna use regular
tying<00:02:37.300> method<00:02:37.750> we'll<00:02:38.530> just<00:02:38.770> twist<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.160> over

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
tying method we'll just twist it over

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:49.680 
tying method we'll just twist it over
pull<00:02:40.510> this<00:02:40.690> up<00:02:43.440> two<00:02:45.570> three<00:02:46.570> four<00:02:47.200> five<00:02:48.690> it's
