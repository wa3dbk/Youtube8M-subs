00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
and then when they were so I changed him

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.280 
and then when they were so I changed him
well<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.150> like<00:01:15.360> set<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.900> that's<00:01:16.170> why

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
well you can like set that that's why

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.620 
well you can like set that that's why
the<00:01:16.350> controls<00:01:16.860> option<00:01:17.310> exists<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.180> thought<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
the controls option exists I thought the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.899 
the controls option exists I thought the
controls<00:01:19.140> were<00:01:19.470> not<00:01:19.500> terrible<00:01:20.400> actually<00:01:20.700> I

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
controls were not terrible actually I

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.399 
controls were not terrible actually I
thought<00:01:21.060> they<00:01:21.210> were<00:01:21.270> pretty<00:01:21.479> okay<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.049> start

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
thought they were pretty okay to start

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.810 
thought they were pretty okay to start
but<00:01:22.650> if<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.860> don't<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.189> them<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.580> couldn't

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
but if you don't like them you couldn't

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.310 
but if you don't like them you couldn't
change<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.330> controls<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.840> course

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
was cool the stages they range from

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.640

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
where the backgrounds were just going

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.050

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
in different places can go on and that's

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.050 
in different places can go on and that's
kind<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:25.650> what<00:03:25.799> a<00:03:25.829> player<00:03:26.159> smash<00:03:26.459> is<00:03:26.669> tiny

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
you think of it it was pretty fun

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.960 
you think of it it was pretty fun
chaotic<00:03:46.109> but<00:03:46.319> fun<00:03:46.590> this<00:03:46.979> is<00:03:47.220> just<00:03:47.609> kind<00:03:47.790> of<00:03:47.849> a

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
chaotic but fun this is just kind of a

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.030 
chaotic but fun this is just kind of a
side<00:03:48.209> attraction<00:03:48.870> umm<00:03:49.290> I<00:03:49.590> thought<00:03:49.769> it<00:03:49.919> was

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
side attraction umm I thought it was

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.740 
side attraction umm I thought it was
interesting<00:03:50.310> basically<00:03:51.180> you're<00:03:51.329> on<00:03:51.359> a<00:03:51.479> board

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
interesting basically you're on a board

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.659 
interesting basically you're on a board
and<00:03:51.989> you<00:03:52.139> all<00:03:52.319> just<00:03:52.349> kind<00:03:52.979> of<00:03:53.040> move<00:03:53.250> all<00:03:53.489> at<00:03:53.579> the

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
and you all just kind of move all at the

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:55.909 
and you all just kind of move all at the
same<00:03:53.819> time<00:03:53.879> and<00:03:54.449> use<00:03:54.659> items<00:03:55.139> and<00:03:55.590> when<00:03:55.739> you

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
same time and use items and when you

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.069 
same time and use items and when you
cross<00:03:56.159> paths<00:03:56.579> you<00:03:56.970> fight<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:57.780> other

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
cross paths you fight and other

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.530 
cross paths you fight and other
conditions<00:03:58.519> kind<00:03:59.519> of<00:03:59.579> like<00:03:59.729> this<00:03:59.909> whole<00:04:00.150> idea

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
conditions kind of like this whole idea

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.420 
conditions kind of like this whole idea
they<00:04:00.840> did<00:04:01.019> with<00:04:01.199> creating<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.739> board<00:04:02.009> game<00:04:02.250> with

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
they did with creating a board game with

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.610 
they did with creating a board game with
fighting<00:04:02.819> it<00:04:03.060> was<00:04:03.180> clever<00:04:03.419> so<00:04:03.870> if<00:04:04.290> you<00:04:04.439> didn't

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
fighting it was clever so if you didn't

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.110 
fighting it was clever so if you didn't
like<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.919> stages<00:04:05.370> that<00:04:05.549> they<00:04:05.819> had<00:04:06.000> available

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
like the stages that they had available

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.059 
like the stages that they had available
you<00:04:06.629> could<00:04:06.780> create<00:04:07.049> your<00:04:07.109> own<00:04:07.259> what<00:04:07.799> you<00:04:07.919> think

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
you could create your own what you think

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.189 
you could create your own what you think
about<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.340> stage<00:04:08.609> builder<00:04:09.030> it<00:04:09.329> was<00:04:09.569> good<00:04:09.870> with

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
about the stage builder it was good with

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:12.110 
about the stage builder it was good with
flaws<00:04:10.500> if<00:04:11.069> you<00:04:11.400> knew<00:04:11.579> how<00:04:11.699> to<00:04:11.759> use<00:04:11.970> the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
flaws if you knew how to use the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.969 
flaws if you knew how to use the
mechanics<00:04:12.599> it<00:04:12.780> would<00:04:12.900> work<00:04:13.079> perfectly<00:04:13.139> the

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:13.979 
mechanics it would work perfectly the

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.490 
mechanics it would work perfectly the
one<00:04:14.280> problem<00:04:14.699> I<00:04:14.790> have<00:04:15.000> is<00:04:15.359> that<00:04:15.569> you<00:04:16.229> can't

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
one problem I have is that you can't

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.219 
one problem I have is that you can't
really<00:04:16.739> undo<00:04:17.400> any<00:04:17.729> changes<00:04:17.849> yeah<00:04:18.810> there's<00:04:19.109> an

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
really undo any changes yeah there's an

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.589 
really undo any changes yeah there's an
undo<00:04:19.650> button<00:04:19.949> but<00:04:20.519> if<00:04:20.849> you're<00:04:21.120> trying<00:04:21.299> to<00:04:21.419> make

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
undo button but if you're trying to make

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.899 
undo button but if you're trying to make
this<00:04:21.750> huge<00:04:22.349> platform<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:23.279> battle<00:04:23.580> on<00:04:23.700> and<00:04:23.849> you

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:23.909 
this huge platform to battle on and you

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:24.159 
this huge platform to battle on and you
may

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
may

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.929 
may
one<00:04:24.349> little<00:04:24.680> mistake<00:04:24.770> instead<00:04:25.550> of<00:04:25.639> being<00:04:25.819> able

00:04:25.929 --> 00:04:25.939 
one little mistake instead of being able

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:27.730 
one little mistake instead of being able
to<00:04:26.090> undo<00:04:26.449> that<00:04:26.599> one<00:04:26.870> little<00:04:27.169> line<00:04:27.319> side<00:04:27.590> when

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
to undo that one little line side when

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.760 
to undo that one little line side when
you<00:04:27.860> man<00:04:28.039> you<00:04:28.460> have<00:04:28.610> to<00:04:28.639> undo<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.270> entire

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
you man you have to undo the entire

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.959 
you man you have to undo the entire
platform<00:04:30.770> yeah<00:04:31.159> that<00:04:31.400> didn't<00:04:31.639> make<00:04:31.729> much

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:31.969 
platform yeah that didn't make much

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:34.390 
platform yeah that didn't make much
