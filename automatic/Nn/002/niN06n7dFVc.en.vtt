 goals to 2 in the madrigal in the match 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.450
 of the 24th day of the bbv league before 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.580
 of the start of the game the players 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.210
 del villarreal came out with some 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.699
 t-shirts good to thank 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.070
 Francisco Javier Farinós his work 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.020
 made in recent seasons as 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.699
 professional a farinós that this same 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.060
 week had announced that that 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:33.579
 he abandoned the practice of football 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.449
 in the game better 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.769
 the villarreal that the Celtic though went to 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.000
 final in the team of Luis Enrique 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:41.890
 who took the reward of the 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.320
 victory we have seen that first 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.469
 opportunity of giovanni two saints more 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.659
 of the Villarreal in that fall of Giovanni 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:53.409
 inside the area that the referee 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:55.890
 Fernández Borbalán considered that it was not 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:55.890
 penalty 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.720
 few opportunities and few arrivals from 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.159
 Celtic 'along throughout the 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.990
 meeting 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.090
 the team of Lucia enriched that arrived 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.090
 the madrigal after one after a good 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.710
 dynamic quick exit from the villarreal 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.829
 good and now and jérémy shot 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.829
 perbet 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.270
 in the cut and shot of the player 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:31.500
 French that did not find the goal of 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.500
 the yoel goal 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.400
 these are images already of the second 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.400
 half 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.270
 got the celta right with that 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.270
 opportunity of sant and mine 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.570
 the 18-year-old kid who was the 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.860
 offensive reference of the team of Luis 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.860
 enrique in his zurdazo 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.829
 and more of the Celtic ' in this occasion of 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.829
 new from the long distance 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.200
 I was trying for the august Celtic 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.160
 fernandez taking advantage of that error of 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.810
 bruno soriano 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.270
 despite those two arrivals 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.990
 consecutive and will continue to arrive and 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.840
 generating opportunities the villarreal 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.370
 canceled and not canceled as you will see that the 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.340
 repetition 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.650
 out of play nine pervez is who 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.440
 ends the action but so that 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.659
 as you can see it takes advantage of being 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.230
 reject when at the time of shooting 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:35.780
 he was in offside 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.710
 and more from villarrealense hand in hand 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.260
 between body gómez and me he 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.470
 the villarreal will arrive he did it with 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.880
 much more danger than the Celtic but it was 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.700
 unable to materialize their 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.910
 lost ball chances in the 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.490
 Celtic ' ball out and shot 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.260
 making thorn very close 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.530
 of the left post of the goal of 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.530
 I the 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.560
 there well 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.219
 the shooting of the midfielder 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.219
 yellow team 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.730
 some arrival of the Celtic that arrived little 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.190
 but when he did he did it with 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.500
 danger left from sant and mine and the 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.780
 álex lópez shot that was very 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.780
 little bit about the game rectangle 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.330
 and well the shot of number 8 Celtic 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.150
 opportunities for the villarreal that 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.570
 He was looking hard for the opposite goal 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.380
 to jérémy perbet could not in this 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.380
 occasion with joel 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.590
 he claimed a possible offside game 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.000
 say allows me even though he settled the 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.500
 collegiate and in this ball action 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.060
 stopped 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.930
 and the first goal of the 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.280
 meeting center of álex lópez and auction 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:05.830
 absolutely free brand backs 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.830
 to the goal of orellana for 0 to 1 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.159
 error of marking the defense of 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.409
 villarreal and the testarazo de orellana 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.220
 that went inside the goal of 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:19.000
 Juan Carlos 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.000
 bailén 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.370
 and it gives 1 to 0 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.080
 the goal that put the Celtic ahead and 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.320
 in the final stretch of the meeting 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.570
 produced I put this fact absolutely 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:37.180
 unfortunate an amateur to call it from 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.180
 some way thrown from the stands 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.680
 a new canister of tear gas and 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.169
 had to suspend the game and also 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.470
 the fans had to leave the stadium 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.470
 from the madrigal 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.000
 after a while 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.939
 once the stadium has been evacuated 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.330
 because it was possible to dispute the 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.260
 last minutes of the last minutes 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:11.139
 of the party and in those last minutes 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:14.550
 I was going to get 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.550
 and the second goal the Celtic 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.830
 since launch of nolito foul 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.230
 transformed the final 0 to 2 and 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.960
 gave the victory very important for the 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:27.000
 Celtic a Celtic that adds 29 points and that 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.810
 is 8 above the descent zone 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.020
 the Villarreal keeps the 40 that 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:37.440
 right now he has a very nice goal 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.850
 marked nolito for the celta oscillating is the 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.900
 lack throw at the end in the 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:46.900
 madrigal triumph of the center of vigo 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.900
 villarreal 0 celta de vigo 2
