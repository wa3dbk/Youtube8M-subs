00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.400
 we now see one here on the floor 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:16.430
 representative of the new series 5 mini excavators 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:19.039
 the zx 55 o'clock stroked 56 55 we feel 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.920
 everything on as we break pipe now 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.730
 Fuses on the jib and on the handle 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.589
 cylinder fitted as standard 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.840
 Here also a multi clutch system 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:33.860
 this is the reason why the attachment is changed 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.200
 again for the customer drastically 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:41.150
 Relieved the machine has continued 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.740
 a very robust swivel buck we 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.280
 have a nix-shaped under venture here 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:49.370
 installed as the entire machine very 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.450
 robust and very in the life after 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.870
 have brought up at the machine 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:00.830
 The pads chains have the pads chains 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:04.040
 the decisive advantage that the 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.799
 life is extended again I 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.630
 can now instead of an entire rubber 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.600
 chain in case of wear 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.460
 just having to exchange a single one 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.980
 or two members of these patch chains 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.030
 change and come here on one 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.370
 drastic lowering of my body of life 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.810
 costs 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.640
 in the cabin was also a lot 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.159
 changed in the end with five mini excavators 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.010
 which allow proportional joysticks 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.270
 a very gentle one very sensitive 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.950
 operate all hydraulic attachments 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.180
 making it even easier for the operator 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.420
 make even the most complicated devices 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.420
 to be able to serve 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:50.050
 Another highlight is a minibar 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.400
 it's very easy to maintain 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:56.970
 The accesses to the were even easier 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:01.120
 Maintenance and inspection costs 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:03.430
 attached we have here now one 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.330
 very nice division between the 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.460
 cool package that we now side by side 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:13.480
 have arranged to air even more 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:17.340
 to bring to the radiator and the engine 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.590
 By encapsulating the cooler package 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.560
 an improved heat balance is sufficient 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.640
 we use up the fuel consumption 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.980
 21 percent for the mini-excavators 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.170
 can reduce 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:36.840
 the coolers are now next to each other 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:39.160
 characterized arranged more air is previously 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.120
 provides cleaning of coolers 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.920
 is easier and I can optional one 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.700
 Dust cover net in front of the radiator 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.070
 install 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.980
 just put in a very dusty one 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.620
 sensible thing 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.170
 the machines are still short tail 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.549
 construction method short construction means 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.250
 I have a very small tail 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.420
 swing radius around even on the fears 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.049
 construction sites and in the inner city 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.200
 area to work with the machine 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.200
 can 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:22.310
 all touchy mini excavators have one 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:25.790
 bonnet which opens upwards and 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.920
 thus opened in the machine shadow 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.530
 can be 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.430
 so that we can forget it even if we are 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.569
 that the mother is shut up 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.269
 Do not shut down this mother's door 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:42.680
 can and distance from the body to the 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:49.629
 important elements such as the dipstick 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:52.280
 reach out and trim the motor oils 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.709
 also in the compact class has hitachi 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.280
 two new models of the 5 series 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:02.659
 released on the one hand the celtics 85 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:09.969
 usb line 5 with swivel arm and 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:13.519
 the 85 us mark 5 with fixed monoblock 

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:16.579
 with these machines will too 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.199
 by default the gripper turn and the 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.989
 open close promotion 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:25.630
 proportionally over joysticks in the 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:28.550
 cab driven we also have here 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.099
 the same iks shaped under dare 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:35.360
 We at the big banks as well as at 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:38.720
 the mini-excavators have installed these 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.820
 robust components are used in the 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.159
 packers from big to small and built 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.000
 that is the big advantage of the floor 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:50.919
 compact excavators where just the robustness 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.919
 plays a big role
