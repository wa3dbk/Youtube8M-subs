for<00:01:53.000> a<00:01:53.030> lot<00:01:53.240> less<00:01:53.420> flour<00:01:53.689> than<00:01:53.990> those<00:01:54.140> two<00:01:54.380> and

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
for a lot less flour than those two and

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.770 
for a lot less flour than those two and
I<00:01:55.100> found<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:55.460> really<00:01:55.700> hard<00:01:55.850> to<00:01:56.149> work<00:01:56.329> with<00:01:56.540> so

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
I found it really hard to work with so

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.020 
I found it really hard to work with so
I'm<00:01:56.869> going<00:01:57.020> to<00:01:57.049> go<00:01:57.170> ahead<00:01:57.409> and<00:01:57.590> add<00:01:57.740> some

work it into the dough to get the dough

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.600 
work it into the dough to get the dough
a<00:02:02.240> little<00:02:02.750> less<00:02:02.930> tacky<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.219> little<00:02:04.490> bit

more easy to handle now that I've got my

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:08.830 
more easy to handle now that I've got my
dough<00:02:07.280> at<00:02:07.490> a<00:02:07.520> more<00:02:07.670> manageable<00:02:08.090> place<00:02:08.509> I'm

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
get this incorporated into the dough

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.260 
get this incorporated into the dough
evenly<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:18.230> if<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.620> fold<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.370> turn

and<00:02:20.390> work<00:02:20.600> it<00:02:20.720> into<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.960> dough<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.770> should<00:02:22.010> be

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
and work it into the dough you should be

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.400 
and work it into the dough you should be
fine<00:02:22.310> make<00:02:23.120> sure<00:02:23.330> you<00:02:23.510> use<00:02:23.690> all<00:02:23.930> of<00:02:24.320> the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
evenly spread throughout the dough so

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.110 
evenly spread throughout the dough so
just<00:02:34.280> do<00:02:34.400> your<00:02:34.550> best

just as a warning I didn't end up using
all<00:02:41.630> of<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.870> seamy<00:02:42.230> that<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.530> recipe<00:02:42.860> called

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
all of the seamy that the recipe called

for you can say that I chickened out a
little<00:02:45.410> bit<00:02:45.680> but<00:02:46.280> now<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.460> dough<00:02:46.820> is<00:02:46.850> ready

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
little bit but now the dough is ready

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.030 
little bit but now the dough is ready
we're<00:02:47.510> going<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:47.840> place<00:02:48.080> it<00:02:48.290> into<00:02:48.620> a<00:02:48.650> slightly

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
we're going to place it into a slightly

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.700 
we're going to place it into a slightly
greased<00:02:49.460> Bowl<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:50.030> cover<00:02:50.090> it<00:02:50.960> lightly<00:02:51.380> in<00:02:51.620> a

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
greased Bowl and cover it lightly in a

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.770 
greased Bowl and cover it lightly in a
warm<00:02:51.950> place<00:02:52.010> to<00:02:52.250> let<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.760> dough<00:02:52.910> rise<00:02:53.210> for<00:02:53.270> the

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
warm place to let the dough rise for the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.060 
warm place to let the dough rise for the
second<00:02:54.440> time<00:02:55.720> after<00:02:56.720> about<00:02:57.170> 30<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.680> 40<00:02:57.980> minutes

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
second time after about 30 to 40 minutes

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.790 
second time after about 30 to 40 minutes
it<00:02:58.400> looks<00:02:58.640> like<00:02:58.850> this<00:02:59.030> so<00:02:59.750> just<00:02:59.900> gently<00:03:00.290> Pat<00:03:00.620> it

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
it looks like this so just gently Pat it

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.010 
it looks like this so just gently Pat it
down<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.310> then<00:03:01.730> take<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.330> dough<00:03:02.480> out<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:02.810> the

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
down and then take the dough out of the

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.650 
down and then take the dough out of the
bowl<00:03:03.110> and<00:03:03.560> turn<00:03:04.100> it<00:03:04.250> over<00:03:04.400> this<00:03:05.090> allows<00:03:05.450> the

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
bowl and turn it over this allows the

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.630 
bowl and turn it over this allows the
dough<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.870> rise<00:03:06.080> even<00:03:06.650> more<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:07.190> next<00:03:07.340> time

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
dough to rise even more the next time

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.970 
dough to rise even more the next time
around<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:08.240> produces<00:03:08.690> an<00:03:08.840> even<00:03:09.140> airier<00:03:09.590> dough

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
around and produces an even airier dough

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.820 
around and produces an even airier dough
you're<00:03:10.850> going<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.180> repeat<00:03:11.480> this<00:03:11.720> step<00:03:12.050> letting

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
you're going to repeat this step letting

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.100 
you're going to repeat this step letting
the<00:03:12.920> dough<00:03:13.070> rise<00:03:13.310> patting<00:03:14.000> it<00:03:14.120> down<00:03:14.150> turn<00:03:14.930> it

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
the dough rise patting it down turn it

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.620 
the dough rise patting it down turn it
over<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.590> recovering<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:16.550> two<00:03:17.150> to<00:03:17.270> three<00:03:17.480> more

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
over and recovering it two to three more

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.220 
over and recovering it two to three more
times<00:03:17.960> if<00:03:18.320> you<00:03:18.830> want<00:03:19.100> your<00:03:19.250> dough<00:03:19.460> Airy

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
times if you want your dough Airy

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.140 
times if you want your dough Airy
definitely<00:03:21.230> do<00:03:21.380> it<00:03:21.410> three<00:03:21.800> times<00:03:22.070> if<00:03:22.430> you<00:03:22.520> want

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
definitely do it three times if you want

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.970 
definitely do it three times if you want
your<00:03:23.300> dough<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:23.480> little<00:03:23.630> bit<00:03:23.870> more<00:03:24.050> dense<00:03:24.260> only

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
your dough a little bit more dense only

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.140 
your dough a little bit more dense only
do<00:03:25.130> it<00:03:25.250> two<00:03:25.430> more<00:03:25.459> times

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
do it two more times

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.690 
do it two more times
I<00:03:26.180> went<00:03:26.900> for<00:03:27.110> a<00:03:27.140> denser<00:03:27.800> bread<00:03:28.070> so<00:03:28.400> I<00:03:28.430> only

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
I went for a denser bread so I only

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.910 
I went for a denser bread so I only
repeated<00:03:29.300> the<00:03:29.420> step<00:03:29.690> twice<00:03:29.990> after<00:03:30.470> that<00:03:30.620> but

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
repeated the step twice after that but
