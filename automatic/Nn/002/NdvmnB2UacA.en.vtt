00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
to have blossom end rot and that's what

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.889 
to have blossom end rot and that's what
it<00:00:40.219> is<00:00:40.340> they're<00:00:40.550> rowdy<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:41.480> rotting<00:00:41.780> of<00:00:41.840> the

top of the tomato and this is rotting
that<00:00:53.660> it<00:00:53.809> definitely<00:00:54.469> is<00:00:54.649> a<00:00:54.680> lack<00:00:55.039> of<00:00:55.070> calcium

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
that it definitely is a lack of calcium

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.099 
that it definitely is a lack of calcium

does<00:01:05.210> not<00:01:05.390> have<00:01:05.570> magnesium<00:01:05.960> but<00:01:06.560> they<00:01:06.740> both

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
does not have magnesium but they both

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.070 
does not have magnesium but they both
have<00:01:07.130> calcium<00:01:07.400> so<00:01:08.150> we<00:01:08.270> always<00:01:08.570> put<00:01:08.810> that<00:01:08.960> in

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
have calcium so we always put that in

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.470 
have calcium so we always put that in
our<00:01:09.170> soil<00:01:09.560> to<00:01:09.830> prevent<00:01:10.220> this<00:01:10.430> but<00:01:10.940> sometimes

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 
our soil to prevent this but sometimes

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.540 
our soil to prevent this but sometimes
we<00:01:11.720> get<00:01:11.870> cloudy<00:01:12.200> weather<00:01:12.500> sometimes<00:01:13.280> we<00:01:13.430> get

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
we get cloudy weather sometimes we get

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.430 
we get cloudy weather sometimes we get
rainy<00:01:13.850> weather<00:01:14.150> and<00:01:14.420> we'll<00:01:14.780> still<00:01:15.020> get<00:01:15.200> some

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
rainy weather and we'll still get some

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.590 
rainy weather and we'll still get some
blossom<00:01:15.800> in<00:01:15.920> rot<00:01:16.130> then<00:01:16.790> we<00:01:17.000> spray<00:01:17.300> them<00:01:17.570> with

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
blossom in rot then we spray them with

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.200 
blossom in rot then we spray them with
calcium<00:01:18.290> chloride<00:01:18.670> spraying<00:01:19.670> once<00:01:19.910> a<00:01:20.030> week

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
calcium chloride spraying once a week

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.300 
calcium chloride spraying once a week
and<00:01:20.450> I've<00:01:20.600> had<00:01:20.930> many<00:01:21.170> times<00:01:21.440> it's<00:01:21.800> amazement

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
and I've had many times it's amazement

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.550 
and I've had many times it's amazement
blossom<00:01:23.180> end<00:01:23.330> rot<00:01:23.360> in<00:01:23.660> part<00:01:23.900> of<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.050> vine<00:01:24.200> and

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
blossom end rot in part of the vine and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.050 
blossom end rot in part of the vine and
then<00:01:24.920> above<00:01:25.190> that<00:01:25.430> they<00:01:25.580> wouldn't<00:01:25.760> be<00:01:25.850> anymore

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
then above that they wouldn't be anymore

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.610 
then above that they wouldn't be anymore
lost<00:01:26.450> me<00:01:26.660> rot<00:01:26.870> because<00:01:26.990> I<00:01:27.230> sprayed<00:01:27.470> it<00:01:27.590> with

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
lost me rot because I sprayed it with

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.890 
lost me rot because I sprayed it with
calcium<00:01:28.070> chloride<00:01:28.310> great<00:01:29.030> so<00:01:29.510> that's<00:01:29.690> one<00:01:29.870> of

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
calcium chloride great so that's one of

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.360 
calcium chloride great so that's one of
the<00:01:30.020> common<00:01:30.410> area<00:01:30.590> once<00:01:30.770> we<00:01:30.920> have<00:01:31.070> any<00:01:31.190> growing

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
the common area once we have any growing

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.880 
the common area once we have any growing
tomatoes<00:01:31.610> but<00:01:32.240> it<00:01:32.390> is<00:01:32.600> preventable<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:33.410> it<00:01:33.740> is

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
tomatoes but it is preventable and it is

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.070 
tomatoes but it is preventable and it is
curable<00:01:34.280> then<00:01:35.030> I<00:01:35.060> have<00:01:35.330> another<00:01:35.450> thing<00:01:35.810> I<00:01:35.900> want

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
curable then I have another thing I want

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.570 
curable then I have another thing I want
to<00:01:36.140> show<00:01:36.290> you<00:01:36.350> talking<00:01:36.710> about<00:01:36.830> tomatoes<00:01:37.340> this

do with anything else some Tomatoes it's

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.640 
do with anything else some Tomatoes it's
like<00:01:46.610> heirloom<00:01:47.030> tomatoes<00:01:47.450> they<00:01:47.810> every<00:01:48.380> one<00:01:48.620> of

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
like heirloom tomatoes they every one of

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.220 
like heirloom tomatoes they every one of
them<00:01:48.860> will<00:01:48.950> crack<00:01:49.190> and<00:01:49.940> this<00:01:50.720> domain<00:01:51.050> is<00:01:51.200> what

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
them will crack and this domain is what

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.320 
them will crack and this domain is what
we<00:01:51.440> call<00:01:51.590> vertical<00:01:51.860> cracking<00:01:52.610> then<00:01:52.970> some

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
we call vertical cracking then some

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.690 
we call vertical cracking then some
tomatoes<00:01:53.720> have<00:01:53.870> circular<00:01:54.560> cracking<00:01:55.040> or<00:01:55.280> what

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
tomatoes have circular cracking or what

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.310 
tomatoes have circular cracking or what
they<00:01:55.820> call<00:01:56.000> a<00:01:56.030> horizontal<00:01:56.720> crack<00:01:56.960> you<00:01:57.140> write

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
they call a horizontal crack you write

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.500

this<00:01:57.530> so<00:01:58.310> there<00:01:58.520> we<00:01:58.670> are<00:01:58.700> there<00:01:59.090> one<00:01:59.270> more

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
this so there we are there one more

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.730 
this so there we are there one more
