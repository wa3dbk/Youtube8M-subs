welcome I'm each's to the Calvin College

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:14.240 
welcome I'm each's to the Calvin College
it's<00:00:07.200> like<00:00:07.400> what<00:00:08.400> are<00:00:08.429> your<00:00:08.550> buddies<00:00:13.250> we

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
recorded our new album in three

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.630 
recorded our new album in three
dimensions<00:00:18.439> but<00:00:19.439> what<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:19.710> may<00:00:19.859> not<00:00:20.039> know<00:00:20.100> is

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
dimensions but what you may not know is

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.670 
dimensions but what you may not know is
how<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:20.970> listen<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.510> this<00:00:21.660> but<00:00:21.900> but<00:00:22.170> that's<00:00:22.470> why

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
how to listen to this but but that's why

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.950 
how to listen to this but but that's why
we<00:00:22.830> brought<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.160> science<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.760> as<00:00:24.359> humans<00:00:24.750> we<00:00:24.869> are

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
we brought in science I as humans we are

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.500 
we brought in science I as humans we are
very<00:00:25.140> interested<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.980> third<00:00:26.220> dimension

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
very interested in the third dimension

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.599 
very interested in the third dimension
but<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.750> sound<00:00:28.019> part<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.470> very<00:00:28.590> dangerous<00:00:28.830> but

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
but the sound part is very dangerous but

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.060 
but the sound part is very dangerous but
I<00:00:29.640> believe<00:00:30.330> we<00:00:30.539> have<00:00:30.660> finally<00:00:31.500> discovered<00:00:31.769> a

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
I believe we have finally discovered a

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.979 
I believe we have finally discovered a
way<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.309> listening<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.210> which<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.780> very

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
way of listening to it which is very

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.299 
way of listening to it which is very
exciting<00:00:34.200> because<00:00:34.380> now<00:00:34.469> we<00:00:34.620> can<00:00:34.770> listen<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.250> is

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
exciting because now we can listen to is

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.310 
exciting because now we can listen to is
a<00:00:35.430> new<00:00:35.640> convert<00:00:36.630> chill<00:00:36.809> happen<00:00:37.140> with<00:00:37.290> that

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
a new convert chill happen with that

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.229 
a new convert chill happen with that
lethal<00:00:37.980> results<00:00:42.530> what<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.680> this<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.239> like

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
lethal results what this this is a like

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.600 
lethal results what this this is a like
a<00:00:45.300> leg<00:00:45.870> covering<00:00:46.469> much<00:00:47.250> like<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.579> would

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
a leg covering much like you would

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.310 
a leg covering much like you would
happen<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.180> dentist<00:00:48.570> if<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.930> get<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.170> give

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
happen the dentist if you get to give

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.369 
happen the dentist if you get to give
the<00:00:49.559> extra<00:00:50.309> water<00:00:50.780> so<00:00:51.780> what<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.050> have<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.260> do

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
the extra water so what we have to do

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.410 
the extra water so what we have to do
next<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.460> just<00:00:53.670> give<00:00:53.850> these<00:00:54.000> test

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
next is that just give these test

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.450 
next is that just give these test
subject<00:00:54.690> an<00:00:54.809> oxygen<00:00:55.230> supply<00:00:55.590> because<00:00:56.280> in

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
subject an oxygen supply because in

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.880 
subject an oxygen supply because in
testing<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.030> with<00:00:57.270> animals<00:00:58.230> practice

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
testing this with animals practice

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.040 
testing this with animals practice
humans<00:00:59.280> we<00:00:59.370> found<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.820> with<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> elephants

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
humans we found that with the elephants

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.330 
humans we found that with the elephants
is<00:01:01.140> very<00:01:01.350> hard<00:01:01.500> for<00:01:01.559> them<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.890> keep<00:01:02.010> track<00:01:02.070> of

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
is very hard for them to keep track of

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.250 
is very hard for them to keep track of
the<00:01:02.430> oxygen<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.030> they<00:01:03.809> were<00:01:03.899> type<00:01:04.080> of

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
the oxygen and they were type of

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.600 
the oxygen and they were type of
elevated<00:01:04.739> Nate's<00:01:04.920> up<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.250> lose<00:01:05.369> consciousness

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
elevated Nate's up to lose consciousness

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.219 
elevated Nate's up to lose consciousness
so<00:01:06.210> that's<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.630> last<00:01:06.810> thing<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.140> would

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
so that's the last thing you would

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.870 
so that's the last thing you would
happen<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.680> are<00:01:07.770> humans<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.369> mr.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
happen to are humans that is mr.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.520 
happen to are humans that is mr.
elephant<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.299> not<00:01:09.330> such<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.659> big<00:01:09.840> deal<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.380> is

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
elephant is not such a big deal this is

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.380 
elephant is not such a big deal this is
the<00:01:10.650> ultimate<00:01:10.979> effect<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.760> what<00:01:11.939> gives

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
the ultimate effect this is what gives

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.960 
the ultimate effect this is what gives

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
what we have here is the supersonic

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.700 
what we have here is the supersonic
dimension<00:01:27.600> meter<00:01:27.750> which<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.140> going<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.650> show

dimension meter which is going to show

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.499 
dimension meter which is going to show
us<00:01:28.950> what<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.310> test<00:01:29.520> subject<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.000> listening<00:01:30.360> to

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
us what the test subject is listening to

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.940 
us what the test subject is listening to
we<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.140> course<00:01:31.200> start<00:01:31.590> them<00:01:31.710> off<00:01:31.799> in

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
we have to of course start them off in

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.039 
we have to of course start them off in
the<00:01:31.979> first<00:01:32.070> dimension<00:01:32.369> because<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.720> move<00:01:33.869> up

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
the first dimension because to move up

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.800 
the first dimension because to move up
here<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.290> third<00:01:34.439> dimension<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:34.979> such<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> fast

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
here the third dimension in such a fast

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.100 
here the third dimension in such a fast
ride<00:01:37.020> could<00:01:37.290> be<00:01:38.130> lethal<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:39.000> what<00:01:39.420> about<00:01:39.540> what

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
ride could be lethal so what about what

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.160 
ride could be lethal so what about what
about<00:01:40.170> musics<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.100> 50s<00:01:41.520> or<00:01:42.180> all<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.049> way

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
about musics in the 50s or all the way

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.899 
about musics in the 50s or all the way
up<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.409> nine<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.770> like<00:01:43.950> boys<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.490> men<00:01:44.640> or<00:01:44.880> a

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
up to the nine is like boys and men or a

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.170 
up to the nine is like boys and men or a
Google<00:01:45.329> dolls<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:46.049> listen<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.680> all<00:01:46.770> the

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
Google dolls to listen to and all the

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.510 
Google dolls to listen to and all the
music<00:01:48.180> say<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> song<00:01:48.840> from<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.170> 50s<00:01:49.530> that

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
music say a song from the 50s that

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.940 
music say a song from the 50s that
wasn't<00:01:50.850> made<00:01:51.060> with<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.479> 3d<00:01:51.720> technology<00:01:51.990> he

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
wasn't made with the 3d technology he

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.020 
wasn't made with the 3d technology he
could<00:01:53.130> lose<00:01:53.280> his<00:01:53.340> limbs

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
could lose his limbs

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.780 
could lose his limbs
all<00:01:54.390> right<00:01:54.540> let's<00:01:54.720> fire<00:01:54.960> up<00:01:54.990> all<00:01:55.290> r2d2<00:01:56.009> here<00:01:56.399> it

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
all right let's fire up all r2d2 here it

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.870 
all right let's fire up all r2d2 here it
