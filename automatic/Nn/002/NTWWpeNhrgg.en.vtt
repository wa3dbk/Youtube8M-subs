basically<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:39.530> story<00:00:39.739> follows<00:00:40.070> I<00:00:41.030> think

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
basically the story follows I think

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.150 
basically the story follows I think
there's<00:00:41.570> an<00:00:41.690> evil<00:00:41.870> sword<00:00:42.110> named<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:42.590> Sangha

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
there's an evil sword named the Sangha

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.819 
there's an evil sword named the Sangha
and<00:00:43.430> it<00:00:43.579> has<00:00:43.880> been<00:00:44.149> locked<00:00:44.390> away<00:00:44.540> for<00:00:45.020> hundreds

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
and it has been locked away for hundreds

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:47.319 
and it has been locked away for hundreds
of<00:00:45.920> years<00:00:46.130> when<00:00:46.399> any<00:00:46.520> ahsha's<00:00:46.820> father<00:00:46.850> died

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
of years when any ahsha's father died

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.720 
of years when any ahsha's father died
apparently<00:00:47.750> three<00:00:48.230> swords<00:00:48.649> swords<00:00:49.460> were

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
apparently three swords swords were

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.319 
apparently three swords swords were
forged<00:00:50.260> the<00:00:51.260> tetsusaiga<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:52.550> tenseiga<00:00:52.969> and

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
the soul or the Soviet something like

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.090 
the soul or the Soviet something like
that<00:00:56.600> and<00:00:56.870> it's<00:00:57.020> funny<00:00:57.200> how<00:00:57.410> they<00:00:57.680> know<00:00:57.950> it

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
that and it's funny how they know it

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.500 
that and it's funny how they know it
started<00:00:58.370> out<00:00:58.489> with<00:00:58.610> that<00:00:58.760> one<00:00:58.789> sword<00:00:59.239> then

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
started out with that one sword then

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.209 
started out with that one sword then

like that it's good action I guess but
it's<00:01:37.039> not<00:01:37.340> going<00:01:37.459> to<00:01:37.550> be<00:01:37.610> enough<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:37.849> say<00:01:38.000> this

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300
