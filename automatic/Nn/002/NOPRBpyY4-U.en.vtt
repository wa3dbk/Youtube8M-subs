your skin and there's just not going to
be<00:01:32.430> any<00:01:32.579> contrast<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:33.689> gonna<00:01:33.810> look<00:01:33.960> a

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
be any contrast and it's gonna look a

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.539 
be any contrast and it's gonna look a
bit<00:01:34.229> strange<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.770> always<00:01:34.950> see<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.220> applies

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
bit strange and always see this applies

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.460 
bit strange and always see this applies
to<00:01:35.579> clothing<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.360> makeup<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.049> all<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.439> that

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
to clothing and makeup and all of that

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.530 
to clothing and makeup and all of that
stuff<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.159> then<00:01:38.610> obviously<00:01:38.790> we<00:01:39.180> need<00:01:39.299> bright

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
stuff and then obviously we need bright

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.600 
stuff and then obviously we need bright
colors<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.290> they<00:01:40.560> do<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.100> be<00:01:41.280> kind<00:01:41.549> of

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
colors and they do have to be kind of

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.030 
colors and they do have to be kind of
colorful<00:01:41.939> they<00:01:42.210> can<00:01:42.390> be<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:42.930> dark<00:01:43.710> bright

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
colorful they can be just dark bright

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.920 
colorful they can be just dark bright
colors<00:01:44.340> or<00:01:44.549> dark<00:01:44.850> bright<00:01:45.030> colors<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.570> blacks

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
colors or dark bright colors like blacks

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.990 
colors or dark bright colors like blacks
and<00:01:46.229> browns<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.009> really<00:01:47.250> kind<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.520> intense

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
and browns and really kind of intense

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.120 
and browns and really kind of intense
rich<00:01:48.479> colors<00:01:48.869> these<00:01:49.409> are<00:01:49.470> obviously<00:01:49.890> gonna

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
rich colors these are obviously gonna

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.740 
rich colors these are obviously gonna
bring<00:01:50.399> out<00:01:50.610> your<00:01:50.820> skin<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.149> little<00:01:51.360> bit<00:01:51.450> more

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
bring out your skin a little bit more

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.600 
bring out your skin a little bit more
just<00:01:52.079> because<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.829> really<00:01:53.130> intense

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
just because of that really intense

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.969 
just because of that really intense
contrast<00:01:54.149> but<00:01:54.720> also<00:01:55.049> think<00:01:55.439> about<00:01:55.530> Reds

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
contrast but also think about Reds

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.770 
contrast but also think about Reds
because<00:01:56.159> if<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.579> do<00:01:56.820> have<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.420> really<00:01:57.630> strong

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
because if you do have a really strong

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.859 
because if you do have a really strong
pink<00:01:58.500> undertone<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.280> you<00:02:00.090> almost<00:02:00.509> find

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
pink undertone and you almost find

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.660 
pink undertone and you almost find
yourself<00:02:01.320> looking<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.799> bit<00:02:01.950> flushed<00:02:02.280> all<00:02:02.549> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
yourself looking a bit flushed all the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.249 
yourself looking a bit flushed all the
time<00:02:02.880> if<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.090> have<00:02:03.119> really<00:02:03.689> red<00:02:03.960> cheeks

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
time if you have really red cheeks

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.990 
time if you have really red cheeks
naturally<00:02:04.799> then<00:02:05.009> always<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.340> stay<00:02:05.549> away<00:02:05.759> from

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
naturally then always you stay away from

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.459 
naturally then always you stay away from
red<00:02:06.210> because<00:02:06.570> that's<00:02:06.780> just<00:02:06.930> gonna<00:02:07.079> make<00:02:07.290> you

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
red because that's just gonna make you

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.410 
red because that's just gonna make you
like<00:02:07.619> even<00:02:07.979> more<00:02:08.190> flushed<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.789> even<00:02:09.239> more

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
like even more flushed and even more

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
with dark Browns and blacks just once

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.240 
with dark Browns and blacks just once
again<00:03:47.060> because<00:03:47.360> of<00:03:47.480> that<00:03:47.570> contrast<00:03:48.140> and<00:03:48.530> it's

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
again because of that contrast and it's

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.010 
again because of that contrast and it's
not<00:03:49.400> overly<00:03:49.730> dark<00:03:50.000> and<00:03:50.360> it's<00:03:50.540> not<00:03:50.750> crazy

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
not overly dark and it's not crazy

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.110 
not overly dark and it's not crazy
contrast<00:03:51.650> as<00:03:51.800> well<00:03:51.830> so<00:03:52.370> it's<00:03:52.640> a<00:03:52.730> really<00:03:53.000> good

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
contrast as well so it's a really good

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.000 
contrast as well so it's a really good
color<00:03:53.360> to<00:03:53.570> have<00:03:53.900> for<00:03:54.110> really<00:03:54.440> dark<00:03:54.650> skin

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
color to have for really dark skin

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.650 
color to have for really dark skin
colors<00:03:55.310> you're<00:03:55.550> really<00:03:55.880> lucky<00:03:56.030> because<00:03:56.360> you

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
colors you're really lucky because you

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.660 
colors you're really lucky because you
can<00:03:56.810> pretty<00:03:56.990> much<00:03:57.110> get<00:03:57.470> away<00:03:57.709> with<00:03:58.040> any<00:03:58.310> sort

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
can pretty much get away with any sort

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:59.320 
can pretty much get away with any sort
of<00:03:58.760> colors

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
of colors

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.330 
of colors
you're<00:03:59.720> better<00:03:59.959> off<00:04:00.170> obviously<00:04:00.500> when<00:04:00.980> really

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
you're better off obviously when really

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.740 
you're better off obviously when really
bright<00:04:01.700> colors<00:04:02.000> just<00:04:02.209> because<00:04:02.540> of<00:04:02.660> that

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
bright colors just because of that

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.630 
bright colors just because of that
contrast<00:04:03.290> with<00:04:03.440> your<00:04:03.650> skin<00:04:03.950> I<00:04:04.130> think<00:04:04.340> it<00:04:04.459> looks

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
contrast with your skin I think it looks

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.699 
contrast with your skin I think it looks
super<00:04:05.030> bitchy<00:04:05.390> you<00:04:05.570> can<00:04:05.750> go<00:04:05.930> for<00:04:06.290> white<00:04:06.650> and

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
super bitchy you can go for white and

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.640 
super bitchy you can go for white and
creams<00:04:07.400> maybe<00:04:08.120> stay<00:04:08.420> away<00:04:08.690> from<00:04:09.050> really<00:04:09.350> kind

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
creams maybe stay away from really kind

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.530 
creams maybe stay away from really kind
of<00:04:09.709> proper<00:04:10.250> white<00:04:10.459> colors<00:04:10.850> just<00:04:11.060> because<00:04:11.390> it

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
of proper white colors just because it

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.600 
of proper white colors just because it
can<00:04:11.720> look<00:04:11.900> a<00:04:12.140> bit<00:04:12.560> strange<00:04:12.860> if<00:04:13.040> your<00:04:13.160> skin<00:04:13.400> is

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
can look a bit strange if your skin is

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.000 
can look a bit strange if your skin is
really<00:04:13.910> dark<00:04:14.300> and<00:04:14.570> also<00:04:14.840> black<00:04:15.290> looks<00:04:15.650> quite

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
really dark and also black looks quite

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.800 
really dark and also black looks quite
nice<00:04:16.190> as<00:04:16.489> long<00:04:16.520> as<00:04:16.970> it's<00:04:17.150> not<00:04:17.390> kind<00:04:17.630> of<00:04:17.660> the

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
nice as long as it's not kind of the

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.780 
nice as long as it's not kind of the
exact<00:04:18.109> same<00:04:18.440> color<00:04:18.799> as<00:04:18.980> your<00:04:19.190> skin<00:04:19.459> as<00:04:19.609> well
