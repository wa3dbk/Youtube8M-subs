00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
one of the characteristics of this kind

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.730 
one of the characteristics of this kind
of<00:00:24.240> light<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.689> only<00:00:24.810> throws<00:00:25.170> light<00:00:25.470> from

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
of light is it only throws light from

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.130 
of light is it only throws light from
the<00:00:25.859> front<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.849> way<00:00:27.150> they<00:00:27.330> behave<00:00:27.689> more

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
the front in that way they behave more

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.160 
the front in that way they behave more
like<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.320> speed<00:00:28.680> light<00:00:29.510> then<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.539> studio<00:00:30.869> flash

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170

you<00:00:33.870> can<00:00:34.020> use<00:00:34.170> them<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.530> softbox<00:00:34.950> if<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.250> can

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
you can use them in a softbox if you can

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.979 
you can use them in a softbox if you can
figure<00:00:35.489> out<00:00:35.610> how<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.850> rig<00:00:35.969> them<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.239> there<00:00:36.420> but

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
figure out how to rig them in there but

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.630 
figure out how to rig them in there but
one<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.230> them<00:00:37.410> won't<00:00:37.620> fill<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> big<00:00:38.070> box<00:00:38.280> like<00:00:38.489> my

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
one of them won't fill a big box like my

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
these over the last few weeks I'm now

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.119 
these over the last few weeks I'm now
finding<00:00:42.629> out<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.930> coverage<00:00:43.469> can<00:00:43.710> be<00:00:43.800> as<00:00:43.920> big

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
finding out that coverage can be as big

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.459 
finding out that coverage can be as big
an<00:00:44.250> issue<00:00:44.309> as<00:00:44.489> brightness<00:00:45.170> because<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
an issue as brightness because the

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.110 
an issue as brightness because the
lights<00:00:46.680> are<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.070> directional<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.700> size<00:00:47.910> in

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
lights are so directional the size in

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.209 
lights are so directional the size in
the<00:00:48.180> shape<00:00:48.450> really<00:00:48.899> affects<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.800> size<00:00:50.010> and

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
the shape really affects the size and

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.680 
the shape really affects the size and
shape<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.640> beam<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.059> light<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.449> comes

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
shape of the beam of light that comes

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.959 
shape of the beam of light that comes
out<00:00:51.980> even<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> flood<00:00:53.309> versions<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.879> these

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
out even the flood versions of these

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.369 
out even the flood versions of these
kind<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.300> act<00:00:54.449> like<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.629> spot<00:00:54.989> light<00:00:55.199> when

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
kind of act like a spot light when

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.010 
kind of act like a spot light when
they're<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.620> close<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> subject<00:00:57.020> diffusion

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
they're in close to a subject diffusion

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.569 
they're in close to a subject diffusion
on<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.199> panel<00:00:58.500> itself<00:00:58.800> can<00:00:59.070> help<00:00:59.219> spread<00:00:59.489> it

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
on the panel itself can help spread it

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.010 
on the panel itself can help spread it
out<00:00:59.699> but<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.000> helps<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.300> have<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.480> bigger<00:01:00.750> light

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
out but it helps to have a bigger light

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.039 
out but it helps to have a bigger light
if<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.379> need<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.649> cover<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.980> larger<00:01:02.370> area<00:01:02.609> I

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
if you need to cover a larger area I

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:04.880 
if you need to cover a larger area I
mentioned<00:01:04.049> last<00:01:04.170> time<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.589> had<00:01:04.710> bought

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
mentioned last time that I had bought

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.980 
mentioned last time that I had bought
two<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.100> these<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.939> one<00:01:06.119> here<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.390> exactly

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
two of these this one here is exactly

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.710 
two of these this one here is exactly
half<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.250> output<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.700> half<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.479> size

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
half of the output and half of the size

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.649 
half of the output and half of the size
of<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.080> larger<00:01:10.560> one<00:01:10.770> by<00:01:10.979> one<00:01:11.250> unit<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:12.510> also

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
of this larger one by one unit it also

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.390 
of this larger one by one unit it also
covers<00:01:13.110> half<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.350> area<00:01:13.860> through<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.220> same

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
covers half the area through the same

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.910 
covers half the area through the same
distance<00:01:14.760> away<00:01:15.170> now<00:01:16.170> looking<00:01:16.439> at<00:01:16.530> what<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.680> need

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
distance away now looking at what I need

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.320 
distance away now looking at what I need
to<00:01:17.040> add<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.430> future<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.820> think<00:01:17.909> I'll<00:01:18.240> be

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
to add in the future I think I'll be

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.240 
to add in the future I think I'll be
looking<00:01:18.630> at<00:01:18.720> something<00:01:19.020> like<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.380> 800<00:01:19.950> unit

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
looking at something like this 800 unit

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.550 
looking at something like this 800 unit
it<00:01:21.150> has<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.330> little<00:01:21.689> less<00:01:21.840> output<00:01:22.080> than<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
it has a little less output than the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.050 
it has a little less output than the
bigger<00:01:22.770> light<00:01:22.979> but<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.340> covers<00:01:23.640> about<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
bigger light but it covers about the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.670 
bigger light but it covers about the
same<00:01:24.240> amount<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.600> area<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.140> cost<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.530> little

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
same amount of area and cost a little

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.770 
same amount of area and cost a little
less<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:26.520> also<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.790> little<00:01:27.060> lighter<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.540> carry

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
less it's also a little lighter to carry

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.319 
less it's also a little lighter to carry
around<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.250> has<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.520> same<00:01:29.729> color<00:01:30.000> as<00:01:30.180> my

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
around and it has the same color as my
