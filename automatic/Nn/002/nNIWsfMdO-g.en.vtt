00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.250
 hello guys we got to the last module of the 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.980
 course and would like to spend some 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.780
 supplementary information which may be 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.539
 useful for those who want to know more about 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.090
 magnetism then the first we want 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.290
 address some problems that are still 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.690
 answers 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.480
 ie issues that have not yet been well 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.360
 in the magnetism gel and for the 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.910
 magnetism then we will be some 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.340
 institutions in Brazil and abroad that 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.680
 conducts research in these areas 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.650
 Finally we will guide you in finding 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.470
 new information on magnetism and 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.540
 we will cover some extra topics that 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.730
 we booked for the end of the course 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.520
 if you thought that the researchers 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.320
 knew everything about the core of the earth or 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.989
 on the field generated hurts us 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.480
 magnetosphere you're mistaken 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.120
 in fact there are many questions not yet 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.399
 resolved and that some are even more 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.290
 our curiosity by stimulating our 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.409
 scientific research 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.219
 one of these intriguing questions is the 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.860
 Following 

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:11.850
 how the magnetic field of the nucleus 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.040
 is filtered by the mantle with a 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.840
 three - dimensional electrical conductivity 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.330
 in the book you will find more 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.979
 details about this question and other 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.590
 issues in full debate in the community 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.869
 it is clear that only 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.450
 We selected some questions but you 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.070
 You can find many more if you visit 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.210
 the home page of some of the 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.970
 search 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.010
 this is already a subject of the next item that 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.810
 It deals with research institutions in 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.640
 Brazil and abroad 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.250
 one of the main institutions in general 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.770
 magnetism and for jetzt magnetism and 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.229
 Germany is located in the city of 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.270
 potsdam in the next berlinda 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.189
 they work in several areas such as 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.720
 global models of the magnetic field in the 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.250
 geological past 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.290
 they also have a great experience 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.780
 in the construction of observatories 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.040
 around the world including in the 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.290
 Brazil 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.570
 so they collaborated with us on 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.430
 constitution of the new observatory 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.439
 of the wetland that has been installed 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.390
 in October of 2012 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:12.480
 the researchers and the ranking and 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.790
 monica court continue 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.569
 with our group at the new observatory 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.069
 of the amazon that we have already begun to install 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.769
 another very important institution 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.510
 outside the University of 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.849
 california where the 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.640
 researchers of Mayan Glatz War and 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.129
 paulo roberto if you remember the models 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.140
 three-dimensional hand in the day so 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.459
 it was they who worked in this 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.440
 problem 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.810
 many institutions perform 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.790
 important research for your 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.780
 magnetism and for magnetism in the 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.760
 in the booklet we mentioned some more 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.250
 we leave this extra work for you 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.769
 to seek out other institutions and 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.690
 other researchers participating in the 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.769
 development of knowledge in already 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.340
 magnetism 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.530
 but in brazil in brazil they also perform 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.220
 the latest research and magnetism 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.799
 for magnetism and economy 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.780
 some important institutions are a 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.609
 Institute of Geophysical Astronomy 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.560
 University of Sao Paulo 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.290
 the national research institute 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.599
 space and national observatory 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.120
 Did you know in this course two 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.790
 researchers in the area of ​​straw the 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.560
 magnetism and even magnetism the doctor 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.549
 ricardo trindade and doctor jeová 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.470
 hartmann 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.780
 they talked a little about work 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.970
 that they develop in usp and that 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.459
 contributes among other things to a 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.919
 better understanding of how the field 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.319
 has fluctuated over the last few millennia 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:42.540
 These unpublished data are 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.060
 key to improving the models 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.489
 of the magnetic field in the past 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.769
 already inpe researchers work 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.269
 more intensely with a magnetic field 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.630
 external 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.760
 You remember, for example, they study. 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.250
 characteristics of the solar wind 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.889
 magnetic storms and how they 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.629
 influence the earth's surface and 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.910
 Do you know about the work that 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.819
 the national observatory 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.099
 we work with different areas 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.660
 the first was the theme of my Ph.D. 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.540
 on conductivity modeling 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.489
 we use pulses of 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.530
 circular evaluation already magnetic 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.800
 another important topic in our research 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.520
 is the construction of new observatories 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.680
 magnetic 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.090
 in Brazil and the study of these data 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.310
 unpublished 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:34.069
 enem has already built three observatories 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:36.949
 magnetic brooms in 1915 touches on 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:39.360
 1957 and we recently built 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:42.900
 the pantanal observatory in October 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.460
 2012 with the collaboration of sesc 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.009
 We are already working on the new 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.440
 observatory of the Amazon inter-faith with 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:51.539
 collaboration of the mamirauá institute 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.610
 we have recently started working with 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.870
 the effects of the magnetic anomaly 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.180
 south atlantic 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.979
 on the land surface relative to the 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.590
 external magnetic field 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.090
 if you have more curiosity and you want 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.069
 talk to us 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:09.470
 we will be happy to tell you more about the 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:09.470
 our current searches up to
