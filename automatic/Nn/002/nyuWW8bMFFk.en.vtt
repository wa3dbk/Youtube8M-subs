00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
more overflowing if I try to do it all

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:13.110 
more overflowing if I try to do it all
at<00:04:01.239> once<00:04:01.420> sighs<00:04:01.870> don't

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
I'd have thrown a little shaker bottle

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:54.650 
I'd have thrown a little shaker bottle
afterwards<00:04:51.680> looks<00:04:52.680> good<00:04:53.090> and<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.330> best<00:04:54.509> thing

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
afterwards looks good and the best thing

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.089 
afterwards looks good and the best thing
about<00:04:54.690> this<00:04:54.900> is<00:04:55.080> you<00:04:55.380> don't<00:04:55.470> have<00:04:55.560> to<00:04:55.830> eat

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
that I just put in I'm going to say this

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.360 
that I just put in I'm going to say this
is<00:05:16.620> an<00:05:16.740> estimate<00:05:17.160> is<00:05:17.310> that<00:05:17.449> it's<00:05:18.449> a<00:05:19.130> it's<00:05:20.130> about

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
is an estimate is that it's a it's about

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.629 
is an estimate is that it's a it's about
72<00:05:21.030> grams<00:05:21.270> of<00:05:21.419> carbs<00:05:21.780> 14<00:05:22.620> grams<00:05:22.949> of<00:05:23.159> fat<00:05:23.370> and

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
72 grams of carbs 14 grams of fat and

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.659 
72 grams of carbs 14 grams of fat and
then<00:05:23.759> you're<00:05:23.789> going<00:05:24.030> to<00:05:24.090> get<00:05:25.310> 60<00:05:26.310> grams<00:05:26.340> of

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
then you're going to get 60 grams of

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.089 
then you're going to get 60 grams of
protein<00:05:27.259> but<00:05:28.259> it's<00:05:28.380> all<00:05:28.530> from<00:05:28.680> whole<00:05:28.889> food
