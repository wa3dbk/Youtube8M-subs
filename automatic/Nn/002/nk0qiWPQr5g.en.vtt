00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
hello we're going to actually carve the

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.599 
hello we're going to actually carve the
pumpkin<00:00:04.140> today<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:04.620> little<00:00:04.830> more<00:00:05.100> advanced<00:00:05.400> so

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
pumpkin today a little more advanced so

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.070 
pumpkin today a little more advanced so
good<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:05.879> carve<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.420> pumpkin

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
good to carve the pumpkin

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.240 
good to carve the pumpkin
this<00:00:07.649> is<00:00:07.830> dr.<00:00:08.160> Kirk<00:00:08.580> welcome<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.360> 3d<00:00:09.599> topic

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
this is dr. Kirk welcome to 3d topic

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.910 
this is dr. Kirk welcome to 3d topic
dot-com<00:00:11.250> now<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:12.719> carve<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.019> pumpkin<00:00:13.440> we<00:00:13.740> just

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
dot-com now to carve the pumpkin we just

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.410 
dot-com now to carve the pumpkin we just
kind<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.130> jump<00:00:14.340> into<00:00:14.549> it<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:17.210> it's<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.270> little

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
kind of jump into it and it's a little

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.820 
kind of jump into it and it's a little
different<00:00:18.930> because<00:00:19.020> it's<00:00:19.320> already<00:00:19.470> got<00:00:19.710> the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
different because it's already got the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.010 
different because it's already got the
ribs<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.640> so<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.539> little<00:00:21.660> tricky<00:00:21.810> to

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
ribs in it so it's a little tricky to

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.050 
ribs in it so it's a little tricky to
carve<00:00:22.350> make<00:00:22.859> sure<00:00:22.980> it's<00:00:23.130> selected<00:00:23.220> go<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:23.939> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
carve make sure it's selected go to the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.029 
carve make sure it's selected go to the
vertex<00:00:24.510> first<00:00:25.170> I'll<00:00:25.500> make<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.650> little<00:00:25.949> bit

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
vertex first I'll make a little bit

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.580 
vertex first I'll make a little bit
easier<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.660> might<00:00:27.779> not<00:00:27.810> be<00:00:27.930> symmetrical

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
easier and it might not be symmetrical

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.169 
easier and it might not be symmetrical
because<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.460> way<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.789> ribs<00:00:29.970> have<00:00:30.119> been

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
because of the way the ribs have been

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.170 
because of the way the ribs have been
made<00:00:30.800> so<00:00:31.800> we<00:00:31.859> just<00:00:32.040> have<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.250> ignore<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.030> back

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
made so we just have to ignore the back

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.000 
made so we just have to ignore the back
facing<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.780> select<00:00:34.440> some<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> points

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
facing and select some of the points

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.400 
facing and select some of the points
here<00:00:35.160> for<00:00:35.880> example<00:00:36.149> ah<00:00:36.480> make<00:00:37.079> sure<00:00:37.260> you're

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
here for example ah make sure you're

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.650 
here for example ah make sure you're
soft<00:00:37.649> select<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.100> off<00:00:38.309> if<00:00:39.300> you're<00:00:39.420> soft

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
soft select this off if you're soft

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.440 
soft select this off if you're soft
select<00:00:39.930> it's<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.230> take<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.800> off<00:00:40.980> immediately

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
select it's on take it off immediately

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.100 
select it's on take it off immediately
so<00:00:42.450> grab<00:00:43.230> some<00:00:43.260> points<00:00:45.200> I'll<00:00:46.200> grab<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> few<00:00:46.559> and

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
so grab some points I'll grab a few and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.410 
so grab some points I'll grab a few and
I'll<00:00:49.110> start<00:00:51.980> by<00:00:52.980> connecting<00:00:53.430> them<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:54.329> I've

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
I'll start by connecting them so I've

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.100 
I'll start by connecting them so I've
grabbed<00:00:54.570> something<00:00:54.960> I'll<00:00:55.020> start<00:00:55.260> connecting

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.790 

basically<00:01:01.950> making<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.340> eyes<00:01:02.489> here<00:01:06.800> they're

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
basically making the eyes here they're

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.230 
basically making the eyes here they're
not<00:01:08.130> going<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.430> be<00:01:08.520> symmetrical<00:01:09.000> like<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.270> say

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
not going to be symmetrical like I say

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.620 
not going to be symmetrical like I say
because<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.479> way<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.720> pumpkin<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.290> set<00:01:13.650> up

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
because of the way the pumpkin is set up

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.450 
because of the way the pumpkin is set up
so<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.690> won't<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.900> symmetrical<00:01:16.409> at<00:01:16.590> all<00:01:16.770> it

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
so it won't be symmetrical at all it

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.440 
so it won't be symmetrical at all it
should<00:01:17.490> be<00:01:17.700> interesting

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
should be interesting

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.700 
should be interesting
nickel<00:01:19.200> grab<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.490> for<00:01:20.550> this<00:01:20.909> side

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
nickel grab this and this for this side

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:29.600 
nickel grab this and this for this side
and<00:01:22.790> over<00:01:23.790> here<00:01:26.030> maybe<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.390> send<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:28.610> so

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
and over here maybe this send this so

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.600 
and over here maybe this send this so
see<00:01:29.850> what<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.149> the<00:01:30.360> path<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:31.409> way<00:01:31.610> feel

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
see what we in the path that way feel

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.320 
see what we in the path that way feel
free<00:01:32.640> after<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.479> get<00:01:33.750> your<00:01:33.960> shapes<00:01:34.940> in<00:01:35.940> order

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
free after you get your shapes in order

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.749 
free after you get your shapes in order
to<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.289> delete<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.619> polygons<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.430> makes<00:01:38.640> it

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
to just delete the polygons it makes it

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.850 
to just delete the polygons it makes it
easier<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.060> see<00:01:39.300> them<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.590> that's<00:01:40.649> something

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
easier to see them so that's something

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.200 
easier to see them so that's something
we<00:01:40.979> roughed<00:01:41.220> out<00:01:41.340> like<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.820> over<00:01:42.030> there

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
we roughed out like that over there

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.150 
we roughed out like that over there
something<00:01:42.869> like<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.140> over<00:01:43.380> there<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:44.100> might

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
something like this over there you might

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.040 
something like this over there you might
want<00:01:44.429> to<00:01:44.460> take<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.670> out<00:01:44.929> kind<00:01:45.929> of

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
want to take that out kind of

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.810 
want to take that out kind of
symmetrical<00:01:46.560> sort<00:01:46.830> of<00:01:46.920> yeah<00:01:47.399> it's<00:01:47.580> a<00:01:47.670> pretty

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
symmetrical sort of yeah it's a pretty

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.529 
symmetrical sort of yeah it's a pretty
good<00:01:48.030> look<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.390> it

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
good look to it

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.450 
good look to it
I<00:01:48.690> could<00:01:49.229> put<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> notice<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.800> if<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.009> want<00:01:50.250> to

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
I could put a notice in if I want to

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.389 
I could put a notice in if I want to
let's<00:01:51.030> do<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.450> go<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.320> vertex<00:01:52.679> grab<00:01:53.220> that

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
let's do that go to the vertex grab that

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.330 
let's do that go to the vertex grab that
hold<00:01:54.149> down<00:01:54.360> control<00:01:54.720> grab<00:01:55.050> that<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.770> by<00:01:56.280> no

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
hold down control grab that and by no

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.310 
hold down control grab that and by no
means<00:01:56.460> I'm<00:01:56.850> using<00:01:57.090> any<00:01:57.330> kind<00:01:57.539> of<00:01:57.630> symmetry<00:01:58.110> as

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
means I'm using any kind of symmetry as

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.160 
means I'm using any kind of symmetry as
I<00:01:58.500> build<00:01:58.830> this<00:01:59.090> so<00:02:00.090> let's<00:02:00.240> go<00:02:00.300> down<00:02:00.509> here<00:02:00.539> back

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
I build this so let's go down here back

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.700 
I build this so let's go down here back
to<00:02:01.380> connect<00:02:02.869> let's<00:02:03.869> start<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.289> build<00:02:04.320> up<00:02:04.590> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
to connect let's start to build up the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.330 
to connect let's start to build up the
nose<00:02:06.080> just<00:02:07.080> a<00:02:07.140> basic<00:02:07.440> triangle<00:02:07.679> nose<00:02:08.009> for<00:02:08.220> this

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
nose just a basic triangle nose for this

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.999 
nose just a basic triangle nose for this
into<00:02:08.610> polygon<00:02:09.000> again<00:02:09.289> just<00:02:10.289> grab<00:02:10.500> these<00:02:10.709> and

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
into polygon again just grab these and

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.020 
into polygon again just grab these and

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
shells you're basically go back to the

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.120 
shells you're basically go back to the
select<00:04:34.240> then<00:04:35.110> what<00:04:35.230> we<00:04:35.320> have<00:04:35.470> to<00:04:35.620> do<00:04:35.770> is

select then what we have to do is

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.480 
select then what we have to do is
basically<00:04:36.940> connect<00:04:37.540> these<00:04:38.790> so<00:04:39.790> I'll<00:04:39.910> grab

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
basically connect these so I'll grab

could<00:05:14.310> group<00:05:14.490> them<00:05:14.550> but<00:05:14.850> I<00:05:14.910> want<00:05:15.060> to<00:05:15.180> attach

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
could group them but I want to attach

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.629 
could group them but I want to attach
them<00:05:15.720> actually<00:05:16.470> so<00:05:17.250> we<00:05:17.370> hit<00:05:17.490> attach<00:05:18.770> and<00:05:19.770> now

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
them actually so we hit attach and now

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.180 
them actually so we hit attach and now
they're<00:05:20.910> basically<00:05:21.270> one<00:05:21.840> object<00:05:22.620> the

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
they're basically one object the

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.400 
they're basically one object the
basement<00:05:23.699> one<00:05:23.820> object<00:05:24.300> this<00:05:24.870> does<00:05:25.080> nothing<00:05:25.229> I

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
basement one object this does nothing I

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.850 
basement one object this does nothing I
wanted<00:05:25.620> to<00:05:25.710> do<00:05:25.800> in<00:05:25.949> here<00:05:26.070> a<00:05:26.280> bit<00:05:27.000> different<00:05:27.860> go

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
wanted to do in here a bit different go

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.480 
wanted to do in here a bit different go
to<00:05:28.919> the<00:05:29.039> selection<00:05:29.300> and<00:05:30.590> if<00:05:31.590> I<00:05:31.770> bridge<00:05:32.160> these

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
to the selection and if I bridge these

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.400 
to the selection and if I bridge these
now<00:05:32.789> it's<00:05:33.419> not<00:05:33.660> gonna<00:05:33.810> look<00:05:33.960> right<00:05:34.139> let<00:05:34.380> me

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
now it's not gonna look right let me

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.529 
now it's not gonna look right let me
give<00:05:34.560> you<00:05:34.650> an<00:05:34.740> example<00:05:35.120> if<00:05:36.120> I<00:05:36.210> go<00:05:36.360> to<00:05:36.449> the

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
give you an example if I go to the

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.790 
give you an example if I go to the
border<00:05:36.870> and<00:05:37.139> try<00:05:37.380> to<00:05:37.440> bridge<00:05:37.710> these<00:05:39.710> it's<00:05:40.710> not

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
border and try to bridge these it's not

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.610 
border and try to bridge these it's not
gonna<00:05:41.009> work<00:05:41.190> right<00:05:41.430> click<00:05:42.150> bridge<00:05:42.389> and<00:05:43.320> it's

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
gonna work right click bridge and it's

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.290 
gonna work right click bridge and it's
all<00:05:43.740> inside<00:05:44.130> out<00:05:44.370> it's<00:05:44.550> not<00:05:44.669> working<00:05:45.120> we're

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
all inside out it's not working we're

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.120 
all inside out it's not working we're
not<00:05:45.479> seeing<00:05:45.750> through<00:05:46.020> it<00:05:46.080> so<00:05:46.889> what<00:05:46.979> I<00:05:47.009> actually

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
not seeing through it so what I actually

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.150 
not seeing through it so what I actually
have<00:05:47.370> to<00:05:47.460> do<00:05:47.550> is<00:05:47.639> take<00:05:47.820> a<00:05:47.849> whole<00:05:48.060> element<00:05:49.160> I'll

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
have to do is take a whole element I'll

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.270 
have to do is take a whole element I'll
do<00:05:50.370> the<00:05:50.490> inside<00:05:50.820> one<00:05:51.090> I<00:05:51.300> need<00:05:52.080> to<00:05:52.169> flip<00:05:52.470> it<00:05:52.620> so

do the inside one I need to flip it so

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.830 
do the inside one I need to flip it so
the<00:05:53.310> bridge<00:05:53.520> won't<00:05:53.699> be<00:05:53.820> turned<00:05:54.030> around<00:05:54.120> so<00:05:54.750> I'm

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840

going to go into the display here I'll

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.640 
going to go into the display here I'll
bridge<00:06:12.300> of<00:06:12.389> the<00:06:12.449> two<00:06:12.599> sections<00:06:12.840> told<00:06:13.349> a<00:06:13.470> more

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
bridge of the two sections told a more

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.830 
bridge of the two sections told a more
rigid<00:06:14.010> so<00:06:14.190> now<00:06:14.699> I<00:06:14.729> can<00:06:14.940> bridge<00:06:15.120> it<00:06:15.270> I've<00:06:15.570> got<00:06:15.810> a

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
rigid so now I can bridge it I've got a

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.070 
rigid so now I can bridge it I've got a
built<00:06:16.139> so<00:06:16.889> this<00:06:17.010> works<00:06:17.220> perfectly<00:06:18.050> knew<00:06:19.050> a

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
built so this works perfectly knew a

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.050 
built so this works perfectly knew a
trick<00:06:19.349> that<00:06:19.560> remains<00:06:19.800> now<00:06:19.919> it's<00:06:20.639> selecting

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
trick that remains now it's selecting

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.240 
trick that remains now it's selecting
these<00:06:21.150> borders<00:06:21.570> I<00:06:21.810> can't<00:06:22.409> very<00:06:22.680> quickly<00:06:22.949> go

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
these borders I can't very quickly go

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.370 
these borders I can't very quickly go
through<00:06:23.539> and<00:06:24.539> do<00:06:24.690> the<00:06:24.810> same<00:06:24.990> thing<00:06:25.259> with

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
through and do the same thing with

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.629 
through and do the same thing with
bridge<00:06:25.620> and<00:06:25.919> it<00:06:26.009> will<00:06:26.099> bring<00:06:26.220> those<00:06:26.490> two

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 
bridge and it will bring those two

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:28.670 
bridge and it will bring those two
sections<00:06:26.960> they're<00:06:27.960> actually<00:06:28.320> almost<00:06:28.440> done

up<00:07:12.170> the<00:07:12.260> iterations<00:07:12.740> every<00:07:12.950> time<00:07:13.100> you<00:07:13.220> do<00:07:13.340> this

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:13.460 
up the iterations every time you do this

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.380 
up the iterations every time you do this
be<00:07:13.820> careful<00:07:14.620> because<00:07:15.620> it<00:07:15.890> brings<00:07:16.040> more

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:16.390 
be careful because it brings more

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.490 
be careful because it brings more
polygons<00:07:17.390> into<00:07:17.690> play<00:07:17.870> it<00:07:18.110> increases<00:07:18.470> your

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:18.500 
polygons into play it increases your

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.130 
polygons into play it increases your
polygons<00:07:19.070> takes<00:07:19.670> longer<00:07:19.940> to<00:07:20.060> render<00:07:20.330> so<00:07:20.990> right

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:21.140 
polygons takes longer to render so right

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.420 
polygons takes longer to render so right
now<00:07:21.260> I<00:07:21.290> have<00:07:21.380> a<00:07:21.470> very<00:07:21.650> good<00:07:21.830> looking<00:07:22.040> pumpkin

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:22.430 
now I have a very good looking pumpkin

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.520 
now I have a very good looking pumpkin
and<00:07:22.670> if<00:07:23.210> I<00:07:23.300> make<00:07:23.510> it<00:07:23.600> a<00:07:23.660> nice<00:07:23.810> ceramic<00:07:24.080> pumpkin

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:24.530 
and if I make it a nice ceramic pumpkin

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:25.810 
and if I make it a nice ceramic pumpkin

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:25.820 
on one color that's perfectly fine
