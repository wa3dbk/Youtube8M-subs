of TNT can minecraft which originally

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.260 
of TNT can minecraft which originally
had<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:36.170> 9x7<00:00:37.280> dispensers<00:00:38.280> amount<00:00:39.180> of

had and 9x7 dispensers amount of
dispensers<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.350> one<00:00:40.530> has<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> team<00:00:41.070> by

twelve<00:00:41.610> amount<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.270> Spencer<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:42.780> that's<00:00:43.050> one

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
twelve amount of Spencer so that's one

twelve amount of Spencer so that's one
hundred<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.440> twenty<00:00:43.800> already<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:45.059> fires

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
hundred and twenty already and it fires

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.229 
hundred and twenty already and it fires
16<00:00:45.899> T<00:00:46.230> per<00:00:46.469> dispenser<00:00:46.980> per<00:00:47.160> shot<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.969> that

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
16 T per dispenser per shot so that

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.490 
16 T per dispenser per shot so that
makes<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.600> fire<00:00:48.809> up<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.170> massive<00:00:50.539> 720p<00:00:51.539> per

makes a fire up to a massive 720p per
individual<00:00:53.219> shot<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.270> colossal

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
individual shot this is colossal

pretty much going to crash any server

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.580 
pretty much going to crash any server
that<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.799> go<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.259> one<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
that you go on to so that is one of the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.830 
that you go on to so that is one of the
main<00:01:16.770> problems<00:01:17.159> with<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.460> if<00:01:17.759> if<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.689> go

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
main problems with this if if you go

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.719 
main problems with this if if you go
onto<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> server<00:01:19.770> like<00:01:20.100> faction<00:01:20.549> server

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
onto like a server like faction server

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.300 
onto like a server like faction server
and<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.299> do<00:01:21.450> somehow<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.650> brains<00:01:23.070> on

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
and you do somehow have the brains on

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.219 
and you do somehow have the brains on
the<00:01:23.400> mind<00:01:23.640> or<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.850> resources<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.810> make<00:01:24.960> this

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
the mind or the resources to make this

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.440 
the mind or the resources to make this
then<00:01:25.860> you'll<00:01:26.250> probably<00:01:26.520> most<00:01:27.000> likely<00:01:27.210> crash

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
then you'll probably most likely crash

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.410 
then you'll probably most likely crash
the<00:01:27.570> server<00:01:27.750> unless<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.680> self<00:01:29.420> dedicated

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
the server unless it is a self dedicated

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.440 
the server unless it is a self dedicated
server<00:01:30.689> they<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.170> hold<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.680> 500<00:01:32.310> people

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
server they can hold like 500 people

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.700 
server they can hold like 500 people
then<00:01:33.450> you're<00:01:33.810> gonna<00:01:33.900> crash<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.380> doesn't

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
then you're gonna crash it doesn't

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.530 
then you're gonna crash it doesn't
matter<00:01:34.890> what<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.250> if<00:01:35.310> you're<00:01:35.460> on<00:01:35.579> like<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.270> said

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
matter what so if you're on like I said

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.840 
matter what so if you're on like I said
if<00:01:36.960> you're<00:01:37.110> on<00:01:37.259> something<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:38.159> don't<00:01:38.790> know

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
if you're on something like I don't know

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.600 
if you're on something like I don't know
it's<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.090> good<00:01:39.180> example<00:01:39.270> um<00:01:40.100> mine<00:01:41.100> flex<00:01:41.400> or

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
it's a good example um mine flex or

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.560 
it's a good example um mine flex or
something<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:41.939> you're<00:01:42.180> probably<00:01:42.360> not

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
something like that you're probably not

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.990 
something like that you're probably not
going<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.810> crash<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.369> but<00:01:44.369> if<00:01:44.579> you're<00:01:44.759> on

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
going to crash that but if you're on

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.550 
going to crash that but if you're on
some<00:01:45.509> random<00:01:45.780> server<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.430> like<00:01:47.759> made<00:01:48.090> by

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
some random server that is like made by

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.080 
some random server that is like made by
minecraft<00:01:49.560> toast<00:01:49.860> then<00:01:50.759> you're<00:01:50.939> going<00:01:51.030> to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
minecraft toast then you're going to

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.639 
minecraft toast then you're going to
crash<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.540> like<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.020> doesn't<00:01:52.200> really<00:01:52.350> matter

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
crash it like it doesn't really matter

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.410 
crash it like it doesn't really matter
unless<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.280> self<00:01:53.579> dedicated<00:01:54.149> server

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
unless you have a self dedicated server

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.620 
unless you have a self dedicated server
you're<00:01:55.350> going<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.280> crash<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.090> that's<00:01:57.390> one

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
you're going to crash it so that's one

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.969 
you're going to crash it so that's one
major<00:01:57.869> problem<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.380> would<00:01:58.590> not<00:01:58.770> recommend

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
major problem so I would not recommend

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.749 
major problem so I would not recommend
making<00:01:59.430> this<00:01:59.670> on<00:02:00.200> any<00:02:01.200> server<00:02:01.560> also<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> second

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
making this on any server also a second

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.510 
making this on any server also a second
thing<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.390> uses<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:04.020> lot<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.890> power<00:02:05.009> like

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
thing is this uses a lot of power like

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.940 
thing is this uses a lot of power like
unless<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.840> super<00:02:07.049> computer<00:02:07.409> -

unless you have a super computer -

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.010 
unless you have a super computer -
pretty<00:02:08.250> much<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.459> super<00:02:08.670> computer<00:02:09.060> then<00:02:09.660> you're

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
pretty much a super computer then you're

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.410 
pretty much a super computer then you're
going<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.229> crash<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.770> game<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.310> have<00:02:11.970> gave<00:02:12.180> all

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
going to crash the game I have gave all

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.630 
going to crash the game I have gave all
my<00:02:12.450> sittings<00:02:12.930> toned<00:02:13.170> down

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
my sittings toned down

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.100 
my sittings toned down
just<00:02:13.850> to<00:02:13.940> make<00:02:14.030> this<00:02:14.090> work<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.569> I<00:02:14.780> get<00:02:14.960> like

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
just to make this work and I get like

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.500 
just to make this work and I get like
five<00:02:15.380> frames<00:02:15.680> per<00:02:15.860> second<00:02:16.190> I<00:02:16.280> shoot<00:02:16.520> this<00:02:16.700> so

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
five frames per second I shoot this so

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.380 
five frames per second I shoot this so
that<00:02:17.900> is<00:02:18.080> extremely<00:02:18.800> problematic<00:02:19.100> so<00:02:19.970> unless

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
that is extremely problematic so unless

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.120 
that is extremely problematic so unless
you<00:02:20.540> have<00:02:20.569> a<00:02:20.660> beast<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:20.990> computer<00:02:21.440> I<00:02:21.620> would<00:02:21.680> not

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
you have a beast a computer I would not

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.280 
you have a beast a computer I would not
use<00:02:22.670> this<00:02:22.880> plus<00:02:23.450> I'm<00:02:23.720> not<00:02:23.750> doing<00:02:24.050> a<00:02:24.110> tutorial

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
use this plus I'm not doing a tutorial

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.670 
use this plus I'm not doing a tutorial
because<00:02:25.130> why<00:02:25.910> would<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:26.300> that's<00:02:26.930> just<00:02:27.290> going<00:02:27.620> to

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
because why would I that's just going to

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.980 
because why would I that's just going to
cause<00:02:27.800> enough<00:02:28.100> from<00:02:28.280> as<00:02:28.520> it<00:02:28.640> is<00:02:28.840> there<00:02:29.840> is<00:02:29.959> a

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
cause enough from as it is there is a

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.270 
cause enough from as it is there is a
download<00:02:30.230> in<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.530> description<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:31.130> if<00:02:31.190> you

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
download in the description that if you

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.030 
download in the description that if you
won't<00:02:31.430> see<00:02:31.610> it<00:02:31.959> so<00:02:32.959> now<00:02:33.380> if<00:02:33.620> we<00:02:33.740> have<00:02:33.830> a<00:02:33.890> quick

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
won't see it so now if we have a quick

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.650 
won't see it so now if we have a quick
look<00:02:34.310> at<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.520> Redstone<00:02:34.940> over<00:02:35.240> here

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
look at the Redstone over here

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.630 
look at the Redstone over here
we<00:02:35.990> can<00:02:36.200> see<00:02:36.440> it<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:36.770> actually<00:02:36.920> really<00:02:37.340> small

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
we can see it is actually really small

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.580 
we can see it is actually really small
it<00:02:37.880> is<00:02:37.940> really<00:02:38.270> small<00:02:38.450> compared<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.870> l12<00:02:39.290> it's

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
it is really small compared the l12 it's

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.680 
it is really small compared the l12 it's
only<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:40.400> actual<00:02:40.670> redstone<00:02:41.180> bit<00:02:41.330> of<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.570> is

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
only the actual redstone bit of it is

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.350 
only the actual redstone bit of it is
only<00:02:41.900> five<00:02:42.290> five<00:02:43.250> wide<00:02:43.520> as<00:02:43.819> you<00:02:43.910> can<00:02:43.970> see<00:02:44.180> here

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
only five five wide as you can see here

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.090 
only five five wide as you can see here
from<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.540> dispenser<00:02:45.050> to<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.290> Redstone<00:02:45.650> which

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
from the dispenser to the Redstone which

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.430 
from the dispenser to the Redstone which
is<00:02:46.310> crazy<00:02:46.670> small<00:02:47.390> compared<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.110> other<00:02:48.260> one

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
is crazy small compared to the other one

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.010 
is crazy small compared to the other one
and<00:02:48.650> actually<00:02:49.370> I<00:02:49.580> had<00:02:49.820> a<00:02:49.850> massive<00:02:50.330> design<00:02:50.810> for

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
and actually I had a massive design for

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.750 
and actually I had a massive design for
this<00:02:51.110> my<00:02:51.290> first<00:02:51.470> doubt<00:02:51.739> that<00:02:51.950> failed<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:52.640> they

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
this my first doubt that failed and they

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.130 
this my first doubt that failed and they
keep<00:02:52.940> making<00:02:53.269> it<00:02:53.360> smaller<00:02:53.600> and<00:02:53.780> smaller<00:02:53.989> and

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
keep making it smaller and smaller and

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.360 
keep making it smaller and smaller and
smaller<00:02:54.200> so<00:02:54.590> I've<00:02:54.650> been<00:02:54.830> feeling<00:02:55.160> about<00:02:55.310> a

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
smaller so I've been feeling about a

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.670 
smaller so I've been feeling about a
month<00:02:55.670> on<00:02:55.850> this<00:02:56.090> just<00:02:56.600> perfecting<00:02:57.320> it<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.530> what

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
month on this just perfecting it to what

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.580 
month on this just perfecting it to what
it<00:02:57.769> is<00:02:57.830> now<00:02:57.890> so<00:02:58.760> that's<00:02:59.090> another<00:02:59.300> pro<00:03:00.230> of<00:03:00.410> this

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
it is now so that's another pro of this

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.740 
it is now so that's another pro of this
it<00:03:00.800> is<00:03:01.220> rather<00:03:01.700> small<00:03:02.000> for<00:03:02.300> what<00:03:02.420> it<00:03:02.510> does<00:03:02.690> and

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
it is rather small for what it does and

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.290 
it is rather small for what it does and
like<00:03:03.410> I<00:03:03.560> said<00:03:03.620> each<00:03:03.950> dispenser<00:03:04.310> just<00:03:04.670> shoot

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
like I said each dispenser just shoot

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.330 
like I said each dispenser just shoot
six<00:03:05.690> that's<00:03:06.019> why<00:03:06.290> we<00:03:06.470> have<00:03:06.650> this<00:03:06.769> comparator

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
six that's why we have this comparator

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.340 
six that's why we have this comparator
clock<00:03:07.550> over<00:03:07.730> here<00:03:08.060> so<00:03:08.510> I<00:03:08.570> can<00:03:08.750> activate<00:03:09.050> all

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
clock over here so I can activate all

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.070 
clock over here so I can activate all
these<00:03:09.530> dispensers<00:03:10.100> I'm<00:03:10.280> back<00:03:10.970> in<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.690> early

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
these dispensers I'm back in the early

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.710 
these dispensers I'm back in the early
versions<00:03:12.590> of<00:03:12.800> one<00:03:13.130> point<00:03:13.420> now<00:03:14.420> one<00:03:14.570> point

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
versions of one point now one point

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.360 
versions of one point now one point
Suman<00:03:15.050> I<00:03:15.110> think<00:03:15.290> also<00:03:15.470> I<00:03:15.590> made<00:03:15.800> all<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.070> cannon

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
Suman I think also I made all the cannon

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.009 
Suman I think also I made all the cannon
there<00:03:16.700> are<00:03:16.790> lots<00:03:17.030> of<00:03:17.180> bugs<00:03:17.360> that<00:03:17.570> prevented

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
there are lots of bugs that prevented

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.810 
there are lots of bugs that prevented
this<00:03:18.140> so<00:03:18.440> now<00:03:18.920> those<00:03:19.220> bugs<00:03:19.489> have<00:03:19.670> been<00:03:19.700> fixed

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
this so now those bugs have been fixed

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.150 
this so now those bugs have been fixed
thanks<00:03:20.540> to<00:03:20.630> Microsoft<00:03:20.870> so<00:03:21.650> this<00:03:21.890> is<00:03:22.010> now

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
thanks to Microsoft so this is now

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.350 
thanks to Microsoft so this is now
possible<00:03:23.440> also<00:03:24.440> another<00:03:25.010> major<00:03:25.670> pro<00:03:26.000> of<00:03:26.209> this

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
possible also another major pro of this

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.440 
possible also another major pro of this
cannon<00:03:26.780> is<00:03:26.900> that<00:03:27.799> it<00:03:28.010> can<00:03:28.220> destroy<00:03:28.700> up<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.209> an

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
cannon is that it can destroy up to an

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.319 
cannon is that it can destroy up to an
80<00:03:29.690> block<00:03:30.200> squid<00:03:30.560> like<00:03:30.920> 80<00:03:31.160> by<00:03:31.340> 80<00:03:31.370> blocks<00:03:31.790> up

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
80 block squid like 80 by 80 blocks up

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.780 
80 block squid like 80 by 80 blocks up
to<00:03:32.750> over<00:03:33.320> 300<00:03:33.620> blocks<00:03:34.040> right<00:03:34.250> so<00:03:34.459> that's<00:03:34.579> a

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
to over 300 blocks right so that's a

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.810 
to over 300 blocks right so that's a
colossal<00:03:35.269> area<00:03:35.600> I<00:03:35.780> actually<00:03:36.290> did<00:03:36.799> try<00:03:37.130> to<00:03:37.250> I

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
colossal area I actually did try to I

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.420 
colossal area I actually did try to I
did<00:03:38.090> try<00:03:38.420> to<00:03:38.480> record<00:03:38.810> me<00:03:39.260> trying<00:03:39.680> blowing<00:03:40.250> up

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
did try to record me trying blowing up

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.910 
did try to record me trying blowing up
some<00:03:40.670> area<00:03:41.030> and<00:03:41.120> I<00:03:41.780> did<00:03:42.019> but<00:03:42.530> a<00:03:42.590> crash

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
some area and I did but a crash

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.530 
some area and I did but a crash
minecraft<00:03:43.489> so<00:03:43.610> I<00:03:43.670> can<00:03:43.850> actually<00:03:44.209> so<00:03:44.390> the

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
minecraft so I can actually so the

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.569 
minecraft so I can actually so the
footage<00:03:44.750> I<00:03:45.079> only<00:03:45.230> got<00:03:45.410> see<00:03:45.680> that<00:03:46.160> what's<00:03:46.459> left

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
footage I only got see that what's left

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.140 
footage I only got see that what's left
of<00:03:46.820> it<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.150> so<00:03:48.079> yeah<00:03:48.290> so<00:03:48.940> anyway<00:03:49.940> you've

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
of it and so yeah so anyway you've

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.940 
of it and so yeah so anyway you've
probably<00:03:50.269> had<00:03:50.570> enough<00:03:50.600> of<00:03:50.959> me<00:03:51.140> blabbering<00:03:51.680> on

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
probably had enough of me blabbering on

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.710 
probably had enough of me blabbering on
there<00:03:52.700> would<00:03:52.850> have<00:03:52.910> been<00:03:53.060> a<00:03:53.090> thing<00:03:53.420> probably

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
there would have been a thing probably

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.050 
there would have been a thing probably
on<00:03:54.079> the<00:03:54.230> thing<00:03:54.410> that<00:03:54.590> probably<00:03:55.370> a<00:03:55.400> thing<00:03:55.850> on

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
on the thing that probably a thing on

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.150 
on the thing that probably a thing on
the<00:03:56.209> video<00:03:56.420> Li<00:03:56.630> that<00:03:56.989> lets<00:03:57.230> you<00:03:57.380> skip<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.920> see

the video Li that lets you skip to see

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.580 
the video Li that lets you skip to see
the<00:03:58.519> swingfire<00:03:59.060> so<00:03:59.600> anyway<00:04:00.079> now<00:04:00.350> we're<00:04:00.470> going

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
to see this thing fire ok guys so for

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.810 
to see this thing fire ok guys so for
the<00:04:03.410> moment<00:04:03.560> of<00:04:03.769> truth<00:04:04.010> I'm<00:04:04.280> gonna<00:04:04.489> press<00:04:04.670> this

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
the moment of truth I'm gonna press this

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.130 
the moment of truth I'm gonna press this
button<00:04:05.090> and<00:04:05.480> then<00:04:05.630> I'm<00:04:05.720> going<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:05.900> back<00:04:06.110> away

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
button and then I'm going to back away

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.000 
button and then I'm going to back away
and<00:04:06.850> then<00:04:07.850> see<00:04:08.120> all<00:04:08.269> the<00:04:08.570> TNT<00:04:09.019> fires<00:04:09.290> down<00:04:09.680> and

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
and then see all the TNT fires down and

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.020 
and then see all the TNT fires down and
then<00:04:10.970> completely<00:04:11.769> just

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.520 

obliterates<00:04:17.109> literally<00:04:18.459> everything<00:04:20.079> so<00:04:21.079> much

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
obliterates literally everything so much

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.640 
obliterates literally everything so much
10<00:04:21.950> tu<00:04:22.730> there's<00:04:23.480> no<00:04:23.720> way<00:04:24.050> that<00:04:24.320> you<00:04:24.470> could

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
10 tu there's no way that you could

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.630 
10 tu there's no way that you could
survive<00:04:24.980> anything<00:04:25.460> like<00:04:25.790> that<00:04:26.950> okay<00:04:27.950> guys<00:04:28.190> so

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
survive anything like that okay guys so

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.820 
survive anything like that okay guys so
you<00:04:28.700> just<00:04:29.420> saw<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:29.660> thing<00:04:30.020> in<00:04:30.140> action<00:04:30.290> as<00:04:30.740> you

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
you just saw the thing in action as you

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.740 
you just saw the thing in action as you
could<00:04:30.950> see<00:04:31.160> TNT<00:04:31.700> literally<00:04:32.360> went<00:04:32.540> flying

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
could see TNT literally went flying

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.960 
could see TNT literally went flying
everywhere<00:04:33.080> in<00:04:33.320> the<00:04:33.410> first<00:04:33.740> thing<00:04:34.100> when<00:04:34.850> it

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
everywhere in the first thing when it

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.880 
everywhere in the first thing when it
first<00:04:35.150> fired<00:04:35.480> you<00:04:35.660> could<00:04:35.810> just<00:04:35.930> see<00:04:36.050> a<00:04:36.080> giant

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
first fired you could just see a giant

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.450 
first fired you could just see a giant
wave<00:04:37.070> of<00:04:37.280> TNT<00:04:37.700> like<00:04:37.910> it's<00:04:38.450> like<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:38.870> ocean

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
wave of TNT like it's like the ocean

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.920 
wave of TNT like it's like the ocean
sorta<00:04:40.460> not<00:04:40.760> really<00:04:41.030> but<00:04:41.270> it's<00:04:41.480> like<00:04:41.660> the<00:04:41.810> ocean

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
sorta not really but it's like the ocean

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.840 
sorta not really but it's like the ocean
sore<00:04:42.320> because<00:04:42.530> just<00:04:42.800> a<00:04:42.890> giant<00:04:43.400> wave<00:04:43.520> and<00:04:43.760> then

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
sore because just a giant wave and then

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.300 
sore because just a giant wave and then
it<00:04:44.000> explodes<00:04:44.510> and<00:04:44.780> goes<00:04:44.960> everywhere<00:04:45.710> up-down

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
it explodes and goes everywhere up-down

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.150 
it explodes and goes everywhere up-down
left-right<00:04:46.570> just<00:04:47.570> every<00:04:48.260> single<00:04:48.470> direction

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
left-right just every single direction

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.040 
left-right just every single direction
and<00:04:49.340> also<00:04:49.970> that<00:04:50.330> brings<00:04:50.540> me<00:04:50.720> to<00:04:50.870> the<00:04:51.020> other

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
and also that brings me to the other

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.500 
and also that brings me to the other
corner<00:04:51.560> of<00:04:51.650> this<00:04:51.890> is<00:04:52.130> that<00:04:52.340> if<00:04:52.550> there's<00:04:53.330> like<00:04:53.480> a

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
corner of this is that if there's like a

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.690 
corner of this is that if there's like a
one<00:04:53.810> in<00:04:53.960> ten<00:04:54.169> percent<00:04:54.440> chance<00:04:54.530> that<00:04:54.919> if<00:04:55.340> when

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
one in ten percent chance that if when

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.190 
one in ten percent chance that if when
it's<00:04:55.880> like<00:04:56.210> a<00:04:56.240> hundred<00:04:56.480> blocks<00:04:56.810> out<00:04:56.990> there

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
it's like a hundred blocks out there

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.960 
it's like a hundred blocks out there
that<00:04:57.560> way<00:04:57.740> which<00:04:57.919> is<00:04:58.070> how<00:04:58.250> far<00:04:58.490> it's<00:04:58.640> supposed

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
that way which is how far it's supposed

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.990 
that way which is how far it's supposed
to<00:04:59.090> fire<00:04:59.410> when<00:05:00.410> I<00:05:00.440> did<00:05:00.800> the<00:05:01.010> calculating<00:05:01.730> of<00:05:01.790> it

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
to fire when I did the calculating of it

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.630 
to fire when I did the calculating of it
it<00:05:02.780> can<00:05:03.050> actually<00:05:03.260> recoil<00:05:03.860> back<00:05:04.040> and<00:05:04.340> it<00:05:04.460> can

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
it can actually recoil back and it can

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.330 
it can actually recoil back and it can
recoil<00:05:05.120> back<00:05:05.300> hard<00:05:05.890> sometimes<00:05:06.890> might<00:05:07.160> just

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
recoil back hard sometimes might just

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.530 
recoil back hard sometimes might just
knock<00:05:07.520> off<00:05:07.640> like<00:05:07.850> one<00:05:08.030> or<00:05:08.150> two<00:05:08.180> blocks

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
knock off like one or two blocks

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.000 
knock off like one or two blocks
sometimes<00:05:08.900> might<00:05:09.350> even<00:05:09.500> touch<00:05:09.740> it<00:05:09.770> all

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
sometimes might even touch it all

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.170 
sometimes might even touch it all
sometimes<00:05:10.490> I<00:05:10.580> might<00:05:10.669> destroy<00:05:10.970> the<00:05:11.060> whole

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
sometimes I might destroy the whole

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.840 
sometimes I might destroy the whole
cannon<00:05:11.540> that<00:05:12.230> that<00:05:12.590> is<00:05:12.830> something<00:05:13.160> that<00:05:13.340> is

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
cannon that that is something that is

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.120 
cannon that that is something that is
major<00:05:14.210> to<00:05:14.419> worry<00:05:14.600> about<00:05:14.810> it's<00:05:15.410> not<00:05:15.650> that<00:05:15.890> I<00:05:15.919> am

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
major to worry about it's not that I am

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.590 
major to worry about it's not that I am
bad<00:05:16.430> designing<00:05:16.910> this<00:05:16.970> I<00:05:17.150> spent<00:05:17.360> like<00:05:17.450> a<00:05:17.510> month

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
bad designing this I spent like a month

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.200 
bad designing this I spent like a month

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
for finding this I got advice from other

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.170 
for finding this I got advice from other
redstone<00:05:20.660> as<00:05:20.840> to<00:05:21.050> on<00:05:21.830> on<00:05:22.190> this<00:05:22.520> because<00:05:22.729> I<00:05:22.880> just

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
redstone as to on on this because I just

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.630 
redstone as to on on this because I just
want<00:05:23.360> this<00:05:23.450> to<00:05:23.510> be<00:05:23.660> as<00:05:23.930> good<00:05:24.260> as<00:05:24.440> possible<00:05:24.640> for

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
want this to be as good as possible for

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.780 
want this to be as good as possible for
the<00:05:25.760> sequel<00:05:26.150> but<00:05:26.390> that<00:05:26.600> is<00:05:26.780> still<00:05:27.370> still<00:05:28.370> it's

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
the sequel but that is still still it's

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.150 
the sequel but that is still still it's
still<00:05:29.030> impossible<00:05:29.360> to<00:05:29.780> get<00:05:29.930> this<00:05:30.080> to<00:05:30.290> be<00:05:30.440> to

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
still impossible to get this to be to

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.690 
still impossible to get this to be to
not<00:05:31.540> recall<00:05:32.540> back<00:05:32.750> it's<00:05:32.990> just<00:05:33.169> impossible

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
not recall back it's just impossible

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.170

literally impossible so that's one small

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.770 
literally impossible so that's one small
little<00:05:38.450> thing<00:05:38.650> but<00:05:39.650> anyway<00:05:39.890> ah<00:05:40.340> this<00:05:41.180> cannon

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780
