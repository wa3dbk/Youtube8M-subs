00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.120
 Welcome to 'The Magical Clock'! The YouTube series where you can learn everything about the history of Efteling. 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.480
 This time we are looking at one of the most hair-raising places in Efteling ... 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.154
 ... the Spookslot. 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.000
 After the opening of the fairy tale 'De Indische Waterlelies' in 1966 plans for more attractions soon come. 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.480
 Anton Pieck initially works out different ideas with combined attractions. 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.840
 From slides and a maze to a roller coaster with a ghost ruin. 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.420
 After years of hard work, it was decided to build the Spookslot. 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.220
 Ton van de Ven has since taken over the design baton. 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.900
 He shapes the attraction in sketches and test set-ups. 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.360
 At the end of 1975, Efteling started the gigantic project. 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:06.380
 For a long time, new techniques are used in-house to make the macabre effects, sounds and movements work optimally. 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.200
 A row of computers in the cellars of the Spookslot controls the show fully automatically from the start. 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.720
 More than 400,000 bricks, 800 m3 of concrete and 65 tons of steel are used for the structural work of the lock. 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.180
 In the decor, countless blocks of polystyrene have been processed into facades, tombstones and other horror attributes. 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.300
 The order and movements of all ghost players in the show are recorded in the computer. 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.540
 Ton van de Ven gives a number of colleagues a switch box. 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.800
 On his instructions they press buttons and bring the ghost appearances to life. 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.580
 The time has come on 10 May 1978. 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.140
 The black carpet is explained. 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.280
 Accompanied by gloomy music and a sinister spectacle ... 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.460
 ... the State Secretary for Economic Affairs will open the Spookslot. 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.520
 A large number of guests is led through a half-dark corridor with niches. 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.660
 There is much to see and hear. 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.020
 Vlederiken occasionally show their monstrous form in a dome hall. 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.720
 You pass an Eastern Spirit with a glass ball, after which you end up in the impressive main show. 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.940
 Here you can see how ghosts, monks, tombstones, gargoyles ... 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.620
 ... and other appearances perform a ghostly ballet ... 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.800
 ... to the music of 'Danse Macabre' by Camille Saint SaÃ«ns. 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.940
 *music* 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.400
 The television is used to draw wide attention to the Spookslot. 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.920
 Ton van de Ven is a guest at the popular talk show 'Voor de Vuist Weg' with Willem Duys. 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.380
 Singer Kate Bush records a TV special in the just completed Spookslot. 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.960
 The effect of all this attention can be clearly seen in the number of visitors in 1978. 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.460
 More than 300,000 guests are welcomed more than the year before. 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.940
 During the Winter Efteling, it also haunts outside the Spookslot. 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.160
 The Terrible Snowman resides in the well on the forecourt. 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.700
 And when evening falls you can see a chilling illusion in the passage next to the castle. 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.280
 The Spookslot has been frightening guests for more than 35 years. 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.800
 You are of course very welcome to experience the ghost spectacle yourself. 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.387
 At least if you dare.
