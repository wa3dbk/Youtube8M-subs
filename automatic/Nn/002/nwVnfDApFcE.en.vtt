00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.280
 Hello everyone, I am Allen. 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.140
 Today, everyone wants to introduce you as a prop for woodworking. 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.920
 Is this one the nail of the wood... is it a nail? 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.620
 Then this Japanese is called ダボ一

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.400
 Wood nails, it can be used mainly to make things between the wooden board and the wooden board. 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.280
 Two planks can tie it together 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.060
 So why do you want to do this? 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.440
 Because this size like this width is the kind that the hypermarket has already had a certain length that is cut. 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.120
 This kind of wood is very cheap. 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.360
 The length of about 3.6 meters is about 500 yuan, you can buy it. 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.900
 It can be put into a wooden board by this kind of wooden nail. 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.600
 This will be very convenient for us to do furniture and other things. 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.600
 Then we will actually try it for everyone now. 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.760
 What kind of peg is it? 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.940
 Ok, like we now want to combine these two boards together. 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.880
 You can use this electric screwdriver first to drill... a hole in which this wood nail is inserted. 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.920
 Then as for the wood nails, the main thing... this one sells the 6 (mm) 8 (mm) 10 (mm) and so on. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Then based on its Size, the size of the hole to be drilled is determined. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.120
 The one used today is the smallest peg of 6 (mm) 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.620
 Then now we use this 6 (mm) screwdriver head to drill holes 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.980
 As for how deep it is to drill, we can take this for a little. 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.540
 About...the amount...and then about half of the nail 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.940
 Then we can put it on this side with paper tape or other tape at this place. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.440
 Then come and make a reminder 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.060
 We will come to the actual drill now. 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.320
 We put two pieces of wood together 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.180
 The most important thing in this peg is that you have to measure well. 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.100
 Because you don’t measure it, it’s actually more troublesome later. 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.100
 So we have to determine the position to measure first. 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.500
 Then after we have measured it, we will first drill a hole in the wood. 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.940
 Then remember to be careful not to let it shake. 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.240
 Then drill a hole and it will look like this. 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.540
 Ok, we can try to insert it first. 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.200
 After plugging in, it will look like this 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.880
 Then the most troublesome part of drilling the nail is the problem of its amount of seats. 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.440
 How can you be right, then you won’t be able to drill down? 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.440
 For example, the kind of ups and downs 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.140
 There are also selling this kind of positioning props for the nails on the market. 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.520
 This is not very expensive 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.920
 Then how to use it like this? 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.140
 This is also the same kind of Size. What kind of dowels do you use? 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.040
 Now Allen is using 6 (mm). This is the 6mm (mm) positioning nail that I bought. 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.300
 Then as for its usage, it is the hole that was drilled just now. We put this positioning nail. 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.300
 Put this thing in it 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.420
 Because the relationship is also 6 (mm), Size is very just like this. 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.200
 As for how to use it, we will just put this thing in the first place. 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.520
 After putting the two planks together, it will be well combined. 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.100
 Gently tap a hammer 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.300
 When you pick it up, you can see that there is already a mark on the board. 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.300
 Is the use of our positioning nail 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.080
 Then we have this hole after it 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.300
 We can locate the same place in the same wood we just positioned and we will drill a hole in it. 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.260
 Then everyone can see that we can get two pieces of wood with two holes in the same place. 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.020
 As for how to pick it up? 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.880
 Let's try it first and put it in. 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.520
 After that, we put it in the hole again. 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.380
 Everyone can see that it is already very close to the feeling. 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.440
 This place then we look at its section and the section is also very flat 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.100
 There will be no such high and low problems 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.460
 Since we have to build a board, we have to drill a hole before and after. 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.900
 Then we have to drill another hole right now. 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.860
 Then because this hole Allen had already had a hole drilled here first 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.520
 We put the positioning pin here as well. 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.160
 Then make another mark in another place. 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.880
 Ok, there is a hole. 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.840
 Ok, so we can get two planks with the same hole in the upper and lower positions. 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.700
 Then we can put them together 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.540
 Turned into a wooden board 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.860
 Let's try it now. 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.900
 Ok, then we put it together again. 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.120
 Ok 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.600
 This will complete a piece of wood 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.220
 How is this one very useful? 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.840
 This kind of dowel is not very easy to use. 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.640
 Like this, we can make a relatively large-scale furniture with a cheaper price. 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.060
 Of course, you will need a tool when you link. 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.020
 After we have tried this, we have confirmed that there is no problem with its closeness. 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.780
 Then we will stick it up next 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.740
 How do you stick? We need to use this kind of woodworking glue for woodworking. 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.740
 Then how do you use it to stick it? 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.260
 First let's first squeeze a little white glue inside the hole. 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.940
 Like this, we squeezed white glue into both holes. 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.940
 Then we will put this one into it. 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.100
 Just complete this 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.220
 Then as for the other board, what do we have to do? 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.040
 Similarly, squeeze a little white glue into the two holes. 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:20.520
 Do you have 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.820
 After that, we also apply a little white glue between the boards to make it easy to fit. 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.140
 Like this, then we can plug it in as I just did 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.260
 Then at this time we can use a hammer and let it tap a little 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.280
 Let him close it. When choosing a hammer, be careful not to use a metal hammer. 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.780
 Will not hurt your wood 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.860
 Next we are waiting for its natural drying 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.340
 After drying, we will have a wider wooden board. 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.120
 This is how to use this one. 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.380
 Anyone who is interested may wish to try it for yourself. 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.240
 Ok, today, I will introduce you to the use of this raft. 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.720
 How to use this kind of dowel 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.760
 What do you think? 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.240
 Anyone who is interested may also try to do it by themselves. 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:09.580
 Use this kind of dowel to make use of cheaper wood and then join to make a larger board. 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.780
 Then the board can do some furniture. 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.120
 I feel very convenient 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.540
 If you are interested, you may wish to try it yourself. 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.540
 Use this kind of dowel to connect wood to make furniture噢

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.760
 Today, Allen Channel introduces you here. We will see you next time. 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.720
 The Allen Channel is mainly to introduce some unique cultures and things in Japan. 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.940
 And some of Alan’s own interests are like woodworking or cooking. 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.060
 Then everyone who is interested can also try to do it with Allen. 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:40.680
 In fact, there are some things. As long as you do it, you will find that in fact, this kind of thing can be done by everyone. 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.500
 Here is the person who is interested in Allen's login button. May wish to log in to Allen's channel. 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.500
 So today is the end of this, waiting for you.
