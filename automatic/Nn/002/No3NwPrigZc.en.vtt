00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 ronnie coleman reigned until 2000 5 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:08.280
 repeating the record for the fairies not and winning 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.380
 title eight times coleman lost title 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.759
 the man who came in time to shut up 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.770
 his loggia cutler injections clip I know 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.660
 always wanted to be someone significant 12 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.970
 For years, I watched magazines and there were photos 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.380
 Chris Dickerson and 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.240
 bodybuilder magazine my boyfriend 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.859
 sisters met my eyes i was 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.099
 just shocked by how it might look 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.130
 the body could not believe it before i 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.110
 saw superheroes batman and superman in 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.239
 cartoons but I've never seen anything 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.270
 like in real life such a figure 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.129
 which was the heroes of marvel i just didn't 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.590
 could believe that it really exists 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.629
 in real life and here I am from 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.190
 small town in usa my dream 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.010
 always had to come to california 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.829
 train among professionals 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.570
 but it was impossible thousands of the first 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.460
 year jay cutler li 2 did not beat ronnie 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.480
 but after that coleman won another 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.850
 several shoots 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.449
 then i knew i had something with 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.309
 i am better than ronnie 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.810
 than I surpassed him on Olympus 2 thousand 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.880
 first year I went to 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.240
 much better shape than before preparing 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.460
 to her for a whole year now i have 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.560
 fans who know that I was some kind 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.000
 being a loser in second place I was 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.830
 happy just in awe of 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.689
 received 2 place for me it was 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.670
 perhaps the greatest victory because 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.689
 i was actually competitive 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.950
 and many people thought the same and should 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.799
 win these competitions 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.570
 jay always came second second 2000 second 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.880
 he did not participate in mr olympia 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.450
 2 thousand five he was very close to 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.040
 first place I personally would give it to jay 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.920
 jay was absolutely disappointed so 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.070
 the result of 2 thousand five I feel 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.299
 that i match ronnie coleman in 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.799
 many poses including some from the back 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.310
 I never thought to improve 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.670
 so much so but he was still definitely 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.290
 on another level 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.740
 2 thousand sixth he finally overcame 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.890
 ronnie 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:08.810
 it was a competition between me and ronnie 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:12.380
 so many years i was the second behind him four 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.600
 times in a row so it was almost that 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.460
 competition between dj cutler 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.840
 and ronnie common them when i won and 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.940
 dropped the current champion who 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.190
 was going to win his ninth olympia 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.720
 he already had 8 wins there 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:34.130
 then a huge load fell from my shoulders after 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:36.590
 this jay won in 2 thousand seventh 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.959
 year and some people thought he was 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.920
 will continue to do it but then in 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.140
 2008 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.140
