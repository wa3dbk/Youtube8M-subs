00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.580
 hello friends welcome to a more home 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.799
 functional exercise my name is Jorge 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.770
 day and I invite you to follow us on 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:21.029
 facebook twitter youtube and internet today 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.940
 we have a very small exercise 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.800
 simple is to free up space here in 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.960
 the chest that happens many times 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.750
 we want to have our hand outstretched in 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.210
 Oviedo positions and we are 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.129
 struggling because we do not have enough 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.100
 range movement in this part of 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.170
 in front of the breastplate is where it is 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.020
 the problem what are we going to do a 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.930
 lacrosse ball we will place the 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.640
 ball let's free space that you 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.770
 I also when we are tense we understand 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.879
 to see the shoulder be a little bit turned 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.649
 forward 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.329
 if we manage to release a moment here the 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.870
 space will be more comfortable for 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.870
 we place the box what for 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.539
 what are we going to do, let's use the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.909
 ball the column and the weight of our 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.579
 own body 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.369
 now what I'm going to do I 'm going to place 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:11.940
 the ball in this part of what is the 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.070
 pectoral 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.940
 here in this corner and we are going to walk 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.860
 this distance first here and then here 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.320
 up here up 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.120
 the pectoral begins to be a kind of 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.600
 knot 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.850
 it is done that way is tied there that 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.380
 we also have to work we are going to 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.190
 start here below is a very genre 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:39.010
 simple you can place the ball sent 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.660
 my weight on top and I start to move 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.530
 obviously the arm of the ball of 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.760
 ahead 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.930
 back forward back 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.880
 I'm going up or down and they'll feel it 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:56.130
 here and it's where they're going to feel a bit of 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.360
 pain when I have a very inspector at 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.790
 are pulling my shoulders towards the 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.710
 front and they'll see that the thumbs the 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.020
 they have pointed towards the tunnels their 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.409
 sands 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:11.730
 then we want it to be in another what 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:15.720
 that I can not do about 20 times after 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.100
 the other little bit higher and we're going to 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.190
 clean this part 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.770
 so 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.920
 we raise the arm and then it is moving 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.900
 from side to side like this and back 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.650
 this along with some exercises 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.780
 stretching 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.000
 his name was very useful to release the 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.180
 space 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.560
 on one side is also traveling 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.560
 spaces this part 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.820
 if I get to see enough here is when 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.330
 have to remember the hashtag I hope 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:55.050
 this trick that will hurt in the soul 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:59.030
 but the results will like it 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:01.850
 to notice the difference 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.030
 how is this man a little bit more 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.410
 relaxed 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.410
 it's a little bit more back 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.890
 that this other is a little bit rotated but 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.360
 we have worked when a 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.099
 bar above the head for a 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.280
 function of men who will notice that 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:22.280
 it's easier to settle in and they can 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.010
 block more simple when the bar 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.010
 It is above 3 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.099
 is everything for today do not forget to follow us 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.200
 facebook twitter youtube and instagram and 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.840
 if they want to use the hashtag it's worse 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.239
 this one entered my name is Jorge DÃ­az and the 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.239
