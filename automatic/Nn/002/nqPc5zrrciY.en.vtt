00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240 

to<00:00:00.690> test<00:00:00.930> the<00:00:01.079> friend<00:00:01.380> relationship<00:00:02.040> between

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
to test the friend relationship between

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.910 
to test the friend relationship between
two<00:00:02.700> users<00:00:03.030> we're<00:00:03.840> going<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.110> be<00:00:04.230> manually

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
two users we're going to be manually

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.579 
two users we're going to be manually
inserting<00:00:05.609> records<00:00:06.089> into<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.480> database<00:00:06.990> to

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
inserting records into the database to

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.530 
inserting records into the database to
say<00:00:07.890> that<00:00:08.160> two<00:00:08.429> users<00:00:08.880> are<00:00:09.030> friends<00:00:09.360> with<00:00:09.480> each

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
say that two users are friends with each

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.660 
say that two users are friends with each
other<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.380> whether<00:00:10.620> they've<00:00:10.889> accepted<00:00:11.340> on

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
other and whether they've accepted on

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.240 
other and whether they've accepted on
our<00:00:11.880> but<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.690> first<00:00:13.049> step<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.559> creating<00:00:13.980> the

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
our but the first step is creating the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.480 
our but the first step is creating the
migration<00:00:14.969> for<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.299> friends<00:00:15.809> table<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.490> if

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
migration for the friends table and if

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.130 
migration for the friends table and if
we<00:00:17.640> just<00:00:17.789> open<00:00:17.910> up<00:00:18.150> our<00:00:18.270> database<00:00:19.340> client<00:00:20.340> here

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
we just open up our database client here

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.570 
we just open up our database client here
we<00:00:22.140> obviously<00:00:22.289> have<00:00:22.560> an<00:00:22.619> ID<00:00:22.830> for<00:00:23.130> each<00:00:23.250> user

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
we obviously have an ID for each user

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.120 
we obviously have an ID for each user
that's<00:00:23.880> obvious<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:25.170> our<00:00:25.289> friends<00:00:25.710> table

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
that's obvious so our friends table

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.519 
that's obvious so our friends table
needs<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.519> have<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.939> user<00:00:27.330> ID<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.930> friend<00:00:28.260> ID

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
needs to have a user ID and a friend ID

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.200 
needs to have a user ID and a friend ID
and<00:00:29.220> then<00:00:29.369> we're<00:00:29.460> gonna<00:00:29.550> have<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> boolean

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
and then we're gonna have a boolean

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.540 
and then we're gonna have a boolean
which<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.990> whether<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.439> other<00:00:31.800> friend<00:00:32.369> has

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
which is whether that other friend has

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.900 
which is whether that other friend has
accepted<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.649> will<00:00:34.649> create<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.340> logic<00:00:35.730> for

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
accepted and will create the logic for

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.959 
accepted and will create the logic for
this<00:00:36.059> within<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.480> user<00:00:36.750> model<00:00:37.140> later<00:00:37.969> so

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
this within the user model later so

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.330 
this within the user model later so
let's<00:00:39.450> go<00:00:39.780> ahead<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.079> generate<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.920> migration

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
let's go ahead and generate a migration

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.250 
let's go ahead and generate a migration
so<00:00:42.030> we're<00:00:42.210> gonna<00:00:42.329> do<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.600> same<00:00:42.809> thing<00:00:43.020> as<00:00:43.110> we

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
so we're gonna do the same thing as we

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.130 
so we're gonna do the same thing as we
did<00:00:43.440> when<00:00:43.710> we<00:00:43.969> migrated<00:00:44.969> or<00:00:45.750> created<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
did when we migrated or created the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.279 
did when we migrated or created the
migration<00:00:46.559> migration<00:00:47.190> for<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.730> users<00:00:48.030> table

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
migration migration for the users table

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.979 
migration migration for the users table
so<00:00:49.289> we<00:00:49.379> say<00:00:49.500> PHP<00:00:50.010> artisan<00:00:50.750> make<00:00:52.850> migration

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
so we say PHP artisan make migration

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.010 
so we say PHP artisan make migration
this<00:00:54.989> time<00:00:55.289> we're<00:00:55.530> creating<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.920> friends

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
this time we're creating the friends

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.340 
this time we're creating the friends
table<00:00:58.399> so<00:00:59.399> once<00:00:59.579> that's<00:00:59.730> created<00:01:00.300> head<00:01:01.140> over

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
table so once that's created head over

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.609 
table so once that's created head over
to<00:01:01.410> our<00:01:01.530> text<00:01:01.890> editor<00:01:01.949> over<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.879> database

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
to our text editor over to database

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:05.960 
to our text editor over to database
migrations<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.220> over<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> create

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
migrations and over to the create

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.480 
migrations and over to the create
friend's<00:01:06.360> table<00:01:06.689> migration<00:01:07.260> we<00:01:08.010> do<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> same

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
friend's table migration we do the same

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.920 
friend's table migration we do the same
thing<00:01:08.729> really<00:01:08.939> as<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.270> did<00:01:09.390> for<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.600> users

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
thing really as we did for the users

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.550 
thing really as we did for the users
table<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.799> at<00:01:10.860> least<00:01:11.070> use<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.430> schema<00:01:12.150> builder

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
table so at least use the schema builder

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.060 
table so at least use the schema builder
to<00:01:13.560> create<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.979> friends<00:01:14.310> table<00:01:15.770> about<00:01:16.770> call

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
to create the friends table about call

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.800 
to create the friends table about call
back<00:01:17.250> here<00:01:18.080> remember<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.229> type<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:20.130> blueprint

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
back here remember we type in blueprint

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.469 
back here remember we type in blueprint
and<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:21.960> our<00:01:22.080> table<00:01:22.549> variable<00:01:23.549> there<00:01:23.869> so<00:01:26.479> we

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
and have our table variable there so we

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.929 
and have our table variable there so we
don't<00:01:27.659> really<00:01:27.750> need<00:01:28.020> increments<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:29.009> here<00:01:29.310> as

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
don't really need increments on here as

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.060 
don't really need increments on here as
an<00:01:30.119> ID<00:01:30.290> but<00:01:31.290> we'll<00:01:31.500> keep<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:31.860> there<00:01:32.040> anyway

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
an ID but we'll keep it in there anyway

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.560 
an ID but we'll keep it in there anyway
and<00:01:32.840> we<00:01:33.840> are<00:01:34.110> going<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.650> have<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.400> user<00:01:36.030> ID<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.479> a

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
and we are going to have a user ID and a

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.450 
and we are going to have a user ID and a
friend<00:01:36.810> ID<00:01:37.049> these<00:01:37.500> are<00:01:37.680> both<00:01:37.950> going<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.280> be

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
friend ID these are both going to be

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.020 
friend ID these are both going to be
integers

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
integers

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.710 
integers
so<00:01:39.869> user<00:01:40.320> ID<00:01:40.729> and<00:01:42.950> friend<00:01:43.950> ID<00:01:44.460> now<00:01:45.360> obviously

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
so user ID and friend ID now obviously

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.359 
so user ID and friend ID now obviously
when<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:45.960> send<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.290> friend<00:01:46.500> request<00:01:46.530> we<00:01:47.040> need<00:01:47.220> to

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
when we send a friend request we need to

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.080 
when we send a friend request we need to
have<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.390> other<00:01:48.420> user<00:01:49.070> accept<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:51.000> we're

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
have the other user accept it so we're

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.399 
have the other user accept it so we're
gonna<00:01:51.180> have<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> boolean<00:01:51.689> here<00:01:52.229> which

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
gonna have a boolean here which

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.560 
gonna have a boolean here which
translates<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.130> tiny<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> database

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
translates to a tiny in in the database

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.410 
translates to a tiny in in the database
and<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:55.950> whether<00:01:56.460> they've<00:01:56.700> accepted<00:01:57.090> or

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
and that is whether they've accepted or

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.719 
and that is whether they've accepted or
not<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.840> we<00:01:58.469> can<00:01:58.590> go<00:01:58.710> ahead<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.250> add<00:01:59.549> our

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
not and we can go ahead and add our

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.679 
not and we can go ahead and add our
table<00:02:00.090> timestamps<00:02:01.079> as<00:02:01.200> usual<00:02:02.119> so<00:02:03.119> when<00:02:03.540> we

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
table timestamps as usual so when we

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.289 
table timestamps as usual so when we
reverse<00:02:04.439> or<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.799> rollback<00:02:05.280> or<00:02:05.790> reset

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
reverse or a rollback or reset

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.589 
reverse or a rollback or reset
migrations<00:02:06.930> we<00:02:07.860> want<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.129> do<00:02:08.250> here<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:09.090> drop

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
migrations we want to do here is drop

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.850 
migrations we want to do here is drop
that<00:02:10.050> friends<00:02:10.500> table<00:02:10.739> like<00:02:11.640> so

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
that friends table like so
