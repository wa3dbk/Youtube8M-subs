00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
a pretty interesting story and we

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.520 
a pretty interesting story and we
weren't<00:00:47.550> really<00:00:47.820> told<00:00:48.329> specifically<00:00:49.199> what

this<00:00:54.149> may<00:00:54.449> fill<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.839> some<00:00:55.019> of<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.140> gaps<00:00:55.350> that

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
this may fill in some of the gaps that

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.000 
this may fill in some of the gaps that
the<00:00:56.339> game<00:00:56.550> not<00:00:57.269> necessarily<00:00:58.079> failed<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:58.559> had
