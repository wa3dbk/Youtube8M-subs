circle<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.750> I'm<00:01:01.079> going<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.289> add<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> motion

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
circle and I'm going to add a motion

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.520 
circle and I'm going to add a motion
guide<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.699> right<00:01:03.660> away<00:01:03.840> what<00:01:04.049> what<00:01:04.320> should

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
be a guide layer now that guide layer

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.789 
be a guide layer now that guide layer
can<00:01:09.510> also<00:01:09.689> be<00:01:09.900> created<00:01:10.049> by<00:01:10.320> pressing<00:01:10.680> this

right<00:01:15.390> click<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.750> your<00:01:15.810> layer<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.439> know

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
right click on your layer so you know

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.370 
right click on your layer so you know
you<00:01:16.680> have<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.070> guide<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.549> proper<00:01:17.909> layer

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
you have the guide on the proper layer

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.740 
you have the guide on the proper layer
so<00:01:19.380> with<00:01:20.250> everything<00:01:20.490> selected<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.479> here

just going to go ahead and select the
pencil<00:01:23.340> tool<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.049> how<00:01:25.200> we

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
pencil tool this is the this is how we

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.890 
pencil tool this is the this is how we
draw<00:01:25.560> our<00:01:25.590> custom<00:01:26.130> path<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:27.000> can<00:01:27.180> use<00:01:27.330> them<00:01:27.600> I

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
draw our custom path you can use them I

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.359 
draw our custom path you can use them I
think<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.350> could<00:01:28.439> use<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.710> pen<00:01:28.920> tool<00:01:28.950> as<00:01:29.340> well

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
think you could use the pen tool as well

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.490 
think you could use the pen tool as well
and<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.240> can<00:01:30.299> also<00:01:30.509> use<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.840> line<00:01:31.079> tool<00:01:31.110> but

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
and you can also use the line tool but

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.080 
and you can also use the line tool but
it<00:01:31.619> does<00:01:31.770> kind<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.100> defeat<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.430> purpose<00:01:32.549> of

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
it does kind of defeat the purpose of

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.990 
it does kind of defeat the purpose of
this<00:01:33.479> custom<00:01:34.320> path<00:01:34.560> if<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:35.310> do<00:01:35.490> use<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.820> line

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
this custom path if you do use the line

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.490 
this custom path if you do use the line
tool<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.630> what<00:01:36.869> I'm<00:01:36.960> going<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.110> do<00:01:37.259> with<00:01:37.409> this

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
tool so what I'm going to do with this

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.880 
tool so what I'm going to do with this
pencil<00:01:37.920> tool<00:01:38.070> now<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.549> just<00:01:38.970> draw<00:01:39.210> out<00:01:39.479> a

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
pencil tool now is just draw out a

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.350 
pencil tool now is just draw out a
simple<00:01:40.890> path<00:01:41.280> I'm<00:01:41.610> just<00:01:41.759> drawing<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.000> squiggly

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
simple path I'm just drawing a squiggly

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.690 
simple path I'm just drawing a squiggly
line<00:01:42.659> here<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.590> will<00:01:43.829> be<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:43.979> path<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.549> this

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
line here that will be the path of this

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.880 
line here that will be the path of this
circle<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.240> circle<00:01:45.840> will<00:01:45.990> follow<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.649> path

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
circle that circle will follow the path

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.950 
circle that circle will follow the path
all<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.340> way<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.060> end<00:01:48.210> when<00:01:48.689> we<00:01:48.840> finish

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
all the way to the end when we finish

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.929 
all the way to the end when we finish
this<00:01:49.229> tutorial<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.399> now<00:01:50.579> what<00:01:50.700> I'm<00:01:50.790> going<00:01:50.880> to

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
this tutorial so now what I'm going to

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.120 
this tutorial so now what I'm going to
do<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.149> going<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.329> go<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.570> layer<00:01:52.020> 30<00:01:52.380> here<00:01:52.649> right

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
do is going to go to layer 30 here right

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.030 
do is going to go to layer 30 here right
click<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.640> I'm<00:01:53.729> going<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.880> insert<00:01:54.149> frame<00:01:55.040> not

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
click and I'm going to insert frame not

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.340 
click and I'm going to insert frame not
keyframe<00:01:56.579> but<00:01:56.729> insert<00:01:57.090> frame<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.719> what

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
keyframe but insert frame and what

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.039 
keyframe but insert frame and what
happens<00:01:58.710> now<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.329> that<00:02:00.329> line<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.659> we<00:02:00.899> just

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
happens now is that line that we just

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.889 
happens now is that line that we just
created<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.649> highlighted<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.729> we<00:02:03.509> do<00:02:03.689> have

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
created is highlighted and we do have

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.840 
created is highlighted and we do have
our<00:02:04.259> circle<00:02:04.890> obviously<00:02:05.250> it's<00:02:05.369> missing<00:02:05.640> but<00:02:05.759> we

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
our circle obviously it's missing but we

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.770 
our circle obviously it's missing but we
do<00:02:06.000> have<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.450> frame<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:08.149> you<00:02:09.149> know<00:02:09.239> frame<00:02:09.539> 30

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
do have a frame on you know frame 30

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.240 
do have a frame on you know frame 30
here<00:02:10.050> now<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.349> we<00:02:10.470> do<00:02:10.560> have<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.890> frame

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
here now so we do have that frame

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.630 
here now so we do have that frame
selected<00:02:11.640> and

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
selected and

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.480 
selected and
edited<00:02:13.420> for<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.410> guide<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:15.160> what<00:02:15.310> we're<00:02:15.400> going

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
edited for the guide so what we're going

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.010 
edited for the guide so what we're going
to<00:02:15.610> do<00:02:15.700> now<00:02:15.910> is<00:02:16.180> we're<00:02:16.360> going<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.600> go<00:02:16.690> back<00:02:16.840> to

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
to do now is we're going to go back to

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.920 
to do now is we're going to go back to
our<00:02:17.050> circle<00:02:18.040> layer<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.660> we're<00:02:19.660> just<00:02:19.780> going<00:02:19.900> to

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
our circle layer and we're just going to

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.760 
our circle layer and we're just going to
right-click<00:02:20.200> on<00:02:20.709> that<00:02:21.400> on<00:02:21.670> that<00:02:22.230> frame<00:02:23.230> 30<00:02:23.440> and

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
right-click on that on that frame 30 and

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.820 
right-click on that on that frame 30 and
insert<00:02:24.160> a<00:02:24.190> keyframe<00:02:24.490> this<00:02:25.000> time<00:02:25.240> and<00:02:25.830> we're

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
insert a keyframe this time and we're

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.630 
insert a keyframe this time and we're
going<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:26.980> go<00:02:27.160> ahead<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:27.910> select<00:02:28.300> our<00:02:28.690> circle

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
going to go ahead and select our circle

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.860 
going to go ahead and select our circle
and<00:02:30.640> we're<00:02:30.820> just<00:02:30.940> going<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.090> take<00:02:31.360> this<00:02:31.540> the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
and we're just going to take this the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.080 
and we're just going to take this the
middle<00:02:32.170> part<00:02:32.380> of<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.680> circle<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.310> you'll

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
middle part of that circle and you'll

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.260 
middle part of that circle and you'll
notice<00:02:34.390> how<00:02:34.540> it<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:34.930> sort<00:02:35.200> of<00:02:35.610> snaps<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.940> our

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
notice how it it sort of snaps to our

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.430 
notice how it it sort of snaps to our
guide<00:02:37.570> and<00:02:37.870> what<00:02:37.990> we're<00:02:38.110> going<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.320> do<00:02:38.380> is

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
guide and what we're going to do is

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.140 
guide and what we're going to do is
we're<00:02:38.560> going<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.709> follow<00:02:39.070> along<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.850> line

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
we're going to follow along that line

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.920 
we're going to follow along that line
that<00:02:40.450> we<00:02:40.989> created<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:43.150> right<00:02:43.300> to<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.569> end<00:02:43.660> and

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
that we created it right to the end and

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.170 
that we created it right to the end and
now<00:02:44.230> that<00:02:44.470> motion<00:02:44.890> has<00:02:45.190> been<00:02:45.220> selected<00:02:45.970> for

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
now that motion has been selected for

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.390 
now that motion has been selected for
that<00:02:46.390> key<00:02:46.630> frame<00:02:46.930> right<00:02:47.170> there<00:02:47.230> on<00:02:47.620> frame<00:02:48.130> 30

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
that key frame right there on frame 30

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.010 
that key frame right there on frame 30
so<00:02:49.300> now<00:02:49.420> we're<00:02:49.570> going<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:49.750> do<00:02:49.810> is<00:02:49.870> we're<00:02:49.959> gonna

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
so now we're going to do is we're gonna

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.920 
so now we're going to do is we're gonna
go<00:02:50.140> back<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.590> our<00:02:50.800> first<00:02:51.370> frame<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:51.900> make<00:02:52.900> sure

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
go back to our first frame and make sure

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.320 
go back to our first frame and make sure
it's<00:02:53.350> in<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.980> starting<00:02:54.340> position<00:02:54.430> as<00:02:54.880> is<00:02:55.090> here

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
it's in the starting position as is here

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.640 
it's in the starting position as is here
and<00:02:55.720> we're<00:02:55.840> just<00:02:55.900> gonna<00:02:56.050> right<00:02:56.230> click<00:02:56.260> and

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
and we're just gonna right click and

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.860 
and we're just gonna right click and
create<00:02:56.830> motion<00:02:57.130> tween<00:02:57.489> and<00:02:57.730> what<00:02:58.510> we've<00:02:58.660> done

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
create motion tween and what we've done

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.160 
create motion tween and what we've done
now<00:02:59.110> is<00:02:59.140> we've<00:02:59.470> created<00:02:59.709> a<00:03:00.640> motion<00:03:01.360> tween<00:03:01.480> for

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
now is we've created a motion tween for

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.860 
now is we've created a motion tween for
this<00:03:02.290> circle<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.860> go<00:03:03.040> along<00:03:03.340> this<00:03:03.580> path<00:03:03.880> so

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
this circle to go along this path so

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.710 
this circle to go along this path so
let's<00:03:05.320> watch<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.800> movie<00:03:05.950> here<00:03:06.570> you'll<00:03:07.570> notice

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
let's watch the movie here you'll notice

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.460 
let's watch the movie here you'll notice
that<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.290> path<00:03:08.500> is<00:03:08.739> now<00:03:08.920> being<00:03:09.130> followed<00:03:09.459> as

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
that the path is now being followed as

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.990 
that the path is now being followed as
such<00:03:11.470> so<00:03:11.980> that's<00:03:12.220> pretty<00:03:12.430> much<00:03:12.580> all<00:03:12.760> i'm<00:03:12.880> going

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
such so that's pretty much all i'm going

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.160 
such so that's pretty much all i'm going
to<00:03:13.060> show<00:03:13.239> you<00:03:13.269> there<00:03:13.510> that's<00:03:13.690> all<00:03:13.840> you<00:03:13.930> need<00:03:14.080> to
