00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.440
 after she installs the photo gallery 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.769
 you also want to know how 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.500
 Pictures a smaller one 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.690
 knows the photogenic 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.700
 certainly not a program with you 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.460
 can emit professional pictures 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.320
 but for home use she represents the 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.259
 main features available 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.500
 Let us, for example, take this picture 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.600
 open here from the rhine by motorboat 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.239
 if I double click on the picture 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.940
 it will be here in the edit view 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.890
 open 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.840
 you can then edit to the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.140
 example also create a copy or 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.480
 work directly on this picture like 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.909
 you can already see them before 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.510
 in the normal photo view the picture 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.480
 rotate 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.399
 that is still very unsettling her 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.530
 but you can do that automatically too 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.269
 customize feature then try 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.990
 the photo gallery the picture right now 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.280
 move back and improve the colors 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.200
 if you do not want that, you can 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.630
 but they also undo 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:10.080
 You can also change the settings for 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.170
 change automatically if you change them 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.479
 the automatic feature does not like it 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.640
 you can crop the picture by cutting it 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.380
 to cut any you see here 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.960
 then results in a frame 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.610
 for example , they could do this down here 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.510
 cut off ugly barrier tape 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.270
 you can leave there in the tree we left 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.310
 above we leave the picture but also one 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.860
 on the right could also be the building 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.860
 remove so if you then 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.310
 Click here for walls so you will find them 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.440
 these options under the small 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.630
 black arrow down too fast 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.830
 Apply then you will see the picture became 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.380
 tailored to fit 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.710
 In addition, they can also do the 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.240
 change proportions of the image if you like 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.960
 for example, know exactly that the 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.830
 can order prints in the format 13 218 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.500
 you should adapt the picture to it 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.300
 people have taken pictures and are up 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.160
 the photo through the lightning red eyes 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.400
 You could have surrendered this here 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.500
 In addition, they can reduce over 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.110
 Alignment the picture in his 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.640
 change alignment so tilt and 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.440
 tend 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.440
 retouching function gives them the 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.600
 possibility of individual inaccuracies in the 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.840
 image to fix or 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.700
 also partially remove objects if 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.580
 they frame the unwanted 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.290
 The system tries to pull this object 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.600
 to reduce the object 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.300
 as you can see, you can still do it 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.209
 if you know where the flagpole was 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.190
 but guessing for a 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.270
 it's actually an automatic feature 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.940
 not that bad 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.210
 furthermore they can undo the 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.580
 Undo change at any time 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.830
 should you have a picture that at night 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.680
 was recorded and very strong 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.690
 be so noisy this huge 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.090
 then they can show over 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.290
 Noise reduction try the effect too 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.989
 Reduce 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.840
 over color you can color adjustments 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.280
 for example, fix color castings or 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.439
 deliberately introduce 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.670
 for example that the picture is a bit older 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:24.200
 acts or suggest a color cast 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.000
 overexposure when you take the picture off 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.000
 darken or lighten 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.090
 a vote will give you extra 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.310
 still the possibility this whole 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.380
 to apply features finer 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.720
 but should not give them something 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.850
 like it said when you are on the 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.550
 Reset button to original reset 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:47.760
 then the photo is reset 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.230
 under effects you will find some foto fw 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.770
 For example, there was one here 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.450
 black and white filter or a sepia the 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.600
 the picture looks old 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:01.080
 or here something like a bluish cast 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.170
 almost like a negative one 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.990
 orange filter so some photos 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.850
 gadgets and for that we with the 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.590
 photo had started not from now times 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.370
 quickly reset I find that 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.560
 not bad at all 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.979
 In addition, there are under create 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.560
 even more options for example 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:24.110
 if you create the photo over as 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.150
 Use desktop background you can 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.430
 order prints online you can 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.979
 send by e-mail you can send one 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.750
 film from her photos make one 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.550
 Slideshow then, for example, on 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.280
 a dvd can burn or ins 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:41.150
 Internet sites and you can see your picture 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.610
 on skydrive facebook youtube flickr like 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.720
 medio or via windows live 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.430
 publish 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.790
 beyond that, there are more 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:54.540
 Tools available for download for 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.640
 for example a panorama tour or also 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.190
 other improvement and optimization 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.510
 tools clique just a moment after that 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.670
 Imagine what you can do here 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:07.170
 For example, you can download a tool 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:11.009
 for car collages or photos 5 foto mustard 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:14.779
 can produce three-dimensional panoramas 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:17.129
 and as I said a panorama tool 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:19.559
 but they should be on all plugins 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:23.600
 then you get an overview 

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:24.860
 about all available plugins 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.320
 so if you have more 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.910
 then look for design options 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.100
 You will find here 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.440
 and can these download this 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:37.240
 also free of charge and the photo gallery 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.240
 even add functions 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.030
 they have worked enough then they can 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.969
 close here under edit file 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.039
 return to the view again and 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:49.169
 select other pictures or 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.800
 continue with the sorting of the 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.080
 images 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.840
 if you put up in this view 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.039
 then you will find it here too 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.870
 panorama feature photo fusion 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:04.720
 automatic collages and again 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.970
 more tools the panorama feature 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.240
 works really great so 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.310
 For example, if you have five or six pictures of one 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.560
 make landscape from left to right 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.680
 or right to left you have this 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.990
 only select images 3 after click to 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.469
 you the shift key so the 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:26.560
 Shift and then the first and the 

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:29.449
 Last picture for example here the flowers 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.219
 up over here 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:33.229
 Unfortunately, I do not have any here yet 

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:33.830
 otherwise I could give them that 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:36.559
 demonstrate 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.479
 then click panorama panorama 

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:40.719
 create and then these pictures 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:44.300
 assembled to a panorama 

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:46.039
 foto fusion is also a great tool like 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.620
 already described here you can use it 

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:51.139
 merge two or more photos together 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.430
 to create an ideal picture 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:54.559
 they will ask themselves what does it matter 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.240
 a sense, therefore, imagine them 

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:58.999
 make a group picture of one 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.159
 birthday company anyone has 

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:03.289
 always close your eyes if you but three 

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:05.749
 or four birthday pictures 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:08.689
 put together then comes in the end 

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:10.939
 In any case, a picture at the 

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:14.040
 all eyes open friendly 

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:16.380
 look and smile at the camera 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.390
 So as I said the live photo gallery 

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.520
 offers many features 

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.230
 you can edit great pictures with it 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.170
 and for being free 

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:27.090
 actually a great tool and me 

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.130
 use it really the most 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.470
 cases where i find another tool 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.120
 need for example photoshop 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:37.190
 essentials or something in the 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.190
 direction are really very rare
