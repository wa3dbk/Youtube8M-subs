00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
instead another thing that I did in the

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.410 
instead another thing that I did in the
first<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.770> one<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.310> used<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.610> soak<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.149> blade

what<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.110> looks<00:02:13.319> like<00:02:13.440> so<00:02:15.200> this<00:02:16.200> is<00:02:16.440> my

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
what that looks like so this is my

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.199 
what that looks like so this is my
rusted<00:02:18.800> nutribullet<00:02:19.800> umm<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:21.780> also

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
rusted nutribullet umm I also

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.110 
rusted nutribullet umm I also
experienced<00:02:24.209> some<00:02:24.890> getting<00:02:25.890> food<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.490> liquid

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
experienced some getting food and liquid

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.870 
experienced some getting food and liquid
sometimes<00:02:27.720> in<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.170> base<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.739> I<00:02:29.280> kind<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.700> wish

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
sometimes in the base and I kind of wish

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.000 
sometimes in the base and I kind of wish
they<00:02:30.090> had<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.330> shield<00:02:30.780> on<00:02:30.959> top<00:02:31.020> so<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.590> could<00:02:31.830> take

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
they had a shield on top so I could take

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.370 
they had a shield on top so I could take
that<00:02:32.280> shield<00:02:32.640> out<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:33.090> clean<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:34.050> would<00:02:34.170> make

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
that shield out and clean it would make

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.670 
that shield out and clean it would make
things<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.770> lot<00:02:34.950> easier<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:36.420> I'm<00:02:37.200> hoping<00:02:37.560> in

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
things a lot easier and I'm hoping in

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.530 
things a lot easier and I'm hoping in
the<00:02:37.800> future<00:02:37.830> that<00:02:38.280> they<00:02:38.489> have<00:02:38.670> options<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.300> buy

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
the future that they have options to buy

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.720 
the future that they have options to buy
glass<00:02:39.900> cups<00:02:40.319> as<00:02:40.590> opposed<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:40.920> plastic<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.670> know

the<00:02:41.970> plastic<00:02:42.390> is<00:02:42.480> supposed<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.780> be<00:02:42.959> safe<00:02:43.200> but<00:02:43.440> I

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
the plastic is supposed to be safe but I

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.160 
the plastic is supposed to be safe but I
personally<00:02:44.130> do<00:02:44.340> not<00:02:44.519> use<00:02:44.790> plastic<00:02:45.000> unless<00:02:45.930> I

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
personally do not use plastic unless I

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.150 
personally do not use plastic unless I
have<00:02:46.620> to

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160
