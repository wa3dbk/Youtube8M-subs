so<00:00:14.620> our<00:00:14.740> asparagus<00:00:15.130> is<00:00:15.520> planted<00:00:16.000> we've

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.510 
so our asparagus is planted we've

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.780 
so our asparagus is planted we've
covered<00:00:16.810> them<00:00:17.050> up<00:00:17.200> and<00:00:18.100> now<00:00:18.279> we<00:00:18.340> need<00:00:18.640> to<00:00:18.670> think

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:18.790 
covered them up and now we need to think

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.340 
covered them up and now we need to think
about<00:00:19.029> how<00:00:19.360> we're<00:00:19.510> going<00:00:19.630> to<00:00:19.690> care<00:00:19.960> for<00:00:20.170> them

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.350 
about how we're going to care for them

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.530 
about how we're going to care for them
during<00:00:20.650> the<00:00:20.770> first<00:00:21.010> several<00:00:21.490> years<00:00:21.670> what

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540 
during the first several years what

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.269 
during the first several years what
we're<00:00:22.689> interested<00:00:23.050> in<00:00:23.439> doing<00:00:23.500> is<00:00:23.860> having<00:00:24.099> the

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
we're interested in doing is having the

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.749 
we're interested in doing is having the
plants<00:00:24.820> become<00:00:25.119> well<00:00:25.450> established<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:27.160> we

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
plants become well established so we

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.220 
plants become well established so we
want<00:00:27.970> to<00:00:28.060> make<00:00:28.210> sure<00:00:28.240> we<00:00:28.509> give<00:00:28.689> them<00:00:28.779> plenty<00:00:29.050> of

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
want to make sure we give them plenty of

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.620 
want to make sure we give them plenty of
water<00:00:29.550> asparagus<00:00:30.550> is<00:00:30.790> going<00:00:31.000> to<00:00:31.060> need<00:00:31.270> about

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
water asparagus is going to need about

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.170 
water asparagus is going to need about
one<00:00:32.020> inch<00:00:32.200> of<00:00:32.380> water<00:00:32.410> per<00:00:32.920> week<00:00:32.950> so<00:00:33.880> if<00:00:34.030> it

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
one inch of water per week so if it

one inch of water per week so if it
rains<00:00:34.480> fine<00:00:35.079> if<00:00:35.380> it<00:00:35.500> doesn't<00:00:35.860> rain<00:00:36.040> you<00:00:36.670> need

to get out there and irrigate them we

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.900 
to get out there and irrigate them we
also<00:00:40.690> want<00:00:41.050> to<00:00:41.140> keep<00:00:41.320> all<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.649> weeds<00:00:41.890> down<00:00:42.250> as

also want to keep all the weeds down as
I<00:00:43.090> said<00:00:43.329> before<00:00:43.510> asparagus<00:00:44.380> is<00:00:44.680> not<00:00:44.980> a<00:00:45.010> very

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
I said before asparagus is not a very

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.119 
I said before asparagus is not a very
good<00:00:45.520> competitor<00:00:46.170> competitor<00:00:47.170> of<00:00:47.440> weeds<00:00:47.829> and

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
good competitor competitor of weeds and

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.220 
good competitor competitor of weeds and
so<00:00:48.789> we<00:00:48.940> want<00:00:49.090> to<00:00:49.179> keep<00:00:49.359> this<00:00:49.570> area<00:00:49.780> clean

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
so we want to keep this area clean

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.079 
so we want to keep this area clean
cultivated<00:00:50.920> at<00:00:51.340> least<00:00:51.609> for<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:51.910> first

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
retain moisture in the soil is we can

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.369 
retain moisture in the soil is we can
use<00:01:00.160> some<00:01:00.429> sort<00:01:00.670> of<00:01:00.760> mulch<00:01:01.030> we<00:01:01.780> new<00:01:01.960> straw

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
use some sort of mulch we new straw

use some sort of mulch we new straw

like<00:01:05.800> that<00:01:06.120> but<00:01:07.120> you<00:01:07.180> want<00:01:07.600> to<00:01:07.780> consider<00:01:08.290> that

like that but you want to consider that

like that but you want to consider that
what<00:01:09.010> you<00:01:09.220> use<00:01:09.490> could<00:01:10.000> impact<00:01:10.510> any<00:01:10.870> of<00:01:11.080> your

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
you are going to mulch with an organic

you are going to mulch with an organic
mulch<00:01:16.180> straw<00:01:16.900> mulch<00:01:17.170> would<00:01:17.440> be<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.710> preferred

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
mulch straw mulch would be the preferred

mulch straw mulch would be the preferred

thing to use to keep the weeds do
typically<00:01:22.869> we're<00:01:23.560> going<00:01:23.710> to<00:01:23.770> wait<00:01:24.040> to<00:01:24.280> mulch

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
typically we're going to wait to mulch

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.999 
typically we're going to wait to mulch
until<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.720> spears<00:01:26.200> start<00:01:26.560> to<00:01:26.710> emerge

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
until the spears start to emerge

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.170 
until the spears start to emerge
especially<00:01:27.939> in<00:01:28.180> a<00:01:28.360> newly<00:01:29.140> planted<00:01:29.350> asparagus

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
especially in a newly planted asparagus

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.850 
especially in a newly planted asparagus
but<00:01:31.180> if<00:01:31.390> you<00:01:31.659> put<00:01:31.899> your<00:01:32.020> mulch<00:01:32.290> layer<00:01:32.560> down

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
but if you put your mulch layer down

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.999 
but if you put your mulch layer down
thinly<00:01:33.490> that<00:01:34.090> we<00:01:34.540> can<00:01:34.719> go<00:01:34.869> ahead<00:01:34.990> and<00:01:35.290> mulch<00:01:35.710> at

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
thinly that we can go ahead and mulch at

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.440 
thinly that we can go ahead and mulch at
the<00:01:36.189> beginning<00:01:36.490> of<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.790> year<00:01:36.969> right<00:01:37.270> after

the beginning of the year right after

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.080 
the beginning of the year right after
planting<00:01:38.110> and<00:01:38.290> just<00:01:38.979> continue<00:01:39.460> to<00:01:39.490> add<00:01:39.640> some

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
planting and just continue to add some

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.090 
planting and just continue to add some
more<00:01:40.299> straw<00:01:40.689> as<00:01:40.960> we<00:01:41.530> get<00:01:41.680> more<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:42.040> more

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
more straw as we get more and more

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.660 
more straw as we get more and more
Spears<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.909> emerge<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:45.070> we're<00:01:45.219> going<00:01:45.369> to<00:01:45.430> place

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
Spears to emerge so we're going to place

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.560 
Spears to emerge so we're going to place
the<00:01:45.909> straw<00:01:47.340> fairly<00:01:48.340> loosely<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:51.270> not<00:01:52.270> very

the straw fairly loosely and not very

00:01:52.570 --> 00:02:04.990 
the straw fairly loosely and not very
deep<00:01:54.840> right<00:01:55.840> over<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.350> bed

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.330 

and<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.210> will<00:02:06.390> serve<00:02:06.660> as<00:02:06.690> an<00:02:07.590> effective<00:02:08.010> weed

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
and this will serve as an effective weed

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.030 
and this will serve as an effective weed
barrier<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:09.000> help<00:02:09.480> hold<00:02:09.660> moisture<00:02:09.990> in<00:02:10.470> around

those<00:02:11.220> crowns<00:02:11.610> with<00:02:12.510> asparagus<00:02:13.110> we're

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
those crowns with asparagus we're

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.490 
those crowns with asparagus we're
interested<00:02:14.100> in<00:02:14.540> expanding<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.930> size<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.380> that

interested in expanding the size of that

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.310 
interested in expanding the size of that
crown<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.820> we're<00:02:18.030> not<00:02:18.240> going<00:02:18.570> to<00:02:18.600> harvest<00:02:19.050> in

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
crown so we're not going to harvest in

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.980 
crown so we're not going to harvest in
the<00:02:19.830> first<00:02:20.160> year<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:21.090> we<00:02:21.270> plant<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.720> Crown's

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
the first year that we plant the Crown's

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.930 
the first year that we plant the Crown's
the<00:02:22.680> second<00:02:23.130> year<00:02:23.340> we're<00:02:23.520> not<00:02:23.700> going<00:02:23.910> to

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
the second year we're not going to

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.120 
the second year we're not going to
harvest<00:02:24.330> any<00:02:24.600> kraut<00:02:24.900> any<00:02:25.200> Spears<00:02:25.770> at<00:02:25.980> all
