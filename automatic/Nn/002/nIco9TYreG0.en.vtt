you<00:01:51.299> take<00:01:51.569> each<00:01:51.749> of<00:01:51.929> the<00:01:52.020> four<00:01:52.350> corners<00:01:53.100> and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
you take each of the four corners and

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:07.120 
you take each of the four corners and
pull<00:01:53.729> towards<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.270> center

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.200 

then<00:02:08.130> we're<00:02:08.520> gonna<00:02:08.640> go<00:02:08.820> ahead<00:02:08.850> and<00:02:09.000> open

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
then we're gonna go ahead and open

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.690 
then we're gonna go ahead and open
things<00:02:09.600> up<00:02:09.750> for<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:10.050> second<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.619> just<00:02:11.310> fold

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
things up for a second and just fold

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.600 
things up for a second and just fold
each<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.210> the<00:02:12.330> tips<00:02:12.740> towards<00:02:13.740> that<00:02:14.010> first<00:02:14.310> line

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
each of the tips towards that first line

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.810 
each of the tips towards that first line
we<00:02:14.850> made<00:02:15.030> go<00:02:15.690> around<00:02:15.930> do<00:02:16.800> this<00:02:16.980> all<00:02:17.220> four<00:02:17.550> times

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
we made go around do this all four times

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.600 
we made go around do this all four times
this<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.540> such<00:02:18.780> an<00:02:18.960> easy<00:02:19.200> fun<00:02:19.770> origami<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.490> do

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
this is such an easy fun origami to do

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.100 
this is such an easy fun origami to do
because<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:21.060> can<00:02:21.090> do<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:21.510> when<00:02:21.690> you're<00:02:21.840> just

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
because you can do this when you're just

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.290 
because you can do this when you're just
starting<00:02:22.350> out<00:02:22.620> really<00:02:22.980> get<00:02:23.910> all<00:02:24.000> four<00:02:24.270> of

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
starting out really get all four of

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.810 
starting out really get all four of
these<00:02:24.510> fold<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:24.960> up<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:27.410> then<00:02:28.410> fold<00:02:29.070> back<00:02:29.370> over

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
these fold it up and then fold back over

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.700 
these fold it up and then fold back over
on<00:02:30.030> those<00:02:30.270> creases<00:02:30.690> we<00:02:31.020> made<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.500> end<00:02:31.650> up

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
on those creases we made you end up

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.690 
on those creases we made you end up
getting<00:02:31.800> something<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.280> kind<00:02:32.520> of<00:02:32.550> looks

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
getting something that kind of looks

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.940 
getting something that kind of looks
like<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.850> picture<00:02:33.330> frame

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
like a picture frame

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.140 
like a picture frame
flip<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.100> over<00:02:35.220> make<00:02:35.670> sure<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.880> keep<00:02:36.000> all

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
flip it over make sure you keep all

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.360 
flip it over make sure you keep all
those<00:02:36.360> flaps<00:02:36.990> underneath<00:02:37.500> nice<00:02:37.770> and<00:02:38.070> smooth

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
those flaps underneath nice and smooth

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.400 
those flaps underneath nice and smooth
and<00:02:38.790> then<00:02:39.209> I'm<00:02:39.330> just<00:02:39.480> gonna<00:02:39.630> repeat<00:02:40.110> that

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
and then I'm just gonna repeat that

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.250 
and then I'm just gonna repeat that
blintz<00:02:40.950> base<00:02:41.040> by<00:02:41.550> folding<00:02:41.970> up<00:02:42.120> again<00:02:42.810> towards

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
blintz base by folding up again towards

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260 
blintz base by folding up again towards
the<00:02:43.440> center<00:02:43.830> you<00:02:44.610> should<00:02:44.790> see<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.000> little

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
the center you should see that little

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:52.310 
the center you should see that little
white<00:02:45.450> crease<00:02:45.870> from<00:02:46.320> underneath<00:02:51.170> get<00:02:52.170> all

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
white crease from underneath get all

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:59.600 
white crease from underneath get all
four<00:02:52.739> sides<00:02:53.010> folded<00:02:53.489> up<00:02:57.800> then<00:02:58.800> once<00:02:59.430> you've

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
four sides folded up then once you've

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.550 
four sides folded up then once you've
finished<00:02:59.790> that<00:03:00.150> open<00:03:00.600> things<00:03:00.840> up<00:03:01.020> and<00:03:01.290> do<00:03:01.440> the

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
finished that open things up and do the

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.410 
finished that open things up and do the
same<00:03:01.770> thing<00:03:02.070> again<00:03:02.220> we're<00:03:02.640> gonna<00:03:02.700> fold<00:03:03.030> up<00:03:03.239> to

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
same thing again we're gonna fold up to

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.570 
same thing again we're gonna fold up to
that<00:03:03.570> first<00:03:03.750> crease<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:05.010> you're<00:03:05.130> basically

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
that first crease so you're basically

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.920 
that first crease so you're basically
doing<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.180> same<00:03:06.209> steps<00:03:06.750> twice<00:03:08.570> by<00:03:09.570> first

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
doing the same steps twice by first

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.560 
doing the same steps twice by first
doing<00:03:10.320> one<00:03:10.590> way<00:03:10.769> and<00:03:11.100> then<00:03:11.730> going<00:03:11.910> again<00:03:12.300> at

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
doing one way and then going again at

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.479 
doing one way and then going again at
the<00:03:12.690> smaller<00:03:13.019> stage<00:03:13.500> as<00:03:13.709> well<00:03:16.250> return<00:03:17.250> these

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
the smaller stage as well return these

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.250 
the smaller stage as well return these
flaps<00:03:17.820> to<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.120> center<00:03:18.600> so<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.019> end<00:03:19.200> up

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
flaps to the center so that you end up

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.660 
flaps to the center so that you end up
getting<00:03:19.410> something<00:03:19.799> again<00:03:20.220> that<00:03:20.250> looks<00:03:20.549> like

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
getting something again that looks like

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.660 
getting something again that looks like
a<00:03:20.700> frame<00:03:21.290> flip<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.410> over<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.830> what<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:23.489> should

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
a frame flip it over and what you should

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.259 
a frame flip it over and what you should
see<00:03:23.700> are<00:03:23.970> these<00:03:24.150> four<00:03:24.570> corners<00:03:25.320> here<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:26.340> what

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
see are these four corners here and what

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.940 
see are these four corners here and what
I<00:03:27.299> want<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.600> do<00:03:27.750> is<00:03:27.900> I'm<00:03:28.049> just<00:03:28.080> gonna<00:03:28.320> start<00:03:28.739> off

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
I want to do is I'm just gonna start off

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.460 
I want to do is I'm just gonna start off
by<00:03:28.980> opening<00:03:29.790> two<00:03:30.120> opposite<00:03:30.810> sides<00:03:30.840> here<00:03:31.350> if

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
by opening two opposite sides here if

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.229 
by opening two opposite sides here if
I'm<00:03:31.620> looking<00:03:31.739> at<00:03:31.950> it<00:03:32.010> like<00:03:32.100> a<00:03:32.220> triangle<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:32.940> go

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
I'm looking at it like a triangle and go

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.970 
I'm looking at it like a triangle and go
ahead<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.600> pinch<00:03:33.959> it<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:34.350> fold<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.799> in<00:03:34.950> half

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
ahead and pinch it and fold it in half

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.150 
ahead and pinch it and fold it in half
and<00:03:35.610> make<00:03:35.900> sure<00:03:36.900> your<00:03:37.200> creases<00:03:37.650> work<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:38.100> you

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
and make sure your creases work and you

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.460 
and make sure your creases work and you
can<00:03:38.310> get<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.489> good<00:03:38.730> edge<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.540> be<00:03:40.140> careful

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
can get a good edge and be careful

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.080 
can get a good edge and be careful
because<00:03:40.530> sometimes<00:03:40.830> these<00:03:41.220> little<00:03:41.489> flaps<00:03:41.730> pop

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
because sometimes these little flaps pop

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.930 
because sometimes these little flaps pop
out<00:03:42.299> make<00:03:42.570> sure<00:03:42.750> they<00:03:42.900> stay<00:03:42.959> underneath<00:03:43.940> so

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
out make sure they stay underneath so

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.520 
out make sure they stay underneath so
that<00:03:45.090> you<00:03:45.180> can<00:03:45.360> get<00:03:45.510> this<00:03:45.630> nice<00:03:45.900> smoothed<00:03:46.350> out

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
that you can get this nice smoothed out

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.520 
that you can get this nice smoothed out
piece<00:03:47.360> then<00:03:48.360> I'm<00:03:48.480> gonna<00:03:48.660> go<00:03:48.840> ahead<00:03:48.959> and<00:03:49.320> do<00:03:49.410> the

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
piece then I'm gonna go ahead and do the

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.140 
piece then I'm gonna go ahead and do the
same<00:03:49.709> thing<00:03:49.980> going<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.310> other<00:03:50.340> way<00:03:50.580> so<00:03:50.730> I<00:03:51.090> can

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
same thing going the other way so I can

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.470 
same thing going the other way so I can
get<00:03:51.420> in<00:03:51.570> here<00:03:51.930> get<00:03:52.739> these<00:03:52.950> flaps<00:03:53.310> opened<00:03:53.820> and

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
get in here get these flaps opened and

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.810 
get in here get these flaps opened and
just<00:03:54.660> try<00:03:54.959> to<00:03:55.019> get<00:03:55.440> this<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.799> fold<00:03:56.130> in<00:03:56.340> one<00:03:56.549> time

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
just try to get this to fold in one time

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.710 
just try to get this to fold in one time
to<00:03:57.440> again<00:03:58.440> just<00:03:58.470> make<00:03:58.890> sure<00:03:58.920> that<00:03:59.720> these

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
to again just make sure that these

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.570 
to again just make sure that these
little<00:04:00.989> tabs<00:04:01.320> standar<00:04:01.980> Neath<00:04:02.130> when<00:04:02.370> you<00:04:02.459> do

that once you get both of those creases

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.720 
that once you get both of those creases
going<00:04:07.019> then<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:07.919> can<00:04:08.070> kind<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.280> hold<00:04:08.400> on<00:04:08.579> to

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
going then you can kind of hold on to

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.690 
going then you can kind of hold on to
the<00:04:08.880> sides<00:04:09.120> open<00:04:09.690> things<00:04:09.930> up<00:04:10.139> get<00:04:10.919> both<00:04:11.280> of<00:04:11.310> the

the sides open things up get both of the

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.070 
the sides open things up get both of the
sides<00:04:11.970> going<00:04:12.269> at<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.600> same

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
sides going at the same

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.960 
sides going at the same
and<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:13.650> should<00:04:13.830> be<00:04:13.950> able<00:04:14.130> to<00:04:14.280> kind<00:04:14.460> of<00:04:14.610> pinch

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
and you should be able to kind of pinch

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.000 
and you should be able to kind of pinch
everything<00:04:15.480> together<00:04:15.720> based<00:04:16.320> on<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.620> creases

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
everything together based on the creases

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.009 
everything together based on the creases
we've<00:04:17.160> made<00:04:17.370> to<00:04:18.330> create<00:04:19.459> something<00:04:20.459> like<00:04:20.610> this

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
we've made to create something like this

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.750 
we've made to create something like this
and<00:04:22.019> then<00:04:22.140> when<00:04:22.320> you<00:04:22.440> push<00:04:22.770> in<00:04:23.070> we're<00:04:23.400> going<00:04:23.610> to

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
and then when you push in we're going to

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.570 
and then when you push in we're going to
hold<00:04:24.390> with<00:04:24.540> the<00:04:24.690> left<00:04:24.720> side<00:04:25.320> here<00:04:25.740> and<00:04:25.920> if

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
hold with the left side here and if

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.820 
hold with the left side here and if
giving<00:04:27.030> this<00:04:27.150> is<00:04:27.330> our<00:04:27.480> base<00:04:27.690> push<00:04:28.380> this<00:04:28.590> side

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
giving this is our base push this side

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.940 
giving this is our base push this side
over<00:04:29.810> getting<00:04:30.810> these<00:04:30.930> two<00:04:31.230> sides<00:04:31.530> to<00:04:31.710> pinch

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
over getting these two sides to pinch

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.190 
over getting these two sides to pinch
together<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:32.670> then<00:04:33.180> keep<00:04:33.450> these<00:04:33.660> two<00:04:34.020> on<00:04:34.170> the

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
together and then keep these two on the

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.050 
together and then keep these two on the
other<00:04:34.410> side<00:04:34.740> and<00:04:34.980> you<00:04:35.130> wind<00:04:35.310> up<00:04:35.400> getting<00:04:35.580> this

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
other side and you wind up getting this

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.960 
other side and you wind up getting this
nice<00:04:36.300> little<00:04:36.540> heart<00:04:36.840> shape<00:04:37.110> and<00:04:37.790> the<00:04:38.790> cool
