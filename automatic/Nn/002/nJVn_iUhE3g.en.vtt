00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.209

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.770

 exclusive secrets and things that 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.290
 You will truly love those 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.780
 that you are fans of the author besides the 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.260
 new naruto costume i do not say anything 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.950
 with specialties that you will love 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.950
 when you see it 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:29.640
 evolve I can not Murcia what 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.890
 I am a level, we have all joined together 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.240
 we were able to try the new wii u that 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.100
 It has left us pleasantly surprised 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.950
 especially the subject of adaptability 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.110
 adding very ergonomic very light addition 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.080
 graphic novelties can be 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.680
 finally equate to consoles like xbox or 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.930
 playstation to name a few 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.940
 now that you're not trying out what 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.680
 it looks like the new handle 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.510
 it seems a bit big but 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.700
 I guess it's a matter of getting used to it 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.990
 are used more are smaller but 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.610
 good handling is pretty I think 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.360
 the command I thought was going to weigh 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.860
 a lot more 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.860
 and I see it quite light is 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.760
 seeing how great it is to see 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.769
 for soft goes well 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.980
 now we have been able to try games like 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:18.639
 zombie and you've written them a little bit 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.229
 great shaders we are surprised 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.680
 quite similar to what was play and 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.990
 xbox 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.740
 but more clearly, maybe you compare it with 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.180
 with wii 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.480
 so there's a difference 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.760
 clear if you compare it with other 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.610
 is about the same height then the 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.400
 utility screen display 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.200
 touch of the moment are not many more 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.720
 well you get here the menu I guess 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.820
 so that you have more more at hand and you 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.990
 be clear, everything is fine 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.990
 moments in the game that you have to 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.640
 use the screen to be able to 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.409
 follow and that for new forces you to 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.539
 use it 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:00.400
 it's a good addition to play who 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:03.820
 wants to try new things 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.960
 this is new enough 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.740
 as maybe we are not at all 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.120
 professionals in this area we have 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.610
 asked two people totally 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.150
 outside the company to give us their 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.800
 opinion please 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.870
 Could you tell us what you think of the 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.280
 new wii 's is very good 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.280
 When I leave, I'll tell you right away 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.120
 we just approved the new halo 4 that 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.650
 went on sale yesterday for some 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.710
 lucky and for others will have to 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.960
 wait a little longer until day 6 no 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.340
 for the moment what we have been able to prove has 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.100
 been something that has left us quite 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.290
 amazed some graphics that really 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.590
 they have nothing to do with the others 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.590
 games 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:59.060
 some small failures in the subject of the 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:01.990
 dubbing our destiny 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:05.170
 do not underestimate them 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:07.470
 but above all do not underestimate it 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.470
 to the 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.110
 nothing that we can not forgive in addition 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.790
 people of the state have behaved very well 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:19.650
 with us they have spoiled us 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.650
 made feel super special 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:28.850
 thanks for the game we are going to have 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.680
 the multiplayer cooperative we are going to 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.110
 have a cooperative where we are going to play 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.410
 on split screen as we have done 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:38.240
 so far and the multiplayer that does not 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.610
 we have been able to try but so 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.520
 We have been able to see also the same 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:46.250
 dynamic that in the other games moment 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.020
 more a more focused opinion we can 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.180
 give because we could try very little 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.520
 what we have seen we liked 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.539
 your mistake is to see the spartans as 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.539
 military machinery 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.349
 my spartans are the next step of the 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.979
 humanity 

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:04.979
 our destiny 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:12.740
 and here's the report today for 

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:13.940
 last level we have gone with very good 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.310
 impressions of everything we could 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.560
 try people have behaved very well and 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.389
 good and the next time another one comes 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.669
 pringado until all the day going around 

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:26.050
 from top to bottom according to 

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:26.050
 true where is he
