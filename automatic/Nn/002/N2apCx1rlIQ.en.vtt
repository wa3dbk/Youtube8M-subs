 Welcome to Neuroscience in 2 minutes, where I will explain the simplified topics of neuroscience 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.819
 In two minutes or less. In this installment we will discuss neuroscience. I will cover 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:13.440
 Few of the most common types of neuropathy are: computed tomography, MRI, positron emission tomography, functional magnetic resonance imaging 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.890
 Some neuroimaging techniques allow us to see the structure of the brain, while others allow 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.260
 Us by looking at brain activity or function. Computerized tomography, also known as computerized 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.100
 Computed tomography (CT) is a type of structural neuropathy. It is usually called Cat or 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.020
 CT scan. It involves taking a series of x-ray images from different locations around the head 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.340
 These images can then be combined to build a picture of the brain. To be a CT scan design 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.030
 The images are not high-resolution, but they can visualize any major structural problems in the brain 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.980
 Such as tumor 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.500
 MRI, involves the application of a package of magnetic fields 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.260
 And radio frequency energy waves to the brain. Hydrogen atoms respond to magnetic fields 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.420
 And radio frequency pulses by energy emission. An MRI device receives this energy and can 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.899
 That tells me came from any part of the brain. The computer can also use that information for reconstruction 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.550
 Image of the brain with high spatial design 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.110
 Positron emission tomography, or positron emission tomography, is a way to depict brain functions. To work 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.590
 The patient is injected with a radioactive substance emitted by positrons, which then 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.250
 Emitted by gamma rays when collided with electrons in brain tissue Gamma rays are detected 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.770
 By the device scanner. Because the radioactive material was injected into the bloodstream 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.830
 What the scanner does for a CT scan The positron version is a monitor of blood movement throughout the brain. Blood flow 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.460
 To a certain area of ​​the brain increases when this area is active, so the positron emission tomography produces 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.960
 The image shows areas of the brain that are most used in when a person is 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.479
 In the scanner 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.979
 Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or MRI, uses a similar approach to MRI but focuses on different responses 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.770
 Make oxygenated and non-oxygenated blood into magnetic fields and radio frequency energy 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.950
 MRI uses the so-called variance of the oxygen level in the blood, or determines the amount of changes in 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.009
 Blood flow in the brain, thus determining which areas of the brain are most active. MRI 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.590
 Allows imaging of brain functions without having to pump anything, and it provides 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.409
 High-resolution images, MRI also provides a functional image 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.409
