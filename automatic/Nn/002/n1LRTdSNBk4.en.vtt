get into it waking up for school is
probably<00:01:11.729> one<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.090> most<00:01:12.210> awful<00:01:12.750> things<00:01:12.930> in

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
probably one of the most awful things in

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.020 
probably one of the most awful things in
the<00:01:13.320> entire<00:01:13.680> world<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.340> goes<00:01:14.490> along<00:01:14.670> with

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
the entire world that goes along with

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.940 
the entire world that goes along with
the<00:01:15.180> whole<00:01:15.360> going<00:01:15.810> back<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.110> school<00:01:16.320> thing<00:01:16.530> but

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
the whole going back to school thing but

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.920 
the whole going back to school thing but
it<00:01:17.040> sets<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.759> much<00:01:17.939> more<00:01:18.210> when<00:01:18.509> your<00:01:18.659> alarm

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
it sets so much more when your alarm

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.230 
it sets so much more when your alarm
just<00:01:19.650> makes<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.130> want<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.580> punch<00:01:20.880> yourself<00:01:20.970> in

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
just makes you want to punch yourself in

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.950 
just makes you want to punch yourself in
the<00:01:21.299> face

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.840 

so<00:01:27.960> my<00:01:28.080> first<00:01:28.290> tip<00:01:28.530> would<00:01:28.680> be<00:01:28.830> to<00:01:28.980> have<00:01:29.370> a<00:01:29.400> very

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
so my first tip would be to have a very

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.120 
so my first tip would be to have a very
fun<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.450> upbeat<00:01:30.600> alarm<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.710> when<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.010> goes

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
fun and upbeat alarm and when it goes

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.200 
fun and upbeat alarm and when it goes
off<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.460> morning<00:01:32.730> you're<00:01:32.880> kind<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.090> like

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
off in the morning you're kind of like

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.490 
off in the morning you're kind of like
dancing<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.750> yourself<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.380> it's

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
dancing to yourself and it's

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.290 
dancing to yourself and it's
automatically<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.220> way<00:01:35.520> better<00:01:35.730> way<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.940> waking

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
automatically a way better way of waking

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.590 
automatically a way better way of waking
up<00:01:40.280> at<00:01:41.280> least<00:01:41.520> for<00:01:41.670> me<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:42.030> really<00:01:42.090> really

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
up at least for me this really really

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.060 
up at least for me this really really
really<00:01:42.930> helps<00:01:43.260> when<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.470> comes<00:01:43.650> to<00:01:43.740> getting<00:01:43.890> up

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
really helps when it comes to getting up

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.359 
really helps when it comes to getting up
in<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:44.250> mornings

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.530 

don't<00:01:49.670> feel

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
don't feel

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.370

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.460 
I suck at studying and I cannot memorize
anything<00:03:33.090> for<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.480> life<00:03:33.660> of<00:03:33.780> me<00:03:33.959> but<00:03:34.260> what<00:03:34.379> I'm

sharing with you is like the only thing

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.820 
sharing with you is like the only thing
that<00:03:35.760> works<00:03:36.060> for<00:03:36.239> me<00:03:36.360> so<00:03:37.200> basically<00:03:37.319> what<00:03:37.739> I'll

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
that works for me so basically what I'll

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.259 
that works for me so basically what I'll
do<00:03:37.950> is<00:03:38.099> I'll<00:03:38.190> take<00:03:38.220> my<00:03:38.370> textbook<00:03:38.849> or<00:03:39.000> whatever

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
do is I'll take my textbook or whatever

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.330 
do is I'll take my textbook or whatever
I'm<00:03:39.480> supposed<00:03:39.629> to<00:03:39.900> be<00:03:40.080> memorizing<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.769> I<00:03:41.190> will

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
I'm supposed to be memorizing and I will

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.770 
I'm supposed to be memorizing and I will
highlight<00:03:41.700> everything<00:03:42.120> that's<00:03:42.300> important

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
highlight everything that's important

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.720 
highlight everything that's important
and<00:03:43.019> once<00:03:43.590> I've<00:03:43.739> done<00:03:43.769> all<00:03:43.920> of<00:03:44.069> that<00:03:44.190> I'll<00:03:44.489> take

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
and once I've done all of that I'll take

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:45.860 
and once I've done all of that I'll take
out<00:03:44.849> a<00:03:44.880> notebook<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.480> I'll<00:03:45.569> write<00:03:45.750> down

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
out a notebook and I'll write down

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.589 
out a notebook and I'll write down
everything<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.440> I<00:03:46.590> thought<00:03:46.830> was<00:03:46.980> important

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.339 

but<00:03:51.599> you<00:03:51.690> have<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:51.959> make<00:03:52.080> sure<00:03:52.110> you're

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
but you have to make sure you're

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:53.630 
but you have to make sure you're
actually<00:03:52.680> writing<00:03:52.890> it<00:03:53.040> down<00:03:53.220> because<00:03:53.459> it

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
actually writing it down because it

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.100 
actually writing it down because it
doesn't<00:03:53.849> work<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.150> same<00:03:54.360> if<00:03:54.599> you<00:03:54.780> are<00:03:54.930> just

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
doesn't work the same if you are just

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:02.390 
doesn't work the same if you are just
typing<00:03:55.349> it<00:03:55.530> on<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.709> computer<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:01.590> going<00:04:02.220> along

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
typing it on a computer and going along

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.370 
typing it on a computer and going along
with<00:04:02.580> that<00:04:02.640> brings<00:04:03.030> me<00:04:03.209> to<00:04:03.239> my<00:04:03.420> next<00:04:03.569> life<00:04:04.170> hack

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
with that brings me to my next life hack

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.319 
with that brings me to my next life hack
which<00:04:04.860> would<00:04:05.010> be<00:04:05.130> also<00:04:05.340> chewing<00:04:05.880> gum<00:04:06.090> at<00:04:06.269> the

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
which would be also chewing gum at the

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.039 
which would be also chewing gum at the
same<00:04:06.569> time<00:04:06.840> while<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.349> do<00:04:07.500> those<00:04:07.680> things<00:04:09.049> I'm

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
same time while you do those things I'm

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.850 
same time while you do those things I'm
still<00:04:10.349> okay<00:04:11.280> for<00:04:12.110> me<00:04:13.110> chewing<00:04:13.440> gum<00:04:13.590> has<00:04:13.739> the

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
still okay for me chewing gum has the

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.259 
still okay for me chewing gum has the
same<00:04:14.040> thing<00:04:14.280> as<00:04:14.400> like<00:04:14.579> when<00:04:14.760> you<00:04:14.819> hear<00:04:14.970> a<00:04:15.030> song

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
same thing as like when you hear a song

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.520 
same thing as like when you hear a song
and<00:04:15.299> you<00:04:15.599> automatically<00:04:16.109> think<00:04:16.350> of<00:04:16.410> these

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
and you automatically think of these

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.199 
and you automatically think of these
memories<00:04:16.919> or<00:04:17.190> when<00:04:17.430> you<00:04:17.519> smell<00:04:17.729> something<00:04:18.120> and

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
memories or when you smell something and

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.520 
memories or when you smell something and
it<00:04:18.329> brings<00:04:18.479> you<00:04:18.570> back<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:18.930> certain<00:04:19.320> time

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
it brings you back to a certain time

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.080 
it brings you back to a certain time
like<00:04:19.889> sometimes<00:04:20.220> I<00:04:20.340> go<00:04:20.459> outside<00:04:20.729> when<00:04:20.970> it's

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
like sometimes I go outside when it's

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.550 
like sometimes I go outside when it's
really<00:04:21.209> humid<00:04:21.600> and<00:04:21.750> it<00:04:21.870> makes<00:04:22.169> me<00:04:22.290> think<00:04:22.320> of

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
really humid and it makes me think of

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.900 
really humid and it makes me think of
Florida<00:04:22.740> I<00:04:23.100> don't<00:04:23.400> know<00:04:23.460> it's<00:04:23.639> really<00:04:23.790> weird

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
Florida I don't know it's really weird

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.100 
Florida I don't know it's really weird
but<00:04:24.360> it<00:04:24.419> definitely<00:04:24.630> works<00:04:26.870> so<00:04:27.870> when<00:04:27.990> you're

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
but it definitely works so when you're

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.390 
but it definitely works so when you're
studying<00:04:28.200> for<00:04:28.350> a<00:04:28.500> test<00:04:28.560> or<00:04:28.919> something<00:04:29.250> make

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
studying for a test or something make

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.770 
studying for a test or something make
sure<00:04:29.430> to<00:04:29.610> chew<00:04:29.790> gum<00:04:29.970> and<00:04:30.270> then<00:04:30.450> when<00:04:30.539> you<00:04:30.630> go<00:04:30.720> to

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
sure to chew gum and then when you go to

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.420 
sure to chew gum and then when you go to
do<00:04:30.930> your<00:04:30.960> test<00:04:31.320> make<00:04:31.650> sure<00:04:31.770> to<00:04:31.860> chew<00:04:31.979> that<00:04:32.100> same

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
do your test make sure to chew that same

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.070 
do your test make sure to chew that same
flavor<00:04:32.669> of<00:04:32.970> gum<00:04:33.150> and<00:04:33.360> then<00:04:33.510> a<00:04:33.539> lot<00:04:33.750> of<00:04:33.840> things

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
flavor of gum and then a lot of things

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.659 
flavor of gum and then a lot of things
will<00:04:34.200> come<00:04:34.350> right<00:04:34.530> back<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.770> you<00:04:34.979> if<00:04:35.370> you<00:04:35.550> have

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
will come right back to you if you have

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.790 
will come right back to you if you have
a<00:04:35.729> lots<00:04:35.880> of<00:04:35.970> chew<00:04:36.120> gum<00:04:36.270> then<00:04:36.750> you<00:04:37.260> can<00:04:37.500> you<00:04:37.770> know

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
Darin the way that I put in work on the

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.480 
Darin the way that I put in work on the
mic<00:04:47.080> staying<00:04:47.470> up<00:04:47.620> all<00:04:47.710> night<00:04:47.770> uh<00:04:47.919> certainly<00:04:48.280> my

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
boy and then my last hack for this video

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.740 
boy and then my last hack for this video
would<00:04:51.550> be<00:04:51.580> to<00:04:51.759> change<00:04:51.909> your<00:04:52.150> phone<00:04:52.330> wallpaper

to your school schedule
I<00:04:55.409> wrote<00:04:56.409> mine<00:04:56.530> down<00:04:56.740> just<00:04:56.979> because<00:04:57.159> I<00:04:57.220> wanted

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
I wrote mine down just because I wanted

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.309 
I wrote mine down just because I wanted
it<00:04:57.550> to<00:04:57.669> look<00:04:57.789> cuter<00:04:58.210> I<00:04:58.389> always<00:04:58.900> forget<00:04:59.080> where

00:04:59.309 --> 00:04:59.319 
it to look cuter I always forget where

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:00.869 
it to look cuter I always forget where
my<00:04:59.349> classes<00:04:59.560> are<00:04:59.860> and<00:05:00.039> what<00:05:00.190> time<00:05:00.370> they<00:05:00.520> are<00:05:00.550> so

00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:00.879 
my classes are and what time they are so

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:02.339 
my classes are and what time they are so
I<00:05:00.909> decided<00:05:01.240> to<00:05:01.360> make<00:05:01.509> it<00:05:01.539> my<00:05:01.690> phone<00:05:01.870> background

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:02.349 
I decided to make it my phone background

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:03.180 
I decided to make it my phone background
because<00:05:02.620> you're<00:05:02.740> going<00:05:02.860> to<00:05:02.919> see<00:05:03.039> this<00:05:03.129> a
