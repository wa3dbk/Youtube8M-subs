00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello to all I reserve you and that a 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.540
 new video for you to do the tutorial 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.030
 of this cake so it's a cake in 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.830
 done lemon and that's it I climbed the 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.900
 little by hans trapp 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.950
 so if you're interested I leave you 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.750
 with following 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.720
 so we will first start with the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.390
 material not need a small ball 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:25.019
 yellow a little bigger ball 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.380
 newspaper 6 and a mixture of yellow 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.050
 and white so it'll give a 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.820
 a little vanilla color like that 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.620
 so what is needed for textures 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.840
 and there is plenty of thio to start when 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.940
 I started I just took 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.760
 scalpel because the tip is really 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.309
 hyper sharp and it's very easy to 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.140
 textures and if not there are also the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.149
 points 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.610
 otherwise I know that beginners use 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.420
 a tooth cure we do not find it's the 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.570
 best solutions 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.070
 after to you to see me in this tutorial I 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.590
 am going to use the needle because 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.739
 I use it all the time and it's 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.660
 something that all starts one can 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.470
 can have quite easily I think 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.290
 so the first step wash you the 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.409
 hands so that's not too much of 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.189
 waste you cut the dough ball 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.280
 white and yellow mixture so we go 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.850
 call it vanilla and I come to do it 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.850
 a ball 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:32.460
 actually a bit too short of 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.750
 thick about like that it takes 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.770
 not that it is either very big but 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.390
 not too small and once that 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.170
 do you do by and with each other 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.780
 dough tip 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.729
 once you have two trays 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.869
 like those here but my lease in 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.539
 does it pretty much thickness you go them 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.640
 reserve and you take the yellow paste and 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.920
 makes you the soul the same circle 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.179
 except that it is necessary that this time the dough 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.179
 it's over 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:17.720
 I take a paw in the trays I 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:21.680
 put it on this I take another 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.050
 tray and I do not put it once 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.510
 do not come punished as if we're going 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.050
 double to grow the roof dishes and a 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:41.720
 sindjÃ©ly go back like this so that's it 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:44.060
 it becomes flat then we take the 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.590
 little piece of yellow dough is actually 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.989
 learn nothing from the miba I know 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.850
 I had no better but it takes everything 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.850
 to animate a montage we take a small 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.770
 little there we will come to make the frosting 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.580
 so I know we do not have all of the 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.260
 fim in liquid 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.440
 that's why I made a video 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.800
 on how to make wireless glazes 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.220
 unit 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.340
 so I put the link here under the 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.870
 cake or the link will be towards the info is 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.739
 so here I'm going to do I'm coming 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.739
 make the icing 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:33.650
 as long as I get to the east coast I 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.959
 resume my thing from earlier 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:42.030
 so come draw one in the middle as 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:48.060
 it's unique in the background that allow me 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:04:07.889
 to be able to cut so eve of this rac 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:04:09.659
 is not everything like this one we're going 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.129
 to make the texture so sorry goes there 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:15.930
 have click click because that's the 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:21.380
 focus of which I take my bed I 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.380
 am going to come and do my little round 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.810
 on my part ring sluggish 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:05:00.070
 so then to come take the frosting 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:03.120
 so is I advise you to 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.120
 start with the edge 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:42.370
 so I fucking say you play can 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:45.900
 6 3 no I made you a tutorial on it 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:51.870
 I do not know if I wanted to post or not 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.870
 these dances and the night is a championship 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:02.110
 and that's it, oh yes, do not forget to 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.479
 put small strokes like this with 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.620

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:11.380

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:33.720
 small slices of lemon like that 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:36.610
