 I found a good friend my beloved Savior 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.620
 I will tell you what he has done for me 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.200
 finding myself lost I have unworthy sinner 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.100
 I saved myself and today he keeps me to himself 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.500
 saves me from sin, keeps me from satan 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.580
 he promises to be with me until the end 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.720
 he consoles my sorrows, he takes away all my eagerness 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.080
 great things Christ has done for me 

00:00:52.315 --> 00:00:57.535
 Jesus I never lack, never leave me 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.320
 It is my strong and powerful protector 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.560

 to consecrate my life to the Lord 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.180
 If the world persecutes me, if I suffer temptation, 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.580
 trusting in Christ I can resist 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.280

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.940
 I know that Jesus Christ will soon return
