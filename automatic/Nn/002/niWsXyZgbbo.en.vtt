00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 it is and remains mysterious 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.940
 unknown flying object has last night 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.550
 for a great excitement at bremen airport 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.769
 worried the air traffic controllers had that 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.080
 shine object with bare eyes so 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.730
 Seen through binoculars on the radar 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.830
 however, nothing was apparent 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.080
 A flight was diverted to a landing 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.310
 completely deleted and the police the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.560
 determined now because of the dangerous 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.439
 intervening in the air traffic 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.510
 ufo alarm or what exactly is on there 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:34.350
 sky played alexander not 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:37.739
 reports red light and one something 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.739
 in a somewhat yellowish light the fluc right 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.660
 slowly 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:46.800
 the police describes this object as 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.070
 helicopter similar that was not not 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.489
 especially big it is probably only one thing 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.789
 firmly 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.480
 a plane was not the thing 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.690
 there flashes with over bremen pulled away 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.090
 There are no photos or videos yet 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.700
 the object was lit and moved here 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.760
 in the approach area his train so on 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.500
 height of the approach area so that the death 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.060
 she has decided the police 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.979
 to contact directly 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.820
 they were then with a helicopter 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.979
 here on the spot and also with a buddel 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.680
 stripe that has localized 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.720
 a machine was headed by the air traffic controllers 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.790
 to Hannover to another one was allowed 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.790
 It was not long either two hours 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.860
 So airport paralyzed in the form 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.680
 we do not have that yet 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.549
 completely new for us that is it 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.720
 really over such a long period of time 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.720
 has drawn 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.200
 I was us by the first moment 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.590
 Actually we rather have fun of it 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.369
 and then just continue 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.369
 went for a walk 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.540
 There should not be extraterrestrials 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.659
 You may smile about this curious thing 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.190
 The investigators find it funny 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.450
 not the criminal police has the 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.799
 investigations was added to determine 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.580
 now because of a threat to the 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.080
 air traffic 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.119
 That's a crime is not a crime 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.950
 this is not going to happen 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.709
 with four years of freedom 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.019
 So that can be very expensive 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:17.600
 especially because yes two machines 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:23.100
 affected by it were walking in Bremen 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.660
 what a media hype this beats 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.130
 Surprisingly, we big waves 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.750
 have requests from a Japanese 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.370
 news agency already have radio 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.940
 interview for the british radio station 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.230
 given 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.000
 just a request 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.540
 answered for the portuguese 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.080
 newspaper 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:41.519
 So that is already supraregional whether 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.340
 alien or hobby pilot with 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.570
 remotely control the tower once 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.590
 shortly to register 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.590
 Not only the boys would have a lot there 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.590
 calmed down
