00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.089
 hello very good again mates 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:08.349
 Well now let's continue with the 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:12.290
 video so you can install the root 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:15.559
 once you have installed the recovery and 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:19.820
 the only thing we have to do is this 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:22.250
 file that already comes in the zip that 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.230
 you have downloaded previously what 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.140
 you have to copy 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.570
 on the phone on the mobile phone 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.570
 then the only thing we are going to do is 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.570
 copy it 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.650
 and on your phone either in the 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.770
 internal or external and now no 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.770
 I have no sd put on the phone and 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:49.090
 I'm going to do it from the inside 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.739
 then I created a folder like 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.840
 I usually always do where I put 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:57.330
 all applications and all 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.330
 programs and simply 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.500
 we put it there 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.030
 with this we already have the root put in the 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.830
 phone and now what we 're going to do is 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.570
 to proceed with the installation from the 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.530
 recovery now what we have to do 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.780
 is to pick up the phone and turn it on in 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.400
 recovery 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:23.920
 good to turn on the phone in mode 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.070
 recovery what we have to do is 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.210
 First 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.210
 turn off the phone 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.540
 and let it go out 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.760
 and now to turn it on manually in 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.120
 recovery mode for 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.650
 to do it you have to do 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.390
 the plus and minus of the volume and at the same time 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.690
 the power button or the three 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.570
 pressed 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.850
 a long pulse and when the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.689
 mobile 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.689
 let's go 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.400
 you have seen that it has entered into 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.930
 recovery without any problem 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.490
 and now what we have to do is 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.430
 look for the folder where we have 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.750
 introduced the zip file of the rotc for 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:15.650
 install it without any problem 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:20.420
 install I see the folder at the first 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.040
 apps I have it there and now the root and 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.090
 now just what we have to 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.050
 do is 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.050
 the little circle 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.680
 drag it to the right 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.390
 and the installation begins 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.350
 that have been seen and not seen two 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.380
 seconds 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.530
 here you can check 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.930
 how the installation has been done and already 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.780
 is 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.680
 in the mobile we already have root and now 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.450
 we just reboot system 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.700
 in this way we already have the robot 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.500
 fully installed 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.920
 and now we can use applications 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.620
 that need root or if you want to do 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.239
 some kind of backup with titanium 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.209
 etcetera etcetera or you want to eliminate 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:11.060
 system applications that come in 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.900
 Chinese or you want to leave the system to 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.239
 your taste because you can already start 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.270
 use and enjoy since I have the mobile 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.980
 on we go to 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:26.730
 to see that everything has been installed well 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:31.040
 as you can see now supersur us 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:34.610
 appears on the desktop we can already 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.519
 give him use then nothing mates I hope 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.810
 help and you can surround your 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.040
 mobile phone without any kind of 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.040
 problem a greeting
