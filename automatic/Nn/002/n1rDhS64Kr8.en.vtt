00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.690
 worked on the gloss 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.450
 Here is such a result I got 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.280
 all carbon maniacs will understand me 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.400
 what sensations I feel now 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:31.510
 so what can I say in work 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:49.900
 hatch in my work was quite a long time 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:52.900
 you saw it yourself saw it yourself 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.900
 means 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:01.560
 under the total there are three layers 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:05.189
 Ugletkany weaving took 200 grams per 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.879
 square meter applied vacuum 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:09.180
 infusions 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:14.909
 after vacuum infusion primer 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:18.090
 clear soil I'm already struggling but 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:22.459
 I think five layers I gave later in the shoes 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.590
 360 grain smoking and grain 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:30.780
 400 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:35.480
 after that scotch brite so through 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.919
 bright purple arts bright gray 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.500
 here further 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:45.139
 blocking alla kerala i think that where 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:51.980
 then than layers 6 gave to after varnishing 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:57.379
 then it worked like that 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:04:00.319
 avalon type 800 one and a half thousand 2000 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:04.579
 3000 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:11.180
 after 3000 he worked pasta 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:13.590
 festool 5000 after the five thousandth worked 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:18.659
 eight months and 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:23.280
 it means final it applied wax 

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:29.479
 protection sealant 2 see also from the company 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:32.520
 festul and polishing used two circles 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:36.330
 white is finish white I worked 8 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:39.560
 thousandth other friend I worked 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.560
 five thousand posts 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:48.770
 which means it turned out like this 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:52.250
 I am pleased with the result. I hope the customer 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:55.010
 also it will all like on the inside 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:05:00.170
 parts of the inside can detail 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:05.990
 take a look I drilled the holes like this 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:12.940
 all this would be pasted over pasted firmly not 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.940
 I think that something can fall out here 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.810
 Such is the design I got 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:37.820
 principle and now there is a matrix can still 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:40.310
 repeat this option so we are dreams 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.650
 comes true really if you want 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.610
 then you need to work hard and you will reach 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:49.960
 what you want to achieve 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:54.880
 The main question is how much strength are you ready 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:59.960
 time and money put on it 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:02.090
 principle any matter but can be 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:06.290
 accomplished and the goal made can 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:11.270
 be achieved this is so philosophy but by 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:13.130
 case like here's my video report and on 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.280
 In this I complete my series by 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:18.680
 making the key to 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:23.000
 let's see what u will 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:27.490
 the next job is nothing special 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.490
