00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
hey you two friends I had someone ask me

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.320 
hey you two friends I had someone ask me
about<00:00:03.330> my<00:00:03.689> antenna<00:00:04.110> that<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:04.920> mentioned<00:00:05.430> and

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
about my antenna that I mentioned and

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.799 
about my antenna that I mentioned and
this<00:00:06.450> is<00:00:06.569> what<00:00:06.690> I<00:00:06.720> got<00:00:06.930> for<00:00:07.200> my<00:00:07.410> shortwave<00:00:08.809> for

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
this is what I got for my shortwave for

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.720 
this is what I got for my shortwave for
my<00:00:09.960> ham<00:00:10.200> radio<00:00:11.210> basically<00:00:12.210> for<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.540> ham<00:00:12.750> radio

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
my ham radio basically for the ham radio

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.129 
my ham radio basically for the ham radio
that's<00:00:14.730> when<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:14.910> listen<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.299> shortwave<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.929> just

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
that's when I listen to shortwave I just

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.580 
that's when I listen to shortwave I just
used<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.500> little<00:00:16.650> indoor<00:00:17.100> antenna<00:00:18.109> but<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.350> got

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
used a little indoor antenna but I got

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.250 
used a little indoor antenna but I got
this<00:00:19.770> fiber<00:00:20.100> pole<00:00:20.810> fiberglass<00:00:21.810> that's

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
this fiber pole fiberglass that's

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.759 
this fiber pole fiberglass that's
extendable<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.660> got<00:00:24.660> up<00:00:24.869> about<00:00:25.140> 20<00:00:25.560> feet<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:27.769> it

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
extendable I got up about 20 feet and it

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.430 
extendable I got up about 20 feet and it
goes<00:00:28.980> into<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:31.489> pointed<00:00:32.489> out<00:00:33.020> this<00:00:34.020> sleeve

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
goes into this I pointed out this sleeve

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.880 
goes into this I pointed out this sleeve
PVC<00:00:35.219> sleeve<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:36.320> got<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.500> tied<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:39.739> to<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
PVC sleeve I got that tied to the to the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.790 
PVC sleeve I got that tied to the to the
porch<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:42.390> know<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.870> what<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.020> plan<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.320> do<00:00:43.590> is

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
porch you know and what I plan to do is

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.250 
porch you know and what I plan to do is
to<00:00:44.450> cement<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.660> into<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.079> ground

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
to cement this into the ground

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.700 
to cement this into the ground
eventually<00:00:47.930> and<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.399> got<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.579> wire<00:00:51.469> that's<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
eventually and I got the wire that's the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.569 
eventually and I got the wire that's the
lower<00:00:52.920> wire<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.579> hope<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.000> could<00:00:54.180> see<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:55.579> see

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
lower wire I hope you could see that see

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.080 
lower wire I hope you could see that see
I<00:00:56.610> have<00:00:56.960> insulators<00:00:57.960> they're<00:00:58.430> an<00:00:59.430> insulator

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
I have insulators they're an insulator

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.850 
I have insulators they're an insulator
on<00:01:00.300> top<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:01.730> it's<00:01:02.730> tied<00:01:03.030> with<00:01:03.180> bungee<00:01:03.420> cords

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
on top and it's tied with bungee cords

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:11.359 
on top and it's tied with bungee cords
to<00:01:04.860> give<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.159> flexibility<00:01:06.650> and<00:01:07.650> then<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:11.130> wire

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
to give it flexibility and then the wire

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.960 
to give it flexibility and then the wire
this<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> lower<00:01:12.299> wire<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.549> I<00:01:14.549> can<00:01:14.729> make<00:01:14.850> it

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
this is the lower wire and I can make it

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.289 
this is the lower wire and I can make it
a<00:01:15.030> little<00:01:15.210> tighter<00:01:15.479> if<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.810> want<00:01:17.090> that<00:01:18.090> goes

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
a little tighter if I want that goes

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.390 
a little tighter if I want that goes
it's<00:01:21.299> probably<00:01:21.840> about<00:01:22.110> ten<00:01:22.979> feet<00:01:23.189> off<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
it's probably about ten feet off the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.969 
it's probably about ten feet off the
ground<00:01:23.990> but<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.049> could<00:01:25.229> get<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> little<00:01:25.650> tighter

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
ground but I could get a little tighter

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.539 
ground but I could get a little tighter
I<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.729> got<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> little<00:01:27.060> slack<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.720> now<00:01:27.840> that

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
I just got a little slack in it now that

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:34.270 
I just got a little slack in it now that
goes<00:01:29.549> way<00:01:30.030> back<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:31.560> then<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.549> goes<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:33.360> this

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
goes way back and then it goes to this

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.030 
goes way back and then it goes to this
tree<00:01:35.280> way<00:01:35.520> back<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.119> yard

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.320 

farthest<00:01:39.820> tree<00:01:40.060> I<00:01:40.090> could<00:01:40.360> get<00:01:40.570> and<00:01:42.090> what<00:01:43.090> I<00:01:43.120> did

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
farthest tree I could get and what I did

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.320 
farthest tree I could get and what I did
was<00:01:43.420> I<00:01:43.570> threw<00:01:43.810> a<00:01:43.840> line<00:01:44.110> up<00:01:44.850> using<00:01:45.850> a<00:01:45.940> fishing

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
was I threw a line up using a fishing

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.010 
was I threw a line up using a fishing
pole<00:01:47.040> went<00:01:48.040> way<00:01:48.250> up<00:01:48.280> into<00:01:48.760> this<00:01:48.940> poplar<00:01:49.840> tree

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
pole went way up into this poplar tree

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.860 
pole went way up into this poplar tree
see<00:01:53.020> if<00:01:53.110> I<00:01:53.170> could<00:01:53.350> show<00:01:53.530> that<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:55.630> that

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
see if I could show that it's that

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.200 
see if I could show that it's that
really<00:01:56.260> tall<00:01:56.500> tree<00:01:56.800> there<00:01:57.040> so<00:01:57.580> I'm<00:01:57.730> Way<00:01:57.880> up<00:01:57.910> in

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
really tall tree there so I'm Way up in

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.990 
really tall tree there so I'm Way up in
there<00:01:58.450> if<00:01:59.230> you<00:01:59.950> look<00:02:00.070> real<00:02:00.310> close<00:02:00.640> you<00:02:00.670> might

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
there if you look real close you might

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.340 
there if you look real close you might
be<00:02:01.180> able<00:02:01.270> to<00:02:01.420> see<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.750> water<00:02:01.900> and<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.840> say<00:02:05.080> it's

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
be able to see the water and I say it's

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.790 
be able to see the water and I say it's
like<00:02:05.470> a<00:02:05.590> bath<00:02:05.980> like<00:02:07.740> 70<00:02:08.740> 75<00:02:09.670> feet<00:02:09.910> up<00:02:10.119> maybe<00:02:10.800> 70

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
like a bath like 70 75 feet up maybe 70

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.700 
like a bath like 70 75 feet up maybe 70
feet<00:02:11.980> maybe<00:02:12.690> it's<00:02:13.690> pretty<00:02:13.990> high<00:02:14.200> but<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.530> threw

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
feet maybe it's pretty high but I threw

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.140 
feet maybe it's pretty high but I threw
it<00:02:14.860> up<00:02:15.010> with<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.220> weight<00:02:15.460> on<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.730> end<00:02:15.850> of<00:02:16.000> a

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
it up with a weight on the end of a

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.970 
it up with a weight on the end of a
fishing<00:02:16.330> line<00:02:16.680> then<00:02:17.680> I<00:02:17.710> pull<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.360> like<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.980> cord

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
fishing line then I pull the like a cord

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.190 
fishing line then I pull the like a cord
through<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.460> then<00:02:21.820> I<00:02:21.940> pulled<00:02:22.270> wire<00:02:22.690> through<00:02:23.080> it

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
through it then I pulled wire through it

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.840 
through it then I pulled wire through it
I<00:02:23.320> did<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.620> progressively<00:02:24.220> because<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.670> wire

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
I did it progressively because the wire

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.870 
I did it progressively because the wire
was<00:02:25.750> heavy<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:28.060> then<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.300> goes<00:02:28.510> across<00:02:28.870> and

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
was heavy and then that goes across and

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.470 
was heavy and then that goes across and
then<00:02:30.880> it<00:02:31.000> slopes<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:33.130> it<00:02:33.220> goes<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.820> top<00:02:34.300> of

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
then it slopes and it goes to the top of

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.210 
then it slopes and it goes to the top of
my<00:02:34.600> pole<00:02:35.280> over<00:02:37.110> where<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.230> house<00:02:38.410> is<00:02:38.710> you<00:02:39.190> know

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
my pole over where the house is you know

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.330 
my pole over where the house is you know
that<00:02:39.490> slopes<00:02:39.880> down<00:02:40.650> let's<00:02:41.650> see<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:42.040> might<00:02:42.220> be

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
that slopes down let's see you might be

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.449 
that slopes down let's see you might be
able<00:02:42.490> to<00:02:42.550> see<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.790> two<00:02:42.970> wires<00:02:43.209> here<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:47.459> then

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
able to see the two wires here and then

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.140 
able to see the two wires here and then
when<00:02:49.000> it<00:02:49.090> gets<00:02:49.270> to<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.630> porch<00:02:50.340> what<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:51.370> do<00:02:51.490> is<00:02:51.850> I

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
when it gets to the porch what I do is I

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.170 
when it gets to the porch what I do is I
um<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.630> just<00:02:53.380> make<00:02:53.770> one<00:02:53.980> wrap<00:02:54.220> around<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.910> top

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
um I just make one wrap around the top

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.840 
um I just make one wrap around the top
of<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.510> porch<00:02:55.840> Pole

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
of the porch Pole

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.910 
of the porch Pole
just<00:02:57.850> just<00:02:58.150> one<00:02:58.239> wrap<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:59.050> I<00:02:59.260> found<00:02:59.530> out<00:02:59.709> that

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
just just one wrap and I found out that

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.520 
just just one wrap and I found out that
I'll<00:03:00.640> have<00:03:00.880> some<00:03:01.060> extra<00:03:01.450> wire<00:03:01.660> there<00:03:01.959> I<00:03:01.989> should

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
I'll have some extra wire there I should

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.040 
I'll have some extra wire there I should
trim<00:03:03.060> but<00:03:04.060> haven't<00:03:04.390> really<00:03:04.630> be<00:03:04.750> used<00:03:04.930> in

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
trim but haven't really be used in

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.640 
trim but haven't really be used in
transmitter<00:03:05.620> yet<00:03:05.920> not<00:03:06.700> too<00:03:06.880> much<00:03:07.090> I<00:03:07.440> did<00:03:08.440> talk

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
transmitter yet not too much I did talk

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.430 
transmitter yet not too much I did talk
to<00:03:08.709> a<00:03:08.860> New<00:03:08.980> Mexico<00:03:09.459> on<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.670> transmitter<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:11.350> I

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
to a New Mexico on the transmitter and I

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.630 
to a New Mexico on the transmitter and I
was<00:03:11.620> listening<00:03:11.860> yesterday<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:14.489> Prince<00:03:15.489> Edward

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
was listening yesterday to Prince Edward

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.030 
was listening yesterday to Prince Edward
Island<00:03:16.270> a<00:03:16.590> ham<00:03:17.590> radio<00:03:17.950> guy<00:03:18.340> out<00:03:18.550> there<00:03:18.820> yeah

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
Island a ham radio guy out there yeah

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.490 
Island a ham radio guy out there yeah
but<00:03:21.040> I<00:03:21.400> found<00:03:22.239> out<00:03:22.330> them<00:03:22.510> when<00:03:22.630> I<00:03:22.660> wrapped<00:03:22.989> the

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
but I found out them when I wrapped the

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.740 
but I found out them when I wrapped the
wire<00:03:23.709> too<00:03:24.040> many<00:03:24.220> times<00:03:24.520> around<00:03:24.910> I<00:03:25.090> caused<00:03:25.360> a

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
wire too many times around I caused a

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.250 
wire too many times around I caused a
made<00:03:26.440> an<00:03:26.560> inductor<00:03:27.040> it<00:03:27.280> was<00:03:27.430> killing<00:03:27.700> my<00:03:27.910> power

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
made an inductor it was killing my power

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.810 
made an inductor it was killing my power
so<00:03:29.260> I<00:03:29.320> just<00:03:29.470> made<00:03:29.650> like<00:03:29.800> one<00:03:30.190> one<00:03:30.550> quick

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
so I just made like one one quick

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.320 
so I just made like one one quick
turnaround<00:03:31.420> there<00:03:31.600> and<00:03:32.170> then<00:03:33.070> it<00:03:33.940> goes<00:03:34.120> in

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
turnaround there and then it goes in

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.030 
turnaround there and then it goes in
that<00:03:34.450> groove

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.950 

goes<00:03:39.040> in<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.370> groove<00:03:39.610> there<00:03:42.030> on<00:03:43.030> top<00:03:43.660> of<00:03:43.870> the

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
goes in the groove there on top of the

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.170 
goes in the groove there on top of the
porch<00:03:45.300> see<00:03:46.300> I'll<00:03:46.360> show<00:03:46.420> you<00:03:47.820> so<00:03:48.820> I<00:03:48.850> just<00:03:49.000> make

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
porch see I'll show you so I just make

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.150 
porch see I'll show you so I just make
one<00:03:49.210> quick<00:03:49.540> turn<00:03:49.870> to<00:03:50.080> hold<00:03:50.260> it<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:50.650> it's<00:03:51.040> in

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
one quick turn to hold it and it's in

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.770 
one quick turn to hold it and it's in
that<00:03:51.310> groove<00:03:51.900> now<00:03:52.900> when<00:03:53.200> storms<00:03:53.860> come<00:03:54.190> I<00:03:54.370> just

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
that groove now when storms come I just

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.320 
that groove now when storms come I just
unwrap<00:03:55.780> that<00:03:55.990> turn<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:56.860> I<00:03:57.520> let<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:57.790> wire<00:03:58.000> come

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
unwrap that turn and I let the wire come

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.070 
unwrap that turn and I let the wire come
down<00:03:58.540> and<00:03:59.670> then<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:00.970> wire<00:04:01.120> comes<00:04:01.450> down<00:04:01.720> and

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
down and then the wire comes down and

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.460 
down and then the wire comes down and
then<00:04:03.330> you<00:04:04.330> know<00:04:04.480> it's<00:04:04.780> not<00:04:04.900> gonna<00:04:05.050> get<00:04:05.290> busted

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
then you know it's not gonna get busted

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.500 
then you know it's not gonna get busted
Patrice<00:04:06.100> are<00:04:06.310> swaying<00:04:06.730> or<00:04:06.940> anything<00:04:07.120> but<00:04:07.450> I

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
Patrice are swaying or anything but I

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.010 
Patrice are swaying or anything but I
got<00:04:07.690> kind<00:04:07.900> of<00:04:08.020> loose<00:04:08.170> right<00:04:08.350> now<00:04:08.410> anyway<00:04:10.020> and

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
got kind of loose right now anyway and

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.050 
got kind of loose right now anyway and
then<00:04:11.760> in<00:04:12.760> the<00:04:13.180> flower<00:04:13.450> bed<00:04:13.750> here<00:04:14.050> I<00:04:14.260> I<00:04:14.880> pound<00:04:15.880> it

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
then in the flower bed here I I pound it

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.570 
then in the flower bed here I I pound it
in<00:04:16.209> a<00:04:16.420> oh<00:04:16.450> I<00:04:16.840> have<00:04:17.080> a<00:04:17.110> video<00:04:17.440> on<00:04:17.500> this<00:04:17.799> I<00:04:18.070> pounded

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
in a oh I have a video on this I pounded

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.370 
in a oh I have a video on this I pounded
in<00:04:18.730> a<00:04:18.790> ground<00:04:19.030> rod<00:04:19.299> about<00:04:20.140> six<00:04:20.500> feet<00:04:20.650> down<00:04:20.910> and

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
in a ground rod about six feet down and

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:30.540 
in a ground rod about six feet down and
I<00:04:24.000> have<00:04:25.000> a<00:04:25.030> a<00:04:27.300> device<00:04:28.300> there<00:04:28.660> that<00:04:29.410> well<00:04:30.340> it's

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
I have a a device there that well it's

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.150 
I have a a device there that well it's
like<00:04:30.670> a<00:04:30.700> lightning<00:04:31.000> suppressor<00:04:31.890> but<00:04:32.890> it's<00:04:33.070> a

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
like a lightning suppressor but it's a

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.510 
like a lightning suppressor but it's a
gas-filled<00:04:33.670> tube<00:04:34.000> and<00:04:34.540> when<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.740> it<00:04:36.100> picks<00:04:36.340> up

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
gas-filled tube and when the it picks up

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.000 
gas-filled tube and when the it picks up
like<00:04:36.790> a<00:04:37.210> nearby<00:04:37.660> lightning<00:04:38.170> strike<00:04:38.470> that<00:04:38.500> tube

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
like a nearby lightning strike that tube

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.210 
like a nearby lightning strike that tube
why<00:04:39.280> and<00:04:39.490> eyes<00:04:39.960> and<00:04:40.960> it'll<00:04:41.500> short<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:41.920> antenna

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
why and eyes and it'll short the antenna

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.180 
why and eyes and it'll short the antenna
out<00:04:42.430> to<00:04:42.580> ground<00:04:42.850> and<00:04:43.830> that's<00:04:44.830> to<00:04:45.040> protect

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
out to ground and that's to protect

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.740 
out to ground and that's to protect
Radio<00:04:45.790> if<00:04:45.910> there's<00:04:46.090> like<00:04:46.270> some<00:04:46.450> kind<00:04:46.660> of

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
Radio if there's like some kind of

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.860 
Radio if there's like some kind of
nearby<00:04:46.960> strike<00:04:47.760> but<00:04:48.760> a<00:04:48.790> direct<00:04:49.210> strike<00:04:49.510> on<00:04:49.750> the

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
nearby strike but a direct strike on the

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.930 
nearby strike but a direct strike on the
wire<00:04:50.080> would<00:04:50.440> probably<00:04:50.950> vaporize<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:51.730> wire

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
wire would probably vaporize the wire

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.060 
wire would probably vaporize the wire
and<00:04:53.220> so<00:04:54.220> why<00:04:54.640> worry<00:04:54.880> about<00:04:54.970> that<00:04:55.330> I<00:04:55.360> guess<00:04:56.070> and

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
and so why worry about that I guess and

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.690 
and so why worry about that I guess and
then<00:04:57.220> what<00:04:57.910> I<00:04:57.940> did<00:04:58.030> was<00:04:58.210> I<00:04:58.480> just<00:04:59.550> have<00:05:00.550> the

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
then what I did was I just have the

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.140 
then what I did was I just have the
connector<00:05:01.120> there<00:05:01.330> I<00:05:01.360> just<00:05:01.750> put<00:05:02.470> around<00:05:02.710> like<00:05:02.860> a

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
connector there I just put around like a

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.640 
connector there I just put around like a
quarter<00:05:04.150> inch<00:05:04.270> piece<00:05:04.480> of<00:05:04.660> plywood<00:05:04.870> and<00:05:05.380> I

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
quarter inch piece of plywood and I

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.310 
quarter inch piece of plywood and I
tried<00:05:05.920> using<00:05:06.190> the<00:05:06.870> like<00:05:07.870> something<00:05:08.230> like

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
tried using the like something like

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.320 
tried using the like something like
lucite<00:05:08.770> but<00:05:09.160> it<00:05:09.250> kept<00:05:09.400> cracking<00:05:09.880> so<00:05:10.120> I<00:05:10.150> just

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
lucite but it kept cracking so I just

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.260 
lucite but it kept cracking so I just
threw<00:05:10.510> it<00:05:10.570> on<00:05:10.660> plywood<00:05:11.200> for<00:05:11.800> now<00:05:12.060> and<00:05:13.060> that's

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
threw it on plywood for now and that's

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.960 
threw it on plywood for now and that's
low<00:05:13.540> loss<00:05:13.810> foam<00:05:14.230> cable<00:05:17.340> and<00:05:18.340> I<00:05:18.400> got<00:05:18.610> that<00:05:18.790> from

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
low loss foam cable and I got that from

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.740 
low loss foam cable and I got that from
some<00:05:19.360> guy<00:05:19.510> called<00:05:19.810> the<00:05:19.900> wire<00:05:20.140> man<00:05:20.430> in<00:05:21.430> a<00:05:22.150> super8

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
some guy called the wire man in a super8

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:32.690 
some guy called the wire man in a super8
low<00:05:23.080> loss<00:05:26.490> cable<00:05:27.490> there's<00:05:27.850> the<00:05:28.030> number<00:05:28.390> there

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
weather I could just take the cable I

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.700 
weather I could just take the cable I
get<00:06:19.150> just<00:06:19.360> like<00:06:19.450> fling<00:06:20.020> it<00:06:20.140> right<00:06:20.260> into<00:06:20.470> the

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
get just like fling it right into the

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.150 
get just like fling it right into the
yard

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 
yard

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.660 
yard
and<00:06:21.760> there's<00:06:22.750> no<00:06:22.870> chance<00:06:22.900> of<00:06:23.350> any<00:06:23.440> less<00:06:24.250> risky

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.670 
and there's no chance of any less risky

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.130 
and there's no chance of any less risky
or<00:06:24.760> lightning<00:06:25.150> coming<00:06:25.420> into<00:06:25.510> the<00:06:25.720> house<00:06:25.870> at

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.140 
or lightning coming into the house at

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.680 
or lightning coming into the house at
all<00:06:26.970> and<00:06:27.970> that's<00:06:28.090> why<00:06:28.360> I<00:06:28.390> use<00:06:28.690> the<00:06:28.960> fiberglass

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
all and that's why I use the fiberglass

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.830 
all and that's why I use the fiberglass
extendable<00:06:31.690> -<00:06:31.870> Pole<00:06:32.140> -<00:06:32.500> because<00:06:33.400> I<00:06:33.840> didn't

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
extendable - Pole - because I didn't

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.690 
extendable - Pole - because I didn't
want<00:06:34.900> to<00:06:35.080> hook<00:06:35.230> anything<00:06:35.470> directly<00:06:36.370> to<00:06:36.580> the

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:36.700 
want to hook anything directly to the

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.780 
want to hook anything directly to the
house<00:06:37.410> so<00:06:38.410> it's<00:06:38.770> away<00:06:39.040> from<00:06:39.070> the<00:06:39.370> house<00:06:39.520> and

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:39.790 
house so it's away from the house and

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.450 
house so it's away from the house and
all<00:06:39.880> that<00:06:40.090> and<00:06:40.300> that's<00:06:40.450> just<00:06:40.690> for<00:06:40.900> like<00:06:41.460> safety

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 
all that and that's just for like safety

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.720 
all that and that's just for like safety
then<00:06:42.850> I<00:06:42.970> could<00:06:43.120> take<00:06:43.300> it<00:06:43.450> down<00:06:43.480> if<00:06:43.840> I<00:06:43.960> want<00:06:44.730> so

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:45.730 
then I could take it down if I want so

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.330 
then I could take it down if I want so
that's<00:06:45.910> all<00:06:46.060> what<00:06:46.240> that's<00:06:46.420> all<00:06:46.630> about

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
that's all what that's all about

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.500
