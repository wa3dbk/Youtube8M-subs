over<00:01:07.890> here<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.460> little<00:01:08.700> plastic<00:01:08.909> piece

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
over here and the little plastic piece

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.929 
over here and the little plastic piece
is<00:01:09.479> where<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.780> numbers<00:01:10.500> hit<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.010> they<00:01:11.490> print

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
is where the numbers hit and they print

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.590 
is where the numbers hit and they print
the<00:01:12.180> actual<00:01:12.570> labels<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.530> take<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.100> and

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
the actual labels so you take this and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.670 
the actual labels so you take this and
you<00:01:17.360> would<00:01:18.360> push<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.049> it's<00:01:19.170> not<00:01:19.350> it's

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
you would push this and it's not it's

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.219 
you would push this and it's not it's
not<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:21.090> easy<00:01:21.299> because<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:21.780> such<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> small

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
not so so easy because it's such a small

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.539 
not so so easy because it's such a small
part<00:01:22.820> so<00:01:23.820> even<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.930> know<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.049> would<00:01:25.409> even<00:01:25.890> make

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
part so even you know I would even make

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.499 
part so even you know I would even make
this<00:01:26.729> more<00:01:27.030> convenient<00:01:27.619> fold<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.920> tape<00:01:29.159> and

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
this more convenient fold the tape and

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.380 
this more convenient fold the tape and
rip<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.890> again<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.579> it's<00:01:32.759> smooth

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
rip it again so it's smooth

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.030 
rip it again so it's smooth
so<00:01:33.659> anything<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.229> got<00:01:34.500> caught<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
so anything that got caught in the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.640 
so anything that got caught in the
original<00:01:35.430> part<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:36.240> make<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.570> smooth<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.170> I

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
original part you make it smooth and I

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.410 
original part you make it smooth and I
would<00:01:41.780> push<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.930> under<00:01:43.140> here<00:01:43.399> trying<00:01:44.399> up<00:01:45.030> and

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
would push it under here trying up and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.539 
would push it under here trying up and
it<00:01:46.320> feels<00:01:46.530> great<00:01:46.740> when<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.070> push<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.399> through

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
it feels great when you push it through

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.120 
it feels great when you push it through
so<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:48.750> push<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.170> down<00:01:49.200> here<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.770> see<00:01:49.950> it's

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
so you push it down here so see it's

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.310 
so you push it down here so see it's
rolling<00:01:50.579> under<00:01:50.820> there<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.299> it's<00:01:51.659> going<00:01:51.869> under

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
rolling under there and it's going under

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.870 
rolling under there and it's going under
the<00:01:52.470> thing<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.829> it's<00:01:53.009> coming<00:01:53.340> out<00:01:53.490> by<00:01:53.670> these

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the thing and it's coming out by these

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.149 
the thing and it's coming out by these
little<00:01:54.060> Rolly<00:01:54.840> things<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.799> pull<00:01:56.009> it

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
little Rolly things and you pull it

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.120 
little Rolly things and you pull it
through<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:57.270> again<00:01:57.840> grab<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.799> trigger

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
through and you again grab the trigger

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.880 
through and you again grab the trigger
so<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.700> can<00:01:59.969> pull<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.420> label<00:02:00.719> through<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.829> you

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
so you can pull the label through so you

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.289 
so you can pull the label through so you
pull<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.310> through<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:03.740> little<00:02:04.740> bit<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.299> then

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299
