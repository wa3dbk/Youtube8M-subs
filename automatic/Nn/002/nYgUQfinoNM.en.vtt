side once we do our drag we need to make
sure<00:01:58.970> that<00:01:59.150> we're<00:01:59.270> using<00:01:59.300> our<00:01:59.660> body<00:01:59.869> to

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
sure that we're using our body to

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.109 
sure that we're using our body to
protect<00:02:00.440> the<00:02:00.530> ball<00:02:00.770> so<00:02:01.310> we<00:02:01.400> can<00:02:01.550> actually<00:02:01.700> put

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
protect the ball so we can actually put

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.380 
protect the ball so we can actually put
that<00:02:02.630> ball<00:02:03.080> position<00:02:03.590> towards<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:04.580> goal<00:02:04.759> just

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
that ball position towards the goal just

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.150 
that ball position towards the goal just
to<00:02:05.540> be<00:02:05.630> clear<00:02:05.840> from<00:02:06.020> a<00:02:06.200> technical<00:02:06.710> point<00:02:06.979> of

also the defender will retreat because

the balls going towards the goal when
you<00:03:02.700> hit<00:03:03.000> it<00:03:03.030> now<00:03:03.990> we're<00:03:04.170> going<00:03:04.320> to<00:03:04.410> flip<00:03:04.620> it

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
you hit it now we're going to flip it

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.290 
you hit it now we're going to flip it
bring<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.490> the<00:03:05.550> left<00:03:05.730> hand<00:03:05.790> side<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.240> the

bring it to the left hand side of the

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.150 
bring it to the left hand side of the
field<00:03:06.510> it's<00:03:06.960> a<00:03:07.140> little<00:03:07.350> bit<00:03:07.440> harder<00:03:07.770> let's<00:03:08.010> see

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
field it's a little bit harder let's see

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.950 
field it's a little bit harder let's see
how<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:08.310> go<00:03:08.460> so<00:03:09.030> these<00:03:09.150> yellow<00:03:09.330> cones<00:03:09.750> are

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
how you go so these yellow cones are

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.380 
how you go so these yellow cones are
actually<00:03:10.260> an<00:03:10.350> indication<00:03:10.740> of<00:03:11.160> which<00:03:11.850> angle

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
actually an indication of which angle

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.600 
actually an indication of which angle
the<00:03:12.540> ball<00:03:12.720> needs<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.080> be<00:03:13.200> traveling<00:03:13.680> when<00:03:14.460> it's

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
the ball needs to be traveling when it's

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.550 
the ball needs to be traveling when it's
being<00:03:14.730> hit<00:03:15.000> at<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.300> goal<00:03:15.510> it's<00:03:15.990> just<00:03:16.320> like<00:03:16.470> the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
being hit at the goal it's just like the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.020 
being hit at the goal it's just like the
other<00:03:16.590> side<00:03:16.920> approaching<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.490> opposite<00:03:17.850> foot

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
other side approaching the opposite foot

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.240 
other side approaching the opposite foot
from<00:03:18.720> this<00:03:18.870> position<00:03:19.050> you<00:03:19.470> need<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.620> sharp<00:03:19.920> trip

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
from this position you need a sharp trip

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.400 
from this position you need a sharp trip
drag<00:03:20.550> outside<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.600> line<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:21.990> defender

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
drag outside the line of the defender

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.530 
drag outside the line of the defender
from<00:03:23.190> here<00:03:23.430> we<00:03:23.550> need<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.730> get<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.000> back<00:03:24.210> into<00:03:24.450> a

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
from here we need to get it back into a

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.740 
from here we need to get it back into a
strong<00:03:24.930> position<00:03:25.670> into<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.700> line<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.300> where

the corner of the goal so technically

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.460 
the corner of the goal so technically
the<00:03:35.820> deceptive<00:03:36.330> part<00:03:36.600> is<00:03:36.840> getting<00:03:37.050> them<00:03:37.290> to

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
the deceptive part is getting them to

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.920 
the deceptive part is getting them to

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
defender if you do the technique run you

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.450 
defender if you do the technique run you
was<00:04:23.780> already<00:04:24.200> baiting<00:04:24.590> the<00:04:24.710> defender<00:04:25.160> so<00:04:25.280> it's
