00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.810
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.360
 wm forecast of the second day of play today 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.849
 it goes with Germany against the 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.740
 Ghanaian national football team 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.680
 here we see again the table of 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.740
 current status of things Germany and 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.119
 the usa leads group g with each 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.070
 three points 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.070
 yes there was in the whole story 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.380
 just two games against Germany 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.880
 ghana but before I do that again 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.430
 We'll see you talking down here 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.250
 we're just setting up like you yes 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.380
 my opinion after at least on 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.230
 most likely is the German 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.860
 here and now just here 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.920
 the same again from ghana 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.500
 mats hummels is hurt 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.090
 So most likely then 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.370
 do not play because of one 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.110
 thigh bruise 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.030
 for that I have first boateng in 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.510
 let the internal defense move and 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.090
 Mustafi in the right of defense 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.990
 Much said there were two games now 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.310
 Germany against Ghana at all and 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.320
 the last of them at the last wm 2010 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.830
 also in the group phase and 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.670
 germany has so very close with 1 0 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.890
 won 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.930
 That was when you go back there 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.970
 reminds in a relatively happy victory so 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.950
 at least in this game it is like this 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.040
 Ghana has a lot of pressure 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.530
 makes German national team even 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.140
 can not get far forward and 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.939
 we already have the 1 0 of ghana 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.100
 Achieved by true excites here 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.070
 but again absolutely 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.250
 earned so far because germany 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.170
 I do not have that much here yet 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.970
 compiled a few graphics though 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.080
 here kwadwo asamoah 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.910
 and mario gÃ¶tze the two he what means 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.070
 Playmaker Germany certainly have 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.170
 another two playmakers, but more 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.690
 kwadwo asamoah on which it was on everyone 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.730
 Watching the match is also preferred 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.580
 quite happy in the left middle field side 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:20.140
 or on the left middle field side 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.640
 club is juventus turin and yes so with 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.260
 safety is currently the best 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.800
 player of ghana 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.920
 since anyway the supposedly best 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:33.700
 African team so here at the ester 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.500
 just ghana bothers very early leaves the 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.850
 German national team not at all 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.070
 come far forward and here have the 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:44.530
 next graduation from monterrey 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.610
 however here we are kept from newer 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.660
 are already in the second here 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.640
 half 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.680
 and here we see the same times 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.050
 changer replacements by north 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.720
 not changed 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.850
 there is a corner here and a good one 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.830
 counter opportunity for Germany by 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.290
 the newly arrived lukas 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.090
 podolski 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.150
 and there is the counter opportunity too 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.769
 already history 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.330
 With Germany being fast soon 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.580
 repeatedly because it's back here on 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.530
 lukas podolski makes a steep pass 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.380
 over to miroslav klose also 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:23.620
 substitutes and he makes the 1 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:26.080
 1 in the 74 minute so he is pleased 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.160
 Here again everything is again a necessity for 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.140
 Germany and yes 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.190
 and to germany first of all a good one 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.680
 could compensate 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.480
 However, you have to say ghana instead 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.290
 really early and we have 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.670
 again or not so bad idea 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.080
 lupfer manuel new culture in the net 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.690
 I keep momentum here are the 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.660
 corner goes 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.890
 I'll let Montani know it was there 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.120
 See you again in the repetition 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.080
 the shot goes but the header goes 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.610
 to the latte and that was also 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.110
 at the same time the last chance 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.490
 after that is not really much anymore 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.620
 happens in the game i thank you for 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.360
 I hope we see each other then 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.360
 initially loose job again
