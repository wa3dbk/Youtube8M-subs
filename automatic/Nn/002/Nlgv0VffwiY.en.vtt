00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
right now now it shows all of the frames

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.930 
right now now it shows all of the frames
of<00:01:59.110> the<00:01:59.229> animation<00:01:59.259> in<00:01:59.979> this<00:02:00.220> gif<00:02:00.459> you'll

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
of the animation in this gif you'll

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.130 
of the animation in this gif you'll
notice<00:02:01.179> that<00:02:01.270> Camtasia<00:02:01.690> has<00:02:01.869> already

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
notice that Camtasia has already

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.290 
notice that Camtasia has already
optimized<00:02:02.619> this<00:02:02.800> however<00:02:03.459> you<00:02:03.759> mean<00:02:03.879> we<00:02:04.149> need

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
optimized this however you mean we need

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.150 
optimized this however you mean we need
to<00:02:04.420> do<00:02:04.539> some<00:02:04.720> trimming<00:02:04.899> to<00:02:05.080> this<00:02:05.229> so<00:02:05.530> we<00:02:05.950> should

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
to do some trimming to this so we should

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.999 
to do some trimming to this so we should
probably<00:02:06.369> unoptimized<00:02:06.849> that<00:02:07.239> right<00:02:07.390> now

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
probably unoptimized that right now

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.030 
probably unoptimized that right now
which<00:02:09.009> makes<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.340> gift<00:02:09.550> seven<00:02:10.179> megabytes<00:02:11.040> now

which makes the gift seven megabytes now

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.680 
which makes the gift seven megabytes now
what<00:02:12.190> makes<00:02:12.340> this<00:02:12.550> program<00:02:12.760> great<00:02:13.239> is<00:02:13.480> its

let me just say it needs to be under a

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.449 
let me just say it needs to be under a
megabyte<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:07.260> next<00:03:07.530> best<00:03:07.709> thing<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.040> do<00:03:08.250> is

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
megabyte the next best thing to do is

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.500 
megabyte the next best thing to do is
resize<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.420> can<00:03:10.109> resize<00:03:10.890> everything<00:03:11.069> to<00:03:11.819> 320<00:03:12.420> by

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
resize I can resize everything to 320 by

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.530 
resize I can resize everything to 320 by
240<00:03:12.980> boom<00:03:13.980> just<00:03:14.159> like<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.569> still<00:03:15.569> 1<00:03:17.329> or<00:03:18.329> is<00:03:18.420> it

240 boom just like that still 1 or is it

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:26.080 
240 boom just like that still 1 or is it
just<00:03:18.569> over<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.200> Meg<00:03:20.150> Whitwell<00:03:21.180> oh<00:03:23.930> dear<00:03:24.930> um

before<00:03:27.090> we<00:03:27.329> resize<00:03:27.950> let<00:03:28.950> Sun<00:03:29.129> optimize<00:03:29.549> that's

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
before we resize let Sun optimize that's

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.149 
before we resize let Sun optimize that's
a<00:03:29.849> good<00:03:30.030> lesson<00:03:30.239> always<00:03:31.019> unoptimized<00:03:31.500> before

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
a good lesson always unoptimized before

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.119 
a good lesson always unoptimized before
you<00:03:32.310> do<00:03:32.519> anything<00:03:33.620> because<00:03:34.620> weird<00:03:34.889> things

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
you do anything because weird things

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:44.470 
you do anything because weird things
happen<00:03:35.430> otherwise

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.680 

okay<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:46.500> next<00:03:46.739> easiest<00:03:46.859> way<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.510> reduce<00:03:48.510> the

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
okay the next easiest way to reduce the

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.240 
okay the next easiest way to reduce the
size<00:03:48.900> of<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.049> gif<00:03:49.230> is<00:03:49.379> to<00:03:49.470> trim<00:03:49.680> out<00:03:49.799> some<00:03:49.949> frames

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
size of a gif is to trim out some frames

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.449 
size of a gif is to trim out some frames
let's<00:03:50.910> see<00:03:51.120> here<00:03:51.419> oh<00:03:51.980> yeah<00:03:52.980> we<00:03:53.099> can<00:03:53.220> cut<00:03:53.340> out<00:03:53.430> a

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
let's see here oh yeah we can cut out a

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.409 
let's see here oh yeah we can cut out a
couple<00:03:53.669> of<00:03:53.760> frames<00:03:53.910> at<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.150> end<00:03:56.239> it's<00:03:57.239> as<00:03:57.329> easy

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
couple of frames at the end it's as easy

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.629 
couple of frames at the end it's as easy
as<00:03:57.659> clicking<00:03:57.870> on<00:03:58.019> them<00:03:58.370> mashing<00:03:59.370> delete<00:03:59.609> a

as clicking on them mashing delete a

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:04.990 
as clicking on them mashing delete a
couple<00:03:59.909> times<00:04:02.900> optimize<00:04:03.900> once<00:04:04.139> more

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
couple times optimize once more

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.869 
couple times optimize once more
not<00:04:06.000> quite<00:04:06.769> there's<00:04:07.769> not<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.310> cup<00:04:08.459> of<00:04:08.579> frame<00:04:08.729> or

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
not quite there's not a cup of frame or

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:16.759 
not quite there's not a cup of frame or
two<00:04:08.909> with<00:04:09.090> beginning<00:04:12.290> one<00:04:13.290> more<00:04:15.560> okay<00:04:16.560> now

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
two with beginning one more okay now

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.879 
two with beginning one more okay now
it's<00:04:16.949> under<00:04:17.099> a<00:04:17.220> Meg<00:04:17.930> it's<00:04:18.930> kind<00:04:19.199> of<00:04:19.260> nice<00:04:19.440> for

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
it's under a Meg it's kind of nice for

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.159 
it's under a Meg it's kind of nice for
the<00:04:20.220> last<00:04:20.430> frame<00:04:20.789> if<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.359> animation<00:04:21.930> is<00:04:22.109> not

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
the last frame if the animation is not

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.310 
the last frame if the animation is not
seamless<00:04:23.449> extend<00:04:24.449> it<00:04:24.539> a<00:04:24.599> little<00:04:24.780> bit<00:04:24.930> instead

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
seamless extend it a little bit instead

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.600 
seamless extend it a little bit instead
of<00:04:25.409> six<00:04:25.650> one<00:04:25.800> hundredth<00:04:26.099> of<00:04:26.159> a<00:04:26.220> second<00:04:26.550> I'll

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
of six one hundredth of a second I'll

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:35.830 
of six one hundredth of a second I'll
bump<00:04:26.940> it<00:04:27.060> up<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.180> 60<00:04:29.510> yeah

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.910 

okay<00:04:36.840> yeah<00:04:37.080> that<00:04:37.290> looks<00:04:37.470> pretty<00:04:37.650> good

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
okay yeah that looks pretty good

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.250 
okay yeah that looks pretty good
another<00:04:38.610> way<00:04:38.910> to<00:04:38.940> reduce<00:04:39.480> the<00:04:39.720> amount<00:04:39.840> to<00:04:40.020> fast

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
another way to reduce the amount to fast

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.650 
another way to reduce the amount to fast
or<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.800> size<00:04:41.010> of<00:04:41.160> a<00:04:41.310> gif<00:04:41.940> is<00:04:42.120> to<00:04:42.300> reduce<00:04:42.570> the

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
or the size of a gif is to reduce the

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.010 
or the size of a gif is to reduce the
number<00:04:42.870> of<00:04:42.900> colors<00:04:44.240> Camtasia<00:04:45.240> defaults<00:04:45.900> to

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
number of colors Camtasia defaults to

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.850 
number of colors Camtasia defaults to
128<00:04:46.650> which<00:04:46.890> is<00:04:47.070> way<00:04:47.550> way<00:04:48.090> too<00:04:48.150> much<00:04:48.450> at<00:04:49.170> 64

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
128 which is way way too much at 64

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.350 
128 which is way way too much at 64
colors<00:04:50.100> you<00:04:50.460> probably<00:04:50.820> won't<00:04:50.970> even<00:04:51.180> notice

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
colors you probably won't even notice

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.680 
colors you probably won't even notice
the<00:04:51.630> difference<00:04:51.660> at<00:04:52.730> 232<00:04:53.730> it<00:04:54.120> starts<00:04:54.450> getting
