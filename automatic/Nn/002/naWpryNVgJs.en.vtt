with it

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.209 
with it
you<00:00:47.969> know<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.120> bench<00:00:48.899> with<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.500> do<00:00:49.770> squats

with it it makes everything much tougher

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.889 
with it it makes everything much tougher
another<00:00:53.670> cool<00:00:53.910> thing<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.390> if<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.570> notice

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
another cool thing is that if you notice

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.229 
another cool thing is that if you notice
it<00:00:55.649> comes<00:00:55.920> with<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.550> sides<00:00:56.760> they're<00:00:57.059> a

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
it comes with on the sides they're a

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.729 
it comes with on the sides they're a
bunch<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.829> different<00:00:58.829> tips<00:00:59.809> of<00:01:00.809> different

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
bunch of different tips of different

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.439 
bunch of different tips of different
size<00:01:01.920> holes<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.730> know<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.879> got<00:01:03.090> some<00:01:03.270> big

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
size holes you know you got some big

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.890 
size holes you know you got some big
holes<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.250> then<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.430> got<00:01:06.290> some<00:01:07.290> smalls<00:01:07.590> and

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
holes and then you got some smalls and

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.880 
holes and then you got some smalls and
obviously<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.080> more<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.290> progress<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.860> more

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
obviously the more you progress the more

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.710 
obviously the more you progress the more
you<00:01:11.100> use<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.580> better<00:01:12.240> off<00:01:12.360> you're<00:01:12.600> going

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
you use it the better off you're going

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.679 
you use it the better off you're going
to<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.960> easier<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.950> get<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.729> that's<00:01:15.240> when<00:01:15.420> you

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
to be easier to get and that's when you

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.270 
to be easier to get and that's when you
start<00:01:15.990> using<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.320> smaller<00:01:16.590> holes<00:01:16.770> but<00:01:17.220> I

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
start using the smaller holes but I

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.380 
start using the smaller holes but I
would<00:01:17.460> definitely<00:01:17.759> recommend<00:01:17.850> picking<00:01:18.210> one

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
would definitely recommend picking one

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.330 
would definitely recommend picking one
of<00:01:18.540> these<00:01:18.600> up<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.960> have<00:01:19.200> these<00:01:19.770> available<00:01:20.250> for

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
of these up I have these available for

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.490 
of these up I have these available for
my<00:01:20.430> athletes<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:20.939> at<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.119> pit<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.570> it

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
my athletes here at the pit and it

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.539 
my athletes here at the pit and it
definitely<00:01:22.680> makes<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.070> difference<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.460> their

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
definitely makes a difference in their

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.590 
definitely makes a difference in their
conditioning<00:01:24.030> those<00:01:24.720> who<00:01:24.930> use<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:26.450> without<00:01:27.450> a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
conditioning those who use it without a

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.450 
conditioning those who use it without a
doubt<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.650> stupid<00:01:29.040> little<00:01:29.189> thing

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
doubt and it's a stupid little thing

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.190 
doubt and it's a stupid little thing
like<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:29.759> kind<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.390> common<00:01:30.720> sense<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.079> it

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
like it's kind of common sense but it

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.080 
like it's kind of common sense but it
works<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:33.770> you<00:01:34.770> know<00:01:34.890> pick<00:01:35.610> one<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.939> these<00:01:36.030> up

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
works so you know pick one of these up

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.580 
works so you know pick one of these up
if<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.600> haven't<00:01:36.810> seen<00:01:37.079> them<00:01:37.200> yet<00:01:37.259> they're

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
if you haven't seen them yet they're

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.499 
if you haven't seen them yet they're
pretty<00:01:37.890> inexpensive<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.549> think<00:01:38.759> like<00:01:38.880> 50<00:01:39.299> bucks

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
pretty inexpensive I think like 50 bucks

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.690 
pretty inexpensive I think like 50 bucks
but<00:01:39.720> it'll<00:01:40.500> last<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.799> forever<00:01:40.950> it's<00:01:41.310> washable

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
but it'll last you forever it's washable
