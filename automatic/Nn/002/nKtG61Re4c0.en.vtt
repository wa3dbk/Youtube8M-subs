00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.790
 taking advantage of the small detour picture by the church of the twelfth man is needed 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.049
 the church that has a particularity is this pot gallery 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.550
 at the time the lord of the place and the keys of the city that was the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.380
 same person so he lived here in the deanery and to get to 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.070
 the sunny office and probably without confreres the crowd of faithful 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.560
 he gets this little boy built to win 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.369
 which today is a private dwelling 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.780
 now my little bit the common we go in will see 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.900
 will see these very particular regions that is making a 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.710
 peninsula 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.609
 between the Loire and the Vienne 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:41.609
 a particular country we will take you right away 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.300
 the badger is a little triangle bermuda touraine wedged between 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.510
 the waters of the country of the Loire is a land of water 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.990
 partially only to dry by man 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.560
 a flood zone conducive to activities such as hunting and fishing 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.570
 with also a little breeding cut off from the world this territory to keep this mode 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.570
 of traditional life 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.240
 Hello 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.600
 Hello me 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.100
 so why did you make us want to come here 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.390
 it's a place I like a lot called at 20h 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.960
 It's a little bit better 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.960
 and in fact we went quite edge of Vienna in the grove 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.310
 what's interesting here is that the other in the chain were showing 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.110
 regularly every winter 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.150
 so we have a habitat perfectly adapted to the area 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.480
 look at the entrance 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.400
 it is actually the equivalent of a first benefit the result is 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.310
 that we are shown in winter there the house remains out of water obviously for the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.960
 trips 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.619
 the most used the boat 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.619
 and that people have it close to a farm they are used to 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.619
 the inhabitants of the rhÃ´ne le 10 sport 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.900
 floods as a plague 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.040
 listen delivering his mandate is not a problem when we know 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.360
 combining every year and that the house is built for that 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.640
 in this case all entirely adapted 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.700
 your house is out of water very regularly your trips have had 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.510
 place to barkin he informs me it was going very deep some 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.119
 put less electrical equipment today but for these houses will be 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.180
 electrified 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.500
 they are not all size it's all year you have right next 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.749
 a sphere where the legs 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:17.239
 tidy has survived but not yet worn his whims are planned 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.369
 visible more it rises slowly during floods 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:23.540
 the river is also a means of communication 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.390
 to bring us to the confluence when to saint martin we can count 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.970
 on amaranth a reproduction of traditional all year case but 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.600
 with all the modern comforts 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.390
 in this beautiful boat you can dine and once you have thrown anchored 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.390
 can even sleep in the middle of the river 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.100
 in the past the night on the boat 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.860
 the amaranth who usually to whom and what a child thinks so what 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.089
 interest to spend the night 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:59.019
 on this boat here it is simply that the trend remains 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.119
 there to see the magic because every moment on a cloud of the 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:04.649
 color of the sun 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:08.619
 for them to return to the tufa they are possible different that 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:10.059
 waiting for us every moment 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.679
 thals and saffron
