are<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.420> middle<00:03:57.630> wrecking<00:03:58.440> this<00:03:58.590> base

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
are the middle wrecking this base

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.910 
are the middle wrecking this base
absolutely<00:03:59.940> wrecking<00:04:00.299> this<00:04:00.420> base<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:01.739> other

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
absolutely wrecking this base the other

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.590

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
one was so open I think that's why the

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.789 
one was so open I think that's why the
Dragons<00:04:04.079> died<00:04:04.200> because<00:04:04.410> they<00:04:04.560> just<00:04:04.680> got
