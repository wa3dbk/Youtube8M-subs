getting<00:01:52.470> back<00:01:52.740> into<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.040> swing<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.399> things

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
getting back into the swing of things

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.149 
getting back into the swing of things
basically<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.390> guess<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.380> what<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.740> point<00:01:55.979> of

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
basically I guess is what the point of

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.889 
basically I guess is what the point of
this<00:01:56.219> commentary<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.880> if<00:01:57.180> there<00:01:57.390> was<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> point

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
this commentary is if there was a point

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:58.870 
this commentary is if there was a point
to<00:01:58.200> begin<00:01:58.439> with

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
to begin with

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.270 
to begin with
but<00:01:59.659> you<00:01:59.899> know<00:02:00.020> normally<00:02:00.530> in<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.130> beginning

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
but you know normally in the beginning

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.190 
but you know normally in the beginning
of<00:02:01.579> each<00:02:01.700> semester<00:02:01.909> in<00:02:02.329> college<00:02:02.360> it<00:02:02.810> takes<00:02:03.049> me

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
of each semester in college it takes me

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.080 
of each semester in college it takes me
a<00:02:03.229> while<00:02:03.409> to<00:02:03.469> adjust<00:02:03.799> to<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.460> whole<00:02:04.579> schedule

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
a while to adjust to the whole schedule

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.789 
a while to adjust to the whole schedule
because<00:02:05.299> every<00:02:05.810> semester<00:02:06.170> in<00:02:06.409> college<00:02:06.439> is

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
because every semester in college is

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.740 
because every semester in college is
completely<00:02:07.220> different<00:02:07.549> as<00:02:07.640> far<00:02:07.670> as<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.450> times

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
completely different as far as the times

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.240 
completely different as far as the times
that<00:02:08.989> you<00:02:09.110> have<00:02:09.349> your<00:02:09.470> classes<00:02:09.979> and

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
that you have your classes and

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.070 
that you have your classes and
everything<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.940> you<00:02:11.480> know<00:02:11.569> you<00:02:11.630> have<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:11.870> get

fun<00:05:02.680> play<00:05:03.520> of<00:05:03.640> the<00:05:03.700> game<00:05:03.730> right<00:05:04.030> here<00:05:04.090> because

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
fun play of the game right here because

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.670 
fun play of the game right here because
i'm<00:05:04.540> not<00:05:04.690> really<00:05:04.810> doing<00:05:04.900> anything<00:05:05.380> for<00:05:05.560> my

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
i'm not really doing anything for my

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.990 
i'm not really doing anything for my
team<00:05:05.890> i<00:05:05.919> mean<00:05:06.160> i<00:05:06.250> guess<00:05:06.400> i'm<00:05:06.550> cutting<00:05:06.850> off<00:05:06.970> a

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
team i mean i guess i'm cutting off a

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.030 
team i mean i guess i'm cutting off a
choke<00:05:07.300> point<00:05:07.330> but<00:05:07.840> i<00:05:08.050> think<00:05:08.740> they<00:05:08.830> end<00:05:08.950> up

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
choke point but i think they end up

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.879 
choke point but i think they end up
capturing<00:05:09.400> a<00:05:09.729> point<00:05:10.000> or<00:05:10.150> something<00:05:10.479> but

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:10.889 
capturing a point or something but

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:12.920 
capturing a point or something but

the reason I haven't posted up a couple

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.100 
the reason I haven't posted up a couple

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
videos which is kind of the reason I

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.390 
videos which is kind of the reason I
decided<00:06:49.410> to<00:06:49.500> do<00:06:49.620> this<00:06:49.770> comment<00:06:50.130> here<00:06:50.220> because

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
decided to do this comment here because

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.440 
decided to do this comment here because
I<00:06:50.430> haven't<00:06:50.580> posted<00:06:50.760> up<00:06:50.970> a<00:06:51.030> video<00:06:51.180> to<00:06:51.360> my

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:51.450 
I haven't posted up a video to my

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.130 
I haven't posted up a video to my
channel<00:06:51.750> a<00:06:51.810> couple<00:06:52.080> days<00:06:52.260> and<00:06:52.520> i<00:06:53.720> put<00:06:54.720> the<00:06:54.930> next

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:55.140 
channel a couple days and i put the next

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.750 
channel a couple days and i put the next
one<00:06:55.290> in<00:06:55.620> the<00:06:55.710> series<00:06:55.920> is<00:06:56.220> going<00:06:56.490> up<00:06:56.610> on

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:56.760 
one in the series is going up on

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.090 
one in the series is going up on
machinima<00:06:57.180> and<00:06:57.600> for<00:06:58.530> some<00:06:58.680> reason<00:06:58.710> it's

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 
machinima and for some reason it's

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.830 
machinima and for some reason it's
taking<00:06:59.130> them<00:06:59.490> an<00:06:59.610> extra<00:06:59.850> long<00:07:00.120> time<00:07:00.420> to<00:07:00.600> get<00:07:00.750> it

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 
taking them an extra long time to get it

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.950 
taking them an extra long time to get it
up<00:07:00.990> this<00:07:01.680> time<00:07:01.740> around<00:07:02.100> so<00:07:02.810> there<00:07:03.810> might<00:07:03.900> be

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 
up this time around so there might be

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.330 
up this time around so there might be
like<00:07:04.260> a<00:07:04.290> little<00:07:04.620> bit<00:07:04.740> of<00:07:04.830> a<00:07:04.890> delay<00:07:05.160> in<00:07:05.190> the

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 
like a little bit of a delay in the

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.790 
like a little bit of a delay in the
series<00:07:05.760> but<00:07:05.790> as<00:07:06.090> soon<00:07:06.240> as<00:07:06.420> they<00:07:07.230> do<00:07:07.290> post<00:07:07.650> that
