yet<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:58.860> we<00:01:58.979> don't<00:01:59.009> know<00:01:59.310> how<00:01:59.640> large<00:01:59.969> the

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
yet so we don't know how large the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.270 
yet so we don't know how large the
damage<00:02:00.509> increase<00:02:00.869> will<00:02:01.049> be<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.469> gun<00:02:01.710> but

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
damage increase will be on the gun but

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.920 
damage increase will be on the gun but
my<00:02:02.399> suspicion<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.270> hitting<00:02:03.509> two<00:02:03.659> body

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
my suspicion is that hitting two body

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.780 
my suspicion is that hitting two body
shots<00:02:04.229> will<00:02:04.439> allow<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.740> next<00:02:05.130> precision<00:02:05.579> shot

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
shots will allow the next precision shot

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.960 
shots will allow the next precision shot
to<00:02:06.240> finish<00:02:06.390> off<00:02:06.689> an<00:02:06.840> enemy<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.290> PvP<00:02:07.860> either<00:02:08.550> way

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
to finish off an enemy in PvP either way
