00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:16.320
 hey people what can you here with 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.980
 a new video and today with something completely 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.050
 new to me was written often and me 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.510
 I also know the first of friends 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.390
 make sharp easier so play 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.400
 out or the best way to do it 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.550
 so what risk do you show like that 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.890
 that does the best and I have one 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.770
 a few clips cut together for you 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.450
 They are really out of the game 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.670
 the goal was how to do it 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.420
 best ski station schlussmann it am 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.960
 best power so let's start with that 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.600
 video here in this example you see 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.070
 as i have tried i am 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.170
 failed but stupid average 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.210
 Lankl I have the ball recovered 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.100
 the simple 3 match made 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.230
 unlimited in the long shot 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.739
 that the most effective way to score goals 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.840
 they will always be and here 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.630
 i just got together with manchester united 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.130
 simply looking for the player of the gap 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.450
 good and there is robin 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.950
 van persie offered 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.170
 But then I'm back in the long 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.509
 shot just like you next 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.840
 For example, I just have the long one 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.310
 ball pushed through access bale and 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.409
 Gameplay fast has the physical 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.240
 stronger good graduation is also running 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.700
 Run up and shoot again 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.369
 the long corner is so effective 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.259
 easy and last example of this 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.720
 We come to the gate after what I do 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.200
 just brought with me 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.210
 run simply super screamo movie 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.759
 then put in again with one sooner 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.619
 shot this time also to the gates if 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.930
 You also want to do that 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.090
 pay attention to what the player has one 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.850
 player has the general super shot 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.369
 has resisted and 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.119
 In the course of this timer you can easily 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.500
 keep the circle button pressed and then 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.830
 We do not need much power like that 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.810
 I think one to two and the ball is 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.250
 but if you have a game now 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.560
 he does not think so well now i have him 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.600
 then maybe you should join him 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.040
 shoots which is then better control and when 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.230
 Last example Ronaldo does not fit 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.900
 necessary but there it is just safe 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.670
 of course, always come seriously 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.130
 there is always safe in it 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.630
 sometimes also goes against the fund so 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.610
 you just have to try it out and 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.720
 then you see how that works in mine 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.840
 next example I have with gary 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.910
 trail ball adopted l1 made pass 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.170
 then he walks alone to the front and 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.000
 then it has to be at the northwall 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.970
 skip over and he does a whole 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.920
 easy as just what exactly had earlier 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.840
 I try to attack again 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.420
 He did a lot of fun there 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.430
 I just made the l1 pass and 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.980
 he he again made this 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.790
 valoren defender but nevertheless the 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.130
 ball was in it 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.319
 actually content should be so everyone should 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.760
 can do and then look like here 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.709
 In the last example , I'm normal 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.420
 played with a lot personally after 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.980
 worked in the front 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.410
 I lost the ball drama 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.980
 spring back on khedira on balls 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:10.090
 on again khedira on isku is repeater 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.760
 at the loss of their domestic again 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.950
 disco bands always sends him to ronaldo 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.930
 and Ronaldo with whom he considers perfect 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.269
 You can also easily with the 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.670
 hessen work forwards and a few 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.209
 Doing the job makes it that 's it 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.280
 Video 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.049
 If you have questions you have this video 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.489
 Write is and in the comments

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.890
