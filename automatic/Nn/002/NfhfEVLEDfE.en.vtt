about<00:01:13.119> connecting<00:01:13.509> people<00:01:13.930> I<00:01:14.200> think<00:01:14.920> of<00:01:15.009> my

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
about connecting people I think of my

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.100 
about connecting people I think of my
own<00:01:15.340> children<00:01:15.640> like<00:01:16.270> seven<00:01:16.690> eight<00:01:16.810> years

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
they'll be off to college and I can

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.050 
they'll be off to college and I can
imagine<00:01:19.539> being<00:01:19.780> able<00:01:19.899> to<00:01:20.020> call<00:01:20.530> them<00:01:20.860> and<00:01:21.190> see

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
imagine being able to call them and see

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.320 
imagine being able to call them and see
them<00:01:22.390> but<00:01:23.049> also<00:01:23.200> look<00:01:24.070> into<00:01:24.310> their<00:01:24.430> eyes<00:01:24.460> and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
them but also look into their eyes and

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.950 
them but also look into their eyes and
see<00:01:25.570> how<00:01:25.780> are<00:01:25.899> they<00:01:25.990> really<00:01:26.229> doing<00:01:27.780> what<00:01:28.780> makes

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
see how are they really doing what makes

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.940 
see how are they really doing what makes
it<00:01:29.110> even<00:01:29.289> better

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
it even better

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.130 
it even better
is<00:01:30.189> that<00:01:30.610> it<00:01:31.119> switches<00:01:31.479> from<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.899> front

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
is that it switches from the front

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.410

one<00:04:37.810> thing<00:04:38.050> we<00:04:38.169> made<00:04:38.380> larger<00:04:38.979> was<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:39.490> battery

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
one thing we made larger was the battery

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.350 
one thing we made larger was the battery
in<00:04:40.060> fact<00:04:40.600> iPhone<00:04:41.169> 4<00:04:41.470> delivers<00:04:41.950> up<00:04:42.160> to<00:04:42.430> 40%<00:04:42.790> more

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
in fact iPhone 4 delivers up to 40% more

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.210 
in fact iPhone 4 delivers up to 40% more
talktime<00:04:43.810> and<00:04:45.120> we<00:04:46.120> started<00:04:46.720> with<00:04:47.220> completely

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
talktime and we started with completely

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.550 
talktime and we started with completely
opposing<00:04:48.370> goals<00:04:49.000> and<00:04:49.720> we<00:04:50.020> wanted<00:04:50.320> to<00:04:50.410> make

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
opposing goals and we wanted to make

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.010 
opposing goals and we wanted to make
this<00:04:50.710> iPhone<00:04:51.190> more<00:04:51.850> capable<00:04:52.360> we<00:04:52.660> wanted<00:04:52.960> to

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
this iPhone more capable we wanted to

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.350 
this iPhone more capable we wanted to
add<00:04:53.169> more<00:04:53.500> feature<00:04:53.800> and<00:04:54.760> yet<00:04:55.120> at<00:04:55.240> the<00:04:55.330> same

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
add more feature and yet at the same

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.510 
add more feature and yet at the same
time<00:04:55.810> we<00:04:56.260> wanted<00:04:56.500> to<00:04:56.560> make<00:04:56.710> it<00:04:56.830> smaller<00:04:57.220> and

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
time we wanted to make it smaller and

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.760 
time we wanted to make it smaller and
even<00:04:57.610> thinner<00:04:58.090> and<00:04:58.510> that<00:04:59.229> lets<00:04:59.440> us<00:04:59.560> some

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
even thinner and that lets us some

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.210 
even thinner and that lets us some
really<00:05:00.160> surprising<00:05:00.340> innovation<00:05:02.100> and<00:05:03.100> we

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
really surprising innovation and we

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.250 
really surprising innovation and we
developed<00:05:03.669> an<00:05:03.760> entirely<00:05:04.330> new<00:05:04.690> gray<00:05:04.960> that

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
developed an entirely new gray that

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.100 
developed an entirely new gray that
stainless<00:05:05.890> steel<00:05:06.160> that<00:05:06.669> after<00:05:07.030> machining<00:05:07.419> is

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
stainless steel that after machining is

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.219 
stainless steel that after machining is
incredibly<00:05:09.010> strong<00:05:09.310> but<00:05:10.240> also<00:05:10.390> remarkably

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
incredibly strong but also remarkably

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:14.610 
incredibly strong but also remarkably
precise<00:05:12.060> the<00:05:13.060> steel<00:05:13.330> frame<00:05:13.720> functions<00:05:14.320> is<00:05:14.470> the

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
precise the steel frame functions is the

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.279 
precise the steel frame functions is the
antenna<00:05:15.010> but<00:05:15.310> also<00:05:15.729> the<00:05:16.270> primary<00:05:16.570> structure

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
antenna but also the primary structure

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.630 
antenna but also the primary structure
giving<00:05:17.950> us<00:05:18.039> more<00:05:18.310> internal<00:05:18.789> volume<00:05:20.490> we<00:05:21.490> also

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
giving us more internal volume we also

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.580 
giving us more internal volume we also
developed<00:05:22.240> a<00:05:22.330> custom<00:05:22.720> glass<00:05:22.990> that's

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
developed a custom glass that's

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.170 
developed a custom glass that's
