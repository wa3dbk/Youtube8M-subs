00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:04.299
 the important thing to keep in mind that going to the moon is not one 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:05.880
 stroll 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.240
 it is a decidedly different undertaking than the astronauts do today 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.950

 184,000 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:32.279
 but with the powerful means offered by the china of which I am accused very often 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.180
 to be part of a love made 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.320
 a powerful scale model this spikes ball you see 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.240
 and the moon e 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.390
 in scale

 to make a journey much longer 400d the mer this scarce 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.240
 so much so 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.070
 it's so much you have to do all this weird 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.380
 it's a little object 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.770
 manufactured as famously said one of the out-of-tune balls made by 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.050
 by the contractor that offers the maximum discount 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.450
 this is the picture of the six missions 12 big-cost astronauts 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.390
 great. ecological to arrive in a few years on the moon by beating the Russians 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.149
 because the technology festival 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.460
 it's a political issue 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.030
 it was a question of demonstrating that the American way of life was more powerful than that 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.870
 good anymore 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.780
 have churn out technical engineers chilose men the dazzling fight 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.110
 and the rabbit gods 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.910

 antagonists of the Soviet system 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.670
 because tv they are also looking for the run the poliform moon see some 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.080
 photographs of their little ones that everyone knows 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.120
 age 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.940
 the thing seems so incredible 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.120
 that many people are waiting for a moment but possible 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.810
 the American missile in particular 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.230
 exploded on the launch pad with the keyboard 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.509
 beautiful 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.859
 i'm a direct ebay downing on mushroom television was breaking out 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:12.950
 later instead 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.360
 beautiful sports clothes put on transports eaten one as if nothing 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.379
 it were 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:19.609
 the doubt has come 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:21.029
 this world has remained 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:24.739
 there are people and statistics have been made in this sense 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.239
 that I think it was all up to the mess now that there was when 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.379
 something 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.039
 I'm all this question 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:35.709
 after a few data surveys unfortunately on this topic are limited 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.529
 presents the united states 

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:42.499
 eheh I had to think of a slightly different culture so they can't text for 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:47.290
 a situation like the European one is a figure on which we can reason 6% 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:50.559
 of Americans do not survey 99 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.840
 betta replied saying that according to them emilbanca and on the moon they were not 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.309
 authentic 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:59.409
 there's a species you don't pay though 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:03.189
 however, the feeling that there is a widespread doubt 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:09.139
 6% of Americans mean 18 million people our talking about 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:13.669
 4 angry cats we are talking about a significant number of people 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:15.509
 who sings beautiful merini 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:17.589
 add the doubts about it 

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:20.719
 what doubts have doubts of this kind 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:25.700
 for example that we have never really gone all fake from the first all 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:28.339
 last image from the first to the last video 

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:32.419
 from the first to the last. all four in some way 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:34.469
 and these are the hard and pure 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:36.139
 then there are those soft pairs 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:37.809
 that viconet 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:40.189
 perhaps 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.989
 at the beginning I was not able they were not ready they had to keep the deadline 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:44.479
 of the 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:49.259
 69 because kennedy not famous speech of the walnut sonto puts it down 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:52.169
 saloon by the end of the decade herexa hurry up 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.909
 the first mission we pretend 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.489
 let's make those real ones seen you are seen 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.899
 so they are the ones who say the first one the extension c 

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:04.209
 these gentlemen were falsified when you see 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.319
 only three layers of the apollo mission 11 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.309
 the one with the t half that hypnotic hypnotic air is what 

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:14.229
 is realizing damn I will become very famous 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:16.449
 but I don't go to the moon 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.859
 the other two months are those that he landed in Milan he had just with 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.370
 immense michael collins 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.370
 and pirelli beyond this this people stop sean faris even more soft or tea 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.270
 lunar conspiracy 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.409
 princess the kiss today we went but photo they came wrong it was 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:37.689
 like those who go on holiday to the Maldives, he returned home 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:39.830
 with ruined burin 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.629
 piano shock representatives a graphics program for is not little about 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:44.800
 somebody else 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.870
 refer the fake photos they went there on holiday but they don't have the proof 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.420
 and as this propaganda mission 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.979
 they needed effective photos 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.839
 she these are there is the absolute softest those with whom you are 

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:59.499
 can you too 

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:00.919
 often discuss 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.840
 discuss why unfortunately or motors very often with these people building 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.830
 start a dialogue because they are 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:08.860
 tools 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.650
 then I'll tell you some 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.979
 cases of life lived 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.430
 there is another current of thought that is nice 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.560
 that is what you say 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.380
 is there or we went there we can no longer go before I found it 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.770
 yesterday that command 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.570
 stay at your home 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.570
 kooboo hips and who you saw * 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.219
 then let's close a little 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:36.669
 what could have happened there would be this theory of falsification anyway 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.249
 through yoox special effects 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:40.499
 the 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:44.959
 combinations of chemical technologies with the help of eg experts from 

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:47.219
 hollywood would have falsified 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:50.169
 with results they might look like this little one
