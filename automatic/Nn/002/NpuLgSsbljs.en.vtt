this<00:00:33.809> warm<00:00:34.200> weather<00:00:34.350> summer<00:00:34.860> months<00:00:35.219> we

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
this warm weather summer months we

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.509 
this warm weather summer months we
sometimes<00:00:35.940> take<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.390> outdoors<00:00:36.510> too<00:00:37.460> so<00:00:38.460> you

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:38.519 
sometimes take it outdoors too so you

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:40.880 
sometimes take it outdoors too so you
can<00:00:38.730> see<00:00:38.879> it's<00:00:38.999> a<00:00:39.120> really<00:00:39.449> small<00:00:39.719> space<00:00:39.960> but

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
can see it's a really small space but

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.200 
can see it's a really small space but
you<00:00:41.129> don't<00:00:41.309> really<00:00:41.429> need<00:00:41.640> much<00:00:41.789> to<00:00:42.030> make<00:00:42.179> a

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
you don't really need much to make a

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.779 
you don't really need much to make a
good<00:00:42.420> picture<00:00:42.859> good<00:00:43.859> equipment<00:00:44.039> and<00:00:44.429> good

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
good picture good equipment and good

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.639 
good picture good equipment and good
light<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.390> one<00:00:45.539> thing<00:00:45.690> we<00:00:45.749> do<00:00:46.019> have<00:00:46.050> here<00:00:46.499> is

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
light so one thing we do have here is

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.430 
light so one thing we do have here is
really<00:00:46.859> great<00:00:47.100> lighting<00:00:47.460> these<00:00:48.300> windows<00:00:49.199> here

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
really great lighting these windows here

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.309 
really great lighting these windows here
face<00:00:49.710> style<00:00:50.359> and<00:00:51.359> we<00:00:51.719> actually<00:00:51.870> put<00:00:52.170> this

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:52.319 
face style and we actually put this

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:54.709 
face style and we actually put this
white<00:00:52.649> film<00:00:52.980> over<00:00:53.309> them<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:54.239> kind<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.480> soften

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
white film over them to kind of soften

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.259 
white film over them to kind of soften
the<00:00:55.079> light<00:00:55.230> that's<00:00:55.440> coming<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.269> come

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
the light that's coming in and come

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.119 
the light that's coming in and come
wintertime<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:58.260> actually<00:00:58.559> brighter<00:00:58.829> in

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
wintertime it's actually brighter in

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.290 
wintertime it's actually brighter in
here<00:00:59.370> which<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.699> would<00:00:59.819> think<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.089> be<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
here which you would think of be the

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.239 
here which you would think of be the
opposite<00:01:00.690> but<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> Sun<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.229> lower<00:01:01.589> in<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.859> sky

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:02.249 
opposite but the Sun is lower in the sky

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:04.189 
opposite but the Sun is lower in the sky
and<00:01:02.579> since<00:01:02.909> we're<00:01:03.059> facing<00:01:03.300> south<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.899> really

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
and since we're facing south it really

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.380 
and since we're facing south it really
comes<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.589> directly<00:01:05.220> during<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.150> winter

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
comes in directly during the winter

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.569 
comes in directly during the winter
months<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:07.229> had<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.560> also<00:01:08.010> occur<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.490> this

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
months so we had to also occur in this

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:10.100 
months so we had to also occur in this
up<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.850> kind<00:01:08.969> of<00:01:09.030> block<00:01:09.270> some<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.869> light

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
up to kind of block some of that light

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.920 
up to kind of block some of that light
so<00:01:11.009> it's<00:01:11.310> really<00:01:11.520> bright<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> sunny<00:01:12.420> day<00:01:12.509> we

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
so it's really bright on a sunny day we

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.459 
so it's really bright on a sunny day we
can<00:01:13.110> close<00:01:13.350> her<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:13.939> and<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.180> also<00:01:15.840> softens

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:16.469 
can close her in and that also softens

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:18.590 
can close her in and that also softens
the<00:01:16.680> light<00:01:16.799> for<00:01:17.100> us<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.700> any<00:01:17.880> real<00:01:18.060> hotspots

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
the light for us have any real hotspots

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.800 
the light for us have any real hotspots
in<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.049> images<00:01:19.820> most<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:21.149> the<00:01:21.270> shooting<00:01:21.600> takes

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
in the images most of the shooting takes

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.529 
in the images most of the shooting takes
place<00:01:21.979> against<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.219> wall<00:01:23.490> here<00:01:23.789> so<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.180> use

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
place against this wall here so I use

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.080 
place against this wall here so I use
generally<00:01:25.439> side<00:01:25.710> lighting<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.939> is

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
generally side lighting but it is

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.029 
generally side lighting but it is
softened<00:01:27.630> side<00:01:27.899> lighting<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.500> then<00:01:28.710> we'll

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
softened side lighting and then we'll

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:30.859 
softened side lighting and then we'll
put<00:01:29.219> a<00:01:29.250> reflector<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:30.000> on<00:01:30.149> the<00:01:30.299> left-hand<00:01:30.750> side

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
put a reflector in on the left-hand side

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.499 
put a reflector in on the left-hand side
of<00:01:31.289> the<00:01:31.439> set<00:01:31.649> to<00:01:32.280> just<00:01:32.430> kind<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.700> fill<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:32.969> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
of the set to just kind of fill in the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.109 
of the set to just kind of fill in the
left<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:34.859> not<00:01:35.009> too<00:01:35.310> dramatic<00:01:35.460> because<00:01:35.909> I

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
left so it's not too dramatic because I

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.910 
left so it's not too dramatic because I
do<00:01:36.180> like<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.509> nice<00:01:36.719> soft<00:01:36.960> even<00:01:37.320> light<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
do like a nice soft even light on the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.700 
do like a nice soft even light on the
subject<00:01:38.479> and<00:01:39.479> then<00:01:39.750> if<00:01:39.990> we<00:01:40.140> really<00:01:40.409> want<00:01:40.680> to

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
subject and then if we really want to

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.410 
subject and then if we really want to
illuminate<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.340> eyes<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.520> lot<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.000> times<00:01:42.240> I'll

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
illuminate the eyes a lot of times I'll

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.139 
illuminate the eyes a lot of times I'll
try<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.659> angle<00:01:43.250> this<00:01:44.250> session<00:01:44.549> towards<00:01:44.969> the

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
try to angle this session towards the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.389 
try to angle this session towards the
windows<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.509> little<00:01:45.750> bit<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.500> would<00:01:47.219> just

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
windows a little bit so I would just

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.740 
windows a little bit so I would just
spin<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.729> slightly<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.359> that<00:01:48.390> they're<00:01:48.630> looking

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750
