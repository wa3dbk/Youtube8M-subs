00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
first unlocked the f2000 i had a lot of

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.300 
first unlocked the f2000 i had a lot of
fun<00:02:54.390> playing<00:02:54.720> with<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:55.110> but<00:02:55.680> after<00:02:55.920> playing

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
fun playing with it but after playing

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.070 
fun playing with it but after playing
with<00:02:56.430> for<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.760> while<00:02:56.880> I<00:02:57.360> realized<00:02:57.600> that<00:02:57.990> it

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
with for a while I realized that it

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.750 
with for a while I realized that it
doesn't<00:02:58.350> have<00:02:58.440> her<00:02:58.560> any<00:02:58.680> true<00:02:58.980> advantage<00:02:59.550> to

doesn't have her any true advantage to
it<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.360> only<00:03:00.570> reason<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:00.990> had<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.200> lot<00:03:01.320> of

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
it the only reason that I had a lot of

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.380 
it the only reason that I had a lot of
fun<00:03:01.650> using<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.190> was<00:03:02.550> because<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.120> weapon

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
fun using it was because the weapon

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.000 
fun using it was because the weapon
reminded<00:03:03.840> me<00:03:03.960> of<00:03:03.990> the<00:03:04.260> days<00:03:04.440> when<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:04.680> played

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
reminded me of the days when I played

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.980 
reminded me of the days when I played
battlefield<00:03:05.370> 3<00:03:05.760> because<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.510> weapon<00:03:06.840> is

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
battlefield 3 because the weapon is

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.230 
battlefield 3 because the weapon is
basically<00:03:07.590> exactly<00:03:07.980> how<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.490> used<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:08.760> perform

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
basically exactly how it used to perform

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.270 
basically exactly how it used to perform
the<00:03:09.810> only<00:03:09.990> problem<00:03:10.380> with<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:10.890> all

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
the only problem with that is that all

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.010 
the only problem with that is that all
of<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.520> other<00:03:11.760> weapons<00:03:12.210> are<00:03:12.390> better<00:03:12.780> in

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
of the other weapons are better in

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.260 
of the other weapons are better in
different<00:03:13.440> ways<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.950> going<00:03:14.880> back<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.240> a

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
different ways and going back to a

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.400 
different ways and going back to a
weapon<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.600> has<00:03:15.810> statistics<00:03:15.990> from

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
weapon that has statistics from

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.770 
weapon that has statistics from
battlefield<00:03:16.830> 3<00:03:17.010> does<00:03:17.190> not<00:03:17.430> really<00:03:17.700> fit<00:03:18.000> in<00:03:18.240> it

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
battlefield 3 does not really fit in it

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.750 
battlefield 3 does not really fit in it
does<00:03:18.960> have<00:03:19.110> very<00:03:19.320> average<00:03:19.830> damage<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.430> lot<00:03:20.730> of

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
does have very average damage a lot of

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.220 
does have very average damage a lot of
the<00:03:20.940> other<00:03:21.060> assault<00:03:21.390> rifles<00:03:21.450> have<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.990> same

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
the other assault rifles have the same

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.710 
the other assault rifles have the same
damage<00:03:22.530> if<00:03:22.830> not<00:03:23.040> better<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.700> while<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:24.540> does

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
damage if not better and while it does

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.780 
damage if not better and while it does
have<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:24.960> decently<00:03:25.380> high<00:03:25.560> firing<00:03:26.070> rate<00:03:26.250> it's<00:03:26.670> a

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
have a decently high firing rate it's a

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.880 
have a decently high firing rate it's a
really<00:03:27.030> slow<00:03:27.360> reload<00:03:27.840> kind<00:03:28.200> of<00:03:28.290> counteracts

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
really slow reload kind of counteracts

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.680 
really slow reload kind of counteracts
that<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.370> doesn't<00:03:29.730> make<00:03:29.850> it<00:03:30.000> as<00:03:30.120> effective

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
that and doesn't make it as effective

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.390 
that and doesn't make it as effective
because<00:03:30.870> if<00:03:31.110> you're<00:03:31.290> shooting<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.830> you<00:03:32.160> run

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
because if you're shooting and you run

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.980 
because if you're shooting and you run
out<00:03:32.550> of<00:03:32.580> ammunition<00:03:32.880> because<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.660> that<00:03:33.780> fast

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
out of ammunition because of that fast

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.320 
out of ammunition because of that fast
firing<00:03:34.350> rate<00:03:34.650> that<00:03:35.100> really<00:03:35.490> slow<00:03:35.730> reload<00:03:36.120> is

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
firing rate that really slow reload is

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.600 
firing rate that really slow reload is
going<00:03:36.600> to<00:03:36.660> get<00:03:36.780> you<00:03:36.960> killed<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:38.220> is<00:03:38.340> not<00:03:38.490> to

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
going to get you killed that is not to

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.820 
going to get you killed that is not to
say<00:03:38.640> that<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.030> weapon<00:03:39.180> is<00:03:39.390> bad<00:03:39.660> because<00:03:40.320> every

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
say that the weapon is bad because every

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.770 
say that the weapon is bad because every
time<00:03:40.860> I<00:03:41.040> use<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.490> f2000<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.180> feel<00:03:42.360> like<00:03:42.510> I<00:03:42.720> do

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
time I use the f2000 I feel like I do

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.930 
time I use the f2000 I feel like I do
very<00:03:43.230> well<00:03:43.410> just<00:03:43.920> because<00:03:44.130> I'm<00:03:44.460> very<00:03:44.640> familiar

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
very well just because I'm very familiar

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.480 
very well just because I'm very familiar
with<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.660> weapon<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:46.140> performed<00:03:46.980> basically

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
with the weapon it performed basically

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.770 
with the weapon it performed basically
exactly<00:03:47.760> how<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.120> did<00:03:48.240> in<00:03:48.330> battlefield<00:03:48.750> 3

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
exactly how it did in battlefield 3

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.570 
exactly how it did in battlefield 3
which<00:03:49.110> is<00:03:49.140> good<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:49.500> bad<00:03:49.800> in<00:03:49.830> its<00:03:50.160> own<00:03:50.280> ways

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
which is good and bad in its own ways

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.550 
which is good and bad in its own ways
but<00:03:51.180> if<00:03:51.330> you're<00:03:51.510> very<00:03:51.690> familiar<00:03:51.870> with<00:03:52.200> it<00:03:52.440> you

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
but if you're very familiar with it you

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.680 
but if you're very familiar with it you
will<00:03:52.680> definitely<00:03:53.220> be<00:03:53.400> able<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:54.030> use<00:03:54.330> it<00:03:54.360> better

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
will definitely be able to use it better

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.870 
will definitely be able to use it better
than<00:03:54.870> some<00:03:55.050> of<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.230> other<00:03:55.530> assault<00:03:56.010> rifles<00:03:56.070> it

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
than some of the other assault rifles it

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.130 
than some of the other assault rifles it
doesn't<00:03:57.150> have<00:03:57.240> any<00:03:57.390> advantage<00:03:57.870> you're<00:03:58.020> not

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
doesn't have any advantage you're not

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.170 
doesn't have any advantage you're not
going<00:03:58.440> to<00:03:58.590> win<00:03:58.890> every<00:03:59.220> single<00:03:59.430> gunfight<00:04:00.060> you

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
going to win every single gunfight you

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.120 
going to win every single gunfight you
get<00:04:00.360> into<00:04:00.660> but<00:04:00.900> if<00:04:00.960> you<00:04:01.020> play<00:04:01.260> surgically<00:04:01.920> and

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
get into but if you play surgically and

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.070 
get into but if you play surgically and
you<00:04:02.250> try<00:04:02.550> and<00:04:02.760> bring<00:04:03.240> back<00:04:03.450> some<00:04:03.690> of<00:04:03.720> that<00:04:03.900> old

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
you try and bring back some of that old

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.750 
you try and bring back some of that old
charisma<00:04:04.740> that<00:04:04.770> you<00:04:04.950> had<00:04:05.160> in<00:04:05.310> battlefield<00:04:05.700> 3

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
charisma that you had in battlefield 3

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.550 
charisma that you had in battlefield 3
then<00:04:06.390> you'll<00:04:06.510> definitely<00:04:06.930> be<00:04:06.960> able<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.380> put

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
then you'll definitely be able to put

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.920 
then you'll definitely be able to put
this<00:04:07.680> gun<00:04:07.830> to<00:04:08.040> good<00:04:08.190> work<00:04:08.450> my<00:04:09.450> preferred<00:04:09.750> set

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
this gun to good work my preferred set

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.480 
this gun to good work my preferred set
up<00:04:10.020> for<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.200> f2000<00:04:10.770> is<00:04:10.860> to<00:04:10.950> run<00:04:11.100> with<00:04:11.310> the

up for the f2000 is to run with the

up for the f2000 is to run with the
default<00:04:11.970> site<00:04:12.180> that<00:04:12.330> comes<00:04:12.480> with<00:04:12.690> it<00:04:12.720> because

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:12.960 
default site that comes with it because

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.500 
default site that comes with it because
one<00:04:13.440> its<00:04:13.890> exclusive<00:04:14.520> and<00:04:14.670> it's<00:04:14.820> unique<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.210> the

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
one its exclusive and it's unique to the

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.450 
one its exclusive and it's unique to the
f2000<00:04:16.170> I<00:04:16.290> really<00:04:16.650> do<00:04:16.799> like<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.190> way<00:04:17.310> it<00:04:17.430> looks

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:17.460 
f2000 I really do like the way it looks

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.729 
f2000 I really do like the way it looks
it's<00:04:18.060> very<00:04:18.420> good<00:04:18.600> for<00:04:18.660> accurate<00:04:19.230> shooting<00:04:19.560> and

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
it's very good for accurate shooting and

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.590 
it's very good for accurate shooting and
it<00:04:20.070> does<00:04:20.310> take<00:04:20.520> up<00:04:20.549> a<00:04:20.730> good<00:04:20.880> majority<00:04:21.239> of<00:04:21.420> your

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
it does take up a good majority of your

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.000 
it does take up a good majority of your
screen<00:04:21.900> it<00:04:22.109> does<00:04:22.290> take<00:04:22.440> up<00:04:22.470> a<00:04:22.620> lot<00:04:22.710> of<00:04:22.770> real

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
screen it does take up a lot of real

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.220 
screen it does take up a lot of real
estate<00:04:23.190> but<00:04:24.060> that<00:04:24.300> doesn't<00:04:24.450> really<00:04:24.660> matter<00:04:24.990> if

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
estate but that doesn't really matter if

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.600 
estate but that doesn't really matter if
you're<00:04:25.380> getting<00:04:25.620> your<00:04:25.740> shots<00:04:25.950> on<00:04:26.130> target<00:04:26.160> and

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
you're getting your shots on target and

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.610 
you're getting your shots on target and
plus<00:04:26.940> this<00:04:27.240> weapon<00:04:27.630> is<00:04:27.720> really<00:04:28.050> good<00:04:28.200> hipfire

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
plus this weapon is really good hipfire

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.590 
plus this weapon is really good hipfire
wise<00:04:28.890> and<00:04:29.160> if<00:04:29.580> you<00:04:29.760> don't<00:04:30.060> need<00:04:30.240> to<00:04:30.300> aim<00:04:30.420> down

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
wise and if you don't need to aim down

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.510 
wise and if you don't need to aim down
sights<00:04:30.930> you<00:04:31.110> really<00:04:31.380> shouldn't<00:04:31.770> i<00:04:31.950> also<00:04:32.310> like

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
sights you really shouldn't i also like

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.070 
sights you really shouldn't i also like

and<00:04:39.760> then<00:04:40.210> I<00:04:40.240> also<00:04:40.510> like<00:04:40.840> to<00:04:40.870> have<00:04:41.200> the<00:04:41.440> heavy

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
and then I also like to have the heavy

like<00:04:44.680> running<00:04:44.950> with<00:04:44.980> the<00:04:45.160> suppressor<00:04:45.460> and<00:04:45.790> I

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
like running with the suppressor and I

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.760 
like running with the suppressor and I
know<00:04:45.940> in<00:04:46.270> battlefield<00:04:46.720> 3<00:04:46.750> the<00:04:46.990> f2000<00:04:47.650> was

know in battlefield 3 the f2000 was

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.170 
know in battlefield 3 the f2000 was
known<00:04:47.980> to<00:04:48.010> be<00:04:48.190> very<00:04:48.370> good<00:04:48.640> with<00:04:48.820> a<00:04:48.880> suppressor

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.860 
but in battle to afford the suppressor
doesn't<00:04:51.700> really<00:04:51.850> work<00:04:52.150> very<00:04:52.180> well<00:04:52.480> for<00:04:52.630> the

does with the suppressor the suppressor
brings<00:04:59.470> down<00:04:59.650> the<00:04:59.710> range<00:05:00.130> and<00:05:00.430> it<00:05:00.700> also<00:05:00.850> brings

brings down the range and it also brings

while the heavy barrel on the other hand
increases<00:05:07.570> accuracy<00:05:07.960> increases<00:05:08.380> hipfire

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
increases accuracy increases hipfire

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.700 
increases accuracy increases hipfire
accuracy<00:05:09.550> and<00:05:09.910> increases<00:05:10.390> the<00:05:10.420> range

accuracy and increases the range

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.440

basically<00:05:11.710> increasing<00:05:12.190> everything<00:05:12.820> that<00:05:13.270> the

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
basically increasing everything that the

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.110 
basically increasing everything that the

suppressor does keep you off the map

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.830 
suppressor does keep you off the map
which<00:05:20.860> could<00:05:21.100> be<00:05:21.220> helpful<00:05:21.730> if<00:05:21.910> you're<00:05:22.720> not

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
which could be helpful if you're not

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.450 
which could be helpful if you're not
able<00:05:23.050> to<00:05:23.290> put<00:05:23.470> down<00:05:23.740> people<00:05:24.070> because<00:05:24.340> your

able to put down people because your

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.950 
able to put down people because your
hipfire<00:05:24.640> accuracy<00:05:25.180> which<00:05:25.540> is<00:05:25.660> one<00:05:25.840> of<00:05:25.870> the

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
hipfire accuracy which is one of the

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.620 
hipfire accuracy which is one of the
advantages<00:05:26.290> to<00:05:26.650> the<00:05:26.770> f2000<00:05:27.430> is<00:05:27.520> not<00:05:28.120> exactly

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
advantages to the f2000 is not exactly

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.300 
advantages to the f2000 is not exactly
working<00:05:28.960> well<00:05:29.350> then<00:05:29.860> it<00:05:30.010> doesn't<00:05:30.070> really

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
working well then it doesn't really

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.250 
working well then it doesn't really
matter<00:05:30.700> and<00:05:30.970> it<00:05:31.090> seems<00:05:31.390> like<00:05:31.480> it<00:05:31.690> takes<00:05:31.870> longer

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
matter and it seems like it takes longer

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.600 
matter and it seems like it takes longer
to<00:05:32.410> put<00:05:32.590> people<00:05:32.830> down<00:05:32.860> with<00:05:33.100> this<00:05:33.220> for<00:05:33.400> us<00:05:33.460> I

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
to put people down with this for us I

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.770 
to put people down with this for us I
don't<00:05:33.640> know<00:05:33.850> how<00:05:33.910> to<00:05:33.970> explain<00:05:34.270> it<00:05:34.390> it<00:05:34.630> doesn't

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
don't know how to explain it it doesn't

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.780 
don't know how to explain it it doesn't
take<00:05:35.140> down<00:05:35.320> the<00:05:35.440> damage<00:05:35.890> but<00:05:36.460> it<00:05:36.580> definitely

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
take down the damage but it definitely

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.610 
take down the damage but it definitely
does<00:05:37.210> have<00:05:37.390> an<00:05:37.570> impact<00:05:37.690> on<00:05:38.170> the<00:05:38.320> weapons

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
does have an impact on the weapons

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.010 
does have an impact on the weapons
performance<00:05:39.220> if<00:05:40.180> I<00:05:40.330> had<00:05:40.450> to<00:05:40.570> give<00:05:40.690> this<00:05:40.810> gun<00:05:40.990> a

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
performance if I had to give this gun a

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.840 
performance if I had to give this gun a

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
rating on a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.120 
rating on a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a
six<00:05:42.880> point<00:05:43.360> five<00:05:43.630> out<00:05:43.870> of<00:05:43.900> 10<00:05:44.260> now<00:05:44.920> whenever

six point five out of 10 now whenever

six point five out of 10 now whenever

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
i'm using the f2000 i occasionally feel

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.930 
i'm using the f2000 i occasionally feel
like<00:05:47.590> i<00:05:47.770> would<00:05:47.920> give<00:05:48.070> it<00:05:48.100> a<00:05:48.280> higher<00:05:48.550> rating

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
like i would give it a higher rating

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.300 
like i would give it a higher rating
that<00:05:49.300> because<00:05:49.780> I<00:05:49.810> go<00:05:50.260> on<00:05:50.410> some<00:05:50.650> really<00:05:50.950> good

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
that because I go on some really good

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.130 
that because I go on some really good
skill<00:05:51.820> streaks<00:05:52.150> and<00:05:52.330> some<00:05:52.480> really<00:05:52.690> good<00:05:52.930> game

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.390 
plays using it but then at the same time
I<00:05:55.450> have<00:05:55.750> just<00:05:56.050> as<00:05:56.200> many<00:05:56.320> gameplays<00:05:56.890> where<00:05:57.370> I

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
I have just as many gameplays where I

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.520 
I have just as many gameplays where I

with<00:06:15.730> a<00:06:15.760> suppressor<00:06:16.090> which<00:06:16.450> was<00:06:16.600> known<00:06:16.810> to

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
with a suppressor which was known to

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.320 
with a suppressor which was known to
lower<00:06:17.110> damage<00:06:17.440> that<00:06:18.220> I<00:06:18.250> was<00:06:18.580> expecting<00:06:18.970> it<00:06:19.180> to

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
lower damage that I was expecting it to

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.480
