Omega Paulo taint his temple okay now I
think<00:03:10.360> your<00:03:10.810> region<00:03:11.080> tends<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.410> like<00:03:11.530> the

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
think your region tends to like the

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.810 
think your region tends to like the
stage<00:03:11.860> a<00:03:11.890> lot<00:03:12.130> maybe<00:03:12.340> because<00:03:12.550> it<00:03:12.610> has<00:03:12.700> the

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
stage a lot maybe because it has the

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.430 
stage a lot maybe because it has the
same<00:03:12.970> color<00:03:13.180> palette<00:03:13.510> of<00:03:13.570> Nashville<00:03:14.050> perhaps

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
same color palette of Nashville perhaps

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.420 
same color palette of Nashville perhaps
so<00:03:14.680> that's<00:03:15.280> actually<00:03:15.610> a<00:03:15.670> good<00:03:16.030> observation

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430
