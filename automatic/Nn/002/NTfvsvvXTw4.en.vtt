00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.740
 that only give in the fish market Felix 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.800
 although it is to seal the first and then 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.140
 put it in the oven we will need 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.910

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.220

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.590
 cool we clean it very 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.950
 Also in the fish market you need 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.719
 Well, a little oil, salt and 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.969
 then to make it rehash 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.559
 later when it comes out of the oven as a 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.920
 little bit of vinegar with a little bit of today 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:01.690
 in option day and garlic and a little parsley 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:06.780
 to be able to ice cream good because it is already 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:09.240
 we proceed to paint the monkfish 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.100
 well then we simply put a 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.770
 little oil 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.230
 then salt later after but now 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:22.820
 is to brush to go to the pan 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.920
 for what we are going to seal is to seal it 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.040
 one side and the other 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.420
 in the pan 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.430
 we put it 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.640
 and it has to be sealed on one side and 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.200
 the other when sealed, they go 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.260
 placing the tray 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.650
 [Applause] 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.110
 Well, as you know, the monkfish 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.890
 it has shrunk a little and what it does 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:54.140
 is to stay all the entry point 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:57.930
 [Applause] 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:01.380
 now we seal it on the other side and 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.770
 while we have the oven we have the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.640
 oven also gets hot to put it 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:12.320
 baked but here they have dried and for 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.320
 earth and is leaving all the future 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.890
 Well, what we have already reduced 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.950
 dear and now we take it out we place it 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:30.100
 in the tray and asks him placed him 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.100
 we put gas we put the salt on one side 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.450
 Look what it looks like and then it will be 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.970
 golden 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.750
 A) Yes 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.290
 and we proceed to put what adorned we put 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.290
 baked 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:53.930
 not only is it not hot at 180 degrees and 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:55.819
 now there then it will be like a 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.549
 quarter of an hour I for example people 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.849
 because a quarter of an hour they sell a ticket 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:04.610
 and in the pan now we put the 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:07.400
 rehashed we will make the rehash 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.580
 Well now we proceed to do the 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.500
 rehash that is made of garlic 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.000
 and as I said with chilli pepper 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.000
 we will put a little of the indicted 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.760
 also little 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.620
 very important, well, now it's 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.840
 It is also very important to be able to 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.540
 throw the vinegar because it is very 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.330
 dangerous let's shake a little 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.130
 the oil because he is super dangerous 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.130
 we're not going to take out of vinegar 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.380
 in fact the vinegar 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.319

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.030

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:26.670

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:29.160
