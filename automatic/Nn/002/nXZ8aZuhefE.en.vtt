00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:10.579
 and they are exacting 

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:12.649
 the remains of someone 

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:15.659
 the remains 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.690
 to be more precise cellular specimens that contains the information 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.429
 genetics of the individual 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.779
 cell specimens so that they want us 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.069
 the terrorists need them 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:32.529
 the new generation special forces have been reinforced by therapy 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.040
 genetics 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.670
 reinforced will have heard about the human genome project 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.550
 they have been working human genome and have almost finished 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.640
 following with the investigation 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.530
 the military have been working to identify the genes responsible for 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.220
 that the soldiers are effective 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.310
 there is that kind of weapons 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.500
 and using gene therapy 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.500
 Professional soldiers can transplant such genes 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.700
 gene therapy 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.700
 I do not know if they want 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.239
 with genetic therapy 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.420
 we can eliminate genes that we know at home diseases and at the same 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.189
 time in blackmail with beneficial effects like resistance altercation 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.640
 in other words 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.760
 we can overcome all kinds of genetic disease and also add the 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.760
 desired genetic characteristics 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.210
 so if they knew which genes responsible for creating northern zone of 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.600
 saná pollini 32 in this way nothing specified we could 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.159
 but it depends on what we can help identify those military genes 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.050
 nowadays 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.480
 Your score may be able to study genetic information and even though 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.480
 better paid 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.600
 one of the best soldiers 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.990
 the man considered to be the best jumper of the 20th century 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.630
 some little gifts 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.349
 precisely 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.859
 We have worked hard to identify the genes responsible for 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:15.029
 his incredible racing skills 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:18.519
 moment we have discovered about 60 military leaders 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.419
 so 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:23.829
 his body was recovered 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:28.319
 and your cells have been frozen in an atrium camps your genetic information 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.729
 it is a treasure for humanity 

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:33.629
 it will be a test for the military 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.050
 that cost suffered severe burns 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.160
 then to restore the partisan Athene profile of one of its deficiencies 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:43.169
 you have 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.209
 and now they are going to transplant those associated genes 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.359
 messi we will use a method that I discovered called genetic selection 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.969
 the strongest soldiers do not become what they did through 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:55.939
 experience workouts 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.480
 we know that hereditary factors are crucial to create jumps 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.409
 superior s 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.579
 we can not give them their body 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.180
 is potentially more dangerous than all the warheads that there are in 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.479
 the island 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:12.299
 a paratrooper the terrorists the board plus the sons of picks 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.139
 the favorite children 

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:32.449
 tell me about the new generation special forces started as a unit 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:35.769
 special anti-terrorist formed by members of biochemical units 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.279
 escort units in the nuclear emergency research group 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:44.949
 its objective was to respond to the threats of new generation weapons 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:47.919
 for massacres including nbc weapons 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.239
 until they arrived is clear 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.569
 who are they 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.999
 of those times they were not professional soldiers 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:58.999
 it seems to be a very international group 

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:01.039
 mercenaries 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:03.169
 and the thing gets worse 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:06.489
 most came from a mercenary agency that I think you know 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:07.949
 all right 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.759
 they were part of the private guard of bingos 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:12.839
 and when it disappeared 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:15.819
 the military acquired all contracts 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.590
 al cartagena 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.699
 in the end 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.680
 merged with our own life of virtual reality 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.650
 strength 21 and they were respected by small means the so-called special forces 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.840
 new generation 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.120
 they should be called artificial soldiers 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.379
 they have no real combat experience 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:38.249
 video game fans 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:42.439
 musaví asks that all have been reinforced with genetic therapy and 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:46.620
 come genes that makes them an excellent probes I do not know how 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.620
 i just because they do not have much experience 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.940
 he believed that the genetically modified soldiers this day the law 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.360
 international 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.569
 my interests he only statements and it's not about helps 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:04.529
 The most interesting thing is that almost every member of the unit participated in this 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:07.529
 attack 

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:21.610
 as it is all a unique cadereyta rebellion 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.499
 they call it a revolution 

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:28.309
 As they were all subjected to the same therapy they surely feel like 

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:31.330
 brothers the unit is their only family 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.509
 the children cerritos 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:37.259
 but if they were professional soldiers, military advisers had to 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:39.360
 interview them periodically 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.700
 according to their archives all obtained the psychological tests 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:49.370
 they all looked good soldiers Friday 24th and others both participated in the 

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:51.490
 lifting not 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.630
 several of them did not show up on the day of the maneuvers so a new 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.080
 trophy recruitment 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.520
 there was recently a signal that something was wrong 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.750
 a month ago came a report that they acted strangely 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.900
 journalists consulted classified information about which last night 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.069
 they started their own gene therapy experiments 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.490
 they can do it even xix 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.430
 good our gene therapy method is almost automatic 

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:24.749
 and all of them are genes with an IQ of more than 180 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:29.449
 even the existence of this army genome of its national secret first 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:30.469
 order 

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:33.749
 We expected to investigate it calmly and fix it on the door 

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:36.749
 closed 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:49.809
 purity fox still special forces caice 

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:53.039
 his old unit and in which I was commander 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:55.939
 an elite group that has weapons and experience 

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:59.259
 and they are as good as when I was in charge 

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:01.649
 you will not be that they are still there 

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:05.039
 there are six fox members still involved in terrorist activity 

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:09.149
 if you command with your powerful psychic abilities 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.490
 it is a hyperbole 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.539
 the beautiful and deadly sniper 

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:15.860
 from colloto 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.089
 master of the fragile cap 

00:07:18.089 --> 00:07:24.779
 vulcan rap giant sorcerer and revolver or other specialist interrogations 

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:27.020
 that a formidable gunman 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.919
 It looks like a group of lovely guys 

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:33.399
 it's a shame we have to see each other in these circumstances 

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:36.869
 and commanding them the leader of the soap fox commando 

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:42.740
 ficomic explains the only thing that follow up and you are the only person 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.330
 that can face him
