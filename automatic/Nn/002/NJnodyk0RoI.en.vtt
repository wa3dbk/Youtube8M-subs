difficult to find the road many places

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.330 
difficult to find the road many places
and<00:00:09.450> eventually<00:00:10.380> call<00:00:10.590> us<00:00:10.740> an<00:00:10.860> Essick<00:00:11.160> caught

again so you know we were swapping

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.250 
again so you know we were swapping
places<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:29.119> they<00:00:30.119> just<00:00:30.449> came<00:00:30.750> out<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.990> some

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
places and they just came out of some

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.150 
places and they just came out of some
dunes<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:33.140> around<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.320> mast<00:00:34.590> which<00:00:34.860> was<00:00:35.040> in

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
dunes and around the mast which was in

second or third gear next minute lying

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.720 
second or third gear next minute lying
on<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.649> roof<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.010> was<00:00:41.160> just<00:00:41.340> quote<00:00:42.300> out<00:00:42.510> by<00:00:42.690> a

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
on the roof I was just quote out by a

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.350 
on the roof I was just quote out by a
ditch<00:00:44.730> which<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:46.079> know<00:00:46.110> really<00:00:47.239> did<00:00:48.239> not

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
ditch which is you know really did not

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.619 
ditch which is you know really did not
look<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.750> bad<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.200> what<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.309> went<00:00:51.210> completely

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
look so bad and what it went completely

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.319 
look so bad and what it went completely
over<00:00:52.110> on<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.739> roof<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.190> broke<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
over on the on the roof and broke the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.180 
over on the on the roof and broke the
radiators<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:54.870> stuff<00:00:55.199> at<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.410> back<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.860> it

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
radiators and stuff at the back so it

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.860 
radiators and stuff at the back so it
was<00:00:56.610> not<00:00:56.730> possible<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.120> continue<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:57.750> it's

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
was not possible to continue but it's

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.799 
was not possible to continue but it's
it's<00:00:58.710> really<00:00:58.890> disappointing<00:00:59.160> because<00:00:59.809> we

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
it's really disappointing because we

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.740 
it's really disappointing because we
were<00:01:00.960> going<00:01:01.199> quite<00:01:01.590> well<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:03.589> yeah<00:01:05.600> I'm<00:01:06.600> just

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
were going quite well and yeah I'm just

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.270 
were going quite well and yeah I'm just
more<00:01:06.960> I'm<00:01:07.170> more<00:01:07.350> disappointed<00:01:07.470> than<00:01:07.920> anything

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
more I'm more disappointed than anything

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.910 
more I'm more disappointed than anything
else<00:01:08.430> honestly<00:01:09.299> was<00:01:09.540> very<00:01:09.810> difficult<00:01:10.049> with

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
else honestly was very difficult with

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.410 
else honestly was very difficult with
again<00:01:11.520> with<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.760> navigation<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:14.420> think

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
again with the navigation and I think

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.640 
again with the navigation and I think
the<00:01:15.509> best<00:01:15.689> thing<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:16.020> happened<00:01:16.320> was<00:01:16.409> at<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
the best thing that happened was at the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.749 
the best thing that happened was at the
end<00:01:16.799> finally<00:01:17.220> we<00:01:19.100> NASA<00:01:20.100> was<00:01:20.340> stuck<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
end finally we NASA was stuck in the

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.219 
end finally we NASA was stuck in the
dunes<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.150> we<00:01:21.270> overtook<00:01:21.600> him<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.110> then

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
dunes and we overtook him and then

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.260 
dunes and we overtook him and then
Carlos<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.400> don't<00:01:23.549> know<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:23.759> happened<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.150> we

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
Carlos I don't know what happened but we

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.230 
Carlos I don't know what happened but we
overtook<00:01:24.630> him<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.049> then<00:01:25.170> when<00:01:25.320> we<00:01:25.439> opened

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
overtook him and then when we opened

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.969 
overtook him and then when we opened
when<00:01:27.240> we<00:01:27.360> opened<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.810> track<00:01:28.380> when<00:01:28.680> we<00:01:28.860> were

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
when we opened the track when we were

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.499 
when we opened the track when we were
the<00:01:29.100> first<00:01:29.130> track<00:01:29.579> finally<00:01:30.060> everything

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
the first track finally everything

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.120 
the first track finally everything
seemed<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:30.960> working<00:01:31.079> like<00:01:31.680> Ralph<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.070> I

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
seemed to be working like Ralph and I

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.310 
seemed to be working like Ralph and I
really<00:01:32.369> started<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.790> click<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.329> maybe<00:01:34.079> that's

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
really started to click so maybe that's

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.710 
really started to click so maybe that's
what<00:01:34.439> we<00:01:34.560> needed<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.759> start<00:01:36.030> opening<00:01:36.479> and

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
what we needed just to start opening and

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.960 
what we needed just to start opening and
then<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:38.070> concentration<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
then the the concentration and the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.450 
then the the concentration and the
communication<00:01:39.600> came<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.170> anyway<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.159> hope<00:01:41.310> we

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
communication came and anyway I hope we

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.819 
communication came and anyway I hope we
can<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:42.000> know<00:01:42.119> keep<00:01:42.840> with<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.380> build<00:01:43.680> on

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
can you know keep with that it build on

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.770 
can you know keep with that it build on
that<00:01:43.860> because<00:01:44.430> at<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:45.000> end<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.360> was<00:01:45.479> really

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
that because at the end it was really

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.760 
that because at the end it was really
good<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.049> way<00:01:46.170> we<00:01:46.200> were<00:01:46.350> working<00:01:46.500> together

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
good the way we were working together

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.889 
good the way we were working together
but<00:01:47.130> we<00:01:47.250> definitely<00:01:47.430> had<00:01:47.759> some<00:01:47.939> moments<00:01:48.119> where

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
but we definitely had some moments where

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.889 
but we definitely had some moments where
it<00:01:48.930> wasn't<00:01:49.320> today<00:01:49.700> yes<00:01:50.700> actually<00:01:51.479> today<00:01:51.750> we

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
it wasn't today yes actually today we

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.770 
it wasn't today yes actually today we
