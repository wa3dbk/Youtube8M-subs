00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.990
 welcome everyone with you want right 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.830
 now you will learn about future changes 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.960
 or even replacing minced 155 literally 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.690
 a couple of days ago the storm developer in 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.789
 LiveJournal replied that your need 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.640
 change on without a drum machine with 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.460
 the normal parameters of the gun many 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.529
 worried because like so mince change 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.109
 he and so suffer and really became 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.910
 squander according to statistics what to do with it 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.850
 developers have several options 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.450
 how to solve this problem or leave 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.149
 your in the game but change it very much 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.520
 either completely take it out of the game and 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.399
 replace with another car but fortunately 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.190
 it is at worst almost immediately 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.300
 three possible options were suggested 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.210
 Fosh first apologies 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.730
 it is to leave your drum but zerfit 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.280
 accuracy data 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.170
 miscellaneous about 20 percent that is 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.329
 in the end we will have almost the same 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.730
 foch but still from more ponerflen them 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.690
 drum as for me this option is the most 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.850
 worst 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.490
 the second option is just to remove 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.590
 drum and leave the same gun with 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.939
 same performance dpm and accuracy 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.400
 information and other things 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.930
 that basically won't change anything 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.130
 except take home 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.409
 minced meat feature 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.240
 Well , finally, the third option is just 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.350
 replace 150 5 meter cannon with 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.229
 120mm mince cannon 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.630
 level nine and add her a drum 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.030
 the third option looks like to me the most 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.790
 acceptable in fact we will have a drum 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.079
 similar to what is available on t57 heavy 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.390
 only stuffing and 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.640
 as for me such an idea could be nice 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.140
 players to take and basically good 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.750
 to affect our 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.549
 Well, what do you think you must write down 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.649
 in the comments if you listened 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.780
 carefully you probably noticed that 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.970
 In the beginning I said that Pasha in general 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.250
 can completely replace this option 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.590
 is really possible if 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.360
 foch with all possible options all 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.649
 Equal will not be accepted and still 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.780
 stay bad 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.670
 no, don't think what I think is minced 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.530
 really bad to me he is very 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.500
 like and even now he is in principle 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.530
 not bad but obviously after his nerve 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.480
 and he became to 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.610
 and less playable and on it very 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.040
 strongly began to sink statistics it 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.660
 obviously even for developers exactly 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.410
 so they go for such radical 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.569
 measures 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.110
 if you are not interested, then what can 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:28.180
 be replaced in place of minced 155 you can 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.340
 don't look any further but don't forget 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.380
 like this video but if you 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.510
 still interesting then right now I'm you 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.930
 briefly tell about the car and which 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:41.560
 will take the place of pasha 155 if suddenly it 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.840
 will be removed unfortunately in the case of minced 155 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.570
 only one can take his place 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.800
 a birdie that very many can not 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.930
 to be in the spirit 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.480
 firstly because this car was not 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.410
 would armor and secondly because it was not 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.510
 would drum 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.780
 however silly it may sound but this 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.239
 machines can only become remix 10th 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.950
 acres those who know what kind of car 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.920
 Immediately they probably ran to write 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.920
 comments that I completely went but no 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.830
 it's not right now I will explain why but 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.360
 for a start, tell a little about the most 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.519
 Fri-shki worth noting that this car 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.700
 hard to classify as fri-sau 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.890
 because it is made on the basis of armored vehicles and 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.560
 enix 10p that is, you just think 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.610
 how is it stupid fri-shka made on 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.860
 bmp base 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.579
 but really nothing is silly in 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.350
 This is not because this practice is often 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:35.260
 used and repeat stupid and 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.750
 there is nothing surprising about it 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.730
 creation a and miix 10 acres french 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.430
 inspired by the reason that they have not 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.799
 it was a normal rocket tank started 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.140
 tried to do something like that on 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.989
 base a and mix deny but it's not 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.510
 crowned with success fortunately almost 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.209
 immediately able to find an alternative to it 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:59.019
 served as armored personnel carrier a and mix 10 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:01.510
 it was slightly modified and inserted 142 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.940
 millimeter gun eventually turned out 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.190
 quite a good car which is very 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.320
 easy going because already and 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.540
 mercy whole sea bmp chic 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.310
 even after all the tests at the site was 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.530
 recognized that the car is very, very 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.459
 good but as you probably already understood 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.859
 without but there were no guns and missiles 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.690
 cost very expensive and the car all 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.790
 equal amid the sheridan and 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.280
 their missile tanks looked very 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.350
 very stupid so further creation 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.080
 pairs of prototypes this thing is nowhere 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.750
 moved immediately the question is outlined as 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.270
 This car can be pushed into the game and 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.730
 how does she even pull up to level 10 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.760
 I will answer you very , very simply in 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.430
 first guns 142 millimeters principle 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.380
 if its correct for the balance you can 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.390
 it would be nice to insert it under 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.850
 sapwood nets mind remake this 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.700
 cannon for our game though in real 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.920
 there was a rocket it does not prevent her from becoming 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.740
 our game is quite a good tool with 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.840
 about 650 units of alpha which 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.270
 would have a very, very good break through 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.420
 good accuracy and fast speed 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.850
 flight of the projectile and almost immediately 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.790
 because of this 142 millimeter guns 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.310
 our Fri-Shka becomes the tenth level 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.010
 the rest tth twist no problem 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.170
 this machine is about 20 tons of fun 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.720
 dynamics would be very very cool 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.880
 Still, the base we have is BMP and armor 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.250
 thinking absolutely meaningless in 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.740
 the rest tth all twisted without 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.300
 problems sum up I want to say that 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.760
 the car would fit in very, very 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.800
 He does well to replace the stuffing and 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.350
 just like some ten a 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.300
 maybe some even nine but 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.340
 if developers suddenly grab this 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.650
 the idea is better to make straight eighth 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.120
 level it would be nice to see ptshku 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.190
 premium at level eight in 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.070
 French line from myself I will say that 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.680
 whatever this replacement was crazy 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.990
 the only car that can be 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.030
 to replace minced meat and forever I want 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:01.150
 believe that the developers just tweak 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.100
 him tth and something good will achieve that 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.960
 think you must write in 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.840
 comments but if you were interested 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.910
 look sure to like
