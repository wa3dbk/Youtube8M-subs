00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
then I step out into this world and it

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.280 
then I step out into this world and it
just<00:00:45.250> opens<00:00:46.120> up<00:00:46.270> in<00:00:46.420> front<00:00:46.660> of<00:00:46.750> me<00:00:46.840> and<00:00:47.110> it's

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
just opens up in front of me and it's

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.729 
just opens up in front of me and it's
it's<00:00:47.620> beautiful<00:00:48.430> an<00:00:48.730> alien<00:00:49.120> it<00:00:49.510> huge<00:00:49.840> that<00:00:50.410> was

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
a sort of seminal moment for me and I

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.250 
a sort of seminal moment for me and I
think<00:00:54.790> that's<00:00:55.180> part<00:00:55.510> of<00:00:55.660> what<00:00:55.840> we<00:00:55.960> want<00:00:56.170> to

core<00:01:00.640> to<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.059> game<00:01:01.360> at<00:01:02.020> the<00:01:02.200> beginning<00:01:02.530> was

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
core to the game at the beginning was

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:10.620 
core to the game at the beginning was
that<00:01:03.780> sense<00:01:04.780> of<00:01:05.050> wonder<00:01:05.680> and<00:01:05.970> exploration<00:01:09.630> we

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
that sense of wonder and exploration we

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.620 
that sense of wonder and exploration we
started<00:01:11.110> with<00:01:11.380> a<00:01:11.740> series<00:01:12.640> of<00:01:12.670> events<00:01:13.090> we'd

started with a series of events we'd

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.380 
started with a series of events we'd
basically<00:01:13.869> set<00:01:14.440> out<00:01:14.560> like<00:01:14.770> okay<00:01:15.160> from<00:01:16.119> this

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.990 
with a whole new rig for how we animate
faces<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.739> also<00:02:23.920> how<00:02:24.069> we<00:02:24.100> approach<00:02:24.700> like

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
faces and also how we approach like

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.240 
faces and also how we approach like
texturing<00:02:25.480> them<00:02:25.660> modeling<00:02:26.350> them<00:02:26.530> everything

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
texturing them modeling them everything

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.120 
texturing them modeling them everything
I<00:02:27.340> just<00:02:27.550> put<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.390> lot<00:02:28.540> more<00:02:28.690> time<00:02:29.130> difference

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
I just put a lot more time difference

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.030 
I just put a lot more time difference
about<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.340> couple<00:02:30.550> million<00:02:30.819> polygons<00:02:32.040> we

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
about a couple million polygons we

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.250 
about a couple million polygons we
absolutely<00:02:33.430> want<00:02:33.970> reach<00:02:34.269> to<00:02:34.600> tell<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.810> human

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
absolutely want reach to tell a human

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.020 
absolutely want reach to tell a human
story<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:35.890> that's<00:02:36.250> going<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.459> require<00:02:36.610> us<00:02:37.000> to

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
story and that's going to require us to

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.509 
story and that's going to require us to
invest<00:02:37.959> significantly<00:02:38.830> into<00:02:39.220> higher

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
invest significantly into higher

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.780 
invest significantly into higher
fidelity<00:02:39.730> models<00:02:40.510> much<00:02:41.230> more<00:02:41.650> open

the<00:02:47.470> vision<00:02:47.830> for<00:02:48.160> what<00:02:48.250> we<00:02:48.459> had<00:02:48.670> for<00:02:48.819> this<00:02:49.000> game

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
the vision for what we had for this game

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.300 
the vision for what we had for this game
we<00:02:49.600> ended<00:02:49.810> up<00:02:49.900> cutting<00:02:50.170> almost<00:02:50.680> every<00:02:51.040> part<00:02:51.190> of

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
we ended up cutting almost every part of

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.890 
we ended up cutting almost every part of
the<00:02:51.400> engine<00:02:51.700> retooling<00:02:52.299> things<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.690> make<00:02:52.780> it

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
the engine retooling things to make it

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
run faster to make it run better it look

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.170 
run faster to make it run better it look
better<00:02:55.930> we<00:02:56.590> had<00:02:56.799> to<00:02:57.010> throw<00:02:57.489> out<00:02:57.519> all<00:02:57.940> of<00:02:58.030> our

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
better we had to throw out all of our

out the life they bring out the style of
our<00:03:22.420> characters<00:03:22.900> we<00:03:23.200> had<00:03:23.320> probably<00:03:23.620> four

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
our characters we had probably four

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.650 
our characters we had probably four

times the amount of polygons to play
with<00:03:25.840> this<00:03:26.260> time<00:03:26.500> around<00:03:26.620> which<00:03:27.310> gave<00:03:27.519> us<00:03:27.670> a

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
with this time around which gave us a

and<00:05:43.810> I<00:05:43.900> still<00:05:44.110> think<00:05:44.290> that<00:05:44.320> we<00:05:44.500> still<00:05:44.680> struggle

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
and I still think that we still struggle

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.370 
and I still think that we still struggle
to<00:05:45.040> figure<00:05:45.220> out<00:05:45.340> exactly<00:05:45.640> what<00:05:46.000> you<00:05:46.300> know<00:05:46.420> what

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
to figure out exactly what you know what

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.840 
to figure out exactly what you know what
can<00:05:47.590> we<00:05:47.740> add<00:05:47.890> or<00:05:48.040> remove<00:05:48.130> without<00:05:48.370> pissing<00:05:48.730> off

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
can we add or remove without pissing off

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:49.950 
can we add or remove without pissing off
certain<00:05:49.060> people<00:05:49.390> to<00:05:49.420> Bible<00:05:49.660> asian<00:05:49.810> do<00:05:49.870> we

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
certain people to Bible asian do we

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.420 
certain people to Bible asian do we
looked<00:05:50.140> at<00:05:50.230> the<00:05:50.320> halo<00:05:50.530> 3<00:05:50.740> assault<00:05:50.950> rifle<00:05:51.310> and

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
looked at the halo 3 assault rifle and

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.160 
looked at the halo 3 assault rifle and
it<00:05:51.550> really<00:05:51.760> does<00:05:51.940> feel<00:05:52.090> kind<00:05:52.150> of<00:05:52.420> dated<00:05:52.810> it<00:05:52.960> fit

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.170 
it really does feel kind of dated it fit

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.770 
it really does feel kind of dated it fit
the<00:05:53.200> tech<00:05:53.500> then<00:05:53.770> but<00:05:54.160> now<00:05:54.400> we<00:05:55.240> have<00:05:55.420> all<00:05:55.690> of

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:57.670 
these new polygons to play with we went

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.150 
these new polygons to play with we went
to<00:05:57.730> a<00:05:57.760> lot<00:05:57.880> of<00:05:57.940> trouble<00:05:58.270> to<00:05:58.300> sort<00:05:58.630> of<00:05:59.160> ground
