00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:06.220
 It is Takashi 

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:10.530
 It is Douda, but today I let it run for a while. 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.950
 It looks like this, but this time 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.370
 I want the end 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.370
 I'm going to make a little lecturer now I look like this in three times 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.119
 Say this 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:26.490
 It has become like 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:30.840
 The direction of this bridge can be either above or below 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:34.320
 If you can create a variety of setup courses like this 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.850
 Seeing in Krabi, it is the same height as this pier 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:42.010
 It's gonna be this 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:48.700
 So I wonder if I could create a course that would be incorporated into this fearful customer 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:52.460
 If you 're coming, it's pretty easy, and when you're going to die, say pom pos on this 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.040
 I do not put this properly 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.850

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.490
 And here too 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.180
 I 'll just put it in the future 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:05.650
 When we put this blue thing on 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.650
 You can talk about this 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:15.210
