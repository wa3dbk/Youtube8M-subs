the<00:01:10.240> beauty<00:01:10.539> of<00:01:10.570> carbon<00:01:10.990> fiber<00:01:11.259> which<00:01:12.039> is<00:01:12.220> this

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
the beauty of carbon fiber which is this

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.219 
the beauty of carbon fiber which is this
guitar<00:01:12.820> is<00:01:12.910> totally<00:01:13.330> made<00:01:13.509> of<00:01:13.630> carbon<00:01:13.990> fiber

guitar is totally made of carbon fiber

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.790 
guitar is totally made of carbon fiber
is<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.670> strength<00:01:16.060> that<00:01:16.450> it<00:01:16.600> brings<00:01:16.840> so<00:01:17.740> you

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
is the strength that it brings so you

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.680 
is the strength that it brings so you
can<00:01:18.039> have<00:01:18.369> things<00:01:18.550> like<00:01:18.670> really<00:01:19.030> thin<00:01:19.390> necks

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
can have things like really thin necks

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.040 
can have things like really thin necks
and<00:01:20.590> the<00:01:21.070> next<00:01:21.369> won't<00:01:21.550> you<00:01:21.880> know<00:01:22.000> pull<00:01:22.690> pull

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
lot of a lot of handwork that goes into

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.210 
lot of a lot of handwork that goes into
making<00:01:37.300> these<00:01:37.570> guitars<00:01:37.990> they're<00:01:38.289> all<00:01:38.500> you

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
making these guitars they're all you

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.649 
making these guitars they're all you
know<00:01:39.340> they're<00:01:39.520> basically<00:01:39.880> built<00:01:40.179> in<00:01:40.330> a<00:01:40.420> mold

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
know they're basically built in a mold

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.749 
know they're basically built in a mold
and<00:01:40.960> the<00:01:41.170> fiberglass<00:01:41.649> cloth<00:01:42.099> which<00:01:42.520> you<00:01:42.640> can

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
and the fiberglass cloth which you can

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.870 
and the fiberglass cloth which you can
see<00:01:42.970> all<00:01:43.209> the<00:01:43.360> weave<00:01:43.539> here<00:01:43.989> is<00:01:44.140> is<00:01:44.979> hand<00:01:45.610> laid

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
see all the weave here is is hand laid

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.080 
see all the weave here is is hand laid
in<00:01:46.149> and<00:01:46.450> lots<00:01:47.410> of<00:01:47.649> man-hours<00:01:48.190> go<00:01:48.399> into<00:01:48.700> to

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
in and lots of man-hours go into to

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.760 
in and lots of man-hours go into to
building<00:01:49.450> these<00:01:49.539> guitars<00:01:49.959> which<00:01:50.229> is<00:01:50.380> why<00:01:50.500> they

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
building these guitars which is why they

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.910 
building these guitars which is why they
cost<00:01:51.340> what<00:01:51.550> they<00:01:51.670> do<00:01:52.289> this<00:01:53.289> particular<00:01:53.770> guitar

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
cost what they do this particular guitar

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.020 
cost what they do this particular guitar
costs<00:01:54.489> is<00:01:55.060> I<00:01:55.239> think<00:01:55.300> 20<00:01:55.770> $23.99<00:01:56.910> but<00:01:57.910> like<00:01:58.000> I

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
costs is I think 20 $23.99 but like I

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.510 
costs is I think 20 $23.99 but like I
said<00:01:58.209> a<00:01:58.239> lot<00:01:58.450> of<00:01:58.479> hours<00:01:58.959> go<00:01:59.140> into<00:01:59.440> it<00:01:59.560> now<00:02:00.459> the

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
said a lot of hours go into it now the

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.080 
said a lot of hours go into it now the
difference<00:02:01.119> between<00:02:01.239> the<00:02:01.539> co<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:02.349> the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
difference between the co and the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.650 
difference between the co and the
regular<00:02:04.090> ws<00:02:04.599> 1000<00:02:05.259> is<00:02:05.770> this<00:02:06.039> has<00:02:06.280> the

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
regular ws 1000 is this has the

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.160 
regular ws 1000 is this has the
uni-directional

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
uni-directional

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.889 
uni-directional
carbon<00:02:09.160> fiber<00:02:09.369> top<00:02:09.789> it's<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.209> thinnest<00:02:10.690> top

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
carbon fiber top it's the thinnest top

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.880 
carbon fiber top it's the thinnest top
that<00:02:11.170> they<00:02:11.640> can<00:02:12.640> produce<00:02:12.879> and<00:02:13.680> because<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:14.860> is

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
that they can produce and because it is

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.699 
that they can produce and because it is
so<00:02:15.160> thin<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:16.330> because<00:02:17.140> it's<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.379> straight

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
so thin and because it's a straight

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.440 
so thin and because it's a straight
grain<00:02:17.980> carbon<00:02:18.459> fiber<00:02:18.670> see<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.120> difference

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
grain carbon fiber see the difference

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.350 
grain carbon fiber see the difference
between<00:02:19.840> this<00:02:19.989> this<00:02:20.170> has<00:02:20.349> actual<00:02:21.310> like<00:02:21.640> it

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
between this this has actual like it

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.119 
between this this has actual like it
looks<00:02:22.510> like<00:02:22.629> a<00:02:22.660> spruce<00:02:22.989> top<00:02:23.230> it's<00:02:23.500> got<00:02:23.650> actual

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
looks like a spruce top it's got actual

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.729 
looks like a spruce top it's got actual
very<00:02:24.430> thin<00:02:24.730> lines<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.330> it<00:02:25.480> versus<00:02:26.230> this<00:02:26.500> big

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
very thin lines to it versus this big

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.070 
very thin lines to it versus this big

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.890 
weave that's going on on the rest of it

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
because of that it's a it's a warmer

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.890 
because of that it's a it's a warmer
