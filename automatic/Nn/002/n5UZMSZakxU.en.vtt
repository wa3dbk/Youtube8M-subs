Maxis<00:00:24.390> side<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.199> Richthofen<00:00:26.160> side<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.640> I'm

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
Maxis side and Richthofen side and I'm

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.120 
Maxis side and Richthofen side and I'm
pretty<00:00:26.939> sure<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.390> Richthofen<00:00:27.990> side<00:00:28.289> so

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
pretty sure this is Richthofen side so

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.620 
pretty sure this is Richthofen side so
on<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.519> one<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:29.820> really<00:00:30.029> need<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.210> turn<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
on this one we really need to turn the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.110 
on this one we really need to turn the
power<00:00:30.810> on<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.859> need<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.189> make<00:00:32.219> sure<00:00:32.430> to

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
power on and you need to make sure to

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.900 
power on and you need to make sure to
put<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.130> obelisk<00:00:35.130> table<00:00:35.640> together

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
put the the obelisk table together

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.760 
put the the obelisk table together
that's<00:00:36.690> really<00:00:36.899> important<00:00:37.410> because<00:00:37.530> you

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
that's really important because you

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.830 
that's really important because you
can't<00:00:38.010> do<00:00:38.190> step<00:00:38.489> one<00:00:38.790> unless<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.570> have<00:00:39.690> that

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
can't do step one unless you have that

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.510 
can't do step one unless you have that
table<00:00:40.170> put<00:00:40.320> together<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:41.129> if<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.280> don't<00:00:41.460> know

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
step is actually it's a pretty difficult

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.340 
step is actually it's a pretty difficult
step<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:20.850> um<00:01:21.000> after<00:01:21.689> turning<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.320> power

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
and making the diabla stable you need to

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.980 
and making the diabla stable you need to
pretty<00:01:27.330> much<00:01:27.770> get<00:01:28.770> four<00:01:29.340> players<00:01:29.759> on<00:01:30.210> four

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
elevators over in the dragon roof one is

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.990 
elevators over in the dragon roof one is
the<00:01:36.780> bowie<00:01:36.990> knife<00:01:37.259> elevator<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.369> one<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.850> the

symbols on them like this and when you
guys<00:01:45.689> jump<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.350> them<00:01:46.560> simultaneously<00:01:46.920> at<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
guys jump on them simultaneously at the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.179 
guys jump on them simultaneously at the
same<00:01:48.000> time<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.990> get<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.320> message<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:50.100> that

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
have to get on these symbols at the same

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.380 
have to get on these symbols at the same
time<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.009> same<00:01:56.070> exact<00:01:56.549> place<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.030> jump<00:01:57.240> on
