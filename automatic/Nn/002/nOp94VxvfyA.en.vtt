00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:07.109
 1 goal from youtube 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.940
 we are here in a first all the new 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.910
 channel 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.230
 and well structure is treated as I said in 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.740
 a diagonal drum can be only 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.740
 good tutorials 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:27.590
 it was like in the miss title 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:31.790
 fork pandaria 132 or more known by 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:35.180
 the boom players like the error of the 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:38.330
 Bhopal tanzania leg game well 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.300
 we were battle had sand and with the 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.550
 axes but not more or less like what is it 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.550
 that this battery of today is created and 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.750
 are connected by commenting 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.149
 I discovered already with the idea me but 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.480
 I admit from the internet and it was shared 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.829
 this knowledge with you 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.829
 and how to forget it 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:12.200
 well that mistake that presumption to me 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.479
 this problem happened to me as always 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.050
 It has already happened with the times but 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.229
 later I was more traveled and with 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.530
 the number of those who no longer served 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:27.220
 I had to make drastic measures is yes 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.210
 it is solved eliminator that meta cache 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.259
 interface that is already a little bit more 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.330
 given equal rock because I say that this 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.210
 folder that I do super focus 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.850
 risky because here is the 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.680
 account 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.910
 of your account you can do here 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.460
 that is, for all your data but 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:53.120
 eliminating the folders that get in 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.660
 the game and going to new options like 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.020
 have and will go out and set options for 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.570
 user 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:06.990
 like this user 2000 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:10.489
 and then it must be achieved and there 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.489
 the problem 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.200
 here system and here set options 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:25.500
 of users when they click on it will come out if 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.790
 even the urinals of your account 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.030
 old or whatever 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.750
 and then there you have to be able to be 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.750
 and log in 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.459
 a little slow I have the action 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.459
 open because the game 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.459
 harmful 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.950
 well and here it is there if you are like that 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.500
 like what 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.310
 I did not know well already zapata and again 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.840
 of characters all that but I understood well 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.590
 How was it 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.590
 and flight 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.880
 Y 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:26.180
 You can finally make it go back to 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.180
 found 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:41.689
 and then good from youtube up here 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.760
 end this tutorial I hope that you 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:46.159
 has worked for all those who 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.860
 they have that problem play the same 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:51.409
 chan back screen and have that 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.329
 problem you already know how to fix it 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:56.000
 the same problem position is followed but 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:59.349
 it has seemed to me since then and 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.349
 OK, see you later
