00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.959 
especially for your first time that was
awesome<00:01:47.950> that<00:01:48.950> was<00:01:48.979> awesome<00:01:49.219> for<00:01:49.729> your<00:01:49.820> first

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
awesome that was awesome for your first

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:52.359 
awesome that was awesome for your first
time<00:01:50.179> I<00:01:50.570> started<00:01:51.259> feeling<00:01:51.560> pretty<00:01:51.859> good<00:01:52.130> until

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
time I started feeling pretty good until

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.669 
time I started feeling pretty good until
I<00:01:52.850> saw<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.270> next<00:01:53.539> move<00:01:53.869> which<00:01:54.140> was<00:01:54.320> a<00:01:54.350> little

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
I saw the next move which was a little

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.709 
I saw the next move which was a little
more<00:01:54.950> complicated<00:01:55.340> especially<00:01:55.759> when<00:01:56.689> I

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
more complicated especially when I

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.050 
more complicated especially when I
kicked<00:01:57.020> up<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.259> weight<00:01:57.409> to<00:01:57.619> 35<00:01:58.130> pounds<00:01:58.369> you

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
kicked up the weight to 35 pounds you

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.639 
kicked up the weight to 35 pounds you
kind<00:01:59.270> of<00:01:59.299> got<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.450> punch<00:01:59.840> it<00:01:59.990> up<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:00.380> the

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
kind of got to punch it up and the

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.289 
kind of got to punch it up and the
slower<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:01.159> punch<00:02:01.399> it<00:02:01.549> up<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.850> more<00:02:01.969> likely

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
slower you punch it up the more likely

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.680 
slower you punch it up the more likely
it's<00:02:02.420> gonna<00:02:02.539> hit<00:02:02.840> your<00:02:05.710> head<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:07.070> throw<00:02:07.369> it<00:02:07.490> up

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
it's gonna hit your head and throw it up

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.170 
it's gonna hit your head and throw it up
that's<00:02:08.690> not<00:02:08.929> bad

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
that's not bad

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.150 
that's not bad
at<00:02:11.180> first<00:02:11.900> it<00:02:12.140> was<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.290> little<00:02:12.320> tough<00:02:12.740> and<00:02:12.950> then

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
at first it was a little tough and then

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.200 
at first it was a little tough and then
I<00:02:13.190> finally<00:02:13.730> got<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.240> hang<00:02:14.390> of<00:02:14.570> it<00:02:15.970> from<00:02:16.970> one
