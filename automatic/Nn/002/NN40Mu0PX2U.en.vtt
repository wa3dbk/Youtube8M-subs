A motorcycle with a strong personality.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.920
The German manufacturer has redesigned almost completely Roadster,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.500
Giving it a better part cycle and an image much more personal.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.630
Its design is very strong,

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.720
With straight lines and pronounced forms.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.160
New ligth asymmetric fork upside and air tickets

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.370

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.630
integration of deposit 15L

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.720
Under the seat. This unit cap takes a back seat to

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.330
gives a sportier look,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.370
In addition you can apply and remove without tools.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.590
The instrument panel has a very particular arrangement,

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.070
area has an abobe the other,

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.850
A first is the speedometer, the second smallest is placed under tachometer,

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.650
that has ligth on regime

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.560
although the throttle cable goes abobe and rigth up not see.....

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.700
next to these have a screen thath makes the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.650
fuel level,

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.170
coolant temperature,

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.840
and the onboard computer optional.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.110
The motorcycle has a parallel twin 798 cc

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.550
And four valves per cylinder,

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.510
Powered by electronic injection; 90 horses generate spedd 8000 RPM

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.430
And substantial 86 Newton meters of torque at 5800.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.970
This is very compact F 800R

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.760
We control the hassle,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.520
The legs are a little backwards.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.580
The seat is 79 centimeters and do a pie whith comfort.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.340
In town

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.810
your containes dimensions and helps low-traffic moving in with ease,

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.170
the only thing that is limited turning radius,

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.390
little tour ...

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.259
reminds me some sports cutting nakeds.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.449
touch of your clutch and change is correct,

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:12.209
the drive is very soft,

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:20.089
at the bottom of the motor tachometer it is very docile.

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:22.639
by freeways  better than expected,

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:24.699
suspension is comfortable

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:27.749
The steering damper helps keep stable

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:33.699
Though lacking any protection aerodynamics.

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:37.509
It is time to seek him tickle the F800R,

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:39.819
First impressions have been pretty good,

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.629
so, i am about to impart a good pace,

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:49.619
Enough already have rolled by city and highway, i deserve a little fun.

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:51.789
Circulating run normally very fine,

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:56.409
brakes Brembo radial-mount give us a good braking and a good dose,

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:02.469
With weigth 208 kilos of progress feel very light, we will pick up the pace.

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:04.689
This unit that takes ESA suspension,

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:06.849
Although only it acts on the rear shock,

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.629
Fork upside is not regulated, so for sporting

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.549
Not much help.

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.529
Chassis is very noble,

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:16.649
320 Disc we allow rush braking.

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:20.369
Change of address are delightful, can place it right where you want.

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:24.749
Now I miss power off the ABS,

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:28.219
As for sporting the rear ABS it is annoying.

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:31.329
Raising the rate, the F 800R makes it easy,

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.949
Engine from the 5000 revolution and to the red line

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:35.939
Pushing with joy,

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:37.869
Makes no stranger no movement

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:39.589
ABS me only the limits,

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:41.379
And I do not want to leave place them as.

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.959
The seat is very small and can move comfortably.

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.659
Change is straightforward and fairly quiet,

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:50.659
Stepping is very successful,

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.419
Lets take advantage of the engine in the whole range of revolutions,

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:59.199
But the bottom shows some lazy.

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:02.429
During the test the comsumption been around 6 liters,

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:06.239
We shot in all conditions, although most been in road

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.029
Apace,

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:10.069
With a good running and driving quieter

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.219
I am sure that consumption would drop considerably.

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:16.319
Our test unit comes with the package tourers TOURING to expand capacity,

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:19.959
This includes pack, with a capacity from 15 to 25 liters each,

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:25.009
TOP CASE small capacity for integral helmet

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:26.389
And the center stand.

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.509
Also comes equipped whith DYNAMIC package,

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:31.800
This has the tail e LED flashing, the spoiler

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.820
Seat and cover

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.789
In my view, THE F 800R is a candidate to be

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:47.620
Note as one very large moto,

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.949
His aesthetic is sexy

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:51.120
And the quality of finish is high,

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.629
How much your engine chassis they are very noble.

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:56.590
See also indicated the middle distance for travel

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.889
And any longer stay,

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.300
As consumption by BMW is between 3.6 and 4.8 liters.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.050
It's more if the ABS out disconnectable also suitable for serius occasional entrance to the circuit.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.650
However there is one thing i do not like anything DO NOT LIKE ANYTHING

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.629
Engine from the 5000 revolution is very jerky

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:18.490
And that to me on a motorbike 2015 is a serious failure,

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.349
While it is true you might end up getting used

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:28.199
Through a series of accessories such as three different seat, they make it right for all sizes,

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:39.719
Think is more with high sear, it would have been more comfortable to tighten some more.

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:43.179
