00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.720
 kind of lesson to electronics that 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.570

 the visible head of xbox level 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.710
 world thinks like the people of oculus

 web as it has declared to eurogamer believes 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.920
 it is too early to jump to 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.320
 virtual reality with products 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.110
 commercials an argument that they repeat with 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.240
 oculus since the first prototypes 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.970
 and that they still maintain from the company 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.560
 most known in this field yet it is 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.870
 press seems to be happy with what 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.209
 go and do not rule out that the holub project 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.770
 lens is aimed at virtual reality by 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.770

 launch and has seen only a part 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.630
 of its potential it seems that not only 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.980
 some elect can already enjoy 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.450

 and 60 images per second although there is a 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:44.769
 but why access the update 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.019
 requires a proxy server then there is 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.689
 that redirect the updated to a 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.909
