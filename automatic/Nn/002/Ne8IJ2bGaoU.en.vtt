that was in black with golden triforce
markings<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.729> thought<00:01:41.909> definitely<00:01:42.420> that

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
markings and I thought definitely that

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.230

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
of Plain Jane it's I mean they've

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.289 
of Plain Jane it's I mean they've
already<00:01:49.320> had<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.829> blue<00:01:50.100> version<00:01:50.850> out<00:01:51.000> for

already had the blue version out for
some<00:01:51.450> time<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.840> obviously<00:01:52.020> Mario<00:01:52.680> Cart<00:01:52.950> it's

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
some time and obviously Mario Cart it's

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.219 
some time and obviously Mario Cart it's
a<00:01:53.729> great<00:01:53.970> game<00:01:54.180> but<00:01:54.420> that's<00:01:54.570> also<00:01:54.780> been<00:01:55.079> out

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.969 
for a while I'm just being kind of
nitpicky<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.689> hopefully<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.530> finds<00:01:58.770> its

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
nitpicky and hopefully this finds its

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.340 
nitpicky and hopefully this finds its

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
used the 3ds XL and what I can say is

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.580 
used the 3ds XL and what I can say is
the<00:02:08.580> screen<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.270> lot<00:02:09.599> bigger<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.349> lot

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
the screen is a lot bigger and a lot

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.530 
the screen is a lot bigger and a lot
nicer<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:11.039> look<00:02:11.099> at<00:02:11.310> compared<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.849> say<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.150> 3ds

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
nicer to look at compared to say the 3ds

nicer to look at compared to say the 3ds
I<00:02:12.959> was<00:02:13.349> reading<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.739> ball

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
I was reading the ball

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.250 
I was reading the ball
Nintendo<00:02:14.670> claims<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.360> screen<00:02:15.629> is<00:02:15.750> 90%

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
Nintendo claims that the screen is 90%

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.100 
Nintendo claims that the screen is 90%
bigger<00:02:16.830> I'm<00:02:17.549> not<00:02:17.790> too<00:02:17.970> sure<00:02:18.150> how<00:02:18.180> Nintendo<00:02:18.840> got

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
bigger I'm not too sure how Nintendo got

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.009 
bigger I'm not too sure how Nintendo got
that<00:02:19.439> number<00:02:19.620> but<00:02:20.159> I<00:02:20.700> do<00:02:21.030> enjoy<00:02:21.299> it<00:02:21.599> it's<00:02:21.810> in<00:02:21.959> a

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
that number but I do enjoy it it's in a

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.899 
that number but I do enjoy it it's in a
larger<00:02:22.409> form<00:02:22.650> factor<00:02:23.099> so<00:02:23.250> it's<00:02:23.370> not<00:02:23.489> as<00:02:23.700> easy

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
larger form factor so it's not as easy

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.850 
larger form factor so it's not as easy
to<00:02:24.000> slip<00:02:24.390> into<00:02:24.629> your<00:02:24.780> pocket<00:02:25.230> but<00:02:25.680> that's

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
to slip into your pocket but that's

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.679 
to slip into your pocket but that's
definitely<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.340> sacrifice<00:02:27.060> I'm<00:02:27.269> willing<00:02:27.329> to

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689
