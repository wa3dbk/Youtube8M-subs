00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.840
 Chain stitch to start we'll take 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.170
 the crochet with the right hand of this 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.170
 shape 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.960
 so that we can make enough strength 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.960
 and we can move the doll freely 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.150
 we take the ribbon and make a cross 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.550
 around 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.669
 of the three middle fingers of the hand 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.669
 left 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.870
 we will pass the crochet inside 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.170
 we take the tape 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.070
 and we make the sliding knot 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.680
 we will always have to work in this 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.650
 part of the crochet 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.320
 in the central part because it is the most 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.200
 gross 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.330
 if we work here or here we will have 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.909
 too thin and then we can not get through 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.670
 the 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:19.190
 there are many people who when they start doing 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.770
 Crochet tends to work at the tip 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.500
 what happens if we work here 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.700
 it will cost us a lot to pass the tape 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.700
 inside the low 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.020
 so we will always work here in 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.020
 medium 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.149
 this is the part of the tape with which 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.149
 we are going to work 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:54.130
 with these two fingers we will hold the knot 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.320
 why 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.880
 because if we hold the knot when 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.880
 let's work we will turn everything 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.479
 okay then we have this who mean 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.479
 the work dinner we take 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.700
 the knot so that it does not spin and 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.119
 this is the part of the tape with which 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.119
 we work 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.150
 and with the crochet 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.240
 we hold the knot 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:28.250
 and very carefully we passed the tape 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.250
 inside the 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.350
 we have already made our first point of 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.350
 chain stitch 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.520
 and we return 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.400
 with the crochet 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.370
 we hold the rest of the work so that 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.150
 do not turn and we passed 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.110
 inside 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.110
 of the low 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:00.120
 and we have made two points one 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:03.920
 we will pick up the tape again 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.920
 and we had it inside 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.620
 we always go back to the center to the zone of 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.900
 work 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.900
 we take it again and we pass it 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.940
 and we went through the low 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.709
 again and we went through the low 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.769
 we take the tape again and we pass it 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:33.400
 by the bar and so we are growing 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.400
 our chain
