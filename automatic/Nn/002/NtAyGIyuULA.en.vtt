00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:06.519
 hello everyone would hold a small 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.080
 review on the novelty unexpected novelty from 

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:11.769
 samsung company 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.110
 namely samsung galaxy s5 but not normal 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.869
 you can look at it big 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.289
 the number of reviews and comparisons for different 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.539
 authors 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:24.789
 she is a model announced mid 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:29.320
 October in Europe with marking 4g + as 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:31.390
 you are these samsung galaxy s5 4g + here 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.230
 let's look at its difference and similarity with 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:38.370
 the main model on the box is the three hours 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:44.220
 stand only in the same marking 4g + and 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:48.850
 in the name of the model with uh dj 901 a 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.500
 It came out in mid-October in Europe 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.840
 could find at least an approximate date 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.840
 output in the cis countries will see 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.950
 external about the smartphone itself from 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:04.509
 there is no such treatment itself with the main 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.920
 model but if we turn it on and set 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.189
 fingerprint scanner which by the way 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.789
 it works quite stably so here 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:15.969
 antutu benchmark 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:19.509
 we immediately see the figure of 49 1351 shu 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:23.950
 forgiveness for the quality of the camera it will be 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:28.469
 about 5-6 thousand higher than that 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.569
 regular samsung galaxy s5 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:34.210
 What is the main reason for this ? 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:36.249
 snapdragon 805 processor in the old 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:43.829
 version worth snapdragon 801 

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:48.670
 and graphics accelerator 420 adreno 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:51.909
 announcements increase in the power of what 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.039
 concerns video accelerator brought 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.799
 power is 50 percent this 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.060
 significantly here so what's the difference on 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.760
 output came pretty susche 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.430
 significant at the moment 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.740
 in my opinion in terms of power 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.340
 flagships the rest are inferior to this 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.149
 The device is basically the same galaxy s5 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.100
 which you can look at 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.660
 a huge number of reviews from 16 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.940
 megapixel camera with two guides 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.980
 gigami ram scanner 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:23.320
 prints and a bunch of other buns here 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.440
 similarly waterproof in general so 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.870
 next the most interesting point is with 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.270
 friend the price of this piece is not 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:36.300
 differing in europe we specify no different 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:38.670
 no way from the usual galaxy s5 then 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.660
 significantly improves it 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.900
 competitiveness I think because 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.850
 that it comes out cheaper recently 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.890
 announced about 200 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.890
 the euro is cheaper than the recently announced 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:56.650
 sony for three and it's cheaper 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:03:01.000
 htc one m8 with that if again 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:05.140
 go to the antutu benchmark we see that 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.070
 again, the increase of 6000 compared to 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.870
 htc one m8 and the price is cheaper so here I am 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.739
 I think this is a very interesting decision from 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.620
 samsung company 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:18.760
 it's very unexpected for October 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:24.850
 I do not know, I have never met 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:26.410
 all about the rest of the things and you 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.190
 no different so look 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.610
 reviews but choose this thanks for 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.610
 Attention
