00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:19.380
 hello I am pastor not there today 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.359
 This was a tattoo artist and I thought 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.769
 I show you today even my room the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.000
 It will soon be made by train as well 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.250
 must be happy as well and papers 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.760
 said hanged say two since 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.900
 months 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.210
 That's why I thought I'm doing now 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.820
 Just because I do not live 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.500
 more so long here and that is mine 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.540
 friend pulled me straight and we 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.790
 actually want to contract and we 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.469
 now have 12 13 square meters here 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.790
 room for two and it is really very 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.550
 tight that we will be right when I do that 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.690
 Show room and that's why we search 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.000
 already have it already 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.210
 few flats are looked at and become 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.590
 then take off soon, unfortunately very 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.360
 bad enough as I wanted too often c 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.270
 where we will work together again soon 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.199

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.489

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.150
 Room I hope you like it that way 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.830
 my room is on the bed 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.490
 it is very very small in 13 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.770
 square meter and that's why I can do it 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.240
 not really big films I am 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.580
 really must always be on the edge with it 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.060
 you see everything I catch 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.340
 there 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.930
 I do not care about the boxes I have 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.670
 really packed up to the top 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.350

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.649

 For example , the wounds are up there 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.140
 also then comes my big one 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.430
 fensterfront you now see not just 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.590
 a lot because it gets very dark because of me 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.810
 Of course backlit movies I have here 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.140

 still such a big flower and stand 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.320
 By the way, this heating is quite complete 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.080
 terrible if you make the power 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.000
 It's two days until she runs when you get her 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.180
 It takes two days to get it out 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.680
 is a very happy david summer is like 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.540
 I said I have very little storage space 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.250
 That's why the cupboard from all 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.489
 This is the one of ikea leadership for 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.930

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.790

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.070
 my girlfriend is not pure and straight 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.510
 this cupboard is actually 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.080
 completely white and not particularly 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.130
 I have him with his mirror 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.830
 sequin 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:22.320

 Stacked up full it is too 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.270
 I also like him very hard 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.550
 neat to keep because it is easy to 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.620
 travels and tables outside out everything 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.490
 I have all my clothes and jackets 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.850

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.070
 my girl bed hereby a cool 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.080

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.320

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.360
 this capri posters and flowers of the 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.370
 I have always stupid poster 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.330
 was suspended, it is almost too 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.520
 girlish 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.170
 meanwhile I find mine especially 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.340
 Friends also with here but lives 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.560
 I still like it anyway 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.360
 good here is also the dice shelf of 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.530
 my friend that I use so well 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.110
 say as a table I have here 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.670
 there is no table and therefore I 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.830
 Finally, the coffee completely on 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.540
 I liked the laptop of my friend 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.950
 because he has his laptop up there 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.410
 and just did not leave him 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.000
 on the way has left the laptop 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.670
 still I was lucky in the pillow 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.850
 mainly his things and 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.440
 then come to the door 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.180
 yes that was it already here 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.420
 my door is hanging there all my jackets 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.710
 and bags and I usually hang them 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.200
 if we turn a video because of it 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.760
 So easy otherwise dark looks fully 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.520
 but now I thought I let's times 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.070
 So that was my culture now 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.560
 my room went very fast 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.270
 has very very small room and it is 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.430
 incredibly difficult such a small one 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.040
 to keep the room tidy because of us 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.060
 of course also here for two 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.680
 no storage space so my 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.690
 friend has very little things here 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.580
 I also looks really good and 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.320
 I do not have stuff here and I'm glad 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.840
 I'll visit a two or ten out of ten 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.890
 three room apartment that i just 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.030
 again a bit of storage space 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.390
 I that I have a small cabinet 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.390
 just for me with my stuff that me 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.290
 more than five branches of my room 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.450
 can keep without the room 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.070
 So right now looks like that 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.940
 really exhausting that annoys too 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:16.230
 the federal ever about the same size 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.690
 but he has only one window I 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:21.780
 at least two, but now they are whole 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.669
 Cool and even a sofa 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.849
 I did not have space for me 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.740
 needed the bin 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:28.479
 but we also turn your high school 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.809
 soon and we will be happy if it 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:32.740
 I liked it when I moved 

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:35.830
 maybe then draws my new one too 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:39.149
 Apartment then thank you for watching 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.149
 and see you soon teams
