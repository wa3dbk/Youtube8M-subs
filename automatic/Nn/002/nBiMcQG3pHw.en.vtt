00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.900
 Yes 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:22.259
 What are you saying about the desired stamp creator 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:25.590
 That line is a line stamp from around April this year also make the general person 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:29.490
 Because it seems to open a system that can be sold 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.310

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.590
 Because it was popular even if you saw the comment from those who look outside, it is already really serious 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.420
 Things to do 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:52.360
 It's about making it seriously and selling it seriously.
