00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.960
 we are or st to the mayor is 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.180
 exactly in factories 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:33.100
 let's evaluate the perfumes of the child 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:36.160
 of the recognition line ok e 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.589
 we also begin to understand if there is a 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.010
 let's say a logical thread with the exam 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:44.409
 visual or not then his rice tied 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.300
 or disconnected so far everything 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:48.129
 let's check that there are or that 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.960
 there are no flaws like those that 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.440
 the wine is samp that there are not any 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.229
 mold that there are no hints of cork 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.420
 and then let's check that the 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.909
 milan is healthy and then we check 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.290
 the intensity and the right assistance 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:03.820
 the first thing that comes in worsened 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.030
 mind just snatched his but the 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.729
 glass is strength 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.890
 the impact that is here next month 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.680
 intense always has an entire intensity 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.900
 which is how it is if the max strong wine 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.720
 like a punch in the nose the least 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.359
 free if persistence and how much 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.140
 resists the memory of mine in the nose up 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:29.049
 in time ok so if now for a while 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.179
 that the glass moves away from the video 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.960
 large nose like the persistent little man o 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:36.310
 much glass persisted 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.740
 inform that even for eight of 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.930
 answer them but in our memory 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.630
 Once my grandmother if we give 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.909
 have used or even more and those 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.460
 they are two really amazing mini 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.409
 incredible then what kind books 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.140
 he knew we intend to give the nose to 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.299
 wine well we could talk about fruit and 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.680
 that we have fruit ripens the fruit 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:01.840
 red the exotic fruit we make gods 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.689
 examples we could have and love and that 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.990
 the apparatuses below the apricots 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:10.420
 of whites our exotic collection 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.400
 map in wine production are beautiful 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.230
 rich and very yellow are interventions 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.600
 all expenses also begin 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.150
 sergio was there that such roasting comes 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.600
 of wood come from psychology 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.960
 of the vines that also many vines 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.510
 since then it's these structures anyway 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.740
 the handles also the same 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:35.310
 may be from the pepper to the ball but 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.320
 same room line discounted say 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.190
 still says the gypsy more to generate 9 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.670
 I am very pleased in the example of expenses 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.470
 tool eversive 2 integrated themes though 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.360
 get out if you want to get out of the usual 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.030
 deadly awards to close the 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.520
 eyes and try to match what 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.890
 will serve at least anything of the 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.680
 future group that will be the first time 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.710
 as for everyone it will not be immediately simple 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.030
 but learning to listen to wine that 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.910
 see in the glass 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.390
 you will surely find many other things 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.400
 new 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.100
 put and then above all you will train the 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.530
 your senses to identify more and more 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.210
 the things present in the wine 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.390
 keep in mind that with the tastings 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.430
 of organic wines that are made of the month there is 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.950
 just an accompaniment to the 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.920
 tasting for each specific wine 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.290
 exact returning to the nose instead 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.510
 another thing for example is the flowers 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.590
 therefore also here the white flowers flowers 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.629
 Detective stories 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.560
 saviola the rose luigi de i fiori di 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:42.640
 acacia there are these perfumes in nature 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:46.950
 and surely you can also find them 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.950
 inside these wonderful wines
