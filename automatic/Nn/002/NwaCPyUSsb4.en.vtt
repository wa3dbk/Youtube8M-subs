 a little video to show you my 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:15.360
 thumb hair tricks and my routine 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:17.250
 capillary it's gone I'm applying from 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.170
 castor oil rooted it's a 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.680
 oil that is considerably at the 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.680

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.700
 Oh 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.630
 in addition I performed a massage 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.510
 to stimulate blood circulation 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:59.330
 and therefore the oxygenation of the scalp 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.330
 this will promote the growth of hair 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.780

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.640
