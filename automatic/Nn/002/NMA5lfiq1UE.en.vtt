00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.980
 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:11.170
 world of wonders science news brain 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.990
 runs hot smartphones and social 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.670
 networks overburden our brain 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.710
 believe swedish scientist of 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.619
 Royal Institute of Technology in 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.359
 stockholm constantly online everywhere 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.240
 To be reachable exceeds the 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.279
 capacities of our memory that 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.869
 problem our brain has no 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.240
 possibility more in the idle too 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.430
 go through the constant urge online 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.650
 and to always be up to date stand 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.809
 revise our working memory 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.329
 and so do not risk information 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.399
 to properly process the idle is 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.800
 important for the brain around memories 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.050
 and information from short-term memory 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.300
 into long-term memory 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.160
 the scientists therefore recommend tablet 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.870
 and mobile phone in the bag and let 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.070
 Just take five minutes 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.570
 Turn off sugar until more dangerous than 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.219
 alcohol and cigarettes 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.620
 sugar has just as high 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.050
 Addiction factor like alcohol and cigarettes 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.600
 before that Dutch experts of the 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.550
 amsterdam mr. service sugary 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.100
 Food and drinks are not just 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.590
 unhealthy and make up but have 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.390
 Also a high addictive sugar can 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.430
 the individual cases even more dangerous 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.240
 be for the health as alcohol and 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.760
 cigarettes 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.920
 the sweet drug damages the liver bothers 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.380
 the metabolism and causes heart 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.510
 Circulatory disorders as well as diabetes the 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.490
 Experts therefore demand similar goods 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.740
 notes on cigarette packs for 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.140
 sugary drinks and food 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.850
 how to protect from caries a glass of milk 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.220
 protects our teeth from caries 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.140
 dentists show the american 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.289
 Dental Association in an exam 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.149
 after sweet food, the pH drops in the 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.920
 mouth and the enamel we ours 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.590
 Teeth protected becomes more susceptible to 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.600
 caries bacteria also other foods 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.060
 like apples and citrus grab the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.470
 enamel immediately after to eat a 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.289
 glass of milk on the other hand lowers that 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.600
 Caries risk the reason the B vitamins 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.880
 The milk neutralizes the acid 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.069
 So who's cute or something household 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.410
 should have eaten afterwards 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.510
 drinking glass of milk at its ph value 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.180
 normalize and so his teeth too 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.580
 protect 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.360
 Sleep disorders caused by smartphones 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.110
 let smartphones and worse 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.450
 sleep 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.000
 to this conclusion comes a study of 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.610
 Washington University with teenagers 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.310
 and students text messaging 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.950
 create partners and friends 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.080
 before going to bed stress though we did 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.019
 we are tired and want to sleep 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.290
 and check social networks status 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.329
 updates of our friends who follow the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.370
 falling asleep takes longer and the 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:47.250
 actual sleep time is shortened 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.170
 enormous and the phones on the 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.290
 bedside table and next to us in bed 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.090
 additionally disturb the sleep messages 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.950
 Sounds and vibrations let us 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.260
 Sleep restlessly and sleep lightly 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.690
 wake up scientist guessing therefore 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.680
 the smartphone off before sleeping or 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.420
 switch at least in the idle mode, 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.700
 mass stranding of choices more and more 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.859
 Whales stood on the coasts of Europe 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.250
 this is shown in a recent study by 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:15.630
 wildlife conservation society 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.489
 For the first time it could be proven that 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.100
 Underwater noise for mass stranding 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.660
 of whales and dolphins off the coast 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.269
 croatia and greece 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.549
 especially echolot is responsible 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.350
 systems with compressed air guns for 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.900
 the search for oil and natural gas used 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.850
 will cause the biggest noise though 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.980
 also ship's screws big 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.799
 Container ships produce crack in the 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.470
 marine creatures like whales and 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.419
 dolphins communicate orient themselves 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.870
 and hunt with the help of sound waves 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:47.790
 they are sent and received 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.070
 this greatly disturbed or even drowned out 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.350
 can have the devastating consequences 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.449
 many animals can no longer find food 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.100
 or lose the orientation and 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:58.229
 stranded on the coasts 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.850
 Environmentalists are now calling for the echo sounder 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:02.660
 Systems with compressed air can now 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.310
 be restricted 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.530
 orgasm guarantee thanks to socket 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.200
 socks in bed make women feel better 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.150
 the climax to this result comes a 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.209
 Dutch study of the university 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.070
 groningen in the investigation came 80 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.470
 percent of the participants more often 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.780
 orgasm if you were worried while wearing sex 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.460
 without stockings, however , only the 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.820
 half of the women to the sexual 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.710
 highlight the bottom cold feet lower 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.440
 the female libido and thus the 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.630
 opportunity provided to a orgasm 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.419
 while keeping your feet warm 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.460
 for more pleasure in the bed next to warm feet 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.100
 but is also the right environment for 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.690
 a female orgasm is important 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.400
 The bedroom is cozy and warm 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.979
 women feel more comfortable and the 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.660
 female lust rises that one the world 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.160
 Thanks for the miracle science news 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.580
 watch it all the way up to the 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.580
 next time
