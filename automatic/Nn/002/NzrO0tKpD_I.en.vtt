the<00:00:00.120> tuning<00:00:00.390> system<00:00:00.719> there<00:00:00.960> right<00:00:02.870> he's<00:00:03.870> at

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
the tuning system there right he's at

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.110 
the tuning system there right he's at
efforts<00:00:04.290> here<00:00:04.529> which<00:00:04.890> are<00:00:05.040> adjustable<00:00:05.279> with

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
efforts here which are adjustable with

onto little LED through this tube tube
just<00:00:40.020> there<00:00:40.790> we've<00:00:41.790> got<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> lot<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.180> pent-up

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
just there we've got a lot of pent-up

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.470 
just there we've got a lot of pent-up
resistor<00:00:42.960> there<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.520> then<00:00:44.520> he<00:00:44.640> follows<00:00:45.000> on<00:00:45.180> to

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.460 

this<00:02:14.410> is<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.620> coding<00:02:14.950> system<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:19.080> which<00:02:20.080> as<00:02:20.320> I

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
this is the coding system to which as I

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.780 
this is the coding system to which as I
said<00:02:20.530> I'm<00:02:20.770> still<00:02:20.800> working<00:02:21.310> on<00:02:21.430> a<00:02:21.840> little<00:02:22.840> lamb

said I'm still working on a little lamb

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:57.870 
said I'm still working on a little lamb
then<00:02:24.790> we'll<00:02:25.030> switch<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:54.570> mana<00:02:55.769> generator<00:02:56.880> can

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
then we'll switch the mana generator can

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.699 
then we'll switch the mana generator can
