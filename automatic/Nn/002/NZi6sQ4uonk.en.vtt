00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.930 
the way the magic was done it was really
unique<00:02:22.769> I<00:02:23.519> would<00:02:24.420> try<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.750> explain<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.319> except

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
unique I would try to explain it except

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.110 
unique I would try to explain it except
the<00:02:27.590> reason<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.650> even<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.519> author<00:02:29.700> like

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
the reason that even the author like

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.050 
the reason that even the author like
candles<00:02:31.250> explaining<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.430> magic<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:32.910> like

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
candles explaining the magic in like

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.199 
candles explaining the magic in like
chunks<00:02:33.660> because<00:02:33.959> it's<00:02:34.950> kind<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:35.940> hard<00:02:36.120> to

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
chunks because it's kind of hard to

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.789 
chunks because it's kind of hard to
explain<00:02:36.390> it's<00:02:36.810> kind<00:02:36.989> of<00:02:37.019> hard<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.260> like<00:02:37.500> grasp

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
explain it's kind of hard to like grasp

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.570 
explain it's kind of hard to like grasp
the<00:02:38.100> idea<00:02:38.220> so<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.030> see<00:02:39.299> why<00:02:40.040> Brandon<00:02:41.040> Sanderson

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
the idea so I see why Brandon Sanderson

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.610 
the idea so I see why Brandon Sanderson
had<00:02:41.900> kind<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:43.049> spaced<00:02:43.650> out<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:45.049> show<00:02:46.049> you<00:02:46.110> how

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
had kind of spaced out and show you how

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.610 
had kind of spaced out and show you how
the<00:02:47.150> magic<00:02:48.150> in<00:02:48.299> his<00:02:48.450> land<00:02:48.690> works<00:02:48.959> piece<00:02:49.380> by

the magic in his land works piece by

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.160 
the magic in his land works piece by
piece<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.910> know<00:02:51.000> kind<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.390> explained<00:02:51.930> it

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
piece and you know kind of explained it

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.160 
piece and you know kind of explained it
over<00:02:52.860> time<00:02:53.160> instead<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.150> just<00:02:54.390> overwhelming

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
over time instead of just overwhelming

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.990 
over time instead of just overwhelming
you<00:02:55.290> with<00:02:55.319> this<00:02:55.590> general<00:02:56.160> idea<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.819> have

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
you with this general idea and you have

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.789 
you with this general idea and you have
to<00:02:57.150> kind<00:02:57.330> of<00:02:57.450> work<00:02:57.600> with<00:02:57.660> that<00:02:58.049> throughout<00:02:58.620> the

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
to kind of work with that throughout the

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.949 
to kind of work with that throughout the
whole<00:02:58.980> book<00:02:59.160> now<00:02:59.400> he<00:02:59.459> takes<00:02:59.850> time<00:03:00.269> to<00:03:00.600> piece<00:03:00.930> it

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
whole book now he takes time to piece it

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.320 
whole book now he takes time to piece it
out<00:03:01.230> for<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:01.920> so<00:03:02.519> it's<00:03:02.700> really<00:03:02.790> really

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330

out for you and so it's really really
nice<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:04.260> thought<00:03:04.769> it<00:03:04.920> was<00:03:05.010> really<00:03:05.400> really

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
nice and I thought it was really really

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.220 
nice and I thought it was really really
solid<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:08.010> strange<00:03:08.310> thing<00:03:08.609> is<00:03:08.640> like<00:03:09.120> this<00:03:09.810> it

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
solid the strange thing is like this it

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.810 
solid the strange thing is like this it
it's<00:03:10.680> like<00:03:10.890> you<00:03:11.250> can<00:03:11.430> read<00:03:11.549> it<00:03:11.700> as<00:03:11.790> a

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
it's like you can read it as a

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.870 
it's like you can read it as a
standalone<00:03:12.440> because<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.950> main<00:03:14.190> conflict

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
standalone because the main conflict

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.940 
standalone because the main conflict
that<00:03:15.060> they<00:03:15.209> bring<00:03:15.450> up<00:03:15.660> gets<00:03:16.290> resolved<00:03:16.680> in<00:03:16.920> the

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.890 
end of course there are a lot of like
unanswered<00:03:19.410> questions<00:03:20.000> but<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:22.680> main

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
a series and the conflict gets result in

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.440 
a series and the conflict gets result in
the<00:03:38.280> first<00:03:38.489> book<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:38.940> so<00:03:39.060> I'm<00:03:39.120> like<00:03:39.269> there's

of<00:03:48.930> views<00:03:49.109> if<00:03:49.350> I<00:03:49.470> remember<00:03:49.799> correctly<00:03:50.030> which

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
of views if I remember correctly which

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.690 
of views if I remember correctly which
is<00:03:51.299> I<00:03:51.750> would<00:03:52.170> say<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.560> main<00:03:52.739> characters<00:03:53.250> then

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
is I would say the main characters then

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.670 
is I would say the main characters then
and<00:03:54.090> then<00:03:54.829> the<00:03:56.030> secondary<00:03:57.030> would<00:03:57.900> be<00:03:58.109> like

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
and then the secondary would be like

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.289 
and then the secondary would be like
hell<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.750> then<00:04:00.920> the<00:04:01.920> third<00:04:02.160> would<00:04:02.489> be<00:04:02.519> someone

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
hell and then the third would be someone

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:09.349 
hell and then the third would be someone
who<00:04:03.650> I<00:04:05.150> think<00:04:06.150> his<00:04:06.239> name's<00:04:06.420> elland<00:04:07.019> I<00:04:08.359> forget

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
and those are the three point of views

and those are the three point of views
you<00:04:15.359> get<00:04:15.510> and<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:15.810> only<00:04:16.079> get

conclude the entire book and you're like
what<00:05:11.340> um<00:05:12.350> so<00:05:13.400> this<00:05:14.400> is<00:05:14.550> really<00:05:14.700> interesting

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
what um so this is really interesting

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.790 
what um so this is really interesting
because<00:05:15.300> I<00:05:15.570> would<00:05:15.750> say<00:05:15.930> it<00:05:16.110> does<00:05:16.380> have<00:05:16.770> a

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
because I would say it does have a

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.440 
because I would say it does have a
conclusion<00:05:17.720> yet<00:05:18.720> there<00:05:19.140> are<00:05:19.320> still<00:05:19.350> some<00:05:20.010> like

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
conclusion yet there are still some like

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.430 
conclusion yet there are still some like
unanswered<00:05:21.450> questions<00:05:21.840> which<00:05:22.050> I'm<00:05:22.200> guessing

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
unanswered questions which I'm guessing

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.140 
unanswered questions which I'm guessing
we're<00:05:22.800> gonna<00:05:22.919> explore<00:05:23.250> in<00:05:23.490> the<00:05:23.580> next<00:05:23.610> books

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
we're gonna explore in the next books

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.840 
we're gonna explore in the next books
and<00:05:24.480> I'm<00:05:25.290> guessing<00:05:25.710> obviously<00:05:26.280> since<00:05:26.580> there

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
and I'm guessing obviously since there

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.400 
and I'm guessing obviously since there
are<00:05:26.970> two<00:05:27.120> more<00:05:27.270> books<00:05:27.450> are<00:05:27.660> going<00:05:27.750> to<00:05:27.840> be<00:05:27.990> a<00:05:28.020> new

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
are two more books are going to be a new

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.980 
are two more books are going to be a new
conflict<00:05:28.830> and<00:05:29.310> so<00:05:29.970> it's<00:05:30.270> really<00:05:30.360> interesting

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
conflict and so it's really interesting

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.770 
conflict and so it's really interesting
and<00:05:31.440> I<00:05:31.620> really<00:05:32.430> like<00:05:32.580> the<00:05:32.760> use<00:05:32.790> of<00:05:32.970> prophecy

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
and I really like the use of prophecy

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.030 
and I really like the use of prophecy
because<00:05:34.490> so<00:05:35.490> much<00:05:35.640> time<00:05:35.700> has<00:05:36.150> passed<00:05:36.480> since

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 
because so much time has passed since

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.970 
because so much time has passed since
they've<00:05:38.040> been<00:05:38.070> oppressed<00:05:39.050> that<00:05:40.050> the

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
they've been oppressed that the

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.610 
they've been oppressed that the
prophecies<00:05:41.580> have<00:05:42.150> startin<00:05:42.570> to<00:05:42.690> be<00:05:42.870> have

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
prophecies have startin to be have

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.290 
prophecies have startin to be have
started<00:05:44.070> to<00:05:44.100> be<00:05:44.910> forgotten<00:05:45.660> and<00:05:46.310> so<00:05:47.310> pieces

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
started to be forgotten and so pieces

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.600 
started to be forgotten and so pieces
will<00:05:48.480> come<00:05:48.750> surface<00:05:49.410> and<00:05:49.830> it's<00:05:50.130> just<00:05:50.460> it's

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
will come surface and it's just it's

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.340 
will come surface and it's just it's
really<00:05:50.700> interesting<00:05:51.180> I<00:05:51.540> really<00:05:51.570> like<00:05:51.960> the<00:05:52.230> way

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.840 
everything balances out I really like
the<00:05:55.050> way<00:05:55.169> everything<00:05:55.890> is<00:05:56.010> set<00:05:56.190> up<00:05:56.220> I'm<00:05:56.580> really
