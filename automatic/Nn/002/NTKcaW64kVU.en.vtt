00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:10.330
 Hello today I show you the latest 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.920
 version of my storage system that's how it looks 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.320
 First of all from them and me 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.720
 I'll show you the whole thing first 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.759
 works and for that I press first 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:24.279
 here on the doctors then I have 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:27.070
 now gone is a double , so to speak 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.749
 crate and can the doctors of me 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.630
 I take the account previously settled 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:34.210
 I would like now we would like 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.539
 I can get food here on the 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.789
 respective lamp is always on 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:42.690
 and then I have my order here 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:46.449
 then eat on the comstor 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.210
 for example, it comes to the counter 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:52.370
 I can not always 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.950
 At the same time naeve take again doctors 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.750
 what you see the boxes were again 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:01.840
 sorted correctly and come back again 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.840
 I take the armor from 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.420
 yes in any case very very well there 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.130
 no problem 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.170
 however I have this version in the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.450
 compared to the last version a 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.570
 bit changed in the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.490
 functionally and although there are now 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.200
 no child safety here for example 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.080
 that is if I press here now and 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.690
 Then right after that, press here 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.210
 the whole thing broke because that 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.650
 just can not stand it however 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.230
 not here for the multiplayer anyway 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.350
 of course saying fall is always people 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.360
 that would give up the whole click and 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.670
 then this is also child safety 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.110
 or idiots insurance does not help 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.570
 That's why I come rather expanded 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:51.479
 that is, this is really only 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:54.270
 compatible for the singleplayer so here 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.210
 red storm and yes then I'll show you 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.590
 the outer one 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.630
 that's what it looks like and mine 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.850
 previous version of this 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.580
 that certainly noticed that 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.690
 really become a lot more compact 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.130
 is 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.620
 Who fly around a bit ? 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.270
 Show a bit and yes I'm pretty 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.580
 to have gotten so proud 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.050
 There are hardly any free spaces where you can 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.660
 something else could have been installed 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:27.390
 that is, the whole is so to speak 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.740
 kept compact as possible 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.310
 Here are all the news now 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:36.060
 just 1 valeska is there then I get me 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.060
 Now something else again 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.849
 so exactly this sound belongs 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.190
 listen carefully 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.370
 which is always played when all 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.849
 mainz back there they were at the beginning 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.129
 should 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:04.409
 that is, after this sound I can 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.409
 click on something new again 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.570
 so m 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.520
 what else would I say 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.710
 yes here to definitely one last 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.670
 picture I hope this is now the third 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:21.310
 version will be glad if you that 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.280
 video rates depending on if you guys 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.770
 liked or yes 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.810
 you want to see the picture 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.690
 the whole thing stuck 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.990
 that means we now have 49 karls here 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:39.430
 on each side up to 15 times cats 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:41.080
 that could have been per page 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.520
 However, it will be a bit 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.360
 I just think 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.790
 you have to definitely the timings and 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.250
 changing pack still put peter 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:56.800
 that's why I would say no more than ten 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:58.180
 the theme should pack well then yes 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.410
 That's it, I hope you liked it 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.080
 like i said i would like about one 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:06.120
 review and then we'll see each other 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.120
 in the next video until then
