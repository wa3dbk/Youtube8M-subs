kidding<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.420> they're<00:00:42.660> not<00:00:42.780> really<00:00:42.899> that

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
kidding but they're not really that

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.250 
kidding but they're not really that
great<00:00:43.230> but<00:00:43.559> they're<00:00:43.800> pretty<00:00:44.250> cool<00:00:44.460> they're

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
they're kind of light and I'm kind of

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.060 
they're kind of light and I'm kind of
doubtful<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.020> there's<00:00:49.200> actually<00:00:49.530> 100<00:00:49.829> shots

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
doubtful that there's actually 100 shots

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.400 
doubtful that there's actually 100 shots
in<00:00:50.219> here<00:00:50.399> because<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.300> rapid<00:00:51.750> fires<00:00:52.020> but

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
in here because it just rapid fires but

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.119 
in here because it just rapid fires but
there's<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.430> fuse<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.289> this<00:00:55.289> side<00:00:55.530> up<00:00:55.739> as<00:00:56.010> you

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
there's the fuse and this side up as you

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.569 
there's the fuse and this side up as you
can<00:00:56.280> clearly<00:00:56.760> tell<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:59.039> 100<00:00:59.340> shot<00:00:59.550> of

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
can clearly tell and it's 100 shot of

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.410 
can clearly tell and it's 100 shot of
pearls<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:01.730> I<00:01:02.730> think<00:01:02.940> it's<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.149> red<00:01:03.390> and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420

I'm<00:02:16.040> just<00:02:16.310> kind<00:02:16.459> of<00:02:16.489> guessing<00:02:16.700> I'm<00:02:16.969> gonna<00:02:17.120> say

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
I'm just kind of guessing I'm gonna say

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.030 
I'm just kind of guessing I'm gonna say
it's<00:02:17.420> 2<00:02:17.689> inches<00:02:18.670> yeah<00:02:19.670> 2<00:02:20.209> inches<00:02:20.480> maybe<00:02:21.040> that

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
it's 2 inches yeah 2 inches maybe that

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.319 
it's 2 inches yeah 2 inches maybe that
doesn't<00:02:22.340> really<00:02:22.579> matter<00:02:22.819> it's<00:02:23.269> a

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
doesn't really matter it's a

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:24.759 
doesn't really matter it's a
thunderstorm<00:02:23.599> Michelle<00:02:24.019> up<00:02:24.170> had<00:02:24.349> these<00:02:24.530> that

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
thunderstorm Michelle up had these that

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.250

maraj but what it is is it shoots off is
the<00:04:12.799> air<00:04:12.979> it<00:04:13.549> will<00:04:13.639> crack<00:04:13.970> open<00:04:14.000> into<00:04:14.599> three

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
the air it will crack open into three

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.979 
the air it will crack open into three
shots<00:04:15.889> that<00:04:16.159> kind<00:04:16.459> of<00:04:16.579> look<00:04:16.669> like<00:04:16.849> that<00:04:17.120> but

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
shots that kind of look like that but

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.170 
shots that kind of look like that but
they're<00:04:18.349> gold<00:04:18.650> and<00:04:19.009> they<00:04:19.370> are<00:04:19.699> just<00:04:20.000> they're

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
they're gold and they are just they're

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.060 
they're gold and they are just they're
just<00:04:20.209> three<00:04:20.570> of<00:04:20.659> them<00:04:20.780> and<00:04:20.900> then<00:04:21.380> those<00:04:21.680> shots

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
just three of them and then those shots

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.209 
just three of them and then those shots
will<00:04:22.430> break<00:04:22.729> off<00:04:22.940> into<00:04:23.180> three<00:04:23.510> more<00:04:23.930> and<00:04:24.260> then

00:04:25.209 --> 00:04:25.219 
will break off into three more and then

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:27.250 
will break off into three more and then
I<00:04:25.250> think<00:04:25.789> those<00:04:26.450> shots<00:04:26.900> will<00:04:27.050> burn

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
I think those shots will burn

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.500 
I think those shots will burn
into<00:04:27.620> a<00:04:27.710> couple<00:04:28.070> so<00:04:28.520> what<00:04:28.640> lasts<00:04:29.000> about<00:04:29.090> 30

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
into a couple so what lasts about 30

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.430 
into a couple so what lasts about 30
seconds<00:04:30.050> in<00:04:30.140> the<00:04:30.170> air

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
seconds in the air

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.440 
seconds in the air
well<00:04:31.040> not<00:04:31.220> 30<00:04:31.400> probably<00:04:31.730> about<00:04:31.820> 10<00:04:32.060> seconds

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
well not 30 probably about 10 seconds

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.870 
well not 30 probably about 10 seconds
and<00:04:32.600> it's<00:04:32.780> really<00:04:32.990> it's<00:04:33.920> really<00:04:34.010> cool<00:04:34.340> that's

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
and it's really it's really cool that's

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.130 
and it's really it's really cool that's
kind<00:04:35.210> of<00:04:35.240> what<00:04:35.360> it<00:04:35.450> looks<00:04:35.600> like<00:04:35.720> in<00:04:35.900> the<00:04:35.990> end

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
kind of what it looks like in the end

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.740 
kind of what it looks like in the end
but<00:04:36.800> uh<00:04:36.830> it's<00:04:37.490> actually<00:04:37.760> it's<00:04:38.090> probably<00:04:38.690> the

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
but uh it's actually it's probably the
