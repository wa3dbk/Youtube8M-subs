one<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.190> most<00:00:17.310> important<00:00:17.910> service<00:00:18.449> tasks

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
one of the most important service tasks

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.189 
one of the most important service tasks
I'm<00:00:19.170> told<00:00:19.470> involves<00:00:20.279> wheel<00:00:20.970> bearings<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.960> if

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
I'm told involves wheel bearings and if

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.200 
I'm told involves wheel bearings and if
you<00:00:22.410> don't<00:00:22.680> know<00:00:22.859> much<00:00:23.100> about<00:00:23.130> our<00:00:23.430> v's<00:00:23.880> or

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
you don't know much about our v's or

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.689 
you don't know much about our v's or
travel<00:00:24.600> trailers<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.949> don't<00:00:26.130> really<00:00:26.340> know

what<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.180> heck<00:00:27.330> wheel<00:00:27.750> bearings<00:00:28.289> are<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.130> why

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
what the heck wheel bearings are and why

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.099 
what the heck wheel bearings are and why
you<00:00:29.910> need<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.210> have<00:00:30.390> them<00:00:30.599> serviced<00:00:31.050> regularly

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
you need to have them serviced regularly

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.139 
you need to have them serviced regularly
so<00:00:31.710> we're<00:00:31.830> gonna<00:00:31.949> talk<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.430> Jim<00:00:32.759> an

experienced service technician about
what's<00:00:35.610> involved<00:00:36.110> your<00:00:37.129> wheel<00:00:38.129> bearings<00:00:38.690> are

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
what's involved your wheel bearings are

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.830 
what's involved your wheel bearings are
one<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.050> main<00:00:40.170> important<00:00:40.649> things<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.460> your

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
one of the main important things on your

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.650 
one of the main important things on your
axle<00:00:42.860> if<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.980> wheel<00:00:44.160> bearings<00:00:44.550> fail<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
axle if the wheel bearings fail the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.270 
axle if the wheel bearings fail the
wheel<00:00:45.840> can<00:00:46.170> come<00:00:46.410> off<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.800> cause<00:00:46.860> severe

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
wheel can come off and cause severe

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.490 
wheel can come off and cause severe
damage<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> vehicle<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:49.140> bearings

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
damage to the vehicle the bearings

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.200 
damage to the vehicle the bearings
should<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.800> packed<00:00:50.039> anywhere<00:00:50.520> from<00:00:50.760> eight<00:00:51.000> to

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
should be packed anywhere from eight to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.990 
should be packed anywhere from eight to
twelve<00:00:51.480> thousand<00:00:52.050> miles<00:00:55.489> lack<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.699> grease

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
twelve thousand miles lack of grease

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.069 
twelve thousand miles lack of grease
they<00:00:57.239> overheat<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.649> then<00:00:58.980> just<00:00:59.750> become<00:01:00.750> metal

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
they overheat and then just become metal

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.319 
they overheat and then just become metal
on<00:01:01.199> metal<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:01.829> like<00:01:02.010> brake<00:01:02.460> shoes<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> car

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
on metal just like brake shoes on a car

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.929 
on metal just like brake shoes on a car
when<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> pad<00:01:03.930> wears<00:01:04.260> out<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:05.489> metal<00:01:05.850> is

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
when the pad wears out the metal is

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.200 
when the pad wears out the metal is
rubbing<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> disk<00:01:06.770> yeah<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:08.490> basically<00:01:09.000> is

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
rubbing the disk yeah this basically is

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.890 
rubbing the disk yeah this basically is
on<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.540> spindle<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.680> axle<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.689> it<00:01:12.689> just

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
on the spindle of the axle and it just

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:22.890 
on the spindle of the axle and it just
wears<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.320> out<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:20.119> eventually<00:01:21.119> adjusts

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
wears it out and eventually adjusts

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.700 
wears it out and eventually adjusts
dissipate<00:01:23.860> you<00:01:24.280> know<00:01:24.400> it<00:01:24.640> just<00:01:24.940> wears<00:01:25.630> out<00:01:25.900> it

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
dissipate you know it just wears out it

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.090 
dissipate you know it just wears out it
gets<00:01:26.890> hard<00:01:27.190> brittle<00:01:27.670> creates<00:01:28.630> crust<00:01:29.020> and<00:01:29.350> just

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
gets hard brittle creates crust and just

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.620 
gets hard brittle creates crust and just
gets<00:01:30.370> in<00:01:30.550> between<00:01:30.730> the<00:01:30.970> bearings<00:01:31.300> of<00:01:31.420> where's

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
gets in between the bearings of where's

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:39.030 
gets in between the bearings of where's
the<00:01:31.750> mouse<00:01:36.270> well<00:01:37.270> time<00:01:38.020> if<00:01:38.230> it's<00:01:38.410> parked<00:01:38.830> for

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
the mouse well time if it's parked for

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.710 
the mouse well time if it's parked for
long<00:01:39.220> periods<00:01:39.670> of<00:01:39.790> time<00:01:40.000> you<00:01:40.030> should<00:01:40.300> probably

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
long periods of time you should probably

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.570 
long periods of time you should probably
go<00:01:40.990> ahead<00:01:41.020> and<00:01:41.290> have<00:01:41.530> them<00:01:41.710> check<00:01:41.740> because<00:01:42.430> the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
go ahead and have them check because the

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.120 
go ahead and have them check because the
grease<00:01:42.850> will<00:01:43.120> dry<00:01:43.780> out<00:01:46.170> if<00:01:47.170> you<00:01:47.440> use<00:01:47.680> it<00:01:47.890> a<00:01:47.980> lot

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
grease will dry out if you use it a lot

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.830 
grease will dry out if you use it a lot
I<00:01:48.460> would<00:01:48.610> say<00:01:48.940> anywhere<00:01:49.210> from<00:01:49.390> eight<00:01:49.690> to

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
I would say anywhere from eight to

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.750 
I would say anywhere from eight to
twelve<00:01:50.080> thousand<00:01:50.560> miles<00:01:50.740> go<00:01:51.340> ahead<00:01:51.550> and<00:01:51.640> get

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
twelve thousand miles go ahead and get

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.580 
twelve thousand miles go ahead and get
the<00:01:51.850> wheel<00:01:52.000> bearings<00:01:52.390> back<00:01:52.600> it's<00:01:53.170> better<00:01:53.410> to

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
the wheel bearings back it's better to

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:08.810 
the wheel bearings back it's better to
be<00:01:53.710> safe<00:01:54.010> than<00:01:54.070> to<00:01:54.340> have<00:01:54.580> an<00:01:54.700> accident<00:01:55.180> right

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.390 

there<00:02:09.820> wasn't<00:02:10.300> a<00:02:10.360> lot<00:02:10.510> of<00:02:10.540> grease<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:12.160> one

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
there wasn't a lot of grease this one

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.480 
there wasn't a lot of grease this one
I've<00:02:12.520> kind<00:02:12.760> of<00:02:12.820> wiped<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.240> grease<00:02:13.510> off<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:14.080> it

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
I've kind of wiped the grease off of it

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.930 
I've kind of wiped the grease off of it
this<00:02:15.490> is<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:16.270> grease<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:16.840> was<00:02:17.170> left<00:02:17.700> on<00:02:18.700> the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
this is the grease that was left on the

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.970 
this is the grease that was left on the
front<00:02:19.090> bearing<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:20.320> you<00:02:20.410> can<00:02:20.590> see<00:02:20.770> there's

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
front bearing and you can see there's

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.730 
front bearing and you can see there's
very<00:02:21.400> little<00:02:21.610> grease<00:02:21.910> in<00:02:22.150> it<00:02:22.270> okay<00:02:22.930> yeah<00:02:23.410> I<00:02:23.500> saw

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
very little grease in it okay yeah I saw

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:31.630 
very little grease in it okay yeah I saw
it<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.430> was<00:02:24.580> time<00:02:24.850> to<00:02:24.910> have<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.510> done

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.080 

you<00:02:32.270> can<00:02:32.420> be<00:02:32.540> in<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:32.870> out<00:02:32.930> in<00:02:33.110> one<00:02:33.140> day

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
you can be in and out in one day

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.120 
you can be in and out in one day
normally<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.180> takes<00:02:35.380> two<00:02:36.380> maybe<00:02:36.650> three<00:02:36.980> hours

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
normally it takes two maybe three hours

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.460 
normally it takes two maybe three hours
to<00:02:37.459> do<00:02:37.610> double<00:02:38.480> apps<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.780> trade<00:02:38.990> so<00:02:39.380> you're

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
to do double apps the trade so you're

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.780 
to do double apps the trade so you're
not<00:02:39.590> gonna<00:02:39.740> go<00:02:39.950> without<00:02:40.100> your<00:02:40.340> trailer<00:02:40.640> for<00:02:40.760> a

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
not gonna go without your trailer for a

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.220 
not gonna go without your trailer for a
long<00:02:40.940> period<00:02:41.209> of<00:02:41.240> time<00:02:41.330> yeah<00:02:41.780> wrap<00:02:41.959> it<00:02:42.110> off

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
long period of time yeah wrap it off

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.840 
long period of time yeah wrap it off
pick<00:02:42.500> it<00:02:42.590> back<00:02:42.680> up<00:02:42.890> that's<00:02:43.370> right<00:02:43.520> you<00:02:43.700> can

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
pick it back up that's right you can

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.880 
pick it back up that's right you can
drop<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.180> off<00:02:44.360> it<00:02:44.569> in<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:45.230> morning<00:02:45.650> if<00:02:45.770> the

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
drop it off it in the morning if the
