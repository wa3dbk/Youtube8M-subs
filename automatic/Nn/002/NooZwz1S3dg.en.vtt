 Yes

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.720

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.850
 2 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.320
 and 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.200
 hello and welcome to this video 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.059
 in which we are going to talk about 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.920
 improvisation on the guitar 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.990
 say of our ability to create 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.970
 melodies and solos as I just 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.190
 do it in a totally improvised way 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.720
 so this is a delicate subject for 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.880
 a lot of guitarists because even 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.720
 among musicians who already have a 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.370
 some experience 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.290
 improvisation is something that 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.150
 scared because it looks pretty 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.720
 abstract it almost seems out 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.850
 of reach 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.930
 yet when we go beyond these 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.430
 blockages and its doubts 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.920
 improvisation is something 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.960
 quite simple in itself so of course there 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.310
 this is a nearly endless subject and we 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.030
 can spend a lifetime working 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.520
 improvisation 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.380
 but even for a musician who starts 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.729
 improvisation it is possible very 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.260
 quickly to succeed 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.030
 some notes to create small 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.860
 melodies totally 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.930
 improvised and that's what we're going 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.920
 do in this series of dedicated videos 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.660
 improvisation 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.220
 so in this first video we 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.840
 let's first try to cut 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.000
 short of some conventional wisdom 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.619
 about improvisation first of all 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.570
 do you usually know which is the most 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.030
 big obstacles that come up to 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.010
 guitarists who wish improvised 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.900
 well, it's simple most of the time 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.390
 the main block is the guitarist 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.619
 himself and especially his preconceptions 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.110
 on improvisation 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.880
 suddenly it is often enough for a small 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.860
 questioning to come to 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.110
 overcome its blockages and be able to 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.370
 improvise freely so here are the 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.170
 main doubts the principal has 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.730
 priori that we meet at the 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.740
 most guitarists who wish 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.960
 to embark on improvisation 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.250
 improvisation is complicated or 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.780
 it will take years of practice 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.240
 intensive before we get to anything 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.770
 so when we try to play 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.480
 an existing piece actually the 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.280
 things seem much more concrete 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.020
 we can listen to the original we can 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.430
 follow a score or follow the 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.650
 advice from our guitarist 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.900
 in short, we have both auditory markers 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.240
 and visual so we know exactly what 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.370
 do in improvisation we do not have 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.170
 model no visual cues one has to 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.910
 use his creativity and his 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.410
 musical instinct somehow 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.660
 so even if we can approach 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.130
 improvisation in a theoretical way he 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.200
 there will be a moment when we will be 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.210
 obliged to let go and start 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.570
 trust his ear and his 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.580
 felt second received idea it takes 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.680
 know solfeggio or theory for 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.970
 to be able to improvise 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.560
 so certainly the theory can be a 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.190
 interesting tool in the practice of 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.510
 improvisation 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.820
 but it's not an element 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.570
 indispensable and it is absolutely not 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.920
 an end in itself 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.510
 there is also very good 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.190
 improviser who do not know of 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.140
 all the music theory and who are incapable 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.850
 to say why they played this or 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.980
 such note on the moment he knew 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.010
 simply instinctively that the 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.810
 note was going to ring properly 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.890
 third, we must be able to 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.200
 move your fingers very quickly and 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.090
 to link notes very quickly 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.319
 so actually some guitarist 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.120
 where some music styles are 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.500
 known to highlight their 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.750
 technique and web speed 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.620
 notes and if that's your goal it 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.629
 will have to work this point 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.670
 specifically but it's absolutely 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.379
 not useful for improvising solos 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.030
 interesting and besides the solos of 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.640
 most memorable guitars are not 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.170
 necessarily the fastest fourth 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.650
 belief must have a good 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.660
 hear 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.000
 so this time it's an idea 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.410
 that I can not contradict indeed 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.690
 what is called the ear that is in 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.390
 makes our ability to identify 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.860
 sounds rhythms of notes okay there 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.519
 This is a crucial element in 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.440
 improvisation 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.510
 but contrary to what many 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.729
 guitarists think the ear is not a 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.889
 gift fell from the sky on some musicians 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.570
 lucky even if we start the guitar 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.950
 our ear is absolutely not 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.830
 beginner in listening to music 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.330
 melodies or notes in general 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.430
 even before reaching adulthood 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.229
 our ear to listen to billions of 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.600
 musical notes and has developed over 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.360
 of time the ability to recognize 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.830
 notes of chords or sounds as well 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.690
 when you hear a piece that you 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.490
 like and that you know well 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.380
 you just need a few notes 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.810
 to instantly recognize the 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.639
 melody and identify the piece so 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.530
 without our knowing it our ear has 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.090
 naturally many skills 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.370
 more developed than we imagine 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.630
 so even if it is possible and useful to 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.400
 work our reign for 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.990
 progress in our musical practice 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.970
 it is above all useful to do 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.440
 trust our ear and learn 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.300
 to use it the right way 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.760
 finally a last received idea that we 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.840
 often meets solos it's good 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.180
 for the electric guitar 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.680
 so there are certainly many solos of 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.640
 legendary guitar that are played on 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.810
 electric guitars 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.400
 but it's absolutely not a 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.680
 practice reserved for the guitar 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.360
 electric make a solo or improvised 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.310
 is simply to create melodies 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.050
 that we will be able to play on a piece 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.640
 by choosing the notes they are going 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.290
 sound harmoniously by 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.120
 compared to pieces the type 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.100
 instruments which are used only between 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.810
 therefore absolutely not relevant 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.360
 we can improvise on any 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.380
 instrument or even singing suddenly 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.330
 that you play on a guitar 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.280
 electric a folk guitar or a 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.320
 classical guitar that will not prevent you 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.970
 in any case to be able to improvise at the 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.240
 guitar and take a lot of 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.460
 pleasure 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.410
 so to start practicing 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.060
 improvisation we will use the 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.490
 accompanying playback that you have 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.690
 could hear at the beginning of this video and 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.060
 that you will be able to download very 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.949
 soon after the second video of 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.419
 this series we will start to 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:59.770
 find out what are the notes that we 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.599
 let's play to be able to 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.130
 improvise on this piece by not having 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:03.490
 no risk of falling on fake 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.289
 Notes 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.270
 in the meantime I have something to you 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.800
 ask I would like you to leave a 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.110
 comment right below this 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.940
 video to answer the few 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.540
 following questions which are 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.400
 very simple questions 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.430
 have you ever practiced improvisation 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.810
 on the guitar 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.430
 and if not what is it 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.210
 prevented is that it's a question 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.920
 of knowledge 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.380
 not knowing where 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.150
 start or lack of confidence in 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.310
 your ability to improvise 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.070
 tell me what is your point of view 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.540
 is your feeling about the question and if 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.950
 you have already practiced improvisation 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.810
 and what are the main 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.520
 difficulties you have encountered 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.020
 what is blocking you or what is it 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.270
 which prevents you from progressing and 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.050
 take more pleasure in improvising to 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.789
 the guitar 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.169
 so I really rely on you for 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:50.090
 answer these questions in the 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:52.220
 comments at the bottom of the article 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.310
 to help me guide you through 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.599
 upcoming videos to make your 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:59.000
 practice of guitar improvisation 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:00.710
 I thank you for your trust and 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.180
 for your loyalty and we end up
