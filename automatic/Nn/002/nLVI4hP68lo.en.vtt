00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:08.060
 the return of hugo sanchez to mexico 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.410
 caused great excitement then in his 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.540
 presentation as the new technician of 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.610
 pachuca managed to gather more than 10,000 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.349
 amateurs at the hidalgo stadium in 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.660
 mÃ©rida a party with music fires 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.100
 artificial and lights hugo said feel 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.380
 happy to be back in your country 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.540
 He also made it clear that he never received a 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.700
 formal proposal of another team and the 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.770
 The only offer was that of Pachuca, because 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.990
 the one that filled him the most because I think that 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.809
 it's a winning team I do not know I 'm going to talk 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.730
 and what I think I'm going to say but what 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.109
 I'm going to do is more measured in 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.030
 things that say the teeth of another 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:41.180
 way 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.809
 and things that maybe he promises in his 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:48.019
 At that moment I will not be so forceful 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:51.019
 but rather I'll say it somehow 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.449
 that is to say we are going to leave champion like I said 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.540
 with being world champions remember 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:58.010
 Well, they accused me of being crazy, 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.930
 Then I better say what the 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.710
 improvement of the coaches we are going to 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.920
 our best effort we will look 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.670
 like all other teams win the 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.920
 title and in that way as well as not 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.350
 have problems and not that kind of thing 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.050
 I mean but internally I follow 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.950
 thinking and I will say it but where do I have 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.079
 What to say, I think that what shocks 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.930
 together with all the members of the 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:29.539
 pachuca and then including the director 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.219
 new technician I think we're going to see a 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.740
 attractive team let's go where we go 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:36.289
 will draw a lot of attention and what 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.880
 it worries me is the pachuca and my 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.460
 working in the pachuca and I think 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.569
 that the best way is that when you think 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.439
 to play the spindles on the pachuca 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.780
 consistency than the comparison of the 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.429
 last season hopefully they can 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.189
 show progress immediately 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.259
 that would mean that we have made a 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:58.009
 pretty good preseason job 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:01.060
 good if you doubt you can not do 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.700
 analysis so you can not check 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.479
 but actually my mother was very 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.170
 excited because I mentioned those words 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:14.910
 and good that had influenced as they include 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.650
 many things and want or not the next 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.900
 sentimental and for some reason other 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.130
 So the earth throws you away and you throw 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.500
 blood 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.000
 and say the proper functioning of a 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.460
 club with the seriousness and with the 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.730
 professional who has pachuca and this 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:33.650
 way it is inclined or not to difference 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.959
 of other proposals from other teams 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.579
 that are not doing as dislocation of the 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.769
 pachuca and I said it when in the living room 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:42.079
 the fame that I congratulate jesus and all the 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.790
 Andrew executives for professionalism 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:46.159
 the seriousness the transcendence with 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.739
 they're doing because it's a club like 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:51.769
 father brown tan enviable and toÃ±o 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.090
 brown that was the cause of that work 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.890
 magnificent hall of fame 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.410
 he congratulated himself for everything that they are 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.200
 doing in mexico because there's no good 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.970
 I do not think there is no club that has 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.440
 I 've done it the Pachuca and I'm 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.420
 here to collaborate and build so that 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.400
 grow even more I think that the most 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.810
 important is that I am authentic 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.329
 on all the teams where I played 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.939
 as a player and all 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:19.510
 teams that I have worked as a coach 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:21.879
 including the selection I have defended 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.790
 defended 100% the interests of the 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.620
 team in the case of selection and 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.079
 now I will defend the interests of 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.959
 pachuca that means that maybe 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.189
 other teams are not going to be according to 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.500
 that hugo sanchez leave to the interests 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:38.409
 from pachuca who do not agree 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:42.069
 it is a criterion situation in my 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:44.349
 criteria will now be to death and 100% 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.879
 defend the interests of the pachuca and 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.950
 that way if you defend the pachuca 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.420
 I think people will understand me I have not 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.980
 received no official proposal of 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:57.700
 pumas what came out are rumors or 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.510
 have been situations that do not leave 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.700
 no formal thing 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.849
 and I want to tell you that the only thing 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.129
 only formal and official situation that 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:11.750
 I received it was with Jesus and with the team 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:15.380
 pachuca and the rumors and what has gone 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:18.570
 No, it does not have to do with me 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:22.100
 it is for one year 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.130
 but I hope it's the first of many 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.560
 and in that way 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.790
 you have to make merits for it and I hope 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.750
 that like my work so that it can 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.750
 stay longer 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.110
 goodnight science 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.810
 ah
