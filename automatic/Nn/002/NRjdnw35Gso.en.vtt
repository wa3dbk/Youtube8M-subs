was one of my friends favorites and I
kind<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.710> knew<00:00:38.579> his<00:00:39.120> style<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:40.050> knew<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.620> it

was very dark and cold but also like

very<00:00:45.180> bitter<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.649> book<00:00:46.860> was<00:00:46.980> written<00:00:47.129> in

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
very bitter this book was written in

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.630 
very bitter this book was written in
1982<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.559> think<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.329> sort<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:52.640> semi

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
1982 I think and it is sort of semi

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.670 
1982 I think and it is sort of semi
memoir<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.690> what<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:54.899> mean<00:00:55.110> by<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.649> that

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
memoir and what I mean by this is that

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.029 
memoir and what I mean by this is that
it's<00:00:56.039> not<00:00:56.340> like<00:00:56.870> outwardly<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.050> memoir<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
it's not like outwardly a memoir the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.160 
it's not like outwardly a memoir the
character<00:00:59.579> the<00:01:00.000> main<00:01:00.149> character<00:01:00.570> has<00:01:01.109> a

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
character the main character has a

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.950 
character the main character has a
different<00:01:01.320> name<00:01:01.710> but<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:02.579> very<00:01:03.059> similar<00:01:03.600> in

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
different name but it's very similar in

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.670 
different name but it's very similar in
the<00:01:04.080> sense<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:05.820> protagonists<00:01:06.570> name<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:07.020> Henry

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
the sense the protagonists name is Henry

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.210 
the sense the protagonists name is Henry
Chinaski<00:01:09.049> while<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.409> author's<00:01:10.770> name<00:01:11.010> is

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
Chinaski while the author's name is

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.149 
Chinaski while the author's name is
Charles<00:01:12.030> Bukowski<00:01:12.619> can<00:01:13.619> see<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.830> little<00:01:13.979> bit<00:01:14.100> of

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
Charles Bukowski can see a little bit of

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.670 
Charles Bukowski can see a little bit of
similarity<00:01:14.700> there<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.780> went<00:01:16.259> into<00:01:16.350> reading

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
similarity there and I went into reading

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.649 
similarity there and I went into reading
this<00:01:16.770> book<00:01:16.979> not<00:01:17.549> knowing<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.210> was<00:01:18.330> semi

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
this book not knowing that it was semi

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.320 
this book not knowing that it was semi
autobiographical<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.850> think<00:01:21.119> that's

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
autobiographical and I think that's

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.620 
autobiographical and I think that's
something<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.140> liked<00:01:22.439> about<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:23.330> so<00:01:24.330> if

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
something that I liked about it so if

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.999 
something that I liked about it so if
you're<00:01:24.840> planning<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.560> reading<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.890> I've

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
you're planning on reading it I've

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.819 
you're planning on reading it I've
already<00:01:26.130> told<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.670> but<00:01:27.470> whilst<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.680> was

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
already told you but whilst I was

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.039 
already told you but whilst I was
reading<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.369> figured<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.299> should

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
reading it I figured that it should

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.359 
reading it I figured that it should
probably<00:01:31.619> be<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.430> sort<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:32.970> memoir<00:01:33.270> because

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
probably be a sort of memoir because

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.950 
probably be a sort of memoir because
just<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.520> similarities<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.360> name<00:01:36.570> and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
just the similarities in the name and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.130 
just the similarities in the name and
the<00:01:37.799> little<00:01:38.450> things<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.720> knew<00:01:39.960> about

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
the little things that I knew about

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.350 
the little things that I knew about
Charles<00:01:40.650> Bukowski<00:01:40.860> --zz<00:01:41.159> life<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:42.060> kind<00:01:42.329> of

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
Charles Bukowski --zz life it kind of

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.170 
Charles Bukowski --zz life it kind of
all<00:01:42.509> tied<00:01:42.780> together<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:44.579> book<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> sort

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
all tied together so this book is a sort

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.440 
all tied together so this book is a sort
of<00:01:45.270> coming-of-age<00:01:45.899> novel<00:01:46.079> it's<00:01:47.149> it's<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.240> very

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
of coming-of-age novel it's it's a very

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.560 
of coming-of-age novel it's it's a very
dark<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.350> bitter<00:01:49.829> coming-of-age<00:01:50.549> novel<00:01:50.759> but

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
dark and bitter coming-of-age novel but

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.700 
dark and bitter coming-of-age novel but
I<00:01:51.600> think<00:01:51.780> that's<00:01:51.899> what<00:01:51.990> makes<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.320> even<00:01:52.439> more

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
I think that's what makes it even more

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.039 
I think that's what makes it even more
interesting<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.850> scenery<00:01:54.630> for<00:01:54.899> this

time<00:06:08.000> you're<00:06:08.120> feeling<00:06:08.300> extremely<00:06:09.110> bad<00:06:09.470> for

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
time you're feeling extremely bad for

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.880 
time you're feeling extremely bad for
him<00:06:09.890> and<00:06:10.100> everyone<00:06:10.460> around<00:06:10.700> him<00:06:11.180> you<00:06:11.890> are

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
him and everyone around him you are

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.070 
him and everyone around him you are
feeling<00:06:13.100> anxious<00:06:13.490> for<00:06:14.000> what<00:06:14.180> he's<00:06:14.360> doing<00:06:14.780> but

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
feeling anxious for what he's doing but

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.930 
feeling anxious for what he's doing but
you<00:06:15.230> know<00:06:15.320> he<00:06:15.530> kind<00:06:15.710> of<00:06:15.800> sabotages<00:06:16.580> himself

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
you know he kind of sabotages himself

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.010 
you know he kind of sabotages himself
and<00:06:17.150> I<00:06:17.210> some<00:06:17.360> think<00:06:17.510> that's<00:06:17.660> something<00:06:17.900> that<00:06:17.990> I

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
and I some think that's something that I

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.380 
and I some think that's something that I
can<00:06:18.200> feel<00:06:18.350> very<00:06:18.530> identified<00:06:19.100> with<00:06:19.310> it<00:06:20.090> was<00:06:20.270> my

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
can feel very identified with it was my

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.080 
can feel very identified with it was my
first<00:06:20.570> Bukowski<00:06:21.200> I<00:06:21.410> asked<00:06:22.340> around<00:06:22.430> a<00:06:22.850> little

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
first Bukowski I asked around a little

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.790 
first Bukowski I asked around a little
bit<00:06:23.210> and<00:06:23.419> people<00:06:23.930> told<00:06:24.260> me<00:06:24.380> that<00:06:24.440> this<00:06:24.620> was

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
bit and people told me that this was

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.500 
bit and people told me that this was
like<00:06:24.950> the<00:06:25.130> best<00:06:25.340> book<00:06:25.580> to<00:06:25.610> start<00:06:25.940> Bukowski

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.510 
like the best book to start Bukowski

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.110 
like the best book to start Bukowski
with<00:06:26.660> and<00:06:26.990> I<00:06:27.800> haven't<00:06:28.460> read<00:06:28.610> anything<00:06:28.850> else

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
with and I haven't read anything else

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.390 
with and I haven't read anything else
but<00:06:29.419> I'm<00:06:29.600> pretty<00:06:30.110> certain<00:06:30.380> that<00:06:30.530> I<00:06:30.650> would

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
but I'm pretty certain that I would

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.100 
but I'm pretty certain that I would
recommend<00:06:31.820> this<00:06:31.910> is<00:06:32.060> the<00:06:32.180> first<00:06:32.450> Bukowski

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
recommend this is the first Bukowski

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.460 
recommend this is the first Bukowski
because<00:06:33.890> it<00:06:34.130> is<00:06:34.310> just<00:06:34.580> good<00:06:35.150> like<00:06:35.419> if<00:06:35.960> it<00:06:36.140> is

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:36.470 
because it is just good like if it is

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.530 
because it is just good like if it is
somewhat<00:06:37.010> of<00:06:37.190> a<00:06:37.280> memoir<00:06:37.490> it<00:06:37.970> can<00:06:38.150> give<00:06:38.300> you<00:06:38.420> a

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.540 
somewhat of a memoir it can give you a

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.420 
somewhat of a memoir it can give you a
little<00:06:38.810> bit<00:06:38.930> of<00:06:39.020> background<00:06:39.320> to<00:06:39.710> Charles

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430 
little bit of background to Charles

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.890 
little bit of background to Charles
Bukowski<00:06:40.640> and<00:06:41.120> I<00:06:41.180> know<00:06:41.240> that<00:06:41.480> some<00:06:41.690> of<00:06:41.720> his

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900 
Bukowski and I know that some of his

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.720 
Bukowski and I know that some of his
later<00:06:42.080> novels<00:06:42.350> are<00:06:42.920> like<00:06:43.430> very<00:06:43.760> old<00:06:44.450> man<00:06:45.730> dark

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:46.730 
later novels are like very old man dark

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.240 
later novels are like very old man dark
and<00:06:47.030> bitter<00:06:47.360> and<00:06:47.780> I<00:06:48.350> guess<00:06:48.560> this<00:06:48.770> can<00:06:48.980> give<00:06:49.130> you

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
and bitter and I guess this can give you

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.670 
and bitter and I guess this can give you
a<00:06:49.310> little<00:06:49.550> bit<00:06:49.640> of<00:06:49.670> background<00:06:50.420> to<00:06:50.990> why<00:06:51.410> he's

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
a little bit of background to why he's

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.890 
a little bit of background to why he's
that<00:06:51.860> way<00:06:52.010> because<00:06:52.340> frankly<00:06:53.240> if<00:06:53.480> you<00:06:53.660> lived

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 
that way because frankly if you lived

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.370 
that way because frankly if you lived
through<00:06:54.380> what<00:06:54.880> Henry<00:06:55.880> Chinaski<00:06:56.000> lived<00:06:56.510> you'd

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:57.380 
through what Henry Chinaski lived you'd

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.020 
through what Henry Chinaski lived you'd
probably<00:06:57.680> end<00:06:57.890> up<00:06:58.100> being<00:06:58.280> really<00:06:58.610> bitter<00:06:58.820> as

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.030 
probably end up being really bitter as

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.570 
probably end up being really bitter as
well<00:06:59.240> and<00:06:59.600> I<00:07:00.080> haven't<00:07:00.500> truly<00:07:00.710> recommend<00:07:01.130> it<00:07:01.430> as

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:01.580 
well and I haven't truly recommend it as

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.640 
well and I haven't truly recommend it as
