00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
went to Japan and I guess he brings her

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.670 
went to Japan and I guess he brings her
here<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.199> France<00:00:16.590> her<00:00:17.310> name<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.640> Yoon<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:18.029> and

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
here to France her name is Yoon a and

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.040 
here to France her name is Yoon a and
she<00:00:19.680> comes<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.279> France<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.270> learn<00:00:21.510> about<00:00:21.720> their

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
she comes to France to learn about their

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.750 
she comes to France to learn about their
the<00:00:22.980> culture<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.580> learn<00:00:23.699> about<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.060> West<00:00:25.310> so<00:00:26.310> I

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
the culture to learn about the West so I

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.939 
the culture to learn about the West so I
guess<00:00:27.300> Japanese<00:00:27.869> culture<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.289> being<00:00:28.650> is

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
guess Japanese culture is being is

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.150 
guess Japanese culture is being is
becoming<00:00:29.340> more<00:00:29.580> popular<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.779> West<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.500> is

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
becoming more popular in the West so is

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.740 
becoming more popular in the West so is
what<00:00:32.430> they<00:00:32.550> said<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.940> summary<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.570> guess

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
what they said in the summary so I guess

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.389 
what they said in the summary so I guess
something<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.380> do<00:00:34.469> with<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.739> later<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.250> in

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
something to do with that later on in

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.590 
something to do with that later on in
the<00:00:35.489> series<00:00:35.700> but<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:37.020> think<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.350> first<00:00:37.500> episode

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
the series but I think the first episode

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.569 
the series but I think the first episode
settled<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.780> pretty<00:00:40.079> well<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.800> reminded<00:00:41.340> me<00:00:41.399> of

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
settled in pretty well it reminded me of

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.810 
settled in pretty well it reminded me of
hanasaku<00:00:42.510> iroha<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:43.410> honestly<00:00:44.309> don't<00:00:44.489> know<00:00:44.610> why

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
hanasaku iroha I honestly don't know why

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.360 
hanasaku iroha I honestly don't know why
was<00:00:45.090> first<00:00:45.780> episode<00:00:46.230> felt<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.190> it

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
was first episode felt like it that it

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.639 
was first episode felt like it that it
they<00:00:47.910> took<00:00:48.090> their<00:00:48.300> time<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.960> settle<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
they took their time to settle in the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.630 
they took their time to settle in the
anime<00:00:50.070> they<00:00:51.559> didn't<00:00:52.559> necessarily<00:00:52.680> explain<00:00:53.340> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
anime they didn't necessarily explain a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.090 
anime they didn't necessarily explain a
lot<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:53.940> things<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:55.440> just<00:00:55.649> felt<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:55.920> they

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
lot of things but it just felt like they

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.240 
lot of things but it just felt like they
took<00:00:56.280> their<00:00:56.460> time<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:57.800> that's<00:00:58.800> really<00:00:59.010> how<00:00:59.129> I

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
took their time and that's really how I

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.029 
took their time and that's really how I
felt<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.030> hemicycle<00:01:00.660> 0ha<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.410> first<00:01:01.620> episode

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
which is I think he missed I think he

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.220 
which is I think he missed I think he
misinterpreted<00:03:34.329> what<00:03:34.390> she<00:03:34.600> was<00:03:34.810> what<00:03:35.170> she

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
misinterpreted what she was what she

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.000 
misinterpreted what she was what she
meant<00:03:35.799> when<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.579> nee<00:03:36.880> gave<00:03:37.090> it<00:03:37.209> to<00:03:37.329> him<00:03:38.010> he

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
meant when you nee gave it to him he

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.710 
meant when you nee gave it to him he
probably<00:03:39.160> thought<00:03:39.430> you<00:03:39.609> know<00:03:39.850> all<00:03:40.390> right<00:03:40.569> it's

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
probably thought you know all right it's

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.629 
probably thought you know all right it's
like<00:03:40.810> a<00:03:40.870> compensation<00:03:41.620> and<00:03:42.010> he'll<00:03:42.280> go<00:03:42.459> and

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
like a compensation and he'll go and

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.550 
like a compensation and he'll go and
sell<00:03:42.850> it<00:03:43.000> I<00:03:43.150> think<00:03:43.510> what<00:03:43.660> she<00:03:43.870> meant<00:03:44.079> was<00:03:44.290> he

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
sell it I think what she meant was he

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.309 
sell it I think what she meant was he
should<00:03:44.769> have<00:03:44.980> it<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:45.510> just<00:03:46.510> keep<00:03:46.840> it<00:03:47.049> and<00:03:47.260> use

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
that would necessarily get really mad

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
that would necessarily get really mad
and<00:04:50.940> that's<00:04:51.940> really<00:04:52.470> about<00:04:53.470> it<00:04:53.740> they<00:04:53.890> end<00:04:54.070> up

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
and that's really about it they end up

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.550 
and that's really about it they end up
by<00:04:54.340> talking<00:04:54.460> to<00:04:54.880> each<00:04:55.000> other<00:04:55.120> bowing<00:04:55.780> to<00:04:55.960> work

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
by talking to each other bowing to work

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.260 
by talking to each other bowing to work
together<00:04:56.800> and<00:04:57.250> make<00:04:57.550> the<00:04:57.700> place<00:04:57.910> better<00:04:58.180> I

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
together and make the place better I

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.410 
together and make the place better I
guess<00:04:58.920> so<00:04:59.920> I<00:04:59.950> think<00:05:00.160> it's<00:05:00.370> really<00:05:00.610> cool<00:05:00.910> or

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
guess so I think it's really cool or

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.240 
guess so I think it's really cool or
because<00:05:01.690> first<00:05:02.140> episode<00:05:02.500> was<00:05:02.590> really<00:05:03.100> well

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
because first episode was really well

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.150 
because first episode was really well
done<00:05:04.800> what<00:05:05.800> I<00:05:05.830> wanna<00:05:06.070> know<00:05:06.130> is<00:05:06.340> how<00:05:06.520> old<00:05:06.790> she<00:05:07.060> is
