00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 Give me a black check. 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.859
 Hello Armstage Fund App 70 Today I am talking about Toshiba Tools 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.620
 Let me look briefly. 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.550
 Oh, I like the idea of a Windows 8 tablet, but Windows 8 tablet is almost 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.080
 It's similar 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:20.609
 Meanwhile, progress was Dell Venue Pro 8, or Toka mix that will shut 2a 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:25.560
 Sure if this is similar to that of Windows 8 tablet gotta similar spec nearly leveled 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.580
 I do not want to survive if there are special ah 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.359
 I'm thinking about it. 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:34.860
 The horse jeukseun Hey likewise 7 ok display of pollution why Lynch 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.850
 And itguyo homki the Toshiba logo and the Power key on the right side of his Oh kirang 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.960
 I have a volume key. 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.530
 Left side sofa earphone jack ah micro hdmi port yo 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.550
 Micro Hdmi Port Micro USB Port Flower Adapter 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.660
 You can just use regular usb devices and mix 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.800
 Iteunikka micro sd card reader that supports the tire Oh impact 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:01:00.420
 Write or palms together and I think the camera or the photo Oh, and one that you need to write 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:04.019
 And there's a stereo speaker and a camera in the back. 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.689
 Why is this pattern unusually on the back of the Embassy pattern video about 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.159
 There's no demonstration rubber coating or anything like that. Just plastic 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:14.729
 Uh inde slow jam is not bad, but also doing so chonseureopji catch in hand 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.540
 I'm doing quite well with my role in keeping things from slipping. 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.220
 But Toshiba's almost instantaneous Tar plan Shiva logo itjyo lodged 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.520
 I have to read it properly. 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:28.439
 As earlier speakers itgekkeum's also just secured 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:32.610
 Uh nucha a reminder, Windows 8 tablet courts are in fact negative specification standards 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.210
 It is because I've got something for you specifically say over who do not have special features 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.030
 do not have 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.470
 If the same kid Bay Trail Like itgoyo into Beit eda records nose 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.070
 The RAM is 2 GB in Sign alternative sound and nutrition 32 or 64 teeth 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.659
 It is. 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:50.159
 Interface is not ttokgatahyo so I already comes to yogeo 2 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.299
 Danny Plan Del Vanny 8 Mix of work with lots of Windows Tablet 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.140
 Basic Things 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:58.619
 Once you've got the Eryu lacking and you are using Windows Web, 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.899
 I'm not going to repeat this again. 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.770
 Lynn could see already done nokeon 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:08.729
 Features of the example only 2 I've done something 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:12.360
 The basic characteristics are very similar to the 8-tablet , 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.080
 The display is not where it's not, not so good side good side 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.260
 Let's see 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.730
 Run a window and go 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:24.299
 Oh, I do not know how cumbersome awake window that looks into the camera for example, boilers with a camera 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:29.940
 I do not know if this is a strange grid. 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:33.660
 There is a slight gap between the eyes and the eyes. 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:37.140
 What did this precisely control the phenomenon has blossomed take it to the camera by default 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.370
 It's a little difficult to express, but actually there's a lattice costume to look at 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.510
 It's a little offensive. 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:48.120
 10 play itself is not really the quality to say it's bad 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:51.629
 The panel itself does not seem to have written such a good thing until so. 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.049
 And if you have a homepage, 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:58.709
 It depends on the model . 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:02.400
 There are some kids running on yo-yo like Benjyu . 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:07.710
 But this problem is not it want more confortable touch keys sometimes anmeokeoyo 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:11.370
 I also do not know why I still have a sword when I can not 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:14.340
 I do not know what my dream is, 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:19.490
 I can recall eating the rest I gave anmeokeoyo cub 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.490
 I have not seen it in any other place. 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:30.400
 I'm determined again. Anyway, the second and third are loud speakers. 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:33.730
 I'm not a reporter of a lot of speakers and a Windows tablet anyway 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.250
 You are in fact a lot of what I'm looking forward to Oh, yeah ya'll exception of Windows tablets 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.209
 You can not hear it. It's just audio. 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:45.939
 Yeah, but the speaker is pretty much used. The speaker is torn. 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:49.450
 I do not care much about the fact that I'm stuck in the speaker itself . 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:53.829
 Writing becomes a speaker gojji I think I look a long time 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:56.019
 And the camera has a good quality to look at. 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:04:00.129
 I think it's perfect for drinking . 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:02.200
 Performance is like having enough hair and just enough for business. 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:06.310
 I told you. 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:10.030
 January is going to be that blunt fact ah felt when you first receive 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.139
 Denny professional, even if such facts even as 8% of the cases I have friends 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.799
 I really like it. 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:19.539
 If it 's the same thing, it 's not really light. 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:23.620
 She's lighter than 40 grams. 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:28.240
 Examples performance is falling so I thought it would not make a difference, I stay cubes 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:30.639
 Well sure but look at the site to the next level as a large thick Han Yu 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.580
 Is there a difference in thickness? 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:37.990
 Give the world a lot of gels 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.389
 The battery is surely long, 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:44.139
 It's a little less natural discharge. 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:46.030
 Benny 8 The pros have been a lot of natural nights , but much more than that 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:50.170
 It's healed, and the battery life itself is long. 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:54.340
 So, according to what I felt , 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:58.000
 There are some people who are attracted to Michael Samantha port . 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:02.770
 It would be nice to have a pt or you'd better watch a movie. 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.610
 Now you can watch the movie by using the rear panel and the speaker. 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:10.600
 So I do try and think in two days. So the trend piece tablet asked 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:13.180
 It's bigger and longer, and the battery's bigger and longer. 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.330
 I thought about whether it was an issue or not. 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.810
 If you did, you 'd have got a little more here. 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:23.200
 It's more expensive than other friends. 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:27.700
 1 4 50% difference, of course , depending on how many gods follow the optimization 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.210
 Going to do that is different but expensive yeoteumyeon into convenience geomyeon write business crackling Escher 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.960
 To write 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:36.100
 I do not think so , and I think the purpose is very unclear. 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:42.310
 This is an absolute opportunity to see if the objective is more unclear 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:44.530
 So if the other competitive market is lighter or cheaper, 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:48.370
 Farewell then scatter 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:53.110
 When it 's not long , I think the charm of this guy is something to do. 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:57.130
 When I saw usb audio , it was a little cheerful when I was born. 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:06:01.720
 Java is a pretty power pretty batteries going a bit longer for the microphone 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:05.919
 It's a heavy potter, but the gate itself is the same. 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:08.140
 Speakers are also post-production and earn funds are good for audio, 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:13.840
 It's so clear. 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:17.710
 I do not know what it is. 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:22.660
 Well what a bad thing when I saw only the machine itself is definitely not written rattling 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:27.400
 Depending on which of the four characters also you can replace oxygen with round-the-round attraction 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:31.270
 The embossing room on the back is also attractive, but when there are other competitors, 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:36.130
 This is why you need to have a micro-HDM port or you really need it 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:39.460
 Who can also appeal iteunikka or clear, or the degree of e 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:43.570
 At the expense of international LA weight and battery capacity 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.530
 If you do not need it, or if it is not, there is no regulatory meaning. 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:49.210
 Think about it 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.750
 1 Toshiba Angkor If you do not need it, it will be good again Toshio Angkor 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.990
 It was. 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.100
 Nowadays, do not forget to press the subscribe button and at the time of the squirrel 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.280
 I'll see you. 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.280
 End
