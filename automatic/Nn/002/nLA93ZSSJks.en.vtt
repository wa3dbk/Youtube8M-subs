00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
longer distance now the way I'm going to

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.019 
longer distance now the way I'm going to
teach<00:00:19.289> this<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.400> first<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.789> going<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:20.970> be

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
teach this is that first is going to be

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.730 
teach this is that first is going to be
a<00:00:21.060> teaching<00:00:21.240> method<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.930> then<00:00:22.470> we're<00:00:22.619> going

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
a teaching method and then we're going

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.410 
a teaching method and then we're going
to<00:00:22.800> actually<00:00:23.220> I'll<00:00:23.580> show<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.029> next<00:00:24.240> step

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
to actually I'll show you the next step

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.359 
to actually I'll show you the next step
which<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.810> actually<00:00:25.019> have<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.010> players

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
which is to actually have the players

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.480 
which is to actually have the players
execute<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.960> throw<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:29.070> first<00:00:29.279> thing<00:00:29.400> I'm

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
execute the throw in the first thing I'm

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.070 
execute the throw in the first thing I'm
gonna<00:00:29.580> do<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.789> show<00:00:30.359> them<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.630> technique

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
gonna do is show them a technique

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.220 
gonna do is show them a technique
without<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.830> ball<00:00:32.450> and<00:00:33.450> I'm<00:00:33.750> gonna<00:00:33.930> go<00:00:34.110> ahead

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
without a ball and I'm gonna go ahead

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.410 
without a ball and I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:00:34.440> do<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.710> for<00:00:34.890> both<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.610> simple<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
and do it for both the simple and the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.630 
and do it for both the simple and the
advanced<00:00:36.719> throw-in<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.440> then<00:00:38.070> we<00:00:38.250> will<00:00:38.430> just

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
advanced throw-in and then we will just

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
advanced throw-in and then we will just
I<00:00:38.969> think<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.719> skip<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.250> practice<00:00:41.700> part

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
I think just skip on the practice part

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.500 
I think just skip on the practice part
of<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.960> we<00:00:43.110> will<00:00:43.820> skip<00:00:44.820> straight<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
of it we will skip straight to the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.310 
of it we will skip straight to the
advanced<00:00:46.020> throw-in<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:47.870> here's<00:00:48.870> your<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
advanced throw-in so here's your the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.130 
advanced throw-in so here's your the
rules<00:00:49.530> for<00:00:49.980> throw<00:00:50.160> ins<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:51.510> player<00:00:51.750> must<00:00:51.989> be

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
rules for throw ins the player must be

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.590 
rules for throw ins the player must be
and<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.739> course<00:00:52.980> obviously<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.910> throwing<00:00:54.329> we

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
and of course obviously of throwing we

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.150 
and of course obviously of throwing we
know<00:00:54.719> what<00:00:54.930> when<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.559> basically<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
know what when that is basically the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.529 
know what when that is basically the
ball<00:00:56.309> goes<00:00:56.460> out<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.640> bounds<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.180> bring<00:00:57.449> it

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
ball goes out of bounds and you bring it

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.990 
ball goes out of bounds and you bring it
when<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.020> other<00:00:59.010> team<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.550> team<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.760> did

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
when the other team the team that did

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.939 
when the other team the team that did
not<00:01:00.149> lose<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.480> ball<00:01:00.629> brings<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.020> back<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.440> back

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
not lose the ball brings it back in back

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.990 
not lose the ball brings it back in back
throwing<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.899> so<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:05.400> player<00:01:05.610> who's<00:01:05.850> gonna

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
throwing it in so the player who's gonna

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.580 
throwing it in so the player who's gonna
throw<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.390> ball<00:01:06.540> has<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.869> stand<00:01:07.260> facing

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
throw in the ball has to stand facing

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.050 
throw in the ball has to stand facing
the<00:01:07.979> field<00:01:08.250> with<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.479> apart<00:01:10.520> places<00:01:11.520> one<00:01:11.790> hand

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
the field with the apart places one hand

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.690 
the field with the apart places one hand
on<00:01:12.390> each<00:01:12.630> side<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.140> ball<00:01:13.380> takes<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.520> ball

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
on each side of the ball takes the ball

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.109 
on each side of the ball takes the ball
behind<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.299> head<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.900> throws<00:01:16.860> forward<00:01:17.369> onto

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
behind the head and throws forward onto

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.780 
behind the head and throws forward onto
the<00:01:18.270> field<00:01:18.930> now<00:01:19.590> technically<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.460> ball<00:01:20.640> is

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
the field now technically the ball is

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.340 
the field now technically the ball is
supposed<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.150> go<00:01:21.330> behind<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.810> head<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.080> little

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
supposed to go behind the head a little

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.980 
supposed to go behind the head a little
bit<00:01:22.500> for<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> legal<00:01:23.610> throw<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.180> if<00:01:24.390> you

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
bit for it to be a legal throw in if you

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.960 
bit for it to be a legal throw in if you
can<00:01:25.170> teach<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.409> that's<00:01:26.189> probably<00:01:26.490> best

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
can teach that that's probably best

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.510 
can teach that that's probably best
because<00:01:27.780> at<00:01:28.140> an<00:01:28.229> older<00:01:28.560> age<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:29.100> referees

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
because at an older age the referees

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.160 
because at an older age the referees
will<00:01:29.729> maybe<00:01:30.119> start<00:01:30.420> calling<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.930> if<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
will maybe start calling that if the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.850 
will maybe start calling that if the
ball<00:01:31.320> doesn't<00:01:31.530> go<00:01:31.790> behind<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.939> head<00:01:33.860> they

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
ball doesn't go behind the head they

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.950 
ball doesn't go behind the head they
could<00:01:35.040> say<00:01:35.220> was<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> bad<00:01:35.640> throw<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.090> now

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
could say was a bad throw in now

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.200 
could say was a bad throw in now
remember<00:01:37.380> both<00:01:37.890> feet<00:01:38.250> have<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.640> stay<00:01:38.939> on<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
remember both feet have to stay on the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.840 
remember both feet have to stay on the
ground<00:01:39.299> until<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.170> throw<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.770> made<00:01:41.009> you

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
ground until the throw in is made you

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.740 
ground until the throw in is made you
can<00:01:42.000> stand<00:01:42.360> on<00:01:42.570> or<00:01:43.140> behind<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.430> sideline<00:01:44.939> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
can stand on or behind the sideline the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.990 
can stand on or behind the sideline the
ball<00:01:45.990> must<00:01:46.229> go<00:01:46.409> behind<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.860> head<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.729> must

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
ball must go behind the head you must

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.380 
ball must go behind the head you must
use<00:01:48.299> both<00:01:48.329> hands<00:01:49.290> equally<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.909> referees

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
use both hands equally so the referees

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.050 
encourage throwing into the ground I
think<00:02:31.739> when<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.160> tell<00:02:32.430> your<00:02:32.580> place<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.879> throw

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
think when you tell your place to throw

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.710 
think when you tell your place to throw
it<00:02:33.120> at<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.299> ground

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
it at the ground

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.650 
it at the ground
it<00:02:33.989> sort<00:02:34.319> of<00:02:34.379> causes<00:02:34.860> amber<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.340> lift<00:02:36.299> a<00:02:36.390> foot

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
it sort of causes amber to lift a foot

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.699 
it sort of causes amber to lift a foot
more<00:02:37.620> than<00:02:38.010> if<00:02:38.160> they're<00:02:38.340> throwing<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.700> up<00:02:38.819> high

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
more than if they're throwing it up high

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.900 
more than if they're throwing it up high
so<00:02:40.709> on<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.099> advanced<00:02:41.519> one<00:02:41.640> we're<00:02:41.760> going<00:02:41.849> to

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
so on the advanced one we're going to

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.600 
so on the advanced one we're going to
drag<00:02:42.150> our<00:02:42.299> toes<00:02:42.629> so<00:02:43.049> hard<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:44.040> we<00:02:44.190> can<00:02:44.340> hear

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
the toes being dragged and when the ball

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.550 
the toes being dragged and when the ball
goes<00:02:47.430> behind<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.879> head<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:49.049> elbows<00:02:49.530> are

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
goes behind the head the elbows are

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.190 
goes behind the head the elbows are
pointing<00:02:49.769> out<00:02:50.129> to<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.640> side<00:02:50.989> because<00:02:51.989> this

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
pointing out to the side because this

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.710 
pointing out to the side because this
gives<00:02:52.530> power<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.430> you're<00:02:54.239> going<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.450> remain
