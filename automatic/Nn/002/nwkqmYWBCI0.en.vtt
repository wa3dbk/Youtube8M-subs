00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.450
 passivity Amur finished just 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.309
 a week ago when the farmers sowed 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.560
 last hector and buckwheat a 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.900
 machine operators are ready to go into the fields for 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.820
 harvest early August farm 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.369
 areas are planning to start cleaning 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.340
 barley on it to prepare the technique for 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.260
 season they have only two weeks term 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.300
 sufficient to barley some more on 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.100
 lenses and it could be cleaned considers 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.620
 head of the economy Baikal Sergey Tkachenko 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.120
 despite the vagaries of nature quality 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.160
 early grains in their fields 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.199
 he rates as satisfactory at 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.780
 this year, barley is essential 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.670
 better last year's voice high grain 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.040
 there is still time to ripen the main thing to 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.200
 it was warm enough sunny weather 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.020
 would not hurt to complain and mechanic them 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.790
 we will wait it is difficult to repair equipment 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.070
 we can assume that 50 percent is ready 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.670
 harvesting techniques came with a sowing season 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.920
 late 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.610
 and plus the fact that the weather did not give here 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.520
 rain week but I think that we are in a week 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:09.170
 all harvesters pull up to harvest on 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:11.630
 availability of the park assign 29 combines from 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.520
 they 26 combines will participate on 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.340
 matching just this year to the fields 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.860
 areas will come out over 2,000 harvesters and 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.630
 about 500 roller reapers most 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.060
 of which already prepared for the field 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.709
 work in good weather 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.840
 must go bang sure 

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:28.399
 regional ministry of agriculture especially as 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.619
 over the past five years a brink 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.660
 significantly updated tractor machine 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.700
 Park purchased over 900 40 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.670
 combine harvesters half of them 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.229
 and men's assembly 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.990
 2012 average load for each such 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.130
 car made 130 hectares when cleaning 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.050
 315 acres of corn and when cleaning layer 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.450
 high-tech harvesters they 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.880
 provide high quality cleaning 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.190
 high threshing quality 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.229
 losses are well reduced 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.530
 accordingly comfortable and convenient and 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.720
 working conditions of the machine operator if old 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.120
 harvester lost year centners per hectare 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.510
 new harvesters 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.670
 not allowed to fix this problem 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.830
 best prepared for harvesting 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.810
 farm Belogorsk Blagoveshchensk 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.880
 Bureysky of October 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.020
 Serov and Tambov districts 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.330
 simultaneously with the repair of equipment 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.310
 experts are checking and ready cereals 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.560
 yards because storing grain from soy 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.080
 requires certain conditions this year 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.310
 Baikal reconstructed 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.080
 granaries repaired one of 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.120
 warehouses so you need to 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.750
 lay on sim twice 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.910
 harvest 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.730
 every year a grain yard makes 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.950
 prophylaxis, that is, we prepare the units 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.070
 considered what day what the shelves 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.670
 file breakage then we make warehouses 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:48.790
 necessarily according to the technique according to the instructions 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.980
 they are my whitening so as not to bugs 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.810
 worms were not to barn 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.030
 pest was not the first of August 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.700
 just the beginning of the harvest Baikal 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.190
 will start and new drying unit 50 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.200
 tons cost this installation in 45 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.600
 million rubles here tell 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.670
 The au pair complex was just vital 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.830
 need old equipment with volumes 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.239
 barely cope new suitable for 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.430
 corn so for corn 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:16.480
 can grain lead 30 percent 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.489
 humidity and 25 means but this place can 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.100
 dry grain from 30 percent moisture 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.739
 can already dry means the most important thing 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.959
 her dignity is what it means 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.090
 she can dry some corn seeds 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.280
 if it means everything is fine with us 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.730
 then we plan to increase the seeding later 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.800
 a wedge on corn up to 2000 tons is volumes 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.750
 grain storage we only have here 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.970
 800 tons these cans are active 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.510
 venting and thousands of tons and here 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.800
 who are here for already pure grain 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.840
 hence last year's situation 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.730
 when tons are in full swing 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.370
 stored right outside no longer 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.590
 will repeat until most of the economic 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.260
 prepares for the harvest already proved 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.180
 technique others only decided to replace 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.280
 All the more so as they operate in the region 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.380
 subsidy purchase program 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.700
 agricultural equipment Amur assembly part 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.700
 cost returns
