Main Street this team deathmatch and i'm
using<00:00:19.540> the<00:00:19.599> cryo<00:00:19.840> gun<00:00:20.110> here<00:00:20.380> so<00:00:21.099> this<00:00:21.189> is<00:00:21.250> going

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
using the cryo gun here so this is going

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.400 
using the cryo gun here so this is going
to<00:00:21.520> be<00:00:21.640> a<00:00:21.670> little<00:00:21.820> Crile<00:00:22.150> gonna<00:00:22.419> commentary

good response in the last resistance 3
video<00:00:28.600> I<00:00:28.660> did<00:00:28.930> the<00:00:29.109> commentary<00:00:29.769> I'm<00:00:30.279> glad<00:00:30.460> you

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
video I did the commentary I'm glad you

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.970 
video I did the commentary I'm glad you
guys<00:00:30.760> enjoyed<00:00:30.820> it<00:00:31.330> and<00:00:31.449> you<00:00:32.379> guys<00:00:32.500> asked<00:00:32.920> for

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
guys enjoyed it and you guys asked for

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.070 
guys enjoyed it and you guys asked for
more<00:00:33.280> are<00:00:33.550> least<00:00:33.790> some<00:00:33.910> of<00:00:33.940> you<00:00:34.090> did<00:00:34.239> so<00:00:35.050> I

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.080 
more are least some of you did so I

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.270 
more are least some of you did so I
thought<00:00:35.230> I'd<00:00:35.350> bring<00:00:35.470> you<00:00:35.559> another<00:00:35.769> one<00:00:36.040> this

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
thought I'd bring you another one this

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.799 
thought I'd bring you another one this
time<00:00:36.460> with<00:00:36.610> the<00:00:36.699> cryo<00:00:36.970> gun<00:00:37.210> which<00:00:37.420> is<00:00:37.570> another

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
time with the cryo gun which is another

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.329 
time with the cryo gun which is another
kind<00:00:38.530> of<00:00:38.680> an<00:00:39.030> underused<00:00:40.030> gun<00:00:40.360> I<00:00:40.390> suppose<00:00:40.839> and

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
kind of an underused gun I suppose and

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:44.100 
kind of an underused gun I suppose and
if<00:00:42.339> you<00:00:42.729> know<00:00:42.909> how<00:00:43.089> to<00:00:43.120> use<00:00:43.239> it<00:00:43.510> right<00:00:43.690> it's

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
if you know how to use it right it's

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.670 
if you know how to use it right it's
actually<00:00:44.320> pretty<00:00:44.769> good<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:46.360> my<00:00:46.960> class<00:00:47.290> setup

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
actually pretty good so my class setup

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.020 
actually pretty good so my class setup
when<00:00:47.830> i'm<00:00:47.920> using<00:00:48.220> the<00:00:48.309> cryo<00:00:48.519> again<00:00:48.729> the<00:00:48.820> class

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
when i'm using the cryo again the class

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.579 
when i'm using the cryo again the class
setup<00:00:49.420> is<00:00:49.659> very<00:00:49.780> important<00:00:50.379> with<00:00:50.470> the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
setup is very important with the

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:52.859 
setup is very important with the
cryogenic<00:00:51.129> the<00:00:51.400> cryo<00:00:51.670> gun<00:00:51.909> much<00:00:52.659> like<00:00:52.839> the

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:52.869 
cryogenic the cryo gun much like the

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:55.350 
cryogenic the cryo gun much like the
mutator<00:00:53.320> it<00:00:54.100> basically<00:00:54.850> puts<00:00:55.119> you<00:00:55.239> at<00:00:55.330> a

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
mutator it basically puts you at a

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.380 
mutator it basically puts you at a
disadvantage<00:00:55.920> initially<00:00:56.920> but<00:00:57.670> if<00:00:57.970> you<00:00:58.180> have

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
disadvantage initially but if you have

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.539 
disadvantage initially but if you have
the<00:00:58.540> right<00:00:58.720> class<00:00:59.080> setup<00:00:59.559> and<00:00:59.769> if<00:00:59.979> you<00:01:00.159> use<00:01:00.369> it

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:00.549 
the right class setup and if you use it

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:02.490 
the right class setup and if you use it
properly<00:01:00.729> it<00:01:01.210> can<00:01:01.510> end<00:01:01.750> up<00:01:01.900> working<00:01:02.110> out<00:01:02.350> to

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
properly it can end up working out to

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.049 
properly it can end up working out to
your<00:01:02.619> advantage<00:01:02.860> you<00:01:03.100> just<00:01:03.309> have<00:01:03.460> to<00:01:03.580> be<00:01:03.790> kind

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
your advantage you just have to be kind

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.030 
your advantage you just have to be kind
of<00:01:04.239> skillful<00:01:05.049> with<00:01:05.379> the<00:01:05.500> way<00:01:05.590> you<00:01:05.650> approach

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
of skillful with the way you approach

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.719 
of skillful with the way you approach
situations<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:08.320> for<00:01:09.189> one<00:01:09.310> thing<00:01:09.520> i<00:01:09.670> would

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
situations so for one thing i would

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.760 
situations so for one thing i would
obviously<00:01:10.060> recommend<00:01:10.659> you<00:01:10.810> don't<00:01:11.049> use<00:01:11.410> the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
obviously recommend you don't use the

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.110 
obviously recommend you don't use the
cryo<00:01:12.040> gun<00:01:12.340> in<00:01:13.110> any<00:01:14.110> map<00:01:14.590> that's<00:01:15.040> like<00:01:15.760> really

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
cryo gun in any map that's like really

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.510 
cryo gun in any map that's like really
long<00:01:16.360> range<00:01:16.720> for<00:01:17.050> example<00:01:17.440> park<00:01:17.770> i<00:01:18.040> would<00:01:18.370> not

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
long range for example park i would not

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.930 
long range for example park i would not
recommend<00:01:18.700> it<00:01:19.680> Broadway<00:01:20.680> is<00:01:20.710> probably<00:01:21.400> not<00:01:21.880> a

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
recommend it Broadway is probably not a

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.930 
recommend it Broadway is probably not a
good<00:01:22.150> idea<00:01:22.210> although<00:01:22.600> I<00:01:22.690> guess<00:01:23.910> Broadway<00:01:24.910> is

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
good idea although I guess Broadway is

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.560 
good idea although I guess Broadway is
doable<00:01:26.580> try<00:01:27.580> and<00:01:27.670> think<00:01:27.730> of<00:01:27.820> other<00:01:27.970> maps<00:01:28.270> that

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
doable try and think of other maps that

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.600 
doable try and think of other maps that
it<00:01:28.690> would<00:01:28.780> be<00:01:28.900> good<00:01:29.110> or<00:01:29.230> bad<00:01:29.350> on<00:01:29.560> seaside<00:01:30.280> no

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
it would be good or bad on seaside no

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.250 
it would be good or bad on seaside no
seaside<00:01:31.030> could<00:01:31.210> work<00:01:31.450> because<00:01:31.960> there's<00:01:32.140> some

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
seaside could work because there's some

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.560 
seaside could work because there's some
close<00:01:32.470> quarters<00:01:32.860> but<00:01:32.980> basically<00:01:33.400> use<00:01:34.330> this

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
close quarters but basically use this

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.899 
close quarters but basically use this
gun<00:01:34.780> in<00:01:35.050> close<00:01:35.380> quarters<00:01:35.800> that's<00:01:36.040> basically

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
gun in close quarters that's basically

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.270 
gun in close quarters that's basically
the<00:01:37.030> best<00:01:37.240> way<00:01:37.480> to<00:01:37.540> use<00:01:37.720> it<00:01:37.930> and<00:01:38.770> use<00:01:38.800> it<00:01:39.010> in

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
the best way to use it and use it in

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.140 
the best way to use it and use it in
kind<00:01:39.640> of<00:01:40.740> intricate<00:01:41.740> areas<00:01:42.730> sort<00:01:42.970> of<00:01:43.030> like

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
kind of intricate areas sort of like

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.730 
kind of intricate areas sort of like
where<00:01:43.330> I<00:01:43.360> am<00:01:43.540> now<00:01:43.750> there's<00:01:43.960> lots<00:01:44.170> of<00:01:44.290> holes<00:01:44.530> in

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
where I am now there's lots of holes in

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.710 
where I am now there's lots of holes in
the<00:01:44.830> walls<00:01:45.070> there's<00:01:45.730> lots<00:01:45.909> of<00:01:46.030> corners<00:01:46.390> i<00:01:46.540> can

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
the walls there's lots of corners i can

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.390 
the walls there's lots of corners i can
run<00:01:46.900> around<00:01:46.930> and<00:01:47.500> there's<00:01:47.770> lots<00:01:47.860> of<00:01:48.010> places<00:01:48.130> to

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
run around and there's lots of places to

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.670 
run around and there's lots of places to
hide<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:48.940> stuff<00:01:49.180> and<00:01:49.450> that's<00:01:50.260> the<00:01:50.380> best<00:01:50.560> way

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
hide and stuff and that's the best way

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
hide and stuff and that's the best way
to<00:01:50.740> use<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.070> cryo<00:01:51.280> gun<00:01:51.610> in<00:01:52.270> it<00:01:53.490> what<00:01:54.490> what's

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
to use the cryo gun in it what what's

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.149 
to use the cryo gun in it what what's
the<00:01:54.760> word<00:01:54.970> fort<00:01:55.300> in<00:01:55.890> combination<00:01:56.890> with

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
the word fort in combination with

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.719 
the word fort in combination with
thermal<00:01:58.030> vision<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:58.770> whatever<00:01:59.770> other<00:01:59.950> perks

thermal vision and whatever other perks

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:01.860 
thermal vision and whatever other perks
you<00:02:00.909> want<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.150> use<00:02:01.270> but<00:02:01.420> i<00:02:01.479> would<00:02:01.630> definitely

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
you want to use but i would definitely

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.800 
you want to use but i would definitely
recommend<00:02:02.110> thermal<00:02:02.740> vision<00:02:02.920> because<00:02:03.810> again

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
recommend thermal vision because again

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.300 
recommend thermal vision because again
you<00:02:05.020> need<00:02:05.170> a<00:02:05.229> leg<00:02:05.500> up<00:02:05.710> if<00:02:05.920> you're<00:02:06.010> going<00:02:06.220> to

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
you need a leg up if you're going to

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.980 
you need a leg up if you're going to
want<00:02:06.460> to<00:02:06.580> win<00:02:06.790> with<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.150> crowd<00:02:07.420> room<00:02:07.659> you<00:02:07.840> need

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
want to win with the crowd room you need

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.779 
want to win with the crowd room you need
a<00:02:08.049> little<00:02:08.409> bit<00:02:08.590> of<00:02:08.649> an<00:02:08.860> advantage<00:02:09.099> over<00:02:09.489> your

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
a little bit of an advantage over your

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.940 
a little bit of an advantage over your
opponents<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:11.260> best<00:02:11.440> way<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.620> do<00:02:11.769> that<00:02:11.799> is

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
opponents and the best way to do that is

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.199 
opponents and the best way to do that is
use<00:02:12.190> thermal<00:02:12.400> vision<00:02:12.670> because<00:02:12.940> then<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:13.180> know

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
use thermal vision because then you know

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.460 
use thermal vision because then you know
when<00:02:13.540> they're<00:02:13.690> coming<00:02:13.989> through<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.230> wall<00:02:14.440> or

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
when they're coming through a wall or

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.360 
when they're coming through a wall or
you<00:02:15.280> know<00:02:15.370> whatever<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.690> can

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
you know whatever and you can

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.039 
you know whatever and you can
you<00:02:18.580> can<00:02:18.730> sneak<00:02:19.000> up<00:02:19.120> on<00:02:19.360> them<00:02:19.510> just<00:02:19.540> like<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:19.989> did

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
you can sneak up on them just like I did

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.140 
you can sneak up on them just like I did
right<00:02:20.349> there<00:02:20.379> and<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:20.860> can<00:02:21.190> beat<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:21.940> shit

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
right there and you can beat the shit

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.770 
right there and you can beat the shit
out<00:02:22.269> of<00:02:22.299> them<00:02:22.450> with<00:02:22.690> your<00:02:23.170> crowd<00:02:23.560> gun<00:02:24.780> so

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
that's uh that's that as for how you

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.170 
that's uh that's that as for how you
actually<00:02:28.629> use<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.260> cryo<00:02:29.470> gun<00:02:29.819> it's<00:02:30.819> kind<00:02:31.060> of

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
actually use the cryo gun it's kind of

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.880 
actually use the cryo gun it's kind of
weird<00:02:31.420> d<00:02:31.599> you<00:02:31.840> don't<00:02:32.019> want<00:02:32.409> to<00:02:32.500> use<00:02:32.680> the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
weird d you don't want to use the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.130 
weird d you don't want to use the
primary<00:02:33.340> fire<00:02:33.700> all<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.330> much<00:02:34.569> you<00:02:34.870> want<00:02:35.049> to

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
primary fire all that much you want to

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.770 
primary fire all that much you want to
use<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.409> in<00:02:35.680> bursts<00:02:36.579> but<00:02:36.879> then<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.150> also<00:02:37.360> want

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
use it in bursts but then you also want

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.559 
use it in bursts but then you also want
to<00:02:37.959> use<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.680> secondary<00:02:39.220> fire<00:02:39.489> as<00:02:39.790> much<00:02:40.329> as<00:02:40.480> you

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
to use the secondary fire as much as you

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.130 
to use the secondary fire as much as you
can<00:02:40.780> so<00:02:41.170> what<00:02:41.920> I<00:02:41.950> recommend<00:02:42.010> is<00:02:43.049> actually<00:02:44.049> what

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
can so what I recommend is actually what

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.839 
can so what I recommend is actually what
I<00:02:44.170> recommend<00:02:44.470> is<00:02:44.650> just<00:02:44.860> watching<00:02:45.099> how<00:02:45.400> i<00:02:45.430> do<00:02:45.579> it

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
I recommend is just watching how i do it

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.270 
I recommend is just watching how i do it
in<00:02:45.940> this<00:02:46.030> video<00:02:46.329> cuz<00:02:46.510> i<00:02:46.540> don't<00:02:46.690> even<00:02:46.750> know

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
in this video cuz i don't even know

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.740 
in this video cuz i don't even know
necessarily<00:02:48.280> how<00:02:48.519> to<00:02:48.670> explain<00:02:49.209> it<00:02:49.269> I<00:02:49.540> don't

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
necessarily how to explain it I don't

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.050 
necessarily how to explain it I don't
know<00:02:49.810> there's<00:02:49.989> not<00:02:50.140> really<00:02:50.319> any<00:02:50.560> like

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
know there's not really any like

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.250 
know there's not really any like
specific<00:02:52.060> way<00:02:52.269> to<00:02:52.329> do<00:02:52.599> it's<00:02:52.810> just<00:02:52.989> you<00:02:53.109> have<00:02:53.140> to

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
specific way to do it's just you have to

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.640 
specific way to do it's just you have to
kind<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.560> feel<00:02:53.799> it<00:02:53.980> like<00:02:54.129> I<00:02:55.349> don't<00:02:56.349> know<00:02:56.470> it's

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
kind of feel it like I don't know it's

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.990 
kind of feel it like I don't know it's
hard<00:02:56.769> to<00:02:56.859> explain<00:02:57.040> but<00:02:57.340> basically<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.910> want

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
hard to explain but basically you want

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.670 
hard to explain but basically you want
to<00:02:58.120> use<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.299> secondary<00:02:58.780> fire<00:02:59.019> more<00:02:59.349> than<00:02:59.530> you

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
to use the secondary fire more than you

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.300 
to use the secondary fire more than you
would<00:02:59.799> probably<00:03:00.340> imagine<00:03:01.120> you<00:03:01.390> would<00:03:01.510> want<00:03:01.720> to

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
would probably imagine you would want to

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.640 
would probably imagine you would want to
so<00:03:03.310> in<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:04.060> few<00:03:04.090> minutes<00:03:04.450> are<00:03:05.019> like<00:03:05.260> in<00:03:05.379> a<00:03:05.409> minute

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
so in a few minutes are like in a minute

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.170 
so in a few minutes are like in a minute
or<00:03:05.739> two<00:03:05.769> you'll<00:03:06.159> probably<00:03:06.370> see<00:03:06.579> me<00:03:06.609> using<00:03:06.879> the

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
or two you'll probably see me using the

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.780 
or two you'll probably see me using the
cryo<00:03:07.959> gun<00:03:08.200> again<00:03:08.470> I<00:03:08.680> messed<00:03:09.129> up<00:03:09.310> here<00:03:09.549> big<00:03:09.760> time

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790

gunslinger<00:03:43.599> on<00:03:43.750> and<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.079> only<00:03:44.169> reason<00:03:44.260> why<00:03:44.530> I

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
gunslinger on and the only reason why I

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.960 
gunslinger on and the only reason why I
have<00:03:44.739> that<00:03:44.919> on<00:03:45.069> is<00:03:45.220> not<00:03:45.400> for<00:03:45.609> improved

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
have that on is not for improved

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.360 
have that on is not for improved
accuracy<00:03:46.530> although<00:03:47.530> I<00:03:47.560> suppose<00:03:47.799> that<00:03:48.040> helps

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
accuracy although I suppose that helps

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.699 
accuracy although I suppose that helps
but<00:03:48.639> I've<00:03:48.760> actually<00:03:48.940> got<00:03:49.180> it<00:03:49.299> on<00:03:49.389> for<00:03:49.720> the

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
but I've actually got it on for the

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.280 
but I've actually got it on for the
quick<00:03:50.949> reload<00:03:51.510> that's<00:03:52.510> pretty<00:03:52.810> important

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
quick reload that's pretty important

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.740 
quick reload that's pretty important
with<00:03:53.379> the<00:03:53.470> cryo<00:03:53.709> gun<00:03:53.980> and<00:03:54.910> I've<00:03:55.389> also<00:03:55.480> got

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
with the cryo gun and I've also got

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.809 
with the cryo gun and I've also got
Berserker<00:03:56.199> which<00:03:56.379> allows<00:03:56.680> me<00:03:56.709> to<00:03:57.160> get<00:03:57.669> my

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
Berserker which allows me to get my

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.150 
Berserker which allows me to get my
killstreaks<00:03:58.180> one<00:03:58.750> kill<00:03:59.049> before<00:03:59.739> I<00:03:59.769> normally

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
killstreaks one kill before I normally

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.800 
killstreaks one kill before I normally
would<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:00.370> that's<00:04:00.609> also<00:04:01.060> very<00:04:01.090> important

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
would and that's also very important

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.270 
would and that's also very important
because<00:04:01.900> again<00:04:02.379> you<00:04:02.739> need<00:04:02.859> as<00:04:03.010> many

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
because again you need as many

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.909 
because again you need as many
advantages<00:04:03.730> as<00:04:04.090> you<00:04:04.180> can<00:04:04.329> get<00:04:04.799> when<00:04:05.799> you're

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:05.919 
advantages as you can get when you're

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:07.409 
advantages as you can get when you're
using<00:04:06.099> the<00:04:06.190> cryo<00:04:06.459> gun<00:04:06.699> and<00:04:06.849> if<00:04:06.910> you<00:04:07.030> can<00:04:07.180> get<00:04:07.329> an

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419 
using the cryo gun and if you can get an

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:09.059 
using the cryo gun and if you can get an
assault<00:04:07.750> shield<00:04:08.019> or<00:04:08.199> invisibility<00:04:08.680> that's

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
assault shield or invisibility that's

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:14.129 
assault shield or invisibility that's
going<00:04:09.280> to<00:04:09.340> help<00:04:09.519> a<00:04:09.790> lot<00:04:10.349> so<00:04:12.329> I'd<00:04:13.329> say<00:04:13.510> that<00:04:13.690> that

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
going to help a lot so I'd say that that

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.379 
going to help a lot so I'd say that that
perk<00:04:14.379> is<00:04:14.530> actually<00:04:14.919> that<00:04:15.220> ability<00:04:15.790> Jesus

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
perk is actually that ability Jesus

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:17.729 
perk is actually that ability Jesus
Christ<00:04:16.570> I<00:04:16.810> can't<00:04:16.870> get<00:04:17.169> the<00:04:17.260> fucking<00:04:17.560> word

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
Christ I can't get the fucking word

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.069 
Christ I can't get the fucking word
right<00:04:17.919> that<00:04:18.669> ability<00:04:19.030> is<00:04:19.539> pretty<00:04:19.930> much

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
right that ability is pretty much

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.420 
right that ability is pretty much
essential<00:04:20.410> to<00:04:21.070> this<00:04:21.190> class<00:04:22.650> if<00:04:23.650> you<00:04:23.830> want<00:04:24.039> to<00:04:24.160> i

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
essential to this class if you want to i

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.120 
essential to this class if you want to i
don't<00:04:24.669> know<00:04:24.880> i<00:04:25.260> mean<00:04:26.260> you<00:04:26.380> could<00:04:26.590> use<00:04:26.890> other

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
don't know i mean you could use other

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.399 
don't know i mean you could use other
weapons<00:04:27.580> with<00:04:27.849> this<00:04:28.090> class<00:04:28.419> like<00:04:29.110> if<00:04:29.320> you

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.409 
weapons with this class like if you

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:31.010 
weapons with this class like if you
wanted<00:04:29.650> to<00:04:29.710> use<00:04:29.860> strapped<00:04:30.310> instead<00:04:30.789> of

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
wanted to use strapped instead of

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.330 
wanted to use strapped instead of
zurcher<00:04:31.379> I<00:04:31.410> suppose<00:04:31.830> that<00:04:32.009> wouldn't<00:04:32.160> be<00:04:32.310> a

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
zurcher I suppose that wouldn't be a

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.960 
zurcher I suppose that wouldn't be a
horrible<00:04:32.849> idea<00:04:33.410> but<00:04:34.410> if<00:04:35.250> you<00:04:35.669> if<00:04:35.879> you're

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
horrible idea but if you if you're

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.610 
horrible idea but if you if you're
planning<00:04:36.300> on<00:04:36.360> just<00:04:36.660> using<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.050> crowd<00:04:37.289> round<00:04:37.470> I

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
planning on just using the crowd round I

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.710 
planning on just using the crowd round I
would<00:04:37.740> definitely<00:04:37.860> recommend<00:04:38.129> beserker<00:04:38.910> so

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
would definitely recommend beserker so

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.629 
would definitely recommend beserker so
anyway<00:04:39.990> that's<00:04:40.440> enough<00:04:40.740> about<00:04:40.889> the<00:04:41.069> cryo<00:04:41.340> gun

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
anyway that's enough about the cryo gun

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.129 
anyway that's enough about the cryo gun
feel<00:04:42.210> like<00:04:42.300> I've<00:04:42.419> said<00:04:42.449> that<00:04:42.690> word<00:04:42.870> like<00:04:43.110> a

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
feel like I've said that word like a

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.820 
feel like I've said that word like a
bazillion<00:04:43.530> times<00:04:43.919> now<00:04:44.159> um<00:04:45.379> you<00:04:46.379> guys<00:04:46.500> want<00:04:46.770> to

bazillion times now um you guys want to

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:47.899 
bazillion times now um you guys want to
know<00:04:46.949> where<00:04:47.159> I've<00:04:47.250> been<00:04:47.280> so<00:04:47.580> I<00:04:47.610> haven't<00:04:47.789> made<00:04:47.879> a

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:47.909 
know where I've been so I haven't made a

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:50.480 
know where I've been so I haven't made a
video<00:04:48.090> in<00:04:48.270> like<00:04:48.509> a<00:04:48.539> month<00:04:48.960> at<00:04:49.590> least<00:04:49.650> something

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
video in like a month at least something

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.309 
video in like a month at least something
like<00:04:50.699> that<00:04:50.849> I<00:04:51.210> think<00:04:51.599> the<00:04:51.659> last<00:04:51.750> one<00:04:51.960> I<00:04:51.990> did<00:04:52.050> was

like that I think the last one I did was

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:56.300 
like that I think the last one I did was
the<00:04:52.500> little<00:04:53.280> big<00:04:53.400> planet<00:04:53.430> 2<00:04:53.669> levels<00:04:54.120> video<00:04:55.310> so

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
the little big planet 2 levels video so

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.450 
the little big planet 2 levels video so
anyway<00:04:57.110> um<00:04:58.110> I've<00:04:58.379> been<00:04:58.440> I've<00:04:58.979> been<00:04:59.039> working<00:04:59.370> on
