that's you know been freshly painted so

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.810

and<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.030> fork<00:01:09.299> are<00:01:09.450> also<00:01:09.720> out<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.220> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
and the fork are also out of it the

and the fork are also out of it the
glove<00:01:11.430> box<00:01:11.610> unlike<00:01:12.210> all<00:01:12.329> the<00:01:12.420> p-series<00:01:12.780> bikes

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
glove box unlike all the p-series bikes

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.020 
glove box unlike all the p-series bikes
pretty<00:01:13.740> much<00:01:14.009> has<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.399> come<00:01:14.579> off<00:01:14.610> that's

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
pretty much has to come off that's

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.639 
pretty much has to come off that's
definitely<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.540> way<00:01:15.720> but<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.500> can

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
definitely in the way but you can

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.770 
definitely in the way but you can
actually<00:01:16.770> do<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.280> particular<00:01:17.670> trim<00:01:18.180> with

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
actually do this particular trim with

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.690 
actually do this particular trim with
the<00:01:18.990> handlebars<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.740> forks<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.250> lot<00:01:20.430> it's

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
the handlebars and forks a lot it's

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.130 
the handlebars and forks a lot it's
definitely<00:01:21.090> easier<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.780> stuff<00:01:21.960> out

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
definitely easier to have that stuff out

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.780 
definitely easier to have that stuff out
of<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.320> way<00:01:22.469> so<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> sake<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.640> demonstration

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
of the way so the sake of demonstration

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.520 
of the way so the sake of demonstration
because<00:01:24.420> they're<00:01:24.630> using<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:24.930> bike<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.439> it

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
because they're using this bike and it

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.109 
because they're using this bike and it
does<00:01:25.619> have<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.009> there<00:01:26.219> you'll<00:01:26.790> see<00:01:26.939> how

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
does have it on there you'll see how

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.480 
does have it on there you'll see how
quick<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.420> easy<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.840> will<00:01:28.079> go<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:29.070> theory

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
quick and easy it will go in theory

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.800 
quick and easy it will go in theory
sometimes<00:01:30.030> they're<00:01:30.210> really<00:01:30.299> quick<00:01:30.540> sometimes

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
sometimes they're really quick sometimes

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.300 
sometimes they're really quick sometimes
you've<00:01:31.079> got<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.200> fight<00:01:31.409> with<00:01:31.590> them<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.219> other

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
you've got to fight with them the other

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.709 
you've got to fight with them the other
thing<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.729> know<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:32.969> not<00:01:33.119> really<00:01:33.329> using

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
thing is you know it's not really using

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.170 
thing is you know it's not really using
any<00:01:33.899> tools<00:01:34.200> aside<00:01:34.530> from<00:01:34.770> latex<00:01:35.549> gloves<00:01:35.909> and

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
any tools aside from latex gloves and

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
start on one side it's the best way to

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.749 
start on one side it's the best way to
do<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.590> I'll<00:02:01.710> kind<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:01.979> take<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.609> one

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
do that is I'll kind of take the one

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.580 
do that is I'll kind of take the one
side<00:02:03.829> start<00:02:04.829> at<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.009> top<00:02:05.899> it<00:02:06.899> kind<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.229> slips

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
side start at the top it kind of slips

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.240 
side start at the top it kind of slips
in<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.859> channel<00:02:09.289> you<00:02:10.289> can<00:02:10.440> kind<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.740> keep

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
in the channel you can kind of keep

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.300 
in the channel you can kind of keep
pressure<00:02:11.610> on<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.540> guide<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.810> down

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
pressure on it and guide it down

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.470 
pressure on it and guide it down
sometimes<00:02:14.310> you'll<00:02:14.550> actually<00:02:14.700> have<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.030> slide

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
sometimes you'll actually have to slide

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.280 
sometimes you'll actually have to slide
it<00:02:15.630> up<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.930> down

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
it up and down

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.759 
it up and down
couple<00:02:16.469> times<00:02:16.709> so<00:02:17.579> you're<00:02:17.760> not<00:02:17.849> fighting<00:02:18.239> it

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
couple times so you're not fighting it

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.170 
couple times so you're not fighting it
this<00:02:19.769> is<00:02:19.950> actually<00:02:20.250> going<00:02:20.370> really<00:02:20.700> smooth<00:02:20.939> so

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
this is actually going really smooth so

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.449 
this is actually going really smooth so
far<00:02:21.450> let's<00:02:22.409> go<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.890> sake<00:02:23.099> of<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.310> video

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
far let's go to the sake of the video

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.589 
far let's go to the sake of the video
and<00:02:23.909> so<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:25.049> kinda<00:02:25.349> wanna<00:02:26.030> ease<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.359> thing

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
and so you kinda wanna ease the thing

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.170 
and so you kinda wanna ease the thing
down<00:02:28.159> until<00:02:29.159> you<00:02:29.280> think<00:02:29.489> you're<00:02:29.700> in<00:02:29.790> about<00:02:30.000> the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
down until you think you're in about the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.100 
down until you think you're in about the
right

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:41.540 

is<00:02:34.560> where<00:02:34.740> it<00:02:34.770> gets<00:02:34.890> country<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:41.190> nice<00:02:41.340> thing

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
is where it gets country the nice thing

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.760 
is where it gets country the nice thing
about<00:02:41.580> this<00:02:41.880> is<00:02:42.060> if<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.210> go<00:02:42.420> too<00:02:42.480> far<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.230> can

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
about this is if you go too far you can

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.040 
about this is if you go too far you can
always<00:02:43.860> peel<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.310> back<00:02:44.460> off<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.630> start<00:02:45.960> over

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
always peel it back off and start over

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.650 
always peel it back off and start over
again<00:02:49.430> that's<00:02:50.430> pretty<00:02:50.670> close<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.210> being<00:02:51.240> about

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
again that's pretty close to being about

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.390 
again that's pretty close to being about
where<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:51.900> needs<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.170> be<00:02:52.260> doctor<00:02:53.160> know<00:02:53.280> what

it<00:03:36.989> into<00:03:37.080> place<00:03:41.570> and<00:03:42.570> actually<00:03:42.750> while<00:03:43.019> the

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
it into place and actually while the

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.539 
it into place and actually while the
camera<00:03:43.410> was<00:03:43.440> off<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.830> put<00:03:43.950> a<00:03:44.010> little<00:03:44.160> tape<00:03:44.370> on

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
camera was off I put a little tape on

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.400 
camera was off I put a little tape on
this<00:03:44.730> you<00:03:45.450> should<00:03:45.480> take<00:03:45.840> this<00:03:45.989> in<00:03:46.200> just

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
this you should take this in just

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.250 
this you should take this in just
because<00:03:46.560> it<00:03:47.420> just<00:03:48.420> can<00:03:48.630> kind<00:03:48.840> of<00:03:48.870> be<00:03:48.959> flailing

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
because it just can kind of be flailing

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.870 
because it just can kind of be flailing
around<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.830> little<00:03:49.950> bit<00:03:50.130> and<00:03:50.340> basically<00:03:50.459> you

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
around a little bit and basically you

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.310 
around a little bit and basically you
just<00:03:51.090> got<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.299> protect<00:03:51.600> it<00:03:51.720> from<00:03:51.750> scratch<00:03:52.140> on

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
just got to protect it from scratch on

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.620 
just got to protect it from scratch on
the<00:03:52.410> pain<00:03:52.620> inadvertently<00:03:56.000> so<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.030> take<00:03:57.420> it<00:03:57.510> from

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
the pain inadvertently so I take it from

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.320 
the pain inadvertently so I take it from
about<00:03:57.780> this<00:03:57.959> point<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:59.220> then<00:03:59.880> start<00:04:00.180> the

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
about this point and then start the

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.050 
about this point and then start the
bottom<00:04:00.980> and<00:04:01.980> again<00:04:02.040> for<00:04:02.519> me<00:04:02.610> it's<00:04:02.730> easier<00:04:03.000> to

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
bottom and again for me it's easier to

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.650 
bottom and again for me it's easier to
kind<00:04:03.299> of<00:04:03.330> reach<00:04:04.459> over<00:04:05.459> and<00:04:05.670> do<00:04:05.790> this<00:04:08.510> you<00:04:09.510> kind

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
kind of reach over and do this you kind

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:17.090 
kind of reach over and do this you kind
of<00:04:09.780> get<00:04:09.900> it<00:04:10.019> started

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.510 

then<00:04:17.670> again<00:04:17.970> with<00:04:18.120> strong<00:04:18.420> hands<00:04:19.430> kind<00:04:20.430> of

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
then again with strong hands kind of

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:29.390 
then again with strong hands kind of
wiggle<00:04:20.910> it<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.090> little<00:04:21.270> bit

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:55.879 

[Applause]

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.170 

we<00:04:56.889> kind<00:04:57.099> of<00:04:57.129> get<00:04:57.249> to<00:04:57.310> write<00:04:57.520> about<00:04:57.610> that<00:04:57.849> point

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
we kind of get to write about that point

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.760 
we kind of get to write about that point
and<00:04:58.389> that's<00:04:58.990> when<00:04:59.199> you<00:04:59.289> know<00:04:59.409> you're<00:04:59.560> close

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
and that's when you know you're close

hand<00:05:01.419> and<00:05:01.629> voila<00:05:02.529> kind<00:05:02.889> of<00:05:02.979> clicks<00:05:03.159> into<00:05:03.400> place

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.580 

that's<00:05:07.300> pretty<00:05:07.599> much<00:05:07.719> the<00:05:07.900> finished<00:05:08.169> product

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
that's pretty much the finished product

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.909 
that's pretty much the finished product
that<00:05:08.939> one<00:05:09.939> went<00:05:10.120> about<00:05:10.330> average<00:05:10.749> and<00:05:11.680> then<00:05:11.830> go

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
that one went about average and then go

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.129 
that one went about average and then go
really<00:05:12.159> good<00:05:12.279> you<00:05:12.430> can<00:05:12.580> do<00:05:12.669> it<00:05:12.849> actually<00:05:13.240> about

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
really good you can do it actually about

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.529 
really good you can do it actually about
half<00:05:14.349> that<00:05:14.379> amount<00:05:14.560> of<00:05:14.889> time<00:05:15.389> but<00:05:16.389> that's

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.539 
half that amount of time but that's

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.649 
half that amount of time but that's
installing<00:05:17.110> the<00:05:18.090> plastic<00:05:19.090> like<00:05:19.270> she'll<00:05:19.479> trim

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:19.659 
installing the plastic like she'll trim

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:21.899 
installing the plastic like she'll trim
basically<00:05:20.319> any<00:05:20.650> large<00:05:20.979> frame<00:05:21.310> or<00:05:21.490> small<00:05:21.699> frame
