00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the slow speed agitation with the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.270 
the slow speed agitation with the
KitchenAid<00:00:56.039> agitator<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:58.070> that's<00:00:59.070> what<00:00:59.250> I

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
KitchenAid agitator and that's what I

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.279 
KitchenAid agitator and that's what I
just<00:00:59.460> leave<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.760> on<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.180> really<00:01:00.629> turns<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
just leave it on and it really turns the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.700 
just leave it on and it really turns the
loads<00:01:01.500> over<00:01:01.890> very<00:01:02.640> very<00:01:02.910> good<00:01:04.939> as<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.299> see

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
loads over very very good as you can see

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.350 
loads over very very good as you can see
it's<00:01:07.710> not<00:01:08.580> even<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.880> struggle<00:01:09.270> at<00:01:09.960> all<00:01:11.360> it's

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
it's not even a struggle at all it's

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.090 
it's not even a struggle at all it's
just<00:01:14.119> pulling<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.210> down

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.930 

and<00:01:19.100> I'm<00:01:19.250> still<00:01:19.460> trying<00:01:19.640> to<00:01:19.670> figure<00:01:19.790> all<00:01:19.910> that

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
and I'm still trying to figure all that

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.500 
and I'm still trying to figure all that
squeaking<00:01:20.510> is<00:01:20.660> but<00:01:24.880> might<00:01:25.880> be<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.090> educator

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
squeaking is but might be the educator

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.790 
squeaking is but might be the educator
that's<00:01:26.630> why<00:01:26.840> we're<00:01:26.990> not<00:01:27.110> tight<00:01:27.350> enough<00:01:27.470> I

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
that's why we're not tight enough I

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.240 
that's why we're not tight enough I
think<00:01:27.950> up<00:01:28.210> put<00:01:29.210> a<00:01:29.240> shot<00:01:29.450> tightened<00:01:29.870> it<00:01:30.250> very

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
think up put a shot tightened it very

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.710 
think up put a shot tightened it very
well<00:01:31.490> but<00:01:31.790> I<00:01:32.030> don't<00:01:32.090> know<00:01:32.240> if<00:01:32.360> I<00:01:32.480> have<00:01:32.600> to

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
well but I don't know if I have to

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.230 
well but I don't know if I have to
tighten<00:01:32.990> it<00:01:33.080> enough<00:01:33.340> but<00:01:34.340> yeah<00:01:34.700> there<00:01:35.090> you

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
tighten it enough but yeah there you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.550

as most of you guys now I prefer the
belt<00:01:56.150> driven<00:01:56.300> machines<00:01:56.810> but<00:01:58.090> beggars<00:01:59.090> can't

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
belt driven machines but beggars can't

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.790 
belt driven machines but beggars can't
be<00:01:59.480> choosers<00:01:59.750> and<00:02:00.050> I<00:02:00.110> needed<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:00.410> washing

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
be choosers and I needed a washing

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.180 
be choosers and I needed a washing
machine<00:02:01.120> ASAP<00:02:02.120> so<00:02:02.630> this<00:02:03.380> one<00:02:03.530> was<00:02:03.680> given<00:02:03.800> to<00:02:04.040> me

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
machine ASAP so this one was given to me

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.750 
machine ASAP so this one was given to me
and<00:02:04.490> I<00:02:04.910> took<00:02:05.240> it<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:06.230> I<00:02:06.310> kind<00:02:07.310> of<00:02:07.340> altered<00:02:07.670> it

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
and I took it and I kind of altered it

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.720 
and I took it and I kind of altered it
that's<00:02:07.940> why<00:02:08.060> I<00:02:08.119> call<00:02:08.300> it<00:02:08.330> my<00:02:08.510> kitchen<00:02:09.500> more
