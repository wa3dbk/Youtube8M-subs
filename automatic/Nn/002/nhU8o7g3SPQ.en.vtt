Roode maybe I think it's important to
note<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:15.070> if<00:03:15.550> you<00:03:15.940> are<00:03:16.300> in<00:03:16.959> the<00:03:17.320> professional

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
note that if you are in the professional

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.290 
note that if you are in the professional
wrestling<00:03:18.220> business<00:03:18.400> it's<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:19.060> foregone

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
wrestling business it's a foregone

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.690 
wrestling business it's a foregone
conclusion<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:20.200> many<00:03:20.410> will<00:03:20.650> say<00:03:20.890> that<00:03:21.520> they

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
conclusion and many will say that they

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.970 
conclusion and many will say that they
would<00:03:21.850> much<00:03:22.150> rather<00:03:22.180> be<00:03:23.110> a<00:03:23.140> heel<00:03:23.470> than<00:03:23.770> be<00:03:23.950> a

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
would much rather be a heel than be a

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.320 
would much rather be a heel than be a
face<00:03:24.190> well<00:03:24.400> it's<00:03:24.520> easier<00:03:24.850> you<00:03:24.940> know<00:03:25.000> why

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
face well it's easier you know why

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.150
