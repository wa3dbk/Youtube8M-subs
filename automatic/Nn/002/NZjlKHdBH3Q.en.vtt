doing<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.630> didn't<00:00:28.230> want<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.500> go<00:00:28.890> too<00:00:28.949> far<00:00:29.250> out

doing I didn't want it to go too far out

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:30.710 
doing I didn't want it to go too far out
you<00:00:29.730> know<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:29.939> didn't<00:00:30.179> want<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.420> be<00:00:30.570> like

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
you know I didn't want it to be like

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.060 
you know I didn't want it to be like
half<00:00:30.960> an<00:00:31.170> hour<00:00:31.289> long<00:00:31.529> or<00:00:31.679> anything<00:00:31.920> like<00:00:31.980> that

knew<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.850> was<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> Chitauri<00:01:27.659> Leviathan<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.409> is

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
knew it was a Chitauri Leviathan it is

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.230 
knew it was a Chitauri Leviathan it is
brilliant<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.250> people<00:01:29.610> who<00:01:29.759> make<00:01:30.000> these

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
brilliant the people who make these

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.719 
brilliant the people who make these
designs<00:01:30.689> are<00:01:31.130> incredible<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.280> don't<00:01:32.490> know<00:01:32.549> how

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
designs are incredible I don't know how

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.100 
designs are incredible I don't know how
they<00:01:32.909> could<00:01:32.939> do<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.270> because<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.720> honest<00:01:33.960> I

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
they could do it because to be honest I

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.840 
they could do it because to be honest I
can<00:01:34.530> look<00:01:34.680> at<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.100> know<00:01:35.220> two<00:01:35.460> more<00:01:35.610> give

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
can look at that you know two more give

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.940 
can look at that you know two more give
me<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> design<00:01:36.509> say<00:01:36.810> build<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.439> couldn't<00:01:37.860> do

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
me a design say build that I couldn't do

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.620 
me a design say build that I couldn't do
it<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.130> couldn't<00:01:38.549> even<00:01:38.700> start<00:01:39.150> off<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.509> it's

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
it I couldn't even start off of it it's

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.080 
it I couldn't even start off of it it's
impossible<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:40.979> amazing<00:01:41.100> it'd<00:01:41.820> be

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
impossible so this is amazing it'd be

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.789 
impossible so this is amazing it'd be
really<00:01:42.240> cool<00:01:42.479> if<00:01:42.540> somebody<00:01:43.500> could<00:01:43.590> actually

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
really cool if somebody could actually

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.130 
really cool if somebody could actually
make<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.670> would<00:01:44.970> love<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.270> see<00:01:45.450> how<00:01:45.840> big

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
make this I I would love to see how big

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.569 
make this I I would love to see how big
it<00:01:46.290> would<00:01:46.350> actually<00:01:46.680> look<00:01:46.799> like<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:47.189> reality

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
it would actually look like in reality

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.069 
it would actually look like in reality
because<00:01:48.000> if<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.180> don't<00:01:48.299> know<00:01:48.509> with<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.869> lego

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
because if you don't know with the lego

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.929 
because if you don't know with the lego
games<00:01:49.380> basically<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.100> think<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.640> have<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.790> do

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
games basically I think you have to do

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.219 
games basically I think you have to do
this<00:01:51.060> with<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.299> lego<00:01:51.479> movie<00:01:51.600> as<00:01:51.899> well<00:01:51.930> but

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
this with the lego movie as well but

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.800 
this with the lego movie as well but
basically<00:01:52.500> what<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.770> have<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.979> do<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.310> when<00:01:53.909> TT

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
basically what you have to do is when TT

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.870 
basically what you have to do is when TT
games<00:01:54.990> or<00:01:55.229> TT<00:01:55.439> fusion<00:01:55.710> whoever<00:01:56.219> working<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.759> it

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
games or TT fusion whoever working on it

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.480 
games or TT fusion whoever working on it
make<00:01:57.450> let's<00:01:58.409> say<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:58.740> there's<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.070> Chitauri

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
make let's say like there's a Chitauri

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.100 
make let's say like there's a Chitauri
Leviathan<00:02:00.090> they<00:02:00.210> have<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.450> send<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.810> off<00:02:00.899> to

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
Leviathan they have to send it off to

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.139 
Leviathan they have to send it off to
Lego<00:02:01.380> or<00:02:01.530> someone<00:02:02.159> else<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.549> they<00:02:02.909> have<00:02:03.030> to

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
Lego or someone else and they have to

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.630 
Lego or someone else and they have to
check<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.570> see<00:02:03.750> if<00:02:03.780> it's<00:02:03.930> physically<00:02:04.770> possible

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
check to see if it's physically possible

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.429 
check to see if it's physically possible
to<00:02:06.149> actually<00:02:06.329> be<00:02:06.570> able<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.750> make<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.079> in

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
to actually be able to make that in

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.740 
to actually be able to make that in
reality<00:02:07.590> which<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.280> really<00:02:08.580> cool<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.629> know

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
reality which is really cool so you know

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.839 
reality which is really cool so you know
yes<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.500> would<00:02:10.679> if<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.009> had<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.280> pieces<00:02:11.730> of

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
yes you would if you had the pieces of

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.680 
yes you would if you had the pieces of
course<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.270> would<00:02:12.510> be<00:02:12.660> able<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.959> make

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
course you would be able to make

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.110 
course you would be able to make
giant<00:02:14.260> Leviathan<00:02:14.920> Chitauri<00:02:15.460> thing<00:02:15.790> which<00:02:15.940> is

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
giant Leviathan Chitauri thing which is

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.810 
giant Leviathan Chitauri thing which is
awesome<00:02:16.510> I<00:02:17.020> mean<00:02:17.080> seeing<00:02:18.010> this<00:02:18.190> reality<00:02:18.700> would

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
awesome I mean seeing this reality would

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.480 
awesome I mean seeing this reality would
be<00:02:18.940> really<00:02:19.210> cool<00:02:19.800> next<00:02:20.800> up<00:02:20.920> here<00:02:21.070> we<00:02:21.160> can<00:02:21.310> see

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
be really cool next up here we can see

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.220 
be really cool next up here we can see
Loki<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.180> bunch<00:02:22.360> of<00:02:22.450> jutt<00:02:22.630> re<00:02:22.900> flying

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
Loki and a bunch of jutt re flying

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.260 
Loki and a bunch of jutt re flying
around<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.800> sky<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.400> Loki<00:02:24.760> looks<00:02:24.940> really

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
around the sky and Loki looks really

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.000 
around the sky and Loki looks really
cool<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:25.480> know<00:02:25.600> he<00:02:25.750> hasn't<00:02:26.080> really<00:02:26.200> had<00:02:26.440> any

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
cool you know he hasn't really had any

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.130 
cool you know he hasn't really had any
redesign<00:02:27.640> at<00:02:27.820> all<00:02:27.940> but<00:02:28.450> you've<00:02:28.540> honest<00:02:28.780> that

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
redesign at all but you've honest that

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.140 
redesign at all but you've honest that
doesn't<00:02:29.410> really<00:02:29.560> matter<00:02:29.860> because<00:02:30.160> he<00:02:30.970> looks

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
doesn't really matter because he looks

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.460 
doesn't really matter because he looks
fine<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:31.570> know<00:02:31.600> that<00:02:31.870> is<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.170> actual

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
fine you know that is the actual

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.770 
fine you know that is the actual
Avengers<00:02:33.130> low<00:02:33.310> key<00:02:33.520> and<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:33.730> is<00:02:33.820> of<00:02:33.970> course<00:02:34.000> the

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
Avengers low key and it is of course the

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.630 
Avengers low key and it is of course the
Avengers<00:02:35.170> Loki<00:02:35.500> from<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.770> actual<00:02:36.010> LEGO<00:02:36.280> sets

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
Avengers Loki from the actual LEGO sets

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.460 
Avengers Loki from the actual LEGO sets
so<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.120> makes<00:02:37.300> sense<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.690> have<00:02:37.870> this<00:02:38.080> version

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
so it makes sense to have this version

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.410 
so it makes sense to have this version
in<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.680> game<00:02:38.830> so<00:02:39.160> I'm<00:02:39.970> not<00:02:40.120> bothered<00:02:40.390> about

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
in the game so I'm not bothered about

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.240 
in the game so I'm not bothered about
that<00:02:40.720> but<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.170> thing<00:02:41.200> is<00:02:41.380> I<00:02:41.560> would<00:02:41.920> like<00:02:42.100> to

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
that but the thing is I would like to

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.770 
that but the thing is I would like to
see<00:02:42.430> different<00:02:42.670> versions<00:02:43.180> of<00:02:43.300> Loki<00:02:43.630> like

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
see different versions of Loki like

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.120 
see different versions of Loki like
maybe<00:02:43.960> we<00:02:44.080> could<00:02:44.230> have<00:02:44.320> a<00:02:44.380> comic<00:02:44.740> book<00:02:44.920> version

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
maybe we could have a comic book version

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.920 
maybe we could have a comic book version
or<00:02:45.640> maybe<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.210> know<00:02:46.300> just<00:02:46.330> something<00:02:46.840> as

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
or maybe you know just something as

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.170 
or maybe you know just something as
simple<00:02:47.140> as<00:02:47.470> thor<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.370> dark<00:02:48.490> world<00:02:48.760> where<00:02:49.120> you

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
simple as thor the dark world where you

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.430 
simple as thor the dark world where you
didn't<00:02:49.420> have<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.660> helmet<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:50.110> think<00:02:50.140> it'd<00:02:50.410> be

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
didn't have the helmet I think it'd be

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.960 
didn't have the helmet I think it'd be
really<00:02:50.530> cool<00:02:50.950> because<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.340> just<00:02:51.430> allows<00:02:51.760> you

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
really cool because it just allows you

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.850 
really cool because it just allows you

to add more costumes two characters

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.590 
to add more costumes two characters
because<00:02:54.040> I'm<00:02:54.160> hoping<00:02:54.490> you<00:02:55.030> know<00:02:55.150> at<00:02:55.390> least

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
because I'm hoping you know at least

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.750 
because I'm hoping you know at least
each<00:02:56.080> of<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.530> core<00:02:56.830> characters<00:02:57.400> have<00:02:57.640> at

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
each of the core characters have at

each of the core characters have at
least<00:02:57.850> one<00:02:58.210> costume<00:02:58.720> because<00:02:58.900> costumes<00:02:59.830> are

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
least one costume because costumes are

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.230 
least one costume because costumes are
cool<00:03:00.160> in<00:03:00.310> these<00:03:00.460> games<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:00.880> it<00:03:00.940> seems<00:03:01.120> like

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
cool in these games and it seems like

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.400 
cool in these games and it seems like
they're<00:03:01.360> definitely<00:03:01.510> pushing<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:02.200> much

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
they're definitely pushing that much

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.870

which is great so fingers crossed with

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.790 
which is great so fingers crossed with
more<00:03:06.310> costumes<00:03:07.080> next<00:03:08.080> up<00:03:08.200> here<00:03:08.410> we<00:03:08.500> can<00:03:08.620> see

them in free play and free roam and all
that<00:03:22.420> good<00:03:22.570> stuff<00:03:22.630> you<00:03:23.290> can<00:03:23.440> also<00:03:23.560> place<00:03:23.830> age

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
that good stuff you can also place age

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.740 
that good stuff you can also place age
of<00:03:24.100> Ultron<00:03:24.610> floor<00:03:24.850> as<00:03:25.030> well<00:03:25.209> which<00:03:25.420> is<00:03:25.450> great

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
of Ultron floor as well which is great

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.870 
of Ultron floor as well which is great
and<00:03:25.780> he<00:03:25.959> has<00:03:26.050> a<00:03:26.080> different<00:03:26.470> design<00:03:26.739> but<00:03:27.400> I<00:03:27.610> also

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
and he has a different design but I also

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.729 
and he has a different design but I also
think<00:03:28.090> that<00:03:28.330> comic<00:03:28.810> book<00:03:28.840> Thor<00:03:29.290> will<00:03:29.500> be<00:03:29.620> in

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
think that comic book Thor will be in

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:30.630 
think that comic book Thor will be in
the<00:03:29.860> game<00:03:30.010> as<00:03:30.130> well<00:03:30.250> this<00:03:30.430> isn't

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
the game as well this isn't

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.090 
the game as well this isn't
confirmations<00:03:31.360> it's<00:03:31.600> just<00:03:31.780> speculation<00:03:32.100> but

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
confirmations it's just speculation but

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.010 
confirmations it's just speculation but
you<00:03:33.489> know<00:03:33.610> there<00:03:33.940> is<00:03:33.970> a<00:03:34.060> Lego<00:03:34.420> set<00:03:34.720> quite<00:03:34.959> a

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
you know there is a Lego set quite a

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.540 
you know there is a Lego set quite a
recent<00:03:35.470> one<00:03:35.560> is<00:03:35.680> well<00:03:35.830> I<00:03:35.860> think<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.250> it's<00:03:36.340> not

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
recent one is well I think and it's not

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.670 
recent one is well I think and it's not
related<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.090> movies<00:03:37.540> and<00:03:37.750> it<00:03:38.110> did<00:03:38.230> come

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
related to the movies and it did come

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.160 
related to the movies and it did come
with<00:03:38.890> like<00:03:39.040> a<00:03:39.070> classic<00:03:39.489> Thor<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:40.630> you<00:03:41.080> know

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
with like a classic Thor so you know

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.810 
with like a classic Thor so you know
that<00:03:41.620> was<00:03:41.739> also<00:03:41.950> in<00:03:42.190> Lego<00:03:42.340> Marvel<00:03:42.400> Super

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
that was also in Lego Marvel Super

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.190 
that was also in Lego Marvel Super
Heroes<00:03:43.030> as<00:03:43.150> well<00:03:43.300> so<00:03:43.480> if<00:03:43.570> you're<00:03:43.690> hoping<00:03:43.870> for<00:03:44.050> a

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
Heroes as well so if you're hoping for a

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.990 
Heroes as well so if you're hoping for a
classic<00:03:44.410> thought<00:03:44.800> you<00:03:45.250> might<00:03:45.430> just<00:03:45.640> get<00:03:45.850> it

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
classic thought you might just get it

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.550 
classic thought you might just get it
but<00:03:46.180> I<00:03:46.209> hope<00:03:46.420> this<00:03:46.600> time<00:03:46.750> he<00:03:46.810> has<00:03:47.050> his<00:03:47.200> helmet

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
but I hope this time he has his helmet

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.320 
but I hope this time he has his helmet
because<00:03:47.709> you<00:03:48.340> know<00:03:48.459> classic<00:03:48.880> Thor<00:03:49.120> with<00:03:49.239> a

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
because you know classic Thor with a

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.729 
because you know classic Thor with a
helmet<00:03:49.510> would<00:03:49.720> be<00:03:49.870> a<00:03:49.900> pretty<00:03:50.140> cool<00:03:50.380> character

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
helmet would be a pretty cool character

helmet would be a pretty cool character

mark 7 and i love the mark 7 the reason
i<00:04:04.930> like<00:04:05.080> it<00:04:05.260> so<00:04:05.290> much<00:04:05.500> is<00:04:05.800> because<00:04:05.830> it's<00:04:06.280> the

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
i like it so much is because it's the

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.820 
i like it so much is because it's the
circle<00:04:06.640> that's<00:04:07.090> pretty<00:04:07.450> much<00:04:07.600> it<00:04:07.660> because<00:04:08.440> you

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
circle that's pretty much it because you

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.000 
circle that's pretty much it because you
know<00:04:08.920> the<00:04:09.100> triangle<00:04:09.610> is<00:04:09.850> okay<00:04:10.330> but<00:04:10.840> I'm<00:04:11.530> not

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
know the triangle is okay but I'm not

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.860 
know the triangle is okay but I'm not
overly<00:04:12.280> fond<00:04:12.550> of<00:04:12.670> it<00:04:12.760> I<00:04:12.850> really<00:04:13.239> much<00:04:13.480> prefer

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
overly fond of it I really much prefer

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.960 
overly fond of it I really much prefer
the<00:04:14.110> circle<00:04:14.739> and<00:04:14.950> you<00:04:15.100> know<00:04:15.190> when<00:04:15.519> I<00:04:15.550> say<00:04:15.790> that

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
the circle and you know when I say that

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.699 
the circle and you know when I say that
I<00:04:16.030> don't<00:04:16.150> hate<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.810> triangle<00:04:17.290> at<00:04:17.380> all<00:04:17.530> and

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
I don't hate the triangle at all and

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.349 
I don't hate the triangle at all and
still<00:04:17.890> think<00:04:18.070> it's<00:04:18.190> cool<00:04:18.400> but<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.000> circle

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
still think it's cool but the circle

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.970 
still think it's cool but the circle
just<00:04:19.540> looks<00:04:19.750> better<00:04:19.989> in<00:04:20.169> my<00:04:20.260> opinion<00:04:20.290> however

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
just looks better in my opinion however

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.580 
just looks better in my opinion however
