00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
against my lashes a little bit all in

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.760 
against my lashes a little bit all in
this<00:01:44.759> area<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.540> wore<00:01:45.840> off<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.200> mean<00:01:46.470> being<00:01:46.619> a

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
this area it wore off I mean being a

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.679 
this area it wore off I mean being a
monolid<00:01:47.189> that's<00:01:47.490> one<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.149> problematic

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
monolid that's one of the problematic

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.200 
monolid that's one of the problematic
areas<00:01:48.990> or<00:01:49.560> just<00:01:50.040> problems<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.670> general<00:01:51.000> so

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
areas or just problems in general so

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.880 
areas or just problems in general so
that<00:01:51.360> was<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.509> disappointment<00:01:52.110> especially

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
that was a disappointment especially

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.380 
that was a disappointment especially
since<00:01:53.130> there<00:01:53.280> are<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:53.610> many<00:01:53.729> things<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.180> liked

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
since there are so many things I liked

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.850 
since there are so many things I liked
about<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.840> but<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.170> guess<00:01:55.320> that's<00:01:55.470> not<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:55.829> bad

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
about this but I guess that's not so bad

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.219 
about this but I guess that's not so bad
since<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.549> was<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> only<00:01:56.969> con<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.930> bunch

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
since that was the only con and a bunch

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.109 
since that was the only con and a bunch
of<00:01:58.380> pros<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:59.040> wasn't<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.399> huge<00:01:59.670> deal<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.909> me

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
of pros it wasn't a huge deal to me

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.370 
of pros it wasn't a huge deal to me
since<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.630> already<00:02:00.750> have<00:02:01.020> some

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
since I already have some

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.260

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
and I use all over my lid that does last

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.090
