00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.960
 I really am, however, very young 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.410
 mister blue and welcome to this new one 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.980
 video 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.570
 I'm here today to talk about the patch 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.669
 1.14 for the call of duty black ops game 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.039
 2 which was released this morning 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.439
 ad activision and as usual that was 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.000
 correct improve some peers of 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.690
 this game is about the 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.670
 multiplayer 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.860
 by contrast, for the part zombie 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.110
 but the most interesting thing about this one 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.900
 patch is definitely the new list 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.290
 trophies that will be unlocked with the 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.760
 fourth and final dlc of this game 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.589
 in fact we can already see together that 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.960
 there will be many interesting things in the 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.909
 map zombie origins starting from 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.900
 most important trophy that will be unlocked 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.989
 with lists reg 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.710
 and in which we will have to free samantha oh 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.809
 my god 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.119
 yes yes as it was already intuited in the 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.670
 samantha presentation trailer will be 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.520
 an integral part of origins and will be 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.680
 our task to free it where it is not 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.860
 we still know exactly but maybe not 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.570
 I know from one place how it happened on worlds 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.600
 from the flat a pyramid of something 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.820
 of similar or we should free from a 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.619
 body that could be rick 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.880
 totem for example for this thing 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.789
 in short, we'll see how it is 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.500
 this new map will then evolve 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.119
 flipping through the other trophies anyway 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.890
 we can deduce that we can 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.590
 cross the entire map on board the 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.030
 similarly tank and transit 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.109
 this thing will be a little intuited already 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.990
 a few days ago 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:42.729
 then always taking a look at these 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.399
 trophies we can guess we can 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.469
 set aside some weapons and we can 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.929
 maybe even share with ours 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:53.140
 playmates then we will have to try to 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.069
 pay attention to the sold out panther which 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.319
 have seen in the trailer 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.670
 we will have to try to free ourselves though 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.549
 we will be captured by him 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.109
 then we will have to build some details 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.030
 sticks 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:05.469
 we will have to activate converters that 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.539
 probably should be those 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.640
 large electromagnetic objects that 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.580
 we also saw them in the 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.990
 contraction trailer of origins and will be 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.390
 also possible to revive ours 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.160
 companions differently and 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.350
 probably also using some 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.120
 ampoules that are those pink fracts 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.480
 we believe 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.569
 also here, however, in today's 3 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.540
 now we know these vials 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.099
 they contain so many zombie blood 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.650
 new things to do on this map 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:39.010
 zombie origins will be right there from 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.069
 indulge yourself with our noblemen indeed 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.900
 our old protagonists and that 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.480
 however I could play we'll see together 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.019
 starting August 27th 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.519
 obviously date of release of the dlc 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.459
 anyway over 36 this new zombies 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.049
 patch also introduces other new features 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:59.560
 first of all, the 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:02.769
 medical locations where water or landed and paca 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.109
 punch strips and graham also on likes 3 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.819
 then the bug was fixed 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.099
 according to which it was possible to copy 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.290
 the emblems of our friends or those 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.450
 of the players we met during 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.010
 matches online so you shouldn't 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.890
 be more possible to use this 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.790
 trick to copy the emblems to 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.590
 finally other people in this peace 1.14 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.019
 no game values ​​were corrected 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.910
 like the balancing of weapons but the 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.190
 developers are more concentrated 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.560
 on the correction of some bugs and glitches 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.840
 that allowed players to get 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.340
 advantages over opponents 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.859
 and here it was done both for the 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.750
 multiplayer than for the zombie part and in 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.549
 anyway anyway if you want to consult

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.109
 that were made starting from 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.609
