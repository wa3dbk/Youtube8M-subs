00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.510
 [Music] 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.620
 [Music] 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.460
 sat close to that shooting we see already 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.610
 inside as a choir there are 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.610
 Finally 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.910
 in how long has the 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.310
 disappointments lasted to ajax 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.710
 feyenoord 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.900
 yes, I already think after the game 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.490
 open evening and next day also one 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.710
 bit of a chat with you with the 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.420
 boys and such a good feeling 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.760
 actually that you are here that there 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.670
 dominated and also out so that was 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.460
 just talked to the boys 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.020
 again about the match and it is it 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.790
 was certainly nice feeling only yes you were 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.960
 still talking about the disappointment 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.030
 that you have not won names 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.680
 in the end just have to be satisfied 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.310
 but we also have quite a few 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.990
 supporters 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.610
 spoken on the training field and that 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.380
 You would also all be unanimous that they are you 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.479
 the best men in the field thought how 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.720
 have you experienced that yourself? 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.399
 yes i actually played a good one 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.710
 but I guess we like that 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.650
 just team 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.600
 have played very well that yes because 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.540
 you can't I can't do it on your own 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.920
 and we showed that we just 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.080
 actually that match actually with 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.430
 its all just very good very good 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.680
 have played so we actually 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.610
 save as a team and we do 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.229
 actually a lot of opponents 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.740
 make it difficult and we have that 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.850
 I think so 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.710
 match very well done one thing that 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.899
 anyone can look back on 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.580
 a good fight from and climbed as well as after 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.540
 You end up being very stable 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.170
 seasons experienced thus even know 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.850
 yes i think so far so 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.320
 goes pretty well 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.780
 Sure things are always better 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.300
 but I certainly can't complain and 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.780
 I am satisfied I think we as a team 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.610
 also what a grow there should be 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.350
 try to continue this line and then 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.940
 maybe you can do a lot of nice things 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.410
 experience beautiful things in between 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.420
 have already scored three times this season 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.310
 also goal really from the second line 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.110
 is that something you do every week but yes 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.940
 are training with sean paul van gastel and 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.830
 giovanni van bronckhorst 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.390
 yes i think so i think we will 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.810
 often busy with it 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.970
 and yes it is but something I this 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.680
 you're actually working on my 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.390
 actually trying to score and yes me 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.660
 think Rupo will start at 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.130
 I said yes if you are if you are here 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.870
 shot 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.820
 actually makes better and prizes or four 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.360
 score five times per season 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.140
 I try to go there 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.090
 [Music] 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.349
 paris summer s yes but that itself again 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.800
 looked well 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.800
 been good 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.170
 he saw the space in the corner and was 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.710
 sure of himself 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.880
 makaay 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.470
 [Music] 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.470
 handy he plays in the match 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.140
 a period in which there is really none 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:13.660
 there is any organization whatsoever 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.450
 hello marie this match before 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.600
 feyenoord chin almost 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.310
 to 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.310
 [Applause] 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:29.280
 within tiwari attack it 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:32.069
 next Sunday feyenoord groningen 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.359
 what do you expect yes you see it 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.739
 actually groningen it too 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.500
 opposition is've made very difficult 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.180
 I think we are on Euroborg now 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.609
 we are on the right track 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.989
 just need the matches 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.560
 who we want that last Sunday 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.739
 have played 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.510
 you should actually try yes 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.209
 to that more often 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.829
 to realize it in competitions that will 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.900
 that we actually just the opposition 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.579
 actually hunting in football and 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.989
 make it difficult 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.700
 I think that want to have tons in us and 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.400
 that we just have to do that more often 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.989
 that that is possible in Groningen yes well 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.370
 that such were against yes 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.609
 which are expected to pressure on 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.230
 hectic audience that you are there too 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.209
 weather can respond 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.680
 but yeah i think i think it 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.489
 on an opponent who wants the game 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.650
 actually make at that moment and yes 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.299
 we'll see how that game over 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.759
 play that match and for what 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.860
 manners but I have faith 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:27.810
 in i think we actually like you 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.849
 actually very difficult for any opponent 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.979
 able to make genes 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.360
 none of the opponents 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.510
 new ones are actually going to get over 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.760
 to lose and yes this is a form 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.419
 of the day determines that we what we then 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.070
 going to do 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.720
 but you are at 2 top games like 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.699
 got out and ajax out well for the day 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.620
 come up with a point and it must be 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.240
 I guess gnawing 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.810
 yes i think that's actually four points 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.510
 should have been but yes I think 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.760
 Your points are very important though 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.620
 I think yes I think that anyway 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.820
 awkward competitions are against 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.320
 only play yes i think how we do on 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.030
 the way we played that 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.570
 that just gives confidence to others 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.320
 matches 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.550
 yeah oh i gotta think we gotta have it 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.990
 going inside they are going to close 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.870
 knew where by where you actually got the 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.039
 boss in the field are clear or 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.039
 trust that we will still do that
