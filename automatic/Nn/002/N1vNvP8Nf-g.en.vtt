00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.900
 production occurs says that in this machine 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.750

 food is chocolate for production 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.790
 of cof beans were necessary 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.200
 pump adaptations that coffee for us is 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.450
 new feature 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.100
 We also had coffee production . 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.430
 innovate in the production of 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.620
 coffee has to build and 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.750
 invent some equipment to be able to 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.030
 reach the final production of the products and 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.579
 coffins at all times as was the 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.290
 were prepared by our team 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.269

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.079
 spread so you can reach this product 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.790

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:12.489
 currently the production capacity is 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.849
 150 tons of commercial coffee per month 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.400
 and this number can be tripled 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:21.129
 the expectation is that soon the 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.420
 already patented products and be 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.420
