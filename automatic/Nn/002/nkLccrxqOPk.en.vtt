00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.679
 hello we go today 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.980
 conduct a test of the new suitcase the otcp x 431 4 m pastor we 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.130
 market on the material site 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.050
 high tech 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.099
 point the brothers 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.559
 so for his suitcases to us as a particularity of course the cultivar 

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:24.339
 that m 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:26.249
 second age factor 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:27.249
 and especially 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:30.809
 it is perfectly in France etc so we will start with the screen 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:33.809
 touch - can click start 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.170
 currently we are diagnosing with a form 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.170
 so we select the reinforcement of 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.120
 a year ago that the suitcase this connector 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.120
 to the vehicle 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.500
 here is the endorsing connected 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.860
 and it allows us to choose three types 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.590
 trottine section so the annual section 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.210
 hate course 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.450
 why then called 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.450
 so we learn that the system that allows us to access 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.530
 well that depends the minister well in France after reindeer no worries 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.180
 allows access to a test 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.640
 specific about air conditioning 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.100
 for example mirrors of the rear view mirror calibration as one can 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.960
 see it here I accept the modules that make up the vehicle 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.040
 mauduit audio commands 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.480
 module for drivers 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.480
 the pse turning vote 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.430
 the image processing module 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.430
 how are they treated dashboard of ventilation 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.360
 or the rear door sensor 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.250
 shareholder function remote control 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.250
 for passengers 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.320
 and even the module 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.940
 novels if one day 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.999
 we add options this vehicle voice recognition 

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:06.430
 47 cars equipped 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.909
 a car radio be vocal knowledge among others 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:11.979
 we saw all the evils of the cocoon page vehicle 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:15.029
 although he recognized by the analysis and not the coup 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:17.789
 I can test them independently his desires 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:19.229
 in our test 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:22.229
 we will rather do a global test 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.079
 this system 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.229
 so we see testo courses 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:30.259
 in this world the suitcase that we ask ourselves no questions 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:31.579
 havas of necessities 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.059
 one by one all the modules of the vehicle 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:38.059
 present in the vehicle 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:42.759
 nantes is heard 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:44.519
 the car 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.479
 is equipped with technologies 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:49.079
 the longer the test will be 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.429
 because it will effectively sift all the accursed 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.489
 that make up this vehicle 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.109
 in the specific case 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.769
 we went to the car park 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.930
 we have a little audio module of course air conditioning is a vehicle that is 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.939
 bardÃ©e of electronics 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.999
 and as can be seen in this region 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:11.479
 the test is over but I already have 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:14.559
 I asked the players that we can see him 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:17.679
 so lower the minigames say nine dtc so 9 euros 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.819
 in the engine module judged one of the tcl 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:26.319
 so they have 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.319
 Actuating remote control function already 2 0 

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:34.029
 cla one is on a vehicle that is still relatively 

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:38.309
 problem 

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:42.679
 and g audio controls modules actually also come 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.180
 not a common name that still has a lot of mistakes so here we go 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.560
 delete we will click on the delete key that allows 

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:52.049
 facets every page we've seen 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.969
 we are really every day we assume that of course you have 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:56.499
 note beforehand 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:58.149
 but it's to show you 

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:01.149
 to the facility that I'm going to have for the module 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.489
 dcm 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.669
 to clear all the players we saw that there were anyway 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.089
 at least nine or ten o'clock 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:12.749
 in their different modules alone 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:15.359
 duo or insulting 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:16.819
 we see the evolution 

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:19.819
 75% 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:24.009
 87 ' 

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:30.159
 all the parts have as weak it's just modules that do not 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:32.879
 are not questioned harlem ok no worries to see at that level park on 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:34.870
 saw that 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.029
 park assist 

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:38.590
 errors have been cleared 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.550
 in the abs part this famous abs so that's where he had a mistake 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.330
 it comes indeed from greenhouse the most present in the world 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.729
 it seems like 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.740
 these are all your own keywords but as a fact it's not very serious these 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.749
 cursed while representing a field where employees no more mistakes 

00:04:56.749 --> 00:05:00.110
 in none of the modules but we had to name the goddess 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.639
 laval he did his job well 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.599
 so here we also have a possible rebound back to the pages 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:09.069
 previous 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:11.249
 that's fine manual section 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:13.189
 place to actually allows 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:16.539
 for people who want to select the vehicle we go on section 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:18.819
 Bethune say the model 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.949
 it's max here 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:25.110
 specify the year ensures 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.909
 so we see that he knows well that's interesting 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:29.949
 good ricky hatton may 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:31.939
 he knows the vehicle well 

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:34.939
 with the model serial number 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.270
 automatically dynamic school 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.580
 and here are all the shellfish made up of gem vehicles to do a test the 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.589
 module per module for example abecassis we see sex decline 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.789
 we will go in the air the ribs of failure 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.240
 no plane crash code erase them just now a medium many cases 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.389
 from breakdown everything to their nation 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.889
 we will go back always is it that I will be able to 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.150
 select and therefore tested GHG emissions for example if we will test 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.770
 the door module 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:09.979
 passengers 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:12.979
 many cases of failure 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:17.539
 see the example he is testing the 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.240
 the other players 

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:30.020
 so here I know I have a problem 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.180
 but the card a little 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.199
 so of communication with the other players a lack the default ko 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:38.270
 continual 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.270
 recoil and there I will be able eg erased 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.800
 imcopa erased in Cairo 20 years old even end of reading 

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:04.059
 a little breakdown 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:07.770
 we will return to the menu 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.439
 of course 

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:12.689
 we will not do all the Royal Armed Modules so parking assistance 

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:14.659
 hours of play 

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:17.309
 a whole bunch of possible modules of a whole bunch of vehicles that I can 

00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:20.009
 select in manual selection so 

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:24.020
 and of course odom that I have fashion such stocks very very simple for them 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.129
 novices is either a mode that automatically or the test are responsible for recognizing the 

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:29.320
 test modules one by one 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.990
 either attest emanuel to power that time 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.169
 you have to choose the car model 

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:35.139
 and organs
