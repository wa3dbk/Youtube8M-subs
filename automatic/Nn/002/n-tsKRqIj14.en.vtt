going to show you how far back that
links<00:02:55.480> girls<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:56.140> it's<00:02:56.290> probably<00:02:56.530> about<00:02:56.799> an

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
links girls and it's probably about an

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.640 
links girls and it's probably about an
inch<00:02:57.310> inch<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:57.850> a<00:02:57.880> half<00:02:57.910> in<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.870> very<00:02:59.380> front

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
inch inch and a half in the very front

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.720 
inch inch and a half in the very front
and<00:03:00.160> maybe<00:03:00.610> on<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.910> sides<00:03:01.180> in<00:03:01.480> age<00:03:02.489> but<00:03:03.489> it's

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
and maybe on the sides in age but it's

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.360 
and maybe on the sides in age but it's
definitely<00:03:04.030> sufficient<00:03:05.019> the<00:03:05.860> way<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.190> lid

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
definitely sufficient the way the lid

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.070 
definitely sufficient the way the lid
was<00:03:06.400> made<00:03:06.820> it<00:03:07.060> seems<00:03:07.360> as<00:03:07.510> if<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.690> hair<00:03:08.049> is

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
was made it seems as if the hair is

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.670 
was made it seems as if the hair is
supposed<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:08.799> go<00:03:08.950> straight<00:03:08.980> back<00:03:10.290> so<00:03:11.290> if<00:03:11.470> you

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
supposed to go straight back so if you

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.789 
supposed to go straight back so if you
wanted<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.430> part<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.600> hair<00:03:13.630> on<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:14.019> side<00:03:14.440> it

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
wanted to part the hair on the side it

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.400 
wanted to part the hair on the side it
may<00:03:15.100> lift<00:03:15.430> up<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:15.820> little<00:03:16.110> depending<00:03:17.110> on<00:03:17.230> which

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
may lift up a little depending on which

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
may lift up a little depending on which
way<00:03:17.620> you<00:03:17.680> part<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:18.370> but<00:03:19.410> my<00:03:20.410> way<00:03:20.709> of<00:03:21.100> fixing

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
way you part it but my way of fixing

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.400 
way you part it but my way of fixing
that<00:03:21.760> is<00:03:21.970> either<00:03:22.209> to<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.690> cliffs<00:03:23.080> on<00:03:23.380> the

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
that is either to the cliffs on the

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.610 
that is either to the cliffs on the
sides

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
sides

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.800 
sides
Park<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.799> way<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.340> place<00:03:27.060> clips<00:03:27.480> on<00:03:27.689> the

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
Park the way and place clips on the

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.770 
Park the way and place clips on the
sides<00:03:28.049> overnight<00:03:29.150> securing<00:03:30.150> it<00:03:30.299> and<00:03:30.540> making

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
sides overnight securing it and making

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.589 
sides overnight securing it and making
it<00:03:31.019> lay<00:03:31.230> down<00:03:31.469> and<00:03:31.889> hopefully<00:03:32.069> it<00:03:32.370> will<00:03:32.599> keep

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
it lay down and hopefully it will keep

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.140 
it lay down and hopefully it will keep
that<00:03:33.629> shape<00:03:34.109> or<00:03:34.769> sleeping<00:03:35.519> in<00:03:35.579> the<00:03:35.700> wig<00:03:35.879> and
