00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:06.250
 Rumors so here today I do not go Weimar 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.129
 yes you can and the 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:11.279
 Memory circuit 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:15.189
 For the sake of understanding, I have taken away tomatoes now also in the first 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:18.189
 Afterwards put Roeders can see better what happens where 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:23.019
 Namely I start with Bergheimer circuits the kicker 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.579
 Dr where repeats itself over and over again 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.689
 the set becomes a signal 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:32.900
 Basti 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.770
 repeated almost every second 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.770
 SEO initially only with a block and a torch won 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.010
 the torch being another block with a torch 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.070
 illuminated 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.070
 Dahl shut off for the second phase of course 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.809
 and "When we become second for a third block 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.129
 the third fake will be turned on again and the whole thing will now be returned 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.260
 consider 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.650
 Naturally 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.990
 Ott 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.129
 again, about one percent occur 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.509
 also the first record is turned off and the second one turns on again 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.700
 third again from the then turn off again who turns on 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.250
 but 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.240
 3 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.340
 Wellington too fast mattress sooner or later 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.260
 stay standing 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.780
 therefore 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.900
 Spokesman of the split minutes 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.110
 Hundreds needed 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.790
 this will switch then 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.790
 endlessly cheerful to yourself 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.230
 That way you could, for example, open the system 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.300
 Build up Pistons 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.450
 interconnected in different diets 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.850
 in a staircase are high 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.760
 or flashing lights 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.750
 because you open there 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.050
 so next the hosts of a male attitude 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.539
 m 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:14.539
 on the other hand, basically it has been 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.150
 ZweibrÃ¼cken interconnected yet means a block turns one 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.739
 want to offer the others from now gives each impression a signal to the 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:26.909
 Poland in short supply 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.839
 Scheider the above 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:31.519
 the other turned on and thereby 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.899
 that remains our short one 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:36.949
 Do not make each other again 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.949
 but are immediately blocked the Greens want or one 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.069
 Ammann connects in this way two scarce with it 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:50.619
 So you can with a button of only a short signal money 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:54.870
 send out a sustainable signal 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.150
 as soon as you start 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.139
 Summer no 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.319
 and then on button 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.610
 this is useful for doors 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.529
 then one percent came at the shutdown 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:09.469
 and also asked 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:11.259
 so 

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:14.199
 next after a short wire 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:17.589
 I'll show you nobody building Lotter's circuit 

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:21.919
 how it works can already be said, because the water 

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:25.149
 in his blood 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:28.149
 based on assumptions based on construction 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.579
 percent 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.579
 because my dream rules accordingly 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.959
 but Triesman spends a direction though the 16 two-branch Munster 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:46.299
 so by activating the Main managed the Redstone line 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.069
 but the water flows again in both directions 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:58.929
 what's going on in the san- or throws and conveniently mine 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:01.499
 Divorce percent thanked them 

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:04.289
 rebuild 

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:05.949
 so 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:09.009
 then 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:12.119
 you just have to be right for Blatter again 

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:16.289
 and channel partners and claims 

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:21.869
 As you might have thought board after a short drive because I just have to 

00:04:21.869 --> 00:04:24.669
 get the same 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.199
 but not every beautiful half-second card did not use 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.479
 to switch off 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.770
 here were the construction for the construction management 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.669
 recorded 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.669
 build with the way the water should deny 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.550
 next to it armed on the rectification comes 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.229
 and then ditch fell two places behind the water path 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:53.309
 all that is now over focused with urgency is about his 

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:57.439
 Flow direction to think again intensively that means some sets 

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:01.580
 remove or switch there or any other block around 

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:03.270
 take 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.270
 Letmathe 5 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.480
 Qu a week full or Andante though he finally 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.300
 To fabricate one needs ladies torches Darman then pimp up 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.300
 can 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:40.349
 the torches are traded at the banks by peer pressure Bauer objects 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:43.349
 by the banks may fall under it 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.600
 and calling there where you have to carry for example 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.740
 Imprison pug 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.469
 People from Santo are faithful 

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:00.849
 Leutert does not drop many meters of depth service 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:03.849
 or just to stop giving it, Born said 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.669
 the Lantus comment on rate and Bayer all possible 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.889
 Questions z or clarification or understanding problems 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:15.210
 when people contact me and I try so Kohler new video 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.680
 thank you and that first time
