turning absolutely superb to sharpen

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.220 
turning absolutely superb to sharpen
these<00:00:23.279> on<00:00:23.520> the<00:00:23.610> credit<00:00:23.910> card<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.449> little<00:00:24.900> bit<00:00:25.140> of

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
these on the credit card a little bit of

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.499 
these on the credit card a little bit of
the<00:00:25.320> fluid<00:00:25.680> there<00:00:25.920> now<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.849> would<00:00:27.000> assume

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509 
the fluid there now you would assume

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:29.480 
the fluid there now you would assume
that<00:00:27.599> when<00:00:28.080> you're<00:00:28.289> sharpening<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:29.130> you

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
that when you're sharpening that you

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.210 
that when you're sharpening that you
would<00:00:29.640> be<00:00:29.810> coming<00:00:30.810> down<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.560> sort<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.980> way

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
would be coming down this sort of way

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.400 
would be coming down this sort of way
and<00:00:32.550> doing<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.000> sort<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.390> motion<00:00:33.570> or<00:00:33.930> do<00:00:34.290> it

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
and doing the sort of motion or do it

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.979 
and doing the sort of motion or do it
now<00:00:34.949> if<00:00:35.280> you're<00:00:35.610> going<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:36.000> do<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.720> me<00:00:36.839> the

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
now if you're going to do that to me the

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.329 
now if you're going to do that to me the
biggest<00:00:37.199> problem<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.010> it's<00:00:38.280> very

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:38.339 
biggest problem is is that it's very

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:40.160 
biggest problem is is that it's very
difficult<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.239> know<00:00:39.360> when<00:00:39.660> you're<00:00:39.839> on<00:00:39.989> that

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
difficult to know when you're on that

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.289 
difficult to know when you're on that
edge<00:00:40.350> ideally<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.489> need<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.850> looking<00:00:42.180> up

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:42.299 
edge ideally you need to be looking up

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:45.259 
edge ideally you need to be looking up
through<00:00:42.720> the<00:00:42.809> bottom<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.229> the<00:00:43.320> table<00:00:43.699> so<00:00:44.699> what

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
through the bottom of the table so what

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:46.729 
through the bottom of the table so what
I'm<00:00:45.360> gonna<00:00:45.510> do<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.869> take<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.260> up<00:00:46.440> here<00:00:46.650> a<00:00:46.680> bit

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
I'm gonna do is take this up here a bit

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.450 
I'm gonna do is take this up here a bit
and<00:00:47.309> what<00:00:48.269> I<00:00:48.299> like<00:00:48.659> to<00:00:48.900> do<00:00:49.049> is<00:00:49.350> actually<00:00:49.739> dress

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
and what I like to do is actually dress

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.350 
and what I like to do is actually dress
that<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.869> stones<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.940> because<00:00:53.940> then<00:00:54.089> I<00:00:54.180> can

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
that to the stones so because then I can

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.600 
that to the stones so because then I can
see<00:00:54.600> exactly<00:00:54.960> what<00:00:55.589> their<00:00:55.799> angle<00:00:56.040> is<00:00:56.159> what<00:00:56.430> I'm

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
see exactly what their angle is what I'm

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.609 
see exactly what their angle is what I'm
doing<00:00:56.970> you're<00:00:57.119> not<00:00:57.150> gonna<00:00:57.330> round<00:00:57.540> it<00:00:57.689> over<00:00:58.019> so

00:00:58.609 --> 00:00:58.619 
doing you're not gonna round it over so

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:00.950 
doing you're not gonna round it over so

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.259 
the way I sharpen one of these is I'm
just<00:01:01.199> purely<00:01:01.439> coming<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.189> that<00:01:02.549> and<00:01:02.909> in

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
just purely coming in like that and in

just purely coming in like that and in
the<00:01:03.390> light<00:01:03.659> circular<00:01:04.500> motion<00:01:04.890> I'd<00:01:05.040> do<00:01:05.220> that

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549

turning<00:01:37.950> which<00:01:38.220> what<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.640> would<00:01:38.940> suggest<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.690> is

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
turning which what I would suggest is is

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.600 
turning which what I would suggest is is
that<00:01:39.990> you're<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.620> majority<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.190> the<00:01:41.370> time

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
that you're the majority of the time

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.090 
that you're the majority of the time
you're<00:01:41.850> using<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.330> coarse<00:01:42.600> side<00:01:42.920> because<00:01:43.920> you

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
you're using the coarse side because you

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.219 
you're using the coarse side because you
would<00:01:44.220> need<00:01:44.430> what<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.729> would<00:01:45.090> suggest<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:46.020> a

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
would need what I would suggest is a

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.890 
would need what I would suggest is a
coarse<00:01:46.920> sharp<00:01:47.340> edge<00:01:47.610> like<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> wiry

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
coarse sharp edge like a wiry

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.500 
coarse sharp edge like a wiry
sharp<00:01:49.500> edge<00:01:50.010> that<00:01:50.520> would<00:01:50.909> probably<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.270> too

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
sharp edge that would probably be too

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.060 
sharp edge that would probably be too
sharp<00:01:51.780> wood<00:01:52.110> turning<00:01:52.440> you<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:52.740> need<00:01:52.860> an<00:01:52.979> edge

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
sharp wood turning you just need an edge

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.520

of<00:02:28.959> cut<00:02:29.379> and<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:29.980> way<00:02:30.129> that<00:02:30.400> this<00:02:30.610> removed<00:02:31.120> the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
of cut and the way that this removed the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.360 
of cut and the way that this removed the
carbide<00:02:31.840> which<00:02:32.409> shows<00:02:32.709> you<00:02:32.890> how<00:02:32.920> quickly

again just likely see the beauty of
working<00:02:51.760> with<00:02:51.849> diamond<00:02:52.239> because<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:52.659> cuts<00:02:52.930> so

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
working with diamond because it cuts so

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.800 
working with diamond because it cuts so
quickly<00:02:53.709> is<00:02:54.310> that<00:02:54.579> you<00:02:54.670> don't<00:02:54.970> have<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.359> do<00:02:55.540> too

your utility knives again I like to put
that<00:03:25.750> on<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:25.989> corner<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.470> just<00:03:26.560> literally

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
that on the corner and just literally

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.220 
that on the corner and just literally
take<00:03:27.310> this<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:28.269> flatter<00:03:28.569> you're<00:03:28.840> working

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230

take this the flatter you're working
that<00:03:29.379> the<00:03:29.620> more<00:03:29.799> of<00:03:29.889> a<00:03:29.980> filling<00:03:30.400> edge<00:03:30.549> or<00:03:30.699> the

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
that the more of a filling edge or the

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.979 
that the more of a filling edge or the
fine<00:03:30.970> of<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.180> edge<00:03:31.269> you<00:03:31.419> get<00:03:31.540> into<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:31.810> blade

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
fine of the edge you get into the blade

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.479 
fine of the edge you get into the blade
and<00:03:32.139> again<00:03:32.319> just<00:03:32.500> take<00:03:32.829> that<00:03:32.980> nice<00:03:33.220> and

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
and again just take that nice and

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.360 
and again just take that nice and
lightly<00:03:33.699> nice<00:03:34.299> and<00:03:34.569> slowly<00:03:34.919> so<00:03:35.919> you<00:03:36.010> can<00:03:36.190> see

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
lightly nice and slowly so you can see

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.159 
lightly nice and slowly so you can see
what<00:03:36.549> you're<00:03:36.699> doing<00:03:36.730> with<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.359> blade<00:03:37.599> it's

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.169 
what you're doing with the blade it's

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:39.629 
what you're doing with the blade it's
the<00:03:38.290> lightness<00:03:38.709> of<00:03:38.859> the<00:03:38.980> stroke<00:03:39.220> is<00:03:39.400> that<00:03:39.519> if

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
the lightness of the stroke is that if

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.069 
the lightness of the stroke is that if
you<00:03:39.760> know<00:03:39.970> conventional<00:03:40.239> stone<00:03:40.840> you'll<00:03:41.019> be

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
you know conventional stone you'll be

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.689 
you know conventional stone you'll be
pressing<00:03:41.440> I<00:03:41.590> don't<00:03:41.769> know<00:03:41.889> why<00:03:42.069> sometimes<00:03:42.370> when

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:42.699 
pressing I don't know why sometimes when

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:44.460

so what I would suggest is that if you

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.120 
so what I would suggest is that if you
can<00:05:36.140> catch<00:05:36.320> this<00:05:36.500> problem<00:05:36.830> just<00:05:36.860> going<00:05:37.070> to

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
can catch this problem just going to

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.740 
can catch this problem just going to
point<00:05:37.340> out<00:05:37.550> the<00:05:37.700> face<00:05:37.940> that<00:05:38.270> you<00:05:38.390> should

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
point out the face that you should

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.480 
point out the face that you should
really<00:05:39.080> be<00:05:39.229> sharpening<00:05:39.860> the<00:05:40.010> face<00:05:40.220> that<00:05:40.400> you

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
really be sharpening the face that you

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.920 
really be sharpening the face that you
should<00:05:40.669> be<00:05:40.790> sharpening<00:05:41.300> is<00:05:41.479> this<00:05:41.720> one<00:05:41.930> here

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
should be sharpening is this one here

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.430 
should be sharpening is this one here
not<00:05:44.930> that<00:05:45.080> one<00:05:45.260> there<00:05:45.440> no<00:05:45.979> that<00:05:46.550> one<00:05:46.700> there

not that one there no that one there

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.510 
not that one there no that one there
that's<00:05:48.440> what<00:05:48.620> we<00:05:48.710> want<00:05:48.890> to<00:05:48.950> sharpen<00:05:49.190> she

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
that's what we want to sharpen she

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.080 
that's what we want to sharpen she
showed<00:05:49.790> me<00:05:49.820> in<00:05:50.000> the<00:05:50.090> rake<00:05:50.240> angle<00:05:50.479> so<00:05:51.640> all<00:05:52.640> we're

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
showed me in the rake angle so all we're

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.909 
showed me in the rake angle so all we're
going<00:05:53.270> to<00:05:53.390> do<00:05:53.660> is<00:05:53.870> if<00:05:54.080> you<00:05:54.200> can<00:05:54.380> see<00:05:54.650> that

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
going to do is if you can see that

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:57.730 
going to do is if you can see that
coming<00:05:55.130> in<00:05:55.370> here<00:05:55.790> I<00:05:56.260> just<00:05:57.260> show<00:05:57.410> you<00:05:57.440> down<00:05:57.710> here

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
coming in here I just show you down here

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.890 
coming in here I just show you down here
for<00:05:58.430> that<00:05:58.550> you<00:05:58.669> could<00:05:58.880> catch<00:05:59.120> that<00:05:59.150> there<00:05:59.720> I

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
for that you could catch that there I

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.170 
for that you could catch that there I
think<00:06:00.080> Bob<00:06:00.200> that<00:06:00.590> is<00:06:00.950> the<00:06:01.729> way<00:06:01.850> that<00:06:02.030> we're

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
think Bob that is the way that we're

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.580 
think Bob that is the way that we're
coming<00:06:02.360> in<00:06:02.510> to<00:06:02.630> show<00:06:02.810> up<00:06:02.930> on<00:06:03.080> that<00:06:03.110> so<00:06:03.470> you<00:06:03.560> can

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
coming in to show up on that so you can

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.770 
coming in to show up on that so you can
see<00:06:03.979> that<00:06:04.190> your<00:06:04.310> bear<00:06:04.610> totally<00:06:05.120> flat<00:06:05.419> across

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
see that your bear totally flat across

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.529 
see that your bear totally flat across
that<00:06:05.960> face<00:06:06.340> so<00:06:07.340> what<00:06:07.490> I<00:06:07.520> would<00:06:07.669> suggest<00:06:07.850> is<00:06:08.270> put

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:08.539 
that face so what I would suggest is put

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:10.510 
that face so what I would suggest is put
your<00:06:08.660> circular<00:06:09.169> saw<00:06:09.380> blade<00:06:09.620> in<00:06:09.770> a<00:06:09.890> vise<00:06:10.100> you

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
your circular saw blade in a vise you

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.290 
your circular saw blade in a vise you
need<00:06:10.729> to<00:06:10.910> mark<00:06:11.240> up<00:06:11.450> the<00:06:11.630> first<00:06:11.870> tooth<00:06:12.760> so<00:06:13.760> and

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
need to mark up the first tooth so and

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.700 
need to mark up the first tooth so and
we're<00:06:14.479> going<00:06:14.600> to<00:06:14.660> come<00:06:14.870> in<00:06:14.990> from<00:06:15.110> there<00:06:15.380> and

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
we're going to come in from there and

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.380 
we're going to come in from there and
all<00:06:15.919> I'm<00:06:16.100> going<00:06:16.280> to<00:06:16.430> do<00:06:16.580> it<00:06:16.729> in<00:06:16.820> a<00:06:16.880> very<00:06:17.120> light

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
all I'm going to do it in a very light

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.029 
all I'm going to do it in a very light
motion<00:06:17.690> just<00:06:18.080> two<00:06:18.320> or<00:06:18.380> three<00:06:18.440> very<00:06:18.860> light

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 
motion just two or three very light

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:24.159 
motion just two or three very light
strokes<00:06:19.490> is<00:06:22.330> is<00:06:23.330> that<00:06:23.510> with<00:06:23.660> the<00:06:23.750> fine<00:06:23.930> grit

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:24.169 
strokes is is that with the fine grit

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:25.029 
strokes is is that with the fine grit
again<00:06:24.440> yeah

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 
again yeah

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:27.249 
again yeah
I<00:06:25.069> think<00:06:25.969> when<00:06:26.089> you're<00:06:26.240> working<00:06:26.599> with<00:06:26.629> carbide

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:27.259 
I think when you're working with carbide

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:29.260 
I think when you're working with carbide
unless<00:06:27.619> you've<00:06:27.830> really<00:06:28.339> got<00:06:28.490> a<00:06:28.520> messy<00:06:28.969> saw

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
unless you've really got a messy saw

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.019 
unless you've really got a messy saw
blade<00:06:29.629> now<00:06:30.379> you<00:06:30.770> can<00:06:30.949> see<00:06:31.159> there<00:06:31.430> how<00:06:31.669> quickly

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:32.029 
blade now you can see there how quickly

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:34.839 
blade now you can see there how quickly
I'm<00:06:32.270> beginning<00:06:32.629> to<00:06:32.659> remove<00:06:32.990> the<00:06:33.139> carbide<00:06:33.849> so

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:34.849 
I'm beginning to remove the carbide so

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:36.760 
I'm beginning to remove the carbide so
really<00:06:35.330> you're<00:06:35.509> working<00:06:35.990> around<00:06:36.139> the<00:06:36.559> saw

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770 
really you're working around the saw

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.609 
really you're working around the saw
blade<00:06:37.159> two<00:06:37.669> or<00:06:37.789> three<00:06:38.029> light<00:06:38.240> strokes<00:06:38.779> all<00:06:39.139> the

00:06:39.609 --> 00:06:39.619 
blade two or three light strokes all the

00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:41.589 
blade two or three light strokes all the
way<00:06:39.740> around<00:06:40.129> there<00:06:40.460> and<00:06:40.849> you've<00:06:41.180> put<00:06:41.330> the<00:06:41.479> edge

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599 
way around there and you've put the edge

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:44.139 
way around there and you've put the edge
back<00:06:41.839> on<00:06:42.020> your<00:06:42.169> saw<00:06:42.379> blade<00:06:42.909> what<00:06:43.909> I<00:06:43.939> would

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:44.149 
back on your saw blade what I would

00:06:44.149 --> 00:06:45.879 
back on your saw blade what I would
suggest<00:06:44.300> you<00:06:44.629> should<00:06:44.869> do<00:06:45.169> is<00:06:45.469> probably

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:45.889 
suggest you should do is probably

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:48.219 
suggest you should do is probably
sharpen<00:06:46.580> it<00:06:46.669> that<00:06:46.939> way<00:06:47.149> around<00:06:47.479> about<00:06:47.779> three

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:48.229 
sharpen it that way around about three

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:51.010 
sharpen it that way around about three
times<00:06:48.499> right<00:06:49.039> then<00:06:49.999> on<00:06:50.180> about<00:06:50.479> the<00:06:50.659> fourth

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
times right then on about the fourth

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.189 
times right then on about the fourth
time<00:06:51.349> I<00:06:51.680> would<00:06:52.009> then<00:06:52.249> send<00:06:52.639> it<00:06:52.819> away<00:06:52.990> to<00:06:53.990> being

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:54.199 
time I would then send it away to being

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:58.329 
time I would then send it away to being
precision<00:06:54.710> ground<00:06:54.979> yeah<00:06:56.949> really<00:06:57.949> getting<00:06:58.129> it

00:06:58.329 --> 00:06:58.339 
precision ground yeah really getting it

00:06:58.339 --> 00:07:00.579 
precision ground yeah really getting it
back<00:06:58.550> yeah<00:06:59.300> so<00:06:59.689> what<00:06:59.899> I'm<00:06:59.990> trying<00:07:00.259> to<00:07:00.289> say<00:07:00.529> is

00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:00.589 
back yeah so what I'm trying to say is

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:02.950 
back yeah so what I'm trying to say is
in<00:07:00.889> trim<00:07:01.309> sharpening<00:07:01.879> will<00:07:02.149> actually<00:07:02.509> again

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 
in trim sharpening will actually again

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.649 
in trim sharpening will actually again
progress<00:07:03.770> prolong<00:07:04.580> the<00:07:04.759> life<00:07:04.939> of<00:07:05.180> your<00:07:05.240> saw

00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:05.659 
progress prolong the life of your saw

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:09.869 
progress prolong the life of your saw
blades<00:07:05.960> tremendously<00:07:06.499> okay<00:07:07.569> so<00:07:08.569> all<00:07:08.809> in<00:07:09.080> all<00:07:09.199> a

00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:09.879 
blades tremendously okay so all in all a

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:13.959 
blades tremendously okay so all in all a
bit<00:07:10.879> one<00:07:11.180> you<00:07:11.330> can<00:07:11.509> see<00:07:11.779> why<00:07:12.110> and<00:07:12.669> this<00:07:13.669> is

00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:13.969 
bit one you can see why and this is

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:16.089 
bit one you can see why and this is
certainly<00:07:14.479> very<00:07:14.629> affordable<00:07:15.409> you<00:07:15.710> can<00:07:15.740> see

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:16.099 
certainly very affordable you can see

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:18.480 
certainly very affordable you can see
why<00:07:16.279> that<00:07:16.550> having<00:07:16.999> a<00:07:17.089> fine<00:07:17.389> and<00:07:17.719> a<00:07:17.959> coarse<00:07:18.199> cut

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.490 
why that having a fine and a coarse cut

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.939 
why that having a fine and a coarse cut
whereas<00:07:19.490> other<00:07:20.259> similar<00:07:21.259> sort<00:07:21.469> of<00:07:21.529> products

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:27.229 
grades a bit confusing as people confuse

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:29.290 
grades a bit confusing as people confuse
me<00:07:27.439> what<00:07:27.830> they<00:07:27.979> should<00:07:28.159> have<00:07:28.189> the<00:07:28.909> good<00:07:29.089> thing

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:29.300

00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:34.639 
into the range so that you get a feel of

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:37.629 
into the range so that you get a feel of
how<00:07:34.849> diamond<00:07:35.389> works
