00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:05.140
 as if they were in the good hands of course we also red-white food 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.080
 red-white Oberhausen two that are so close at least ober-grafendorf Inc 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.699
 and the club name 

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:14.989
 otherwise, the two Grand can currently pray 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:19.890
 RWO is enthroned on the first place in the table and red-white food starts straight away 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.679
 Rank 14 and is close to bankruptcy it could almost be the last 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.089
 Wanting to be third if I hope for the worst in many cases 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.669
 It's almost as comfortable as it is the tram depot l 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.669
 seen and commented and healthier 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.240
 Just seven minutes drive from Oberhausen to his works brothel 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.400
 By train, however, GE is already free 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.710
 Harbor Road in 15 minutes 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.020
 the classic town center so who 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.220
 red-white Oberhausen coach Hombruch nominated me from the start to Jörg 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.220
 Lipinski about three years ago at the Cup final Essen against Bremen 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.610
 Last not first choice today for the injured Kaká Owlient the 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.940
 Essen with a first success in the capital around the department of 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.020
 namely second division relegated was allowed to accrue the beloved red and white 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.020
 Oberhausen, however, at the beginning with the larger game shares 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.660
 the third minute 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.290
 especially on the right side, the front-runner developed neatly 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.799
 rocked 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.799
 Attacks mostly threaded by Chamier Gerd Kaden 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.920
 in the middle of not that Weiland 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.799
 his header of course too weak Rome food keeper Krause 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.799
 to elicit more than a weary smile 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.580
 but logical guests super motivated in the duel with the unloved and better 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.060
 placed neighbors 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.080
 Free kick Small 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.200
 sure, of course 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.980
 good reaction parking the last week from which position 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.980
 Employer conceding goals is 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.680
 And speaking of last week against Trier, Theo BOS was the Oberhausener 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.740
 what is especially noticeable today 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.480
 with his free kicks 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.900
 Played for 20 minutes 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.969
 Zero to zero 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.789
 Food after lethargic beginning of 12 who advises the feet 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:14.789
 here it is black he gives gas 

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:20.299
 RWO even screwed up the vocational school from the listener because of the 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.489
 we find good its completion wireless outstanding was upgradeable 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:29.779
 Hans-Peter Lehnhoff of the family pack with Wolfgang Klein the reason 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:33.189
 because the ball is more than one in four here 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.090
 So I left her right after the start I was eating Worms 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.529
 first time will be for the league leaders 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:40.080
 here castle instead of the city 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.249
 Hanover 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:44.249
 yellow-red against the car romantics 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.609
 but also 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.119
 to works in duel with Werder 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:51.859
 Oberhausen so in the next 50 minutes 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.229
 outnumbered 

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:57.229
 or Chuka took care of it 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.929
 Oberhausen remains strong above all on the right 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:04.359
 that was not what you for example Dr 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.039
 and thanks to Eichelberger 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:10.509
 the act unambiguous and the subsequent you go something of "innocent" 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.349
 but again effort free kick 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:15.659
 everyone here too 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.889
 and Krause 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:19.579
 no goals at break 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.170
 the red-and-white football neighborhood dispute 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.700
 usually it was clear quickly RWE against RWO 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.700
 is not a seminar for pats 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:34.119
 then continue to see halftime is 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.999
 best coach Dieter Brei he saw both teams by the way initially unchanged 

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:43.669
 from the cabin 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:46.029
 Free kick for his troop for Hessen 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:47.629
 Doha 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:48.660
 the middle 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.289
 the pain 

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:53.469
 the 56 4 million 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:54.969
 to eat for red and white 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:58.049
 at the same time it is for St 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.049
 he mixed the rights Oberhausen defense side enormously 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:05.399
 the RP has handball 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:08.109
 1 2 0 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.510
 Eat now on the post office, the hosts followed suit 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.439
 us the scorer we are in charge 

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:20.499
 several minutes after the 4 

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:23.509
 two to zero by Wolfram Klein 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:26.840
 classic surprise 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.439
 he is defensively better 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:31.740
 but of course a beautiful flank of live 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.510
 Clients opponent once did not form 13 04 11 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.210
 then the singing was 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.210
 Lipinsky gender test sent behind the arrest 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.449
 Great chance for me too with the goals 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.180
 the action however is, so to speak, Felicia trains upper house after 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.719
 attack actions 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:54.219
 Red Cross Dennis Weiland came to the finish for the construction and Artur Mas 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.809
 then after the culprit 

00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:59.590
 Dennis Weiland 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.080
 the connection gate 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.080
 now only three minutes on the court 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:08.319
 However, there are also after the perpetrator 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:10.249
 the parking garage without chance 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:13.400
 RWO turn again 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.730
 Result of a class morale outnumbered and in arrears but courageously forward 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.699
 play terror fear away 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.300
 big stir 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.349
 either has the compensation 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:28.689
 Faber subsequently celebrated the season's number eleven conceded 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:31.650
 however, for his climbing the yellow card 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.690
 and benefited previously from a hate speech judge 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.280
 and upholds the interests Oberhausen 2 1 and 2 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:45.419
 and RWO now have fun and in the opponent's penalty area 

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:48.969
 Dennis Weiland 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:50.210
 the monastery 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.009
 Good action by both Dennis Weiland and Thomas Krause for the first time 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:58.620
 every inch of height needs to prevent the Essene residue 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:02.589
 but also the hosts sought the decision 

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:05.699
 Hellmich once again the last possibility, especially after the 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:09.419
 Break really good and exciting Regina league game's rating 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.460
 Matter of opinion Helge Meeuw 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.259
 could achieve the 2 2 in his second goal and take it away now 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:19.499
 where I think more of a smeared first place we'll take in 

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:22.400
 The scoring odds winning single can also outnumber 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.719
 conditionally had in the end and already would 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:28.779
 Warth &amp; Klein what in the end the joy outweighs the front-runner one 

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:32.080
 Point to have buttoned the frustration that one with a 2 

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:36.509
 0-lead and still had to concede two goals in excess 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:38.199
 I believe every one percent 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:41.909
 We are very sad because I think you should also for their films 

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:43.139
 readings 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:46.369
 in my opinion was nine first half 

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:48.800
 we were always of an opinion so were not given 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.710
 and my eyes are always hundreds of accidents Amisia Rheine not understood 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.669
 what 2 0 to save over time because we simply miss the Fr
