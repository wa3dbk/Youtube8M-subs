00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.860
 hello to all that such a welcome one day 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:20.619
 more to the channel today a new makeup with 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.349
 the palette of sleep is a makeup that 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.570
 I consider it very good for the 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.640
 night is a kind of smoked elongated 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.619
 and well, let's start by putting 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.110
 a pre base in this case is a shadow 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.480
 in cream in skin tone is the pp soft ocher 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.280
 of mac and well let's start taking 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.900
 shadows of the palette in this case we're going 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.670
 to catch the golden shadow we're going to 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.309
 put all over the tear in a very 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.820
 intense and now with a tongue brush 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.129
 of gatto let's take the blue shadow 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.260
 metallized and there's more intense in the 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.030
 pallet and we're going to put it all over the 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.449
 mobile eyelid until you reach the 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.449
 fold 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.210
 to then darken what 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.830
 that is all outside with the shadow 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.380
 black that is in the palette see is not a 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.270
 matte black shadow but it's like a 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.300
 little satin is worth before anything 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.920
 blur we have all the blue for then 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.659
 happen to darken as you see what we are going 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.360
 to do is darken the end 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.300
 taking it out is worth so that we 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.470
 give a more elongated shape to what is 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.590
 a makeup that the truth is that it is 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.030
 quite intense and each one can 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.759
 use for what you want like today we are going to 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.500
 mark also the basin and what we're going 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.869
 to do is to blur what towards the 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.670
 outside we do not want to go up too 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.280
 up we will help from the shadow 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.869
 122 of kiko but we do not want to get on 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.710
 too much about everything we will do is 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.780
 lengthen out 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.880
 and with a matte vanilla shadow 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.720
 we will illuminate the arch of the eyebrows as 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.780
 you see there is nothing complicated 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.450
 and let's move on to the face as the basis of 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.340
 mixed makeup being from here the 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.770
 ideal flawless soap in tone 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.390
 medium you see that it's darker with the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.420
 face pink it is the max factor in the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.160
 golden tone 75 and sealed everything with these 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.450
 powders of that if we apply a little 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.710
 of the film and maybelline and I've 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.260
 applied everything with the sponge 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.120
 real technique makeup I will give 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.220
 now a little bit of shape to the face is 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.450
 produces will do better with these 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.270
 powder of makeup revolution as always 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.420
 under the cheekbone on the forehead and on the 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.220
 final and with a powder brush 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.959
 as blusher I'm going to use this one 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.550
 here election I 'm lately a lot 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.209
 I really like the tone that gives the 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.959
 cheeks that is the picking of my 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.959
 evolution cable 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.629
 as an illuminator we are going to use the 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.120
 same brand the golden light and good what 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.860
 we are going to put in an intense way by the 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.620
 areas where we usually have to put it 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.569
 in the nasal septum the upper part of the 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.099
 cheekbone and good you can put in the 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.829
 lips what you like but I in 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.720
 this case then all the others in the 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:05.299
 quite natural a rosy tone with 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.849
 reflections to be eye makeup 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.739
 pretty marked, but it could be good 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.560
 arrange what you like most we put 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.690
 a lot of mascara and nothing else 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.700
 this would be the finished makeup already 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.930
 You see it's very simple but I think 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.390
 that is very flattering 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.579
 I hope you liked to tell me 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.989
 from below you have seemed to see 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.989
