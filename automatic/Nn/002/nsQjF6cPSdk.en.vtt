subscribers that sounds so weird when I
say<00:01:22.729> to<00:01:22.790> myself<00:01:23.090> like<00:01:23.479> seven<00:01:24.020> hundred

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
thousand seven hundred is that how you

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.450 
thousand seven hundred is that how you

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.500 
say it seven hundred thousand seven
hundred<00:01:28.520> thousand<00:01:28.909> I<00:01:28.970> think<00:01:29.000> that's<00:01:29.360> how<00:01:29.479> you

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
hundred thousand I think that's how you

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.570 
hundred thousand I think that's how you
say<00:01:29.870> it<00:01:29.990> for<00:01:30.170> some<00:01:30.290> reason<00:01:30.320> my<00:01:31.070> mind<00:01:31.280> just<00:01:31.400> went

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
say it for some reason my mind just went

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.180 
say it for some reason my mind just went
blank<00:01:31.700> but<00:01:32.210> it<00:01:33.110> tends<00:01:33.440> to<00:01:33.530> do<00:01:33.800> that<00:01:33.830> when<00:01:34.159> I

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
blank but it tends to do that when I

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.680 
blank but it tends to do that when I
think<00:01:34.520> about<00:01:34.580> how<00:01:34.970> many<00:01:35.210> people<00:01:35.570> actually

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
think about how many people actually

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.740 
think about how many people actually
watch<00:01:36.110> me<00:01:36.380> these<00:01:36.590> days<00:01:36.860> and<00:01:37.510> it's<00:01:38.510> always

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
watch me these days and it's always

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.010 
watch me these days and it's always
mind-blowing<00:01:39.620> it<00:01:39.770> really<00:01:40.010> is<00:01:40.130> but<00:01:40.400> I<00:01:41.210> wanted

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
mind-blowing it really is but I wanted

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.170 
mind-blowing it really is but I wanted
to<00:01:42.170> talk<00:01:42.409> if<00:01:42.620> they'd<00:01:42.770> been<00:01:43.400> about<00:01:43.670> something

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
to talk if they'd been about something

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.430 
to talk if they'd been about something
that<00:01:44.270> I've<00:01:44.450> already<00:01:44.780> talked<00:01:45.049> about<00:01:45.140> in
