either<00:02:01.210> I<00:02:01.689> used<00:02:02.110> to<00:02:02.200> just<00:02:02.350> do<00:02:02.500> whatever<00:02:02.679> I<00:02:02.860> felt

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
either I used to just do whatever I felt

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.370 
either I used to just do whatever I felt
like<00:02:03.280> doing<00:02:03.459> but<00:02:03.850> my<00:02:04.030> hair<00:02:04.270> was<00:02:04.690> so<00:02:04.899> long<00:02:05.170> he

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
like doing but my hair was so long he

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.529 
like doing but my hair was so long he
wasn't<00:02:05.740> as<00:02:06.100> healthy<00:02:06.729> as<00:02:06.940> I<00:02:06.970> could<00:02:07.240> have<00:02:07.330> been

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
wasn't as healthy as I could have been

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.199 
wasn't as healthy as I could have been
but<00:02:07.780> it<00:02:08.019> was<00:02:08.170> relatively<00:02:09.069> longer<00:02:09.880> than<00:02:10.060> most

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
but it was relatively longer than most

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.470 
but it was relatively longer than most
people<00:02:10.750> in<00:02:10.929> my<00:02:11.140> circle<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:11.830> I<00:02:12.180> just<00:02:13.180> thought<00:02:13.330> my

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
people in my circle so I just thought my

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.460 
people in my circle so I just thought my
hair<00:02:13.660> was<00:02:13.810> naturally

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
hair was naturally

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.430 
hair was naturally
you<00:02:15.040> know<00:02:15.160> like<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:15.640> just<00:02:16.000> grew<00:02:16.299> on<00:02:16.660> its<00:02:17.290> own

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
you know like that just grew on its own

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.650 
you know like that just grew on its own
without<00:02:17.590> me<00:02:17.890> having<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.299> maintain<00:02:19.299> it<00:02:19.510> and

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
without me having to maintain it and

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.870 
without me having to maintain it and
stuff<00:02:19.959> so<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:20.530> think<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.310> was<00:02:21.459> about<00:02:22.290> 2009<00:02:23.290> or

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
stuff so I think it was about 2009 or

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.820 
stuff so I think it was about 2009 or
2010

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
2010

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.490 
2010
around<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:27.010> time<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:27.670> came<00:02:28.569> across<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:29.230> love

around that time I came across you love

and<00:02:34.720> I<00:02:34.780> loved<00:02:34.989> how<00:02:35.170> she<00:02:35.200> blew<00:02:35.650> a<00:02:36.070> long<00:02:36.970> while<00:02:37.780> I

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
and I loved how she blew a long while I

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.720 
and I loved how she blew a long while I
was<00:02:38.019> still<00:02:38.260> relaxed<00:02:38.799> so<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.370> kind<00:02:39.910> of<00:02:39.970> followed

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
was still relaxed so I kind of followed

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.090 
was still relaxed so I kind of followed
so<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:41.910> used<00:02:42.240> to<00:02:42.360> do<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.750> war<00:02:42.960> conditioning<00:02:43.890> and

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
so I used to do the war conditioning and

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.580 
so I used to do the war conditioning and
sealing<00:02:44.520> and<00:02:44.820> washing<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.690> all<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.350> stuff

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
sealing and washing and all that stuff

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.640 
sealing and washing and all that stuff
so<00:02:46.730> my<00:02:47.730> aunt<00:02:47.970> did<00:02:48.270> grow<00:02:48.510> probably<00:02:49.170> from<00:02:49.440> about

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
so my aunt did grow probably from about

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.970 
so my aunt did grow probably from about
here<00:02:50.510> all<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.660> way<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.780> grass<00:02:52.170> rebellion<00:02:52.760> from

empowering black women African woman
you<00:04:26.990> know<00:04:27.110> to<00:04:27.170> embrace<00:04:27.920> themselves<00:04:28.490> more<00:04:28.700> with

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
all these projects there you know the

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.820 
all these projects there you know the
least<00:04:31.610> I<00:04:31.760> could<00:04:31.940> do<00:04:32.060> was<00:04:32.150> embrace<00:04:32.810> my<00:04:33.080> my<00:04:33.620> home

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
least I could do was embrace my my home

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.890 
least I could do was embrace my my home
my<00:04:34.130> head<00:04:34.400> you<00:04:34.670> know<00:04:34.820> there's<00:04:35.630> nothing<00:04:35.720> wrong

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
my head you know there's nothing wrong

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.720 
my head you know there's nothing wrong
with<00:04:36.139> me<00:04:36.380> used<00:04:36.590> I<00:04:36.740> love<00:04:36.950> leaves<00:04:37.250> I<00:04:37.490> probably

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
with me used I love leaves I probably

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.460 
with me used I love leaves I probably
would<00:04:38.060> have<00:04:38.090> believed<00:04:38.690> as<00:04:38.900> a<00:04:38.930> protective

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
would have believed as a protective

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.170 
would have believed as a protective
style<00:04:40.419> but<00:04:41.419> you're<00:04:41.570> not<00:04:41.690> just<00:04:42.460> like<00:04:43.460> I<00:04:43.760> needed

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
style but you're not just like I needed

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.520 
style but you're not just like I needed
to<00:04:44.330> embrace<00:04:44.810> more<00:04:45.320> of<00:04:46.070> myself<00:04:46.880> and<00:04:47.600> yeah<00:04:48.380> and

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
to embrace more of myself and yeah and

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.560 
to embrace more of myself and yeah and
not<00:04:48.680> rely<00:04:49.040> on<00:04:49.070> relaxer<00:04:49.880> and<00:04:50.030> that<00:04:50.210> would<00:04:50.360> let's

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
not rely on relaxer and that would let's

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.629 
not rely on relaxer and that would let's
just<00:04:50.810> my<00:04:51.070> personal<00:04:52.070> opinion<00:04:52.340> and<00:04:53.410> choice<00:04:54.639> and

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
just my personal opinion and choice and

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.610 
just my personal opinion and choice and
decisions<00:04:56.300> so<00:04:56.630> it's<00:04:56.900> got<00:04:57.080> nothing<00:04:57.350> to<00:04:57.470> do<00:04:57.590> with

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
decisions so it's got nothing to do with

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.280 
decisions so it's got nothing to do with
anything<00:04:58.130> else<00:04:58.400> it's<00:04:58.790> not<00:04:58.970> going<00:04:59.300> to<00:04:59.450> be<00:04:59.540> one

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
anything else it's not going to be one

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.830 
anything else it's not going to be one
of<00:05:00.410> those<00:05:00.530> things<00:05:00.860> that<00:05:01.540> that's<00:05:02.540> going<00:05:02.720> to<00:05:02.780> be

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
of those things that that's going to be

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.780 
of those things that that's going to be
difficult<00:05:03.320> for<00:05:03.380> me<00:05:03.650> because<00:05:03.770> I<00:05:04.010> did<00:05:04.400> grow<00:05:04.640> my

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
difficult for me because I did grow my

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.540 
difficult for me because I did grow my
hair<00:05:04.820> but<00:05:05.750> it<00:05:05.900> was<00:05:06.080> relaxed<00:05:06.890> yeah<00:05:07.220> so<00:05:07.520> I

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
hair but it was relaxed yeah so I

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.700 
hair but it was relaxed yeah so I
decided<00:05:08.000> to<00:05:08.150> just<00:05:08.419> go<00:05:08.840> Naturals<00:05:09.290> right<00:05:09.530> now

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
decided to just go Naturals right now

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.159 
decided to just go Naturals right now
I'm<00:05:09.860> transitioning<00:05:10.250> into<00:05:10.760> the<00:05:11.090> big<00:05:11.330> chop<00:05:11.570> at

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
I'm transitioning into the big chop at

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.290 
I'm transitioning into the big chop at
all<00:05:12.500> I'm<00:05:12.740> transitioning<00:05:13.160> a<00:05:13.640> lot<00:05:14.090> of<00:05:14.180> the

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
all I'm transitioning a lot of the

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.690 
all I'm transitioning a lot of the
things<00:05:14.510> that<00:05:14.600> I<00:05:14.720> did<00:05:15.080> do<00:05:15.380> when<00:05:15.530> I<00:05:15.650> was<00:05:15.830> relaxed

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
things that I did do when I was relaxed

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.370 
things that I did do when I was relaxed
it's<00:05:17.419> probably<00:05:18.040> similar<00:05:19.040> and<00:05:20.200> probably<00:05:21.200> the

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
it's probably similar and probably the

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.380 
it's probably similar and probably the
exact<00:05:21.740> same<00:05:21.979> thing<00:05:22.250> that<00:05:22.280> I<00:05:22.580> am<00:05:22.820> doing<00:05:23.180> now

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
exact same thing that I am doing now

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.260 
exact same thing that I am doing now
while<00:05:23.690> I'm<00:05:24.169> natural<00:05:24.740> so<00:05:25.280> if<00:05:25.400> you<00:05:25.550> are<00:05:25.729> relaxed

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
while I'm natural so if you are relaxed

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.950 
while I'm natural so if you are relaxed
and<00:05:26.419> you<00:05:26.600> are<00:05:26.750> following<00:05:27.169> my<00:05:27.350> channel<00:05:27.460> then

probably most of the stuff that I will
be<00:05:31.490> showing<00:05:31.700> you<00:05:31.940> you<00:05:32.330> can<00:05:32.570> just<00:05:32.750> look<00:05:32.900> do<00:05:33.140> I'm
