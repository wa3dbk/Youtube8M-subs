00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
 so welcome to 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:09.929
 meanwhile tenth part of poker myth 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:13.380
 and you can choose the part as a second one 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.580
 see part of the last video and that 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.990
 but we had I have the genesis 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.390
 I've talked about the world and there I have 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.890
 mentions that kira tina actually 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.539
 maybe not as bad as 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.920
 Everyone thinks and that's why it's in the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.980
 just follow it is just 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.439
 actually a peaceful pokémon the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.150
 ask how can I not do it? 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.189
 Of course there was the last episode where I too 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.690
 the member of a band but everything 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.390
 It started so much back then 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.629
 the word back then it was a month ago 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.660
 old conclusion with her steffen anyway 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:47.399
 Back then, there was showdown or better 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.100
 said at smog as quasi April Fool 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.079
 the joke that keratin is an aspect 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.230
 for the car comes that means the latina in 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.480
 the original form he is currently in the upper and 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.920
 as aprilschool there was almost the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.230
 Announcement that it is now in the us-werk 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.879
 that gives whether the ratina in the original form ins 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.369
 Audio is what I was really good 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.270
 I would have found at cinema form 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.240
 like to use 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.549
 Mario fit in well anyway 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.479
 But that's not the topic from there 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.259
 I then started this way 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.170
 a little bit yes to deal with them 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:21.420
 and from gera tina is always said it 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.720
 is almost the evil act of diana and 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.900
 Paul Klees lives in the world 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.909
 pass the counterworld and it is one 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.159
 bad pokemon i must say it 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.600
 actually true not because you 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.909
 must have taken exactly the three 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.850
 pokémon aschaffenburg yes the alpha and 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.000
 gera tina now it is like that 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.579
 Martina was joined in this world 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.770
 or is responsible for it 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.740
 that the antimatter gives the allgäuer 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.439
 the time and the space 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.840
 the problem is only without antimatter 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.329
 also matter can not exist that 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.740
 is like a balance and on both 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.100
 Pages always have to be the same 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.990
 that is, if the antimatter is not in the 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.940
 Balance is then affects 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.110
 even in our world is even in the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.160
 real life out there is really 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.920
 antimatter 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.180
 without antimatter can really be the 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.470
 matter does not exist 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.970
 seeing that is an equilibrium 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:28.050
 and now imagine the ratina 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:30.150
 voluntarily goes to the world around for it 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.770
 balance so we all 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.480
 at all or all in 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.600
 the pokémon world can exist 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.330
 that means keratin almost takes the agony 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.890
 to be alone only to the 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.090
 complete pokémon world is ever 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.590
 to give balance at all 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.150
 to be able to exist 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.540
 and that is not necessarily what 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.280
 a vicious promoter clear it gives it 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.320
 is also called in many pokédex entries 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.790
 that the ratina exiled in this world 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.080
 has been 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.820
 However, if we look at the movie 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.100
 the ratina or sky third look 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.960
 in the film, it's almost straight to Gera 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.310
 tina and chaman chaman want one 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.440
 flower garden come and then comes 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.450
 want to fight with her tina gera tina 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.820
 take revenge on this because the Allgäu 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.440
 I believe in this world invaded 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.530
 or so against the ratinger 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.830
 fought later in the film, however 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.590
 the ratina supports the people around the 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:23.730
 In the evil enemy club siroki so too 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.380
 defeat and the ratina man noticed gera 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.000
 tina is actually not bad screened 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.380
 tina wants to do nothing to the people it 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.780
 not only wants to protect the two world 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.390
 because in the film was also said that 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.000
 smallest change within the world 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.350
 big changes to the real world 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.900
 bring in the film was the 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.000
 Antagonist Zero is also in the cell wall 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.000
 invaded and wanted from the 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.280
 world from the real world must destroy 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.890
 weakly hit where we go 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:59.520
 fun parents and so now he 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.010
 wanted to destroy the world and so on 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.260
 once seen the keratin 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.540
 Maybe just volunteer in the 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.700
 World is gone is so and so 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.490
 generated 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.050
 yahia and hunters are doing so far 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.700
 the matter that holds it all 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.650
 but walk on the other side if 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.800
 because someone is paying attention and there something 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.580
 then happens to packerin everything 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.830
 a little bit confused 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.230
 that's why I go here now voluntarily 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.790
 since back when my've been living alone for 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.290
 no friends everyone hates me though 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.390
 Anyone could exist for that at all 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:34.470
 and that's why I voluntarily go to the 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:36.720
 server and as I said in the movie you can see 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.150
 the latina was the hero in the end 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.870
 our our friends as it is always called 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:45.180
 had to protect gera tina fey zero 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.530
 or have saved the latina and the 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.820
 routine has then reciprocated 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.380
 Take it with you to the room 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.020
 is and has stopped and zero 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.250
 so think about gera tina 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.090
 maybe not a bad one at all 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:59.820
 pokémon and the ratina go voluntarily 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:04.440
 in the world for balance too 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:06.450
 Keep the world in like that at all 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.070
 So we know the world and pokémon 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.070
 which decays both can exist and 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.390
 that is in my opinion has the 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.770
 earn the most respect and that's why 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.510
 hatira tina is also much more respectful 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.550
 deserves as the old park but the 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:21.000
 idiots who fight all the time because 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.350
 there was also the film with woody here 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.900
 all parkers all the time 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.990
 have fought against each other and thereby 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.610
 it also covers space and time 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.860
 would interfere and came there had also 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.650
 save and then it comes immediately is 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.950
 They also the nicest of the trio 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:42.750
 that's why rob sandy the latina you are 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:44.070
 you are our pro and as I said no 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.930
 news smog and you do that 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.840
 please fallen pens dickens audio please 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.160
 just in the original form of course because of 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.750
 items lottes work consumes it 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.040
 needed then in platinum if so 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.950
 can even keep the shape 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.500
 that means in my opinion it would be 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.930
 a really good pokémon soul and 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.720
 that's why tomorrow will do it for me 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.830
 she wants so thank you and now 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.060
 we want your opinion, of course, the 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.440
 commentary still shows interest yes 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.190
 also for that routine actually 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.290
 a nice pokémon us or you would 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.810
 if he had the opportunity he would have the 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.430
 latina or parker and the league over 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.110
 Run away so I will personally 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.960
 yes rather the ratina on the way 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.419
 run over gera tina for no reason no one 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.740
 clearly in the movie again said that 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.090
 At the end , look for it again 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.410
 after the Allgäuer has made it to himself 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:32.910
 Take a little bit of revenge until I have a lot of trouble 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.430
 must be in rabbiners, too 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:38.370
 but if it is the bill with 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.169
 Do yoga so no world 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.120
 maybe suffers another world 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:44.160
 or so but in any case my opinion 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.900
 after all, the ratina is even an extremist 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.660
 friendly pokémon and all that 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.720
 it takes on itself so that we live in peace 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:54.000
 can in the world of the pokémon and 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:57.120
 that's why popstar christina would have me 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.360
 Almost said the retina christine 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:04.050
 what is going on and as said write yours 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.669
 opinion a yes, and there are always 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:09.449
 great to say on wednesday's 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:11.520
 again gpl fight number 9 if you do not 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:15.080
 really great and i have seen and failed 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.080
 special role a man 70
