four or three little pots together they
look<00:01:50.520> really<00:01:50.729> good<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.060> they're<00:01:51.299> about<00:01:51.390> that

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
look really good and they're about that

look really good and they're about that
size<00:01:52.049> yeah<00:01:52.560> but<00:01:52.770> they<00:01:52.860> dry<00:01:53.070> out<00:01:53.100> they<00:01:53.430> dry<00:01:53.640> out

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
size yeah but they dry out they dry out

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.550 
size yeah but they dry out they dry out
they<00:01:53.820> dry<00:01:54.090> out<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.450> they<00:01:54.570> just<00:01:54.840> can't<00:01:55.140> survive

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
they dry out so they just can't survive

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.780 
they dry out so they just can't survive
you<00:01:55.860> want<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.070> make<00:01:56.159> sure<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.369> put<00:01:56.520> them<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:56.729> a

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
you want to make sure you put them in a

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.969 
you want to make sure you put them in a
potting<00:01:57.090> soil<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.659> type<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:57.960> pots<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.680> use

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
potting soil the type of pots that I use

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.940 
potting soil the type of pots that I use
is<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.850> use<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.390> size<00:02:00.630> upon<00:02:01.020> because<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.740> use<00:02:01.920> a

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
is I use this size upon because I use a

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.639 
is I use this size upon because I use a
lot<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.219> parsley<00:02:02.430> sizes<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> lot<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.719> basil<00:02:03.869> well

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
lot of parsley sizes a lot of basil well

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.620 
lot of parsley sizes a lot of basil well
the<00:02:04.890> reason<00:02:05.219> why<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.790> can<00:02:06.060> have<00:02:06.210> I'm<00:02:06.479> not

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
the reason why is you can have I'm not

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.809 
the reason why is you can have I'm not
home<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.200> often<00:02:07.829> right<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.459> with<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.640> more

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
home that often right and with the more

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.729 
home that often right and with the more
soil<00:02:09.090> mass<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.629> have<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.200> doesn't<00:02:10.440> dry<00:02:10.709> out

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
soil mass that I have it doesn't dry out

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.580 
soil mass that I have it doesn't dry out
it<00:02:11.009> gives<00:02:11.340> me<00:02:11.489> more<00:02:11.760> flexibility<00:02:12.750> but<00:02:13.379> in

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
it gives me more flexibility but in

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.650 
it gives me more flexibility but in
this<00:02:13.709> here<00:02:13.950> I'll<00:02:14.040> put<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:14.550> terms<00:02:14.790> of<00:02:15.060> sage<00:02:15.330> for

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
this here I'll put in terms of sage for

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.030

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
instance you got sage in front of you I

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.250 
instance you got sage in front of you I
would<00:02:17.550> put<00:02:17.700> four<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.269> those<00:02:18.420> six<00:02:18.480> inch<00:02:18.959> pots

yeah it's really important when a

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.690 
yeah it's really important when a
Gardens<00:05:09.960> really<00:05:10.440> well<00:05:10.830> depends<00:05:11.310> on<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:11.490> size

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
Gardens really well depends on the size

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.770 
Gardens really well depends on the size
of<00:05:11.820> the<00:05:11.910> container<00:05:12.210> so<00:05:12.450> the<00:05:12.570> bigger<00:05:12.720> the

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
of the container so the bigger the

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.630 
of the container so the bigger the
container<00:05:13.200> not<00:05:13.380> as<00:05:13.500> often<00:05:13.680> depends<00:05:14.400> on<00:05:14.520> how

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
container not as often depends on how

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.580 
container not as often depends on how
much<00:05:14.820> sudden<00:05:15.180> you're<00:05:15.300> seeing<00:05:15.540> but<00:05:16.470> for

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
much sudden you're seeing but for

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.350 
much sudden you're seeing but for
instance<00:05:16.680> a<00:05:16.980> container<00:05:17.310> of<00:05:17.490> this<00:05:17.670> size<00:05:17.730> if

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
instance a container of this size if

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.730 
instance a container of this size if
it's<00:05:18.510> a<00:05:18.600> sunny<00:05:18.840> day<00:05:18.930> I<00:05:19.080> could<00:05:19.350> have<00:05:19.470> to<00:05:19.590> water
