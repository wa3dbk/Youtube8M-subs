billions in what like one or two days I
don't<00:03:04.200> really<00:03:04.620> think<00:03:04.770> it<00:03:05.010> was<00:03:05.100> necessary<00:03:05.670> for

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
don't really think it was necessary for

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.850 
don't really think it was necessary for
him<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.880> go<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.660> money<00:03:06.989> whore<00:03:07.230> route<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:07.650> just

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
him to go the money whore route and just

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.220 
him to go the money whore route and just
try<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.520> get<00:03:09.270> money<00:03:09.480> out<00:03:09.630> of<00:03:09.750> everyone

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
try and get money out of everyone

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.930 
try and get money out of everyone
through<00:03:10.470> detail<00:03:10.830> mind<00:03:11.100> it<00:03:11.400> basically<00:03:11.700> made

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
through detail mind it basically made

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.870 
through detail mind it basically made
this<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.360> paid<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.440> win<00:03:13.620> game<00:03:13.860> basically<00:03:14.370> spend

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
this a paid to win game basically spend

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.820 
this a paid to win game basically spend
money<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.300> you<00:03:15.959> win<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:16.350> know<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.530> better

than<00:03:16.890> everyone<00:03:17.040> else<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:17.840> for<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:18.900> reason<00:03:18.959> I

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
than everyone else so for that reason I

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.289 
than everyone else so for that reason I
think<00:03:19.410> that's<00:03:19.890> why<00:03:20.130> everyone<00:03:20.730> has<00:03:21.030> glitched

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
think that's why everyone has glitched

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.750 
think that's why everyone has glitched
money<00:03:21.630> it<00:03:22.049> was<00:03:22.170> too<00:03:22.470> difficult<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:23.459> get<00:03:23.610> on

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
money it was too difficult to get on

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.720 
money it was too difficult to get on
