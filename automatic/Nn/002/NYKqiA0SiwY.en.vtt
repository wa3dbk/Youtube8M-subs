00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
better speed is a key factor in this

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.510 
better speed is a key factor in this
choice<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.800> want<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.129> make<00:00:44.219> sure<00:00:44.250> you've<00:00:44.489> got

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
and it has to have a faster base speed

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.330 
and it has to have a faster base speed
than<00:00:48.510> doing<00:00:48.809> their<00:00:49.469> brooms<00:00:49.710> magic<00:00:50.160> type

fantastical<00:00:58.710> call<00:00:58.949> lightning<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.520> we<00:00:59.640> are

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
fantastical call lightning and we are

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.950 
fantastical call lightning and we are
ready<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.660> take<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.370> little<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.699> xufu<00:01:03.270> cub<00:01:03.510> okay

ready to take on little of xufu cub okay
so<00:01:04.589> our<00:01:04.710> strategy<00:01:05.189> here<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.519> we're<00:01:05.820> going<00:01:05.909> to

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
so our strategy here is we're going to

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.539 
so our strategy here is we're going to
apply<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.450> call<00:01:07.049> lightning<00:01:07.320> which<00:01:08.070> he's<00:01:08.400> going

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
apply it call lightning which he's going

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.070 
apply it call lightning which he's going
to<00:01:08.610> go<00:01:08.729> first<00:01:09.000> he's<00:01:09.240> going<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.630> moon<00:01:09.810> fire

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
to go first he's going to moon fire

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.810 
to go first he's going to moon fire
which<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.320> going<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.740> make<00:01:10.890> its<00:01:11.040> crazy<00:01:11.430> healy

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
which is going to make its crazy healy

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.490 
which is going to make its crazy healy
weather<00:01:12.000> for<00:01:12.270> him<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.930> don't<00:01:13.049> want<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.350> so

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
weather for him we don't want that so

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.260 
weather for him we don't want that so
he's<00:01:13.710> gonna<00:01:13.830> moon<00:01:14.040> fire<00:01:14.310> because<00:01:14.729> he's<00:01:14.850> faster

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
he's gonna moon fire because he's faster

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.760 
he's gonna moon fire because he's faster
which<00:01:15.840> does<00:01:16.080> weak<00:01:16.259> damage<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.680> us

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
which does weak damage to us

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.280 
which does weak damage to us
incidentally<00:01:17.460> we<00:01:18.090> call<00:01:18.450> lightning<00:01:18.750> which

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
incidentally we call lightning which

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.749 
incidentally we call lightning which
does<00:01:19.470> strong<00:01:19.770> damage<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.130> him<00:01:20.250> over<00:01:20.520> writes

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
does strong damage to him over writes

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.090 
does strong damage to him over writes
his<00:01:20.909> moon<00:01:21.060> fire<00:01:21.650> immediately<00:01:22.650> switch<00:01:22.920> the

dark moon hatchling and then a flock

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.300 
dark moon hatchling and then a flock
should<00:01:25.020> just<00:01:25.229> decimate<00:01:25.740> him<00:01:25.860> because<00:01:26.100> every

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
should just decimate him because every

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.980 
should just decimate him because every

little extra bonus hits are mechanical

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.149 
little extra bonus hits are mechanical
and<00:01:40.920> we<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.130> get<00:01:41.280> one<00:01:41.430> more<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:42.049> because

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
and we can get one more in because

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.200 
and we can get one more in because
because<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.280> our<00:01:44.369> speed<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.759> really<00:01:45.030> want<00:01:45.149> to

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
because of our speed you really want to

we go okay no more no more hatchling so

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.530 
we go okay no more no more hatchling so
phase<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:53.700> I'm<00:01:53.759> going<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:53.909> go<00:01:54.030> back<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.210> my<00:01:54.390> Yeti

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
phase so I'm going to go back to my Yeti

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.840 
phase so I'm going to go back to my Yeti
make<00:01:54.780> sure<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.079> get<00:01:55.490> lightning<00:01:56.490> up<00:01:56.610> one

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
make sure I can get lightning up one

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.850 
make sure I can get lightning up one
more<00:01:57.119> time<00:01:57.509> maybe<00:01:57.810> not<00:01:58.049> metal<00:01:58.469> fist<00:01:58.710> we're

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
more time maybe not metal fist we're

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.050 
more time maybe not metal fist we're
just<00:01:58.979> gonna<00:01:59.070> do<00:01:59.219> some<00:01:59.280> damage<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.610> as<00:01:59.790> much<00:01:59.909> as

just gonna do some damage to as much as
we<00:02:00.180> can<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.689> then<00:02:01.259> our<00:02:01.500> broom<00:02:01.920> should<00:02:02.280> be<00:02:02.520> good

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
we can and then our broom should be good

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.359 
we can and then our broom should be good
to<00:02:03.149> go<00:02:03.360> as<00:02:03.659> far<00:02:03.899> as<00:02:04.110> mopping<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.770> whole<00:02:05.070> mess

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369

to go as far as mopping this whole mess
up<00:02:05.610> there<00:02:06.420> we<00:02:06.540> go<00:02:06.630> hopefully<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.110> can<00:02:07.229> get<00:02:07.560> you

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
up there we go hopefully I can get you

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.050 
up there we go hopefully I can get you
know<00:02:07.950> hopefully<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.459> think<00:02:08.489> because<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:08.970> my

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
know hopefully I think because of my

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.440 
know hopefully I think because of my
mechanical<00:02:09.629> rez<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.200> might

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
mechanical rez I might

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
mechanical rez I might
be<00:02:10.509> able<00:02:10.599> to<00:02:10.660> get<00:02:10.750> caught<00:02:10.959> lightening<00:02:11.230> up<00:02:11.349> one

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
be able to get caught lightening up one

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.750 
be able to get caught lightening up one
more<00:02:11.590> time<00:02:11.620> I'm<00:02:12.010> slowing<00:02:12.280> them<00:02:12.489> so<00:02:12.610> it<00:02:12.670> might

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
more time I'm slowing them so it might

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.250 
more time I'm slowing them so it might
not<00:02:12.910> happen<00:02:13.090> but<00:02:13.300> at<00:02:13.420> least<00:02:13.569> get<00:02:13.780> one<00:02:13.810> more

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
not happen but at least get one more

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.979 
not happen but at least get one more
middle<00:02:14.769> fist<00:02:14.920> in<00:02:15.040> all<00:02:15.280> in<00:02:15.790> he's<00:02:16.060> down<00:02:16.360> in<00:02:16.930> the
