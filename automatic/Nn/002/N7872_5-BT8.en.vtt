00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
electrical cleaner and then just in case

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.420 
electrical cleaner and then just in case
that<00:01:52.380> does<00:01:52.619> fix<00:01:52.920> if<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.250> similar

you're going to change your pots just
make<00:03:15.390> sure<00:03:15.510> you<00:03:15.600> know<00:03:15.690> what<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.080> resistance

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
make sure you know what the resistance

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.289 
make sure you know what the resistance
is<00:03:16.799> value<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.430> need<00:03:17.549> to<00:03:17.640> know<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.850> resistance

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
is value you need to know the resistance

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.840 
is value you need to know the resistance
value<00:03:18.600> so<00:03:19.290> right<00:03:19.440> here<00:03:19.739> it's<00:03:20.160> upside-down<00:03:20.519> it

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
value so right here it's upside-down it

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.229 
value so right here it's upside-down it
says<00:03:21.000> 500<00:03:21.299> and<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.530> letter<00:03:22.739> K<00:03:22.980> so<00:03:23.790> that's<00:03:24.120> a

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
says 500 and the letter K so that's a

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.300 
says 500 and the letter K so that's a
500<00:03:24.750> k<00:03:24.930> so<00:03:25.290> replace<00:03:25.620> them<00:03:25.799> with<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:25.980> same<00:03:26.130> type

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
500 k so replace them with the same type

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.440 
500 k so replace them with the same type
of<00:03:26.340> pots<00:03:26.609> and<00:03:26.820> most<00:03:27.030> pots<00:03:27.239> cost<00:03:28.140> about<00:03:29.450> you

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
of pots and most pots cost about you

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.090 
of pots and most pots cost about you
know<00:03:30.540> five<00:03:30.810> bucks<00:03:31.079> two<00:03:31.290> bucks<00:03:31.320> six<00:03:31.829> bucks

anytime you're going to change up the
electronics<00:03:36.959> in<00:03:37.109> an<00:03:37.530> instrument<00:03:37.980> it's<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.280> good

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
electronics in an instrument it's a good

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.210 
electronics in an instrument it's a good
idea<00:03:38.579> to<00:03:38.989> snap<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.019> photo<00:03:40.320> of<00:03:40.470> exactly<00:03:40.920> what<00:03:41.130> it

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
idea to snap a photo of exactly what it

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.240 
idea to snap a photo of exactly what it
looks<00:03:41.430> like<00:03:41.549> before<00:03:41.880> you<00:03:42.000> start<00:03:42.239> it<00:03:42.299> so<00:03:43.250> you

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
looks like before you start it so you

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.500 
looks like before you start it so you
have<00:03:44.400> that<00:03:44.609> that<00:03:44.850> way<00:03:45.000> if<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.209> mess<00:03:45.359> up

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
have that that way if you mess up

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.699 
have that that way if you mess up
anything<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:45.930> can<00:03:46.049> put<00:03:46.140> everything<00:03:46.230> back<00:03:46.500> the

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
anything you can put everything back the

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.319 
anything you can put everything back the
way<00:03:46.739> it<00:03:46.829> was<00:03:46.950> so<00:03:47.579> before<00:03:47.820> I<00:03:47.850> take<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.120> pot<00:03:48.299> out

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
way it was so before I take the pot out

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.060 
way it was so before I take the pot out
I'm<00:03:48.600> going<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.840> yank<00:03:49.049> off<00:03:49.320> the<00:03:49.590> volume<00:03:49.799> knob

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
I'm going to yank off the volume knob

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.789 
I'm going to yank off the volume knob

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
which like on any guitars just pull it

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.490 
which like on any guitars just pull it
straight<00:03:52.890> off<00:03:53.190> not<00:03:53.489> a<00:03:53.519> big<00:03:53.700> deal<00:03:53.850> and<00:03:54.500> then

careful not to damage the finish of the

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.130 
careful not to damage the finish of the
guitar<00:04:04.700> here<00:04:05.700> I'm<00:04:05.790> using<00:04:05.940> long<00:04:06.840> nose<00:04:07.109> pliers

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
guitar here I'm using long nose pliers

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.979 
guitar here I'm using long nose pliers
or<00:04:07.680> needle<00:04:07.980> nose<00:04:08.160> pliers<00:04:08.459> just<00:04:08.760> to<00:04:09.510> slowly

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
or needle nose pliers just to slowly

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.650 
or needle nose pliers just to slowly
spin<00:04:10.590> it<00:04:10.739> to<00:04:11.069> get<00:04:11.190> it<00:04:11.280> going<00:04:11.549> and<00:04:12.450> then<00:04:12.510> I

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
spin it to get it going and then I

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.120 
spin it to get it going and then I
should<00:04:12.810> go<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:13.079> remove<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.709> with<00:04:13.799> my<00:04:13.950> hand

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
should go to remove it with my hand

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.270 
should go to remove it with my hand
there<00:04:14.310> we<00:04:14.370> go

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.439 

just<00:04:18.280> don't<00:04:18.430> lose<00:04:18.549> any<00:04:18.759> of<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:18.910> pieces<00:04:19.060> the

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
just don't lose any of the pieces the

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.320 
just don't lose any of the pieces the
nut<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.840> washer<00:04:20.519> and<00:04:21.519> there<00:04:21.669> you<00:04:21.759> go<00:04:21.820> your<00:04:22.090> pot

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
nut the washer and there you go your pot

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.029 
nut the washer and there you go your pot
can<00:04:22.720> be<00:04:22.750> pushed<00:04:23.050> right<00:04:23.259> through<00:04:23.440> so<00:04:23.740> if<00:04:23.830> I<00:04:23.889> flip

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
can be pushed right through so if I flip

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:33.450 
can be pushed right through so if I flip
the<00:04:24.220> guitar<00:04:24.460> over<00:04:26.970> there's<00:04:27.970> no<00:04:28.150> pot

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.020 

and<00:04:33.730> that's<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:34.360> problem<00:04:34.540> child<00:04:35.820> so<00:04:36.820> all<00:04:36.940> that

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
and that's the problem child so all that

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.970 
and that's the problem child so all that
has<00:04:37.150> to<00:04:37.300> happen<00:04:37.420> now<00:04:37.690> is<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.440> solder<00:04:38.650> has<00:04:38.830> to

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
has to happen now is the solder has to

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.240 
has to happen now is the solder has to
come<00:04:39.100> off<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:39.340> back<00:04:39.490> and<00:04:40.330> we're<00:04:40.420> all<00:04:40.510> good<00:04:40.690> and

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
come off the back and we're all good and

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.480 
come off the back and we're all good and
just<00:04:42.250> to<00:04:42.340> show<00:04:42.600> quickly<00:04:43.860> if<00:04:44.860> you<00:04:44.980> look<00:04:45.160> in<00:04:45.310> here

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.640 
doesn't clean it up fully well then you
have<00:05:05.710> to<00:05:05.770> replace<00:05:06.070> the<00:05:06.250> bot<00:05:07.170> so<00:05:08.170> the<00:05:08.320> next<00:05:08.500> step

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
have to replace the bot so the next step

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.350 
have to replace the bot so the next step
is<00:05:08.800> pretty<00:05:09.010> simple<00:05:09.400> I'm<00:05:09.700> just<00:05:09.760> going<00:05:10.150> to<00:05:10.180> take

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
is pretty simple I'm just going to take

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.720 
is pretty simple I'm just going to take
a<00:05:10.800> little<00:05:11.800> soldering<00:05:12.220> iron<00:05:12.520> right<00:05:12.670> here

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
a little soldering iron right here

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.220 
a little soldering iron right here
that's<00:05:13.060> plugged<00:05:13.330> in<00:05:13.480> already<00:05:13.660> I<00:05:13.900> have<00:05:14.080> some

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
that's plugged in already I have some

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.560 
that's plugged in already I have some
extra<00:05:14.530> solder<00:05:14.770> I<00:05:15.100> just<00:05:16.030> have<00:05:16.120> to<00:05:16.210> touch<00:05:16.360> the

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
extra solder I just have to touch the

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.600 
extra solder I just have to touch the
solder<00:05:16.750> that's<00:05:16.990> all<00:05:17.170> in<00:05:17.230> the<00:05:17.320> pot<00:05:17.470> the<00:05:18.370> wires

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
solder that's all in the pot the wires

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.670 
solder that's all in the pot the wires
are<00:05:18.850> all<00:05:18.910> going<00:05:19.090> to<00:05:19.150> come<00:05:19.300> falling<00:05:20.230> right<00:05:20.500> off

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
are all going to come falling right off

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.770 
are all going to come falling right off
and<00:05:20.950> then<00:05:21.820> I<00:05:21.880> just<00:05:22.000> put<00:05:22.150> the<00:05:22.240> new<00:05:22.330> pot<00:05:22.540> in<00:05:22.660> place

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
and then I just put the new pot in place

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.540 
and then I just put the new pot in place
and<00:05:23.110> make<00:05:23.200> sure<00:05:23.230> I<00:05:23.380> just<00:05:23.650> solder<00:05:23.830> the<00:05:24.340> wires

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
and make sure I just solder the wires

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.710 
and make sure I just solder the wires
into<00:05:24.820> the<00:05:24.940> exactly<00:05:25.330> the<00:05:25.450> same<00:05:25.510> location

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
into the exactly the same location

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.870 
into the exactly the same location
that's<00:05:26.200> why<00:05:26.290> I<00:05:26.320> took<00:05:26.500> a<00:05:26.560> photo<00:05:26.740> and<00:05:26.980> then<00:05:27.730> put

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
that's why I took a photo and then put

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.850 
that's why I took a photo and then put
the<00:05:27.940> pot<00:05:28.120> back<00:05:28.330> in<00:05:28.510> place<00:05:28.690> so<00:05:29.320> I'm<00:05:29.620> not<00:05:29.710> going

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
the pot back in place so I'm not going

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.260 
the pot back in place so I'm not going
to<00:05:29.920> take<00:05:30.070> 20<00:05:30.310> minutes<00:05:30.550> and<00:05:30.670> show<00:05:30.970> all<00:05:31.090> that

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
to take 20 minutes and show all that

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.940 
to take 20 minutes and show all that
I'll<00:05:31.960> just<00:05:32.200> do<00:05:32.320> it<00:05:32.470> and<00:05:32.620> show<00:05:32.830> you<00:05:32.860> what

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
I'll just do it and show you what

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:45.779 
I'll just do it and show you what
happens

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:47.950 

all<00:05:46.789> right<00:05:46.909> so<00:05:47.059> the<00:05:47.150> new<00:05:47.270> pot<00:05:47.449> is<00:05:47.569> in<00:05:47.599> it<00:05:47.809> looks

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
all right so the new pot is in it looks

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.989 
all right so the new pot is in it looks
pretty<00:05:48.139> good<00:05:48.349> my<00:05:48.979> soldering<00:05:49.370> job<00:05:49.580> isn't<00:05:49.819> that

00:05:49.989 --> 00:05:49.999 
pretty good my soldering job isn't that

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:51.999 
pretty good my soldering job isn't that
great<00:05:50.240> I'll<00:05:50.809> just<00:05:51.080> stick<00:05:51.259> the<00:05:51.469> app<00:05:51.589> off<00:05:51.800> and

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:52.009 
great I'll just stick the app off and

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:52.689 
great I'll just stick the app off and
stand<00:05:52.249> by

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:52.699 
stand by

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:56.739 
stand by
and<00:05:54.339> now<00:05:55.339> the<00:05:55.400> buzz<00:05:55.669> you<00:05:55.699> hear<00:05:56.059> is<00:05:56.270> not<00:05:56.300> the

00:05:56.739 --> 00:05:56.749 
and now the buzz you hear is not the

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:59.529 
and now the buzz you hear is not the
guitar<00:05:57.080> it's<00:05:57.409> actually<00:05:58.159> the<00:05:58.969> lights<00:05:59.210> in<00:05:59.449> the

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
guitar it's actually the lights in the

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.079 
guitar it's actually the lights in the
room<00:05:59.569> just<00:05:59.990> to<00:06:00.110> shoot<00:06:01.009> light<00:06:01.219> on<00:06:01.370> the<00:06:01.520> video<00:06:01.789> it

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:02.089 
room just to shoot light on the video it

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:04.510 
room just to shoot light on the video it
causes<00:06:02.449> a<00:06:02.479> buzz<00:06:02.719> through<00:06:02.930> the<00:06:03.050> amp<00:06:03.199> so<00:06:04.189> here<00:06:04.460> we

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
causes a buzz through the amp so here we

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.010 
causes a buzz through the amp so here we
go<00:06:04.639> I'm<00:06:04.849> just<00:06:04.909> going<00:06:05.389> to<00:06:05.539> hit<00:06:06.439> the<00:06:06.559> strings<00:06:08.020> try

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
go I'm just going to hit the strings try

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:17.709 
go I'm just going to hit the strings try
the<00:06:09.080> volume<00:06:09.529> control<00:06:15.699> no<00:06:16.699> scratchiness<00:06:17.360> works

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:17.719 
the volume control no scratchiness works

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:19.450 
the volume control no scratchiness works
perfect<00:06:18.169> you<00:06:18.680> know<00:06:18.770> so<00:06:18.919> here<00:06:19.069> we<00:06:19.159> have<00:06:19.309> the

guitar<00:06:19.789> with<00:06:20.149> the<00:06:20.240> back<00:06:20.449> off<00:06:20.719> and<00:06:21.050> I<00:06:21.620> left<00:06:21.830> the

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:21.949 
guitar with the back off and I left the

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:23.379 
guitar with the back off and I left the
back<00:06:22.099> off<00:06:22.309> just<00:06:22.490> case<00:06:22.669> I<00:06:22.879> have<00:06:22.999> to<00:06:23.120> make<00:06:23.210> any

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:27.819 
is with the new volume pot installed

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:30.129 
is with the new volume pot installed
it's<00:06:28.819> actually<00:06:29.089> cleaned<00:06:29.330> up<00:06:29.449> the<00:06:29.569> sound<00:06:29.809> of<00:06:29.960> it

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:32.149 
I still have the same distortion but a

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:34.629 
I still have the same distortion but a
lot<00:06:32.330> more<00:06:32.360> articulate<00:06:32.960> it's<00:06:33.110> not<00:06:33.259> so<00:06:33.499> so<00:06:34.339> dead

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 
lot more articulate it's not so so dead

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:36.909 
lot more articulate it's not so so dead
sounding<00:06:35.149> and<00:06:35.300> muddy<00:06:35.539> it's<00:06:35.839> very<00:06:36.050> clean<00:06:36.319> so

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919 
sounding and muddy it's very clean so

sounding and muddy it's very clean so
I've<00:06:37.039> got<00:06:37.219> it<00:06:37.309> attached<00:06:37.729> to<00:06:37.939> the<00:06:38.089> orange<00:06:38.749> app

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:38.899 
I've got it attached to the orange app

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:41.980 
I've got it attached to the orange app
behind<00:06:39.259> me<00:06:39.409> it's<00:06:40.279> not<00:06:41.029> might<00:06:41.270> your<00:06:41.659> just<00:06:41.839> hear

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:41.990

00:06:44.049 --> 00:06:44.059 
it through the camera volume and it said

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:45.249 
it through the camera volume and it said
it<00:06:44.240> sounds<00:06:44.509> pretty<00:06:44.689> good<00:06:44.779> so<00:06:44.839> I've<00:06:45.020> got<00:06:45.169> the
