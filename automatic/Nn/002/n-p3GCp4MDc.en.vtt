00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
wheelie bar never filled on this it was

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.280 
wheelie bar never filled on this it was
just<00:00:38.730> crazy<00:00:38.850> now<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.629> way<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.110> it's

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
just crazy now the way it is it's

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.290 
just crazy now the way it is it's
basically<00:00:40.500> like<00:00:40.950> pro<00:00:41.309> street<00:00:41.610> we've<00:00:42.090> got<00:00:42.270> to

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
basically like pro street we've got to

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.970 
basically like pro street we've got to
heat<00:00:42.570> up<00:00:42.600> your<00:00:42.780> tires<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> certain<00:00:43.770> point

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
heat up your tires to a certain point

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.440 
heat up your tires to a certain point
you<00:00:44.160> have<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.280> do<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:45.000> have<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.149> keep<00:00:45.329> it

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
you have to do that you have to keep it

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.729 
you have to do that you have to keep it
within<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.690> Green<00:00:45.899> Zone<00:00:45.930> appreciate<00:00:46.620> its

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
within the Green Zone appreciate its

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.200 
within the Green Zone appreciate its
basically<00:00:46.950> what<00:00:47.160> it's<00:00:47.280> doing<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:48.000> game

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
basically what it's doing on this game

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.029 
basically what it's doing on this game
as<00:00:48.390> well<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:49.170> also<00:00:49.320> tells<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.829> when<00:00:50.010> to

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
as well and it also tells you when to

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.220 
as well and it also tells you when to
shift<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:51.030> obviously<00:00:51.449> has<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.660> bad<00:00:51.840> start<00:00:52.110> with

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
shift so obviously has a bad start with

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.600 
shift so obviously has a bad start with
this<00:00:52.289> one<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.620> was<00:00:52.770> probably<00:00:52.890> my<00:00:53.219> worst<00:00:53.340> one

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
this one this was probably my worst one

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.250 
this one this was probably my worst one
the<00:00:53.699> first<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.020> shift

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
the first one so you just have to shift

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.810 
the first one so you just have to shift
when<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.620> gets<00:00:55.770> into<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.070> green<00:00:56.280> zone<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.730> to

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
when it gets into the green zone and to

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.099 
when it gets into the green zone and to
show<00:00:56.969> if<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.090> just<00:00:57.270> flick<00:00:57.510> up<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.960> right

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
show if you just flick up on the right

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.020 
show if you just flick up on the right
stick<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.559> flick<00:00:58.770> down<00:00:58.920> on<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.520> right

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
stick and flick down on the on the right

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.849 
stick and flick down on the on the right
stick<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.359> change<00:01:00.600> down<00:01:00.809> as<00:01:01.020> well<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.680> then

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
stick to change down as well so then

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.260 
stick to change down as well so then
once<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.190> done<00:01:02.309> with<00:01:02.489> all<00:01:02.640> your<00:01:02.820> shift<00:01:03.120> then

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
once you done with all your shift then

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.700 
once you done with all your shift then
you<00:01:03.359> can<00:01:03.510> then<00:01:03.660> just<00:01:03.870> use<00:01:04.019> your<00:01:04.170> nitrous<00:01:04.559> to

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
you can then just use your nitrous to

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.990 
you can then just use your nitrous to
get<00:01:04.830> yourself<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.220> finish<00:01:05.610> line<00:01:05.790> I

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
get yourself to the finish line I

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.730 
get yourself to the finish line I
stupidly<00:01:06.600> went<00:01:06.900> into<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.260> cones<00:01:07.470> heading

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
stupidly went into the cones heading

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.109 
stupidly went into the cones heading
directly<00:01:07.920> for<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> finish<00:01:08.700> line<00:01:08.850> rather<00:01:09.030> than

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
directly for the finish line rather than

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.640 
directly for the finish line rather than
straight<00:01:09.360> forward<00:01:09.750> because<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.320> wasn't

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
straight forward because I wasn't

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.109 
straight forward because I wasn't
actually<00:01:10.740> racing<00:01:11.220> against<00:01:11.549> anyone<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.000> this

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
actually racing against anyone in this

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.789 
actually racing against anyone in this
year<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.570> would<00:01:12.659> know<00:01:12.780> me<00:01:12.900> up<00:01:12.990> someone<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
year you would know me up someone on the

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.770 
year you would know me up someone on the
other<00:01:13.830> side<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> cones<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.479> was<00:01:15.630> a

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
other side of the cones so that was a

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.780 
other side of the cones so that was a
pretty<00:01:15.990> bad<00:01:16.259> one<00:01:16.470> but<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.740> did<00:01:16.920> manage<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.549> max

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
pretty bad one but I did manage to max

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.719 
pretty bad one but I did manage to max
out<00:01:18.000> at<00:01:18.060> 299<00:01:19.049> miles<00:01:19.470> per<00:01:19.710> hour<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:20.610> is

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
out at 299 miles per hour that is

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.539 
out at 299 miles per hour that is
stupidly<00:01:21.479> fast<00:01:21.780> way<00:01:22.470> car<00:01:22.710> like<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.040> but<00:01:23.400> it's

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
stupidly fast way car like this but it's

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.950 
stupidly fast way car like this but it's
got<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> huge<00:01:23.790> drag<00:01:24.150> tires<00:01:24.390> it's<00:01:24.659> got<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> nice

body kit it's got a nice livery on it

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.700 
body kit it's got a nice livery on it
it'll<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.479> called<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.810> customize<00:01:28.259> these<00:01:28.439> car

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
it'll be called to customize these car

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.429 
it'll be called to customize these car
ourselves<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:30.180> did<00:01:30.479> get<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.720> go<00:01:30.840> into<00:01:31.049> free

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
ourselves and I did get to go into free

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.719 
ourselves and I did get to go into free
room<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.650> play<00:01:31.950> round<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.610> was

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
room and play round of it that was

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.399 
room and play round of it that was
pretty<00:01:32.939> awesome<00:01:33.090> well<00:01:33.750> heating<00:01:33.990> up<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.079> tires

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
pretty awesome well heating up the tires

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.990 
pretty awesome well heating up the tires
this<00:01:34.619> time<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.100> was<00:01:35.400> just<00:01:35.520> putting<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
this time I was just putting it in the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.060 
this time I was just putting it in the
Green<00:01:36.240> Zone<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.659> then<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.530> leave<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.890> to

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
Green Zone and then I just leave it to

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.410 
Green Zone and then I just leave it to
let<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.310> cool<00:01:38.430> down<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.670> bit<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.000> keep<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.299> in

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
let it cool down a bit and keep it in

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.789 
let it cool down a bit and keep it in
that<00:01:39.450> green<00:01:39.810> zone<00:01:39.990> ready<00:01:40.229> for<00:01:40.409> when<00:01:40.530> I'm<00:01:40.619> about

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
that green zone ready for when I'm about

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.649 
that green zone ready for when I'm about
to<00:01:40.979> set<00:01:41.220> off<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.640> then<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.060> just<00:01:42.119> tap<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
to set off and then I just tap the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.300 
to set off and then I just tap the
trigger<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.140> little<00:01:43.380> bit<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.680> heat<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:43.860> up<00:01:44.009> again

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
trigger a little bit to heat it up again

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.819 
trigger a little bit to heat it up again
so<00:01:44.970> shifting<00:01:45.540> with<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:45.840> one<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.200> did<00:01:46.439> do<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.619> bad

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
so shifting with this one I did do a bad

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.560 
so shifting with this one I did do a bad
shift<00:01:47.009> at<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.220> start<00:01:47.520> again<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.939> then<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.479> was

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
shift at the start again and then I was

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.270 
shift at the start again and then I was
just<00:01:48.630> picking<00:01:48.930> up<00:01:49.110> speed<00:01:49.350> shifting<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.189> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
just picking up speed shifting in the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.060 
just picking up speed shifting in the
Green<00:01:50.490> Zone<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.960> isn't<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.590> quite<00:01:52.890> good

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
Green Zone and it isn't it is quite good

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.980 
Green Zone and it isn't it is quite good
the<00:01:53.430> way<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.790> works<00:01:53.820> it's<00:01:54.450> basically<00:01:54.899> just

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the way it works it's basically just

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.539 
the way it works it's basically just
like<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.350> appreciate<00:01:55.799> imagine<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.430> could

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
like the appreciate imagine you could

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.730 
like the appreciate imagine you could
probably<00:01:56.790> turn<00:01:57.119> these<00:01:57.360> ship<00:01:57.630> assists<00:01:58.350> off<00:01:58.500> so

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
probably turn these ship assists off so

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.380 
probably turn these ship assists off so
that<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.920> could<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.280> shift<00:01:59.820> whenever<00:02:00.240> you

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
that you could just shift whenever you

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.810 
that you could just shift whenever you
choose<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.930> rather<00:02:01.619> than<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.159> directing<00:02:02.700> you

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
choose to rather than it directing you

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.910 
choose to rather than it directing you
when<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.450> do<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.750> that'll<00:02:04.020> be<00:02:04.140> for<00:02:04.590> more<00:02:04.740> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
when to do that that'll be for more the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.340 
when to do that that'll be for more the
hardcore<00:02:05.399> players<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:06.299> want<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.960> play<00:02:07.079> fern

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
hardcore players that want to play fern

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.770 
hardcore players that want to play fern
also<00:02:07.829> we<00:02:08.190> get<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.459> deploy<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.090> parachute<00:02:09.330> at

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
also we get to deploy the parachute at

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.540 
also we get to deploy the parachute at
the<00:02:09.929> end<00:02:10.050> that's<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.679> cool<00:02:10.830> little<00:02:11.009> cinematic

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
the end that's a cool little cinematic

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.880 
the end that's a cool little cinematic
feature<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:12.599> didn't<00:02:12.989> actually<00:02:13.080> Maxie

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
feature so I didn't actually Maxie

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.280 
feature so I didn't actually Maxie
out<00:02:14.100> on<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.370> one<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.850> my<00:02:15.540> shifts<00:02:15.960> went<00:02:16.140> is

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
out on this one and my shifts went is

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.930 
out on this one and my shifts went is
great<00:02:16.590> leading<00:02:17.130> up<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.490> finish<00:02:17.760> line<00:02:17.910> I

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
great leading up to the finish line I

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.730 
great leading up to the finish line I
only<00:02:18.090> managed<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.360> get<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.600> 200<00:02:18.810> 80<00:02:19.440> miles<00:02:19.650> per

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
only managed to get to 200 80 miles per

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.740 
only managed to get to 200 80 miles per
hour<00:02:19.890> but<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:20.430> did<00:02:20.640> actually<00:02:20.760> do<00:02:21.030> better<00:02:21.300> than

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
hour but I did actually do better than

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.540 
hour but I did actually do better than
my<00:02:21.930> last<00:02:22.110> time<00:02:22.410> because<00:02:22.950> these<00:02:23.100> shifting<00:02:23.430> at

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
my last time because these shifting at

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.070 
my last time because these shifting at
the<00:02:23.640> start<00:02:23.850> was<00:02:23.970> slightly<00:02:24.240> better<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:24.959> all

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
the start was slightly better so it all

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.470 
the start was slightly better so it all
really<00:02:25.290> count<00:02:25.650> on<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.190> first<00:02:26.490> shift<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.360> I'm

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
really count on that first shift and I'm

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.059 
really count on that first shift and I'm
having<00:02:27.569> bad<00:02:27.840> it's<00:02:28.020> starting<00:02:28.350> on<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.920> first

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
having bad it's starting on the first

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.260 
having bad it's starting on the first
shift<00:02:29.280> anyway<00:02:29.520> I<00:02:29.610> probably<00:02:29.819> need<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.060> little

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
shift anyway I probably need a little

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.150 
shift anyway I probably need a little
bit<00:02:30.420> more<00:02:30.930> practice<00:02:31.200> but<00:02:31.800> if<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:31.980> can<00:02:32.130> just

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
bit more practice but if you can just

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.949 
bit more practice but if you can just
look<00:02:32.430> out<00:02:32.670> at<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:32.970> Salt<00:02:33.240> Flats<00:02:33.390> there's<00:02:33.780> so

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
look out at the Salt Flats there's so

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.480 
look out at the Salt Flats there's so
much<00:02:34.140> space<00:02:34.290> where<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:34.980> could<00:02:35.130> just<00:02:35.310> play

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
much space where you could just play

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.130 
much space where you could just play
around<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.970> could<00:02:36.150> even<00:02:36.300> go<00:02:36.540> drifting<00:02:36.870> on

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
around you could even go drifting on

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.750 
around you could even go drifting on
there<00:02:37.350> maybe<00:02:37.800> even<00:02:38.040> make<00:02:38.190> your<00:02:38.310> own<00:02:38.400> tracks

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
there maybe even make your own tracks

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.420 
there maybe even make your own tracks
using<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.750> impromptu<00:02:40.080> race<00:02:40.530> creator<00:02:40.920> so

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
using the the impromptu race creator so

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.680 
using the the impromptu race creator so
you<00:02:41.520> can't<00:02:41.730> create<00:02:41.910> your<00:02:42.060> own<00:02:42.150> races<00:02:42.540> which

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
you can't create your own races which

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.670 
you can't create your own races which
i'll<00:02:42.810> be<00:02:42.870> showing<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.110> guys<00:02:43.200> in<00:02:43.560> another

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
i'll be showing you guys in another

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.040 
i'll be showing you guys in another
video<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.430> i<00:02:44.910> did<00:02:45.090> do<00:02:45.270> a<00:02:45.300> bad<00:02:45.569> shift<00:02:45.750> again

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
video and i did do a bad shift again

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.930 
video and i did do a bad shift again
there<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:46.890> do<00:02:47.040> get<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.280> good<00:02:47.550> shift<00:02:47.760> in

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
there and you do get a good shift in

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.580 
there and you do get a good shift in
your<00:02:47.970> looking<00:02:48.330> like<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.630> amber<00:02:48.989> zone<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.470> you

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
your looking like the amber zone and you

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.110 
your looking like the amber zone and you
get<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.739> perfect<00:02:50.250> one<00:02:50.430> if<00:02:50.520> you're<00:02:50.610> in<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.820> Green

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
get a perfect one if you're in the Green

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.790 
get a perfect one if you're in the Green
Zone<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.630> then<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.110> can<00:02:52.230> just<00:02:52.350> use<00:02:52.440> your<00:02:52.650> nice

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
Zone and then you can just use your nice

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.979 
Zone and then you can just use your nice
on<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.100> final<00:02:53.370> run<00:02:53.489> again<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:53.940> I'm<00:02:54.600> still<00:02:54.870> not

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
on the final run again and I'm still not

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.470 
on the final run again and I'm still not
doing<00:02:55.170> very<00:02:55.290> good<00:02:55.590> only<00:02:55.860> managing<00:02:56.310> 289<00:02:57.090> miles

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
doing very good only managing 289 miles

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.259 
doing very good only managing 289 miles
per<00:02:57.660> hour<00:02:57.780> I'm<00:02:58.200> bad<00:02:58.980> at<00:02:59.130> drag<00:02:59.370> racing<00:02:59.790> but<00:03:00.090> you

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
per hour I'm bad at drag racing but you

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.030 
per hour I'm bad at drag racing but you
guys<00:03:00.390> get<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.750> gist<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:01.230> i'm<00:03:01.320> sure<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:02.010> guys

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
guys get the gist and i'm sure you guys

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.770 
guys get the gist and i'm sure you guys
will<00:03:02.220> do<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.489> lot<00:03:02.820> better<00:03:02.970> than<00:03:03.209> me<00:03:03.360> when<00:03:03.750> you

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
will do a lot better than me when you

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.810 
will do a lot better than me when you
guys<00:03:03.959> get<00:03:04.140> your<00:03:04.290> hands<00:03:04.470> on<00:03:04.530> this<00:03:04.650> expansion<00:03:05.070> so

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
guys get your hands on this expansion so

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.759 
guys get your hands on this expansion so
unfortunately<00:03:06.360> with<00:03:06.870> this<00:03:07.050> drag<00:03:07.260> racing<00:03:07.620> we

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
unfortunately with this drag racing we

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.740 
unfortunately with this drag racing we
only<00:03:07.890> got<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.190> try<00:03:08.340> out<00:03:08.459> one<00:03:08.610> car<00:03:08.910> so<00:03:09.209> this<00:03:09.510> car

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
only got to try out one car so this car

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.900 
only got to try out one car so this car
that<00:03:09.930> was<00:03:10.170> had<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.440> four-speed<00:03:11.010> gearbox<00:03:11.310> now

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
that was had a four-speed gearbox now

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.580 
that was had a four-speed gearbox now
that<00:03:12.150> was<00:03:12.300> pretty<00:03:12.510> quick<00:03:12.750> for<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:13.140> four-speed

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
that was pretty quick for a four-speed

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.410 
that was pretty quick for a four-speed
gearbox<00:03:13.860> it's<00:03:14.340> absolutely<00:03:14.820> maxed<00:03:15.120> out<00:03:15.239> this

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
gearbox it's absolutely maxed out this

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.910 
gearbox it's absolutely maxed out this
car<00:03:15.600> so<00:03:16.019> I<00:03:16.050> can't<00:03:16.320> imagine<00:03:16.470> what<00:03:16.769> it'll<00:03:16.860> be

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
car so I can't imagine what it'll be

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.130 
car so I can't imagine what it'll be
like<00:03:16.980> safe<00:03:17.310> we<00:03:17.459> have<00:03:17.550> a<00:03:17.580> shot<00:03:18.239> of<00:03:18.360> gears<00:03:18.600> that

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
like safe we have a shot of gears that

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.390 
like safe we have a shot of gears that
would<00:03:19.290> just<00:03:19.440> be<00:03:19.470> insane<00:03:19.829> trying<00:03:20.100> to<00:03:20.220> shift

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
would just be insane trying to shift

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.370 
would just be insane trying to shift
those<00:03:20.610> gears<00:03:20.850> when<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.180> shorter<00:03:21.600> turning<00:03:22.290> all

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
those gears when the shorter turning all

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.410 
those gears when the shorter turning all
the<00:03:22.410> assists<00:03:22.920> off<00:03:23.010> as<00:03:23.190> well<00:03:23.340> so<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:24.269> actually

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
the assists off as well so I actually

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.750 
the assists off as well so I actually
got<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:24.780> drive<00:03:24.959> this<00:03:25.110> car<00:03:25.320> in<00:03:25.560> free<00:03:25.860> room<00:03:26.100> now

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
got to drive this car in free room now

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.550 
got to drive this car in free room now
the<00:03:26.820> gearbox<00:03:27.480> is<00:03:27.660> automatically<00:03:28.230> set<00:03:28.530> to

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
the gearbox is automatically set to

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.890 
the gearbox is automatically set to
automatic<00:03:29.400> so<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.000> had<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:30.390> change<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:30.780> to

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
automatic so I had to change it to

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.810 
automatic so I had to change it to
manual<00:03:31.320> but<00:03:31.560> when<00:03:31.829> it's<00:03:32.010> in<00:03:32.130> automatic<00:03:32.670> it

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
manual but when it's in automatic it

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.940 
manual but when it's in automatic it
will<00:03:32.940> shift<00:03:33.120> for<00:03:33.450> you<00:03:33.570> in<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:34.230> good<00:03:34.620> zone<00:03:34.769> so

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
will shift for you in the good zone so

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.289 
will shift for you in the good zone so
it'll<00:03:35.100> be<00:03:35.130> like<00:03:35.250> at<00:03:35.579> the<00:03:35.670> end<00:03:35.700> of<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.030> amber

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
it'll be like at the end of the amber

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.789 
it'll be like at the end of the amber
zone<00:03:36.450> so<00:03:36.630> it'll<00:03:36.780> only<00:03:36.870> do<00:03:37.110> good<00:03:37.140> shift<00:03:37.620> that

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
zone so it'll only do good shift that

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.319 
zone so it'll only do good shift that
won't<00:03:37.950> do<00:03:38.160> perfect<00:03:38.670> shift<00:03:38.910> so<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:39.150> will<00:03:39.299> have

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
won't do perfect shift so you will have

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.150 
won't do perfect shift so you will have
to<00:03:39.600> do<00:03:39.720> manual<00:03:40.170> if<00:03:40.350> you<00:03:40.709> want<00:03:40.890> to<00:03:41.010> absolutely

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
to do manual if you want to absolutely

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.190 
to do manual if you want to absolutely
top<00:03:41.670> out<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:41.970> car<00:03:42.180> get<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.019> best

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
top out the car get the best

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.530 
top out the car get the best
acceleration<00:03:43.860> out<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:44.070> it<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.400> can't<00:03:45.120> wait<00:03:45.269> sit

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
acceleration out of it I can't wait sit

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.850 
acceleration out of it I can't wait sit
I'll<00:03:45.690> really<00:03:46.049> want<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.260> take<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.500> wheelie<00:03:46.709> bar

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
I'll really want to take the wheelie bar

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.740 
I'll really want to take the wheelie bar
off<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.100> just<00:03:47.280> want<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.459> try<00:03:47.579> and<00:03:47.820> accelerate

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
off I just want to try and accelerate

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.539 
off I just want to try and accelerate
super<00:03:49.110> hard<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.410> then<00:03:49.560> just<00:03:49.739> fly<00:03:50.040> backwards

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
super hard and then just fly backwards

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.490 
super hard and then just fly backwards
that<00:03:50.730> would<00:03:50.850> just<00:03:51.030> be<00:03:51.060> crazy<00:03:51.390> but<00:03:52.140> the<00:03:52.290> amount

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
that would just be crazy but the amount

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.810 
that would just be crazy but the amount
of<00:03:52.650> speed<00:03:52.829> that<00:03:52.860> you<00:03:53.040> can<00:03:53.160> just<00:03:53.310> pick<00:03:53.459> up<00:03:53.640> and

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
of speed that you can just pick up and

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.220 
of speed that you can just pick up and
the<00:03:53.910> turnin<00:03:54.329> and<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.540> steering<00:03:54.750> isn't<00:03:54.989> too

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
the turnin and the steering isn't too

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.710 
the turnin and the steering isn't too
bad<00:03:55.410> either<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:56.160> Hamlin<00:03:56.459> is<00:03:56.610> fairly<00:03:57.239> decent

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
bad either the Hamlin is fairly decent

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.960 
bad either the Hamlin is fairly decent
so<00:03:58.230> I<00:03:58.260> fought<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.500> try<00:03:58.769> out<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:58.920> speed<00:03:59.280> run<00:03:59.489> at

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
so I fought a try out a speed run at

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.120 
so I fought a try out a speed run at
first<00:04:00.450> by<00:04:00.690> putting<00:04:01.079> it<00:04:01.140> into<00:04:01.290> manual<00:04:01.769> so<00:04:02.070> I

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
first by putting it into manual so I

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.560 
first by putting it into manual so I
could<00:04:02.280> get<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.430> best<00:04:02.700> ships<00:04:02.940> out<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.209> it<00:04:03.360> so<00:04:03.510> to

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
could get the best ships out of it so to

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.060 
could get the best ships out of it so to
do<00:04:03.840> that<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:04.320> just<00:04:04.500> have<00:04:04.590> to<00:04:04.620> go<00:04:04.769> into<00:04:04.950> these

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
do that you just have to go into these

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.460 
do that you just have to go into these
settings<00:04:05.519> change<00:04:06.209> it<00:04:06.299> over<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.600> manual<00:04:06.989> now<00:04:07.440> I

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
settings change it over to manual now I

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.170 
settings change it over to manual now I
didn't<00:04:07.799> actually<00:04:07.860> turn<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.340> assist<00:04:08.730> off<00:04:08.940> for

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
didn't actually turn the assist off for

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.840 
didn't actually turn the assist off for
driving<00:04:09.570> so<00:04:10.109> maybe<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:11.160> would<00:04:11.340> be<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.519> lot

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
driving so maybe it would be a lot

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.270 
driving so maybe it would be a lot
better<00:04:11.880> even<00:04:12.840> further<00:04:13.079> if<00:04:13.440> we<00:04:13.590> could<00:04:13.769> turn<00:04:14.130> the

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
better even further if we could turn the

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.130 
better even further if we could turn the
assist<00:04:14.579> off<00:04:14.760> for<00:04:14.970> driving<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:15.420> Hamlin<00:04:15.750> that

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
assist off for driving and Hamlin that

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.170 
assist off for driving and Hamlin that
I'd<00:04:16.229> be<00:04:16.350> awesome<00:04:16.650> maybe<00:04:17.160> it'll<00:04:17.370> go<00:04:17.549> absolutely

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
I'd be awesome maybe it'll go absolutely

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.430 
I'd be awesome maybe it'll go absolutely
crazy<00:04:18.269> if<00:04:18.750> we're<00:04:18.900> trying<00:04:19.140> to<00:04:19.200> go<00:04:19.289> in<00:04:19.380> a

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
crazy if we're trying to go in a

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.569 
crazy if we're trying to go in a
straight<00:04:19.620> line<00:04:19.709> it<00:04:19.979> will<00:04:20.070> just<00:04:20.190> throw<00:04:20.370> itself

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
straight line it will just throw itself

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.159 
straight line it will just throw itself
left<00:04:20.850> and<00:04:21.000> right<00:04:21.120> like<00:04:21.329> a<00:04:21.359> lot<00:04:21.660> of<00:04:21.750> drag<00:04:21.900> cars

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
left and right like a lot of drag cars

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.980 
left and right like a lot of drag cars
do<00:04:22.470> so<00:04:23.160> straightaway<00:04:23.940> I'm<00:04:24.210> just<00:04:24.390> straight<00:04:24.960> up

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
do so straightaway I'm just straight up

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.810 
do so straightaway I'm just straight up
to<00:04:25.140> 100<00:04:25.560> the<00:04:25.800> speed<00:04:26.070> from<00:04:26.280> this<00:04:26.490> car<00:04:26.700> is

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.440 
to 100 the speed from this car is
incorrect

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.480 
incorrect
well<00:04:27.570> I<00:04:27.780> wasn't<00:04:28.170> losing<00:04:28.410> any<00:04:28.740> control<00:04:29.190> at<00:04:29.340> all

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
well I wasn't losing any control at all

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.090 
well I wasn't losing any control at all
and<00:04:29.790> just<00:04:30.080> blasted<00:04:31.080> on<00:04:31.170> the<00:04:31.260> nas<00:04:31.440> there<00:04:31.980> we<00:04:32.070> are

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
and just blasted on the nas there we are

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.700 
and just blasted on the nas there we are
like<00:04:32.430> 260<00:04:33.120> miles<00:04:33.450> per<00:04:33.630> hour<00:04:33.720> than<00:04:34.230> one<00:04:34.560> of<00:04:34.650> the

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
like 260 miles per hour than one of the

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.500 
like 260 miles per hour than one of the
main<00:04:34.860> strips<00:04:35.190> in<00:04:35.370> Vegas<00:04:36.060> getting<00:04:36.300> near-misses

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
main strips in Vegas getting near-misses

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.830 
main strips in Vegas getting near-misses
on<00:04:36.930> cars<00:04:37.230> now<00:04:37.740> I<00:04:37.770> did<00:04:37.980> actually<00:04:38.100> start<00:04:38.550> a

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
on cars now I did actually start a

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.450 
on cars now I did actually start a
speedrun<00:04:39.840> here<00:04:40.020> so<00:04:40.230> I<00:04:40.260> wasn't<00:04:40.950> having<00:04:41.100> to<00:04:41.310> stay

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
speedrun here so I wasn't having to stay

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.980 
speedrun here so I wasn't having to stay
on<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.610> road<00:04:41.760> and<00:04:41.970> keep<00:04:42.120> up<00:04:42.300> a<00:04:42.420> lot<00:04:42.570> of<00:04:42.660> speed

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
on the road and keep up a lot of speed

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.780 
on the road and keep up a lot of speed
saying<00:04:43.530> about<00:04:43.680> 50<00:04:44.010> miles<00:04:44.130> per<00:04:44.250> hour<00:04:44.400> so<00:04:44.640> I<00:04:44.670> was

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
saying about 50 miles per hour so I was

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.700 
saying about 50 miles per hour so I was
just<00:04:44.940> blasting<00:04:45.540> through<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:45.870> speed<00:04:46.170> skill<00:04:46.470> I

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
just blasting through the speed skill I

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.830 
just blasting through the speed skill I
was<00:04:47.190> pretty<00:04:47.340> much<00:04:47.550> straightaway<00:04:47.910> up<00:04:48.330> to

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
was pretty much straightaway up to

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.930 
was pretty much straightaway up to
bronze<00:04:49.230> and<00:04:49.500> then<00:04:49.980> the<00:04:50.070> multiplayer<00:04:50.550> was<00:04:50.760> just

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
bronze and then the multiplayer was just

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.850 
bronze and then the multiplayer was just
going<00:04:51.150> up<00:04:51.300> and<00:04:51.540> up<00:04:51.660> and<00:04:51.810> up<00:04:51.930> and<00:04:52.050> up<00:04:52.200> because<00:04:52.830> I

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
going up and up and up and up because I

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.740 
going up and up and up and up because I
was<00:04:53.100> just<00:04:53.190> racking<00:04:53.430> up<00:04:53.610> so<00:04:53.850> quick<00:04:54.150> it<00:04:54.300> didn't

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
was just racking up so quick it didn't

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.630 
was just racking up so quick it didn't
even<00:04:54.810> feel<00:04:55.110> that<00:04:55.170> fast<00:04:55.680> because<00:04:56.070> of<00:04:56.250> the<00:04:56.400> sound

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
even feel that fast because of the sound

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.130 
even feel that fast because of the sound
of<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:56.940> engine<00:04:57.240> I<00:04:57.420> wasn't<00:04:57.870> absolutely

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
of the engine I wasn't absolutely

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.140 
of the engine I wasn't absolutely
powering<00:04:58.770> it<00:04:58.890> along<00:04:59.190> so<00:04:59.640> as<00:04:59.700> you<00:04:59.790> can<00:04:59.940> see

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
powering it along so as you can see

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.700 
powering it along so as you can see
managed<00:05:00.450> to<00:05:00.510> get<00:05:00.600> gold<00:05:00.870> straight<00:05:01.230> away<00:05:01.470> and

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
managed to get gold straight away and

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.070 
managed to get gold straight away and
there<00:05:02.550> we<00:05:02.670> are<00:05:02.790> finished<00:05:03.180> it<00:05:03.360> before<00:05:03.750> the<00:05:03.870> time

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
there we are finished it before the time

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.380 
there we are finished it before the time
runs<00:05:04.110> out<00:05:04.530> and<00:05:04.770> I<00:05:05.220> was<00:05:05.310> hardly<00:05:05.640> even<00:05:05.760> trying<00:05:06.150> in

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
runs out and I was hardly even trying in

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.780 
runs out and I was hardly even trying in
this<00:05:06.840> jack<00:05:07.080> car<00:05:07.320> so<00:05:07.590> I<00:05:07.770> do<00:05:08.040> really<00:05:08.430> like<00:05:08.640> the

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
this jack car so I do really like the

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.370 
this jack car so I do really like the
drag<00:05:09.000> build<00:05:09.210> it<00:05:09.360> is<00:05:09.480> a<00:05:09.510> lot<00:05:09.780> of<00:05:09.870> fun<00:05:10.050> to<00:05:10.230> play

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
drag build it is a lot of fun to play

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.810 
drag build it is a lot of fun to play
with<00:05:10.500> but<00:05:10.560> I<00:05:10.890> cannot<00:05:11.220> wait<00:05:11.340> to<00:05:11.520> take<00:05:11.700> the

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
with but I cannot wait to take the

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.580

let's<00:05:15.360> take<00:05:15.540> both<00:05:15.780> the<00:05:15.960> assists<00:05:16.350> off<00:05:16.470> and<00:05:16.680> then

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
let's take both the assists off and then

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.310 
let's take both the assists off and then
we'll<00:05:17.400> just<00:05:17.580> blast<00:05:17.850> it<00:05:18.000> down<00:05:18.240> one<00:05:19.020> of<00:05:19.110> the<00:05:19.170> main

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
we'll just blast it down one of the main

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.390 
we'll just blast it down one of the main
routes<00:05:19.500> of<00:05:19.620> vegas<00:05:19.890> or<00:05:19.980> on<00:05:20.010> the<00:05:20.130> salt<00:05:20.370> flats

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
routes of vegas or on the salt flats

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.340 
routes of vegas or on the salt flats
we'll<00:05:21.060> see<00:05:21.210> who<00:05:21.360> can<00:05:21.540> keep<00:05:21.660> the<00:05:21.810> most<00:05:21.990> control

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
we'll see who can keep the most control

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.260 
we'll see who can keep the most control
and<00:05:22.890> maybe<00:05:23.160> if<00:05:23.340> we<00:05:23.460> can<00:05:23.640> even<00:05:23.730> take<00:05:24.090> the

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
and maybe if we can even take the

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.150 
and maybe if we can even take the
wheelie<00:05:24.690> bar<00:05:24.870> off<00:05:24.990> I<00:05:25.170> just<00:05:25.410> if<00:05:25.740> I<00:05:25.830> can<00:05:25.980> ask

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
wheelie bar off I just if I can ask

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.380 
wheelie bar off I just if I can ask
anything<00:05:26.370> from<00:05:26.460> average<00:05:26.940> how<00:05:27.090> it<00:05:27.150> would<00:05:27.270> be<00:05:27.300> to

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
anything from average how it would be to

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.300 
anything from average how it would be to
take<00:05:27.660> the<00:05:27.780> wheelie<00:05:28.050> bar<00:05:28.230> off<00:05:28.410> so<00:05:28.890> I<00:05:28.920> can<00:05:29.160> just

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
take the wheelie bar off so I can just

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.950 
take the wheelie bar off so I can just
face<00:05:29.580> off<00:05:29.820> against<00:05:30.090> one<00:05:30.180> of<00:05:30.330> my<00:05:30.480> mates<00:05:30.660> and

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
face off against one of my mates and

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.900 
face off against one of my mates and
then<00:05:31.290> we<00:05:31.500> can<00:05:31.650> just<00:05:31.680> sort<00:05:32.190> of<00:05:32.280> dare<00:05:32.580> each<00:05:32.760> other

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
then we can just sort of dare each other

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.450 
then we can just sort of dare each other
to<00:05:33.060> go<00:05:33.270> as<00:05:33.390> fast<00:05:33.570> as<00:05:33.810> we<00:05:33.930> can<00:05:34.110> and<00:05:34.320> then<00:05:34.460> hope

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
to go as fast as we can and then hope

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.640 
to go as fast as we can and then hope
for<00:05:35.490> the<00:05:35.730> best<00:05:35.910> that<00:05:36.510> we<00:05:36.600> don't<00:05:36.780> do<00:05:37.050> a<00:05:37.080> backflip

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
for the best that we don't do a backflip

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.440 
for the best that we don't do a backflip
or<00:05:37.860> just<00:05:38.100> lose<00:05:38.310> control<00:05:38.700> by<00:05:38.850> sway<00:05:39.120> and<00:05:39.270> left
