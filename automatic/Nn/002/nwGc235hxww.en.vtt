00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
it's pretty embarrassing for the guy in

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.729 
it's pretty embarrassing for the guy in
front<00:03:41.680> of<00:03:41.860> me<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:43.780> that<00:03:43.930> part<00:03:44.140> was<00:03:44.320> fast

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
front of me so that part was fast

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.670 
front of me so that part was fast
forwarded<00:03:45.160> and<00:03:45.660> it's<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:46.750> last<00:03:46.930> round<00:03:47.350> I

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
forwarded and it's the last round I

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.840 
forwarded and it's the last round I
guess<00:03:48.430> of<00:03:48.850> the<00:03:49.209> game<00:03:49.420> i<00:03:49.780> guess<00:03:50.440> i<00:03:50.470> felled<00:03:50.920> some

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
guess of the game i guess i felled some

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.880 
guess of the game i guess i felled some
part<00:03:52.150> that<00:03:52.299> I<00:03:52.359> failed<00:03:52.630> as<00:03:52.840> well<00:03:52.989> but<00:03:53.650> i<00:03:53.709> still

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
part that I failed as well but i still

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.500 
part that I failed as well but i still
get<00:03:54.070> a<00:03:54.100> few<00:03:54.370> i'll<00:03:54.640> get<00:03:54.820> two<00:03:55.000> kills<00:03:55.269> in<00:03:55.390> this

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
get a few i'll get two kills in this

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.360 
get a few i'll get two kills in this
round<00:03:55.690> that's<00:03:55.989> all<00:03:56.109> right<00:03:56.200> then<00:03:56.350> right<00:03:57.160> now<00:03:57.280> it

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
round that's all right then right now it

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.400 
round that's all right then right now it
is<00:03:57.430> care<00:03:57.640> package<00:03:57.940> i<00:03:58.180> was<00:03:58.450> expecting<00:03:58.870> like<00:03:59.109> an
