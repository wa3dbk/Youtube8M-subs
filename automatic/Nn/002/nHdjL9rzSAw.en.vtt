00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.050 

in<00:04:22.690> contrast<00:04:23.410> to<00:04:23.530> that<00:04:23.650> a<00:04:23.949> painting<00:04:24.550> always

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
in contrast to that a painting always

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.240 
in contrast to that a painting always
stays<00:04:25.389> the<00:04:25.630> same<00:04:25.840> even<00:04:26.470> after<00:04:26.560> thousands<00:04:27.160> of

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
stays the same even after thousands of

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.170 
stays the same even after thousands of
years<00:04:29.070> but<00:04:30.070> then<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:30.460> world<00:04:30.699> and<00:04:31.090> the

years but then the world and the

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.270 
years but then the world and the
feelings<00:04:31.630> drawn<00:04:32.020> on<00:04:32.199> that<00:04:32.380> canvas<00:04:32.919> can<00:04:33.160> be

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
feelings drawn on that canvas can be

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.400 
feelings drawn on that canvas can be
shared<00:04:33.520> by<00:04:33.789> people<00:04:33.820> in<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.449> past<00:04:34.630> and<00:04:35.080> in<00:04:35.380> the

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
shared by people in the past and in the

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.290 
shared by people in the past and in the
future<00:04:37.380> if<00:04:38.380> those<00:04:39.070> two<00:04:39.340> art<00:04:39.580> forms<00:04:39.669> were<00:04:40.120> to<00:04:40.210> be

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
future if those two art forms were to be

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.659 
future if those two art forms were to be
combined<00:04:40.750> I<00:04:41.050> think<00:04:41.650> that<00:04:41.800> even<00:04:42.039> God<00:04:42.250> would<00:04:42.520> be

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
combined I think that even God would be

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.159 
combined I think that even God would be
able<00:04:42.789> to<00:04:43.000> appreciate<00:04:43.330> the<00:04:43.690> resulting

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
able to appreciate the resulting

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.680 
able to appreciate the resulting
creation<00:04:47.280> an<00:04:48.280> art<00:04:49.000> form<00:04:49.270> that<00:04:49.389> would<00:04:49.600> be

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
creation an art form that would be

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.439 
creation an art form that would be
appreciated<00:04:50.350> by<00:04:50.440> God

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.350

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
that would make us feel time and

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.719 
that would make us feel time and
