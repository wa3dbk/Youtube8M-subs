00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.190
 and everyone I come back 

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.009
 today with a makeup in the 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.930
 copper tones a little red 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.030
 so watch out it can be scary but 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.380
 do not worry it's still mobile 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.330
 finally I hope I start with a farid 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.850
 standstill at make up for ever which is the 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.439
 number 19 you obviously took the 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.800
 base that you have until they do not 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.289
 that one 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.300
 and ben I cover the whole of the 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.160
 eyelid then they are 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.340
 I love to be serious because 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.420
 it's an egg base or the lighthouses 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.920
 powder takes super well known by cons 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.239
 the beautiful color but we can not 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.460
 too much to wear them all alone because they 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.870
 not really dry so it 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.879
 really have to put something by 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.350
 on it but see the color is 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.789
 findable on the blue eyes it is 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.739
 beautiful this then I took then 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.879
 I came out I found them because 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.520
 that in my move I had it 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.660
 put a little bit with everyone 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.640
 happily my guys for done so 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.309
 it's a little harder to see it so 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.050
 my sephora palette that here you take 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.229
 the one you obviously have and I have 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.340
 used this brown I leave you at tce 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.990
 and this red hop like red maroilles 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.380
 for you to find 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.790
 equivalents to brown dishes ago 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.460
 bobos golden reflections the red there 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.439
 is referred I love it so I took this 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.409
 rice brush the technique I know more 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.630
 what is his name for brown and 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.780
 I have them go on the whole of the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.780
 eyelid 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:39.380
 we can see the golden reflections I find 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:45.560
 these gorgeous and ja cover the base 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:47.929
 down everywhere just so what 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.460
 is with his brush is that he makes a 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:54.020
 little lets him prevent you alone 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.130
 very convenient but against 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.780
 Well, that's because of the standby with 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.409
 my fingers I have people everywhere but 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.149
 everywhere here I stop there 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.459
 then I took another reid brush 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.840
 technics this one lakepa which is very 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:07.340
 thick to mine and standards and 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.840
 which does not hurt to put blush in 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.729
 thousand 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.780
 I took the red eyes and 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:18.829
 I tap the lashes and then 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.750
 gesture we did a little bit up then 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.829
 that for the same blue eyes that the 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.260
 to bring out something 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.099
 for them one for the clear eyes of 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.720
 any color by the way 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:32.170
 so you think I like of course and 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.170
 I also want 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.650
 that's how it looks almost pink 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.090
 in fact by far I find and then 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.000
 I added black in the corner 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.290
 external but then afterwards I find 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.810
 it's a lot less pretty I think that 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.340
 fadil all so I'm going to put less 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:54.230
 trying to act as if I had 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.280
 same time I had corner vela and 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.370
 then I went back up a bit in the 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.370
 hollow 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.329
 in fact I should have put a 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:05.780
 dark brown I think and I come back to 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.340
 the moment t 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:13.730
 with the hot weather with which I had 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:15.380
 took the brown then I took over am 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.829
 there and I picked up the red to pass 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.829
 under the eye 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.080
 after that I took the master 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.070
 accurate from gemey maybelline to do 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.070
 the line of eyelashes 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.370
 so I just board the lashes I do not 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.670
 too big goal line it's just 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.780
 to have a little black the world and if he 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.040
 do not cover all the red but 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.290
 Anyway we add after 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.460
 red do not worry my nail polish 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.350
 it's a kiko I would have to go 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:57.990
 look at the number to yes I have a 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.800
 question for you that annoys me I 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.010
 tried to show you 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.230
 I do not know if you will see there are 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.340
 little bubbles in my nail polish and I 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.720
 want to know what is due 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.850
 because I tried to remove the seat 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.770
 8 I tried to change the top coat etc 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.020
 and it keeps doing it and it annoys me 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.490
 I find it too ugly so if you 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.960
 pleases wood says moss that these say 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:20.030
 me how can I avoid that it makes 

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:23.850
 I take back the red 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.440
 Not at first I took a big flop 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.570
 black with a tiny brush and I 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.990
 blur the line of the LÃ¤nder 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.740
 finally I managed to go over to 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.740
 that it's fuzzier 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.330
 and I did a little bit the beginning 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.110
 from a bottom line too and so I 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.970
 picked up the red 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:58.970
 and what do I do to 8g ironing 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.970
 the red so that they see as a wall 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.330
 it's almost the same on both sides 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.270
 said in this wonderful thing after I 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:13.440
 taken any part enjoyed by the pencil a 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:16.160
 eyeliner of elf and here I have put 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.160
 in the mucosa 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:31.510
 just a little bit a month too the first 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:33.730
 half that and then I spread the 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:37.830
 mascara and devilishly so that's the 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.830
 fantastic bourgeois volume 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.300
 we also go a little bit 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.880
 and the little touch of blush in the 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.620
 hollow because otherwise it's not really 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.470
 a makeup machine games 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.060
 I put the blush called pcci de 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.740
 the seventeen brand 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.530
 it's a brand that we find in 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.480
 england and it's gael who had me 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.750
 do discover that so I think a 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.580
 little coral stake and I put it in the 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.930
 hollow that it does not change much if 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.930
 it's just that a little bit matify 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:23.810
 far who was before and I resume my 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:26.600
 broken fingers'm kind gesture and we 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:30.440
 can all this then I resume the same 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:32.590
 bluff and I'm not doing cheeks 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:39.290
 as it's original 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:40.700
 here I do not put in the minors 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.310
 because well it's not bad 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:47.540
 made on the eyes so we will do 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:50.750
 more softly in quotation marks of course and 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.950
 like lipstick like at ba in this 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.510
 moment when I do the eyes I want 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.570

 exactly the same but it's very very 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.220
 close to a hairstyle that I had done 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.780
 during less hairstyle challenge 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.990
