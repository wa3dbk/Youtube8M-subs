00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 it's the world so today I 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.549
 showed how to install bone x 10 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.540
 10 points you might on your hard drive 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.940
 external before starting the installation 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.840
 it is necessary above all prepared the hard disk 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.320
 or even the usb key 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.650
 so you go into applications 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.640
 utilities and death utilities 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.920
 it's very important it was grass 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.670
 otherwise he may refuse 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.650
 the installation so you select the 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:32.399
 external hard drive not the partition so 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:38.190
 all right above and you're heading 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:43.250
 in score there you have to put here 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:46.230
 a partition and click options 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.879
 the partition scheme that is you 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.030
 fake score sheet guide 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.730
 as he explains it allows for particular 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.199
 finally start the score can 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.940
 start a mac intel processors so 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.270
 it is absolutely necessary this one if you 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.540
 put another partition scheme because 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.830
 of apple scores or so 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.030
 master boot record that 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.740
 will not work it absolutely must 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.390
 this makes you ok rename you the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.750
 score here so go but fell 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.500
 macintosh that's the number to fake 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.630
 not who should buy regarding 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.590
 the format you put I advise you 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.390
 in any case mac extended bone logging 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.460
 is not not what it is tense sensitive to 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.890
 the breakage is not heard on 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.600
 will break it's attention it's sensitive to 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.329
 so breaks the font if it's 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.560
 uppercase or lowercase 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.420
 if you put case sensitive 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.930
 some applications will not install 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.600
 not and so it's a shame 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.850
 is it if you forget so you put 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.490
 in mac os and extended then everything done 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.750
 then apply the loading 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.829
 you have some time facing swaths 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.979
 the type finally the hard drive it's a 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.619
 usb key or whatever we slammed we could 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.400
 see we can see that space 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.020
 available is 114 gia while 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.820
 normally 619 including four young people 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.260
 a small space that is reserved for 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.160
 systems so that does not worry 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:23.060
 so our external hard drive is ready 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:28.560
 and so now we will install osx 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:30.870
 for a 10.10 so go but all the 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.670
 download on the app store or if it is 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.840
 not out yet and he got it 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.910
 depends when you see the video you 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.140
 download on the internet so you 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.800
 click on the installation file you 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.960
 do continue 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.790
 there you have the little settlement I did 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:50.760
 no choice I have to click 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:53.250
 on ok he accepts and so then here you 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.040
 come on display all the disks and 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.310
 you select the external hard drive 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.790
 or the usb key you want 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.520
 install bone x 10.6 then you do 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.650
 install there and ask for your word 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.450
 password 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.800
 cool introduce you do hockey and 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.700
 then you just have to go it's a 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.280
 installation to be done and after as he 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.040
 will tell you but you say as 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.450
 you said the computer will restart 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.630
 it can last between half an hour and 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.820
 an hour depends on your installation 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.280
 but let him do it he left 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.250
 drink a cup of coffee or whatever and 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.260
 was coming back as soon as it's over 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.420
 anyway if for example that for our 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.190
 bread if it's finished and you're not 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.810
 there is voiceover after a few 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.410
 minutes it turns on so your mac not 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.209
 speak alone 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.350
 at that moment you will hear and 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.670
 so that's so if you're question 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.780
 to put them in the comments and 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.170
 I will answer as quickly as 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.170
 usually
