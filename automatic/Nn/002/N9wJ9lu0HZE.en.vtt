00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.160
 hi harris 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.169
 I saw you come 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.650
 I've been worse, believe me 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.410
 they have fired him 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:31.270
 not really 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:34.180
 resign because apparently someone has 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.520
 filtered the nature of my condition 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.760
 tomorrow these hours will come owls 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.339
 the parents claiming they do not want 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.710
 in order that someone like me educate their 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:48.159
 children but dumbledore dumbledore 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:51.270
 risked enough for me besides the 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:53.430
 people like me 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.640
 well partly we are used to 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.640
 this 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.190
 all right 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.690
 what is that disgusting face 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:13.670
 nothing is now different pettigrew escaped 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.980
 like nothing is different harry everything is 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.930
 now very different you have discovered the 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.850
 truth has saved an innocent man from 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.990
 a terrible fate 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.990
 that is a big difference 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.340
 If I'm proud of something, it's what 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:35.219
 a lot you 've learned this year 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.740
 since I 'm not your teacher anymore 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:39.740
 I have the least qualms about returning this to you 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.770
 now I say goodbye to you harry 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.450
 I feel we will see each other again 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.950
 until then 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.950
 mischief done 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.020
 as it is not the same he took it up 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.420
 harry 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.120
 Where did you get out you want to leave me a 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.580
 shortly after dedicate me that I'm alone 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.800
 it is silence to let the owner 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.810
 garden I did not want to open what was 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.220
 poorly packaged and they forced me 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.890
 that nothing 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.160
 and the fire bolt the fastest broom 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.160
 of the world 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.799
 and who sends it to me nobody knows and 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.799
 I came with this 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.880
 as well 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.880
 and to his credit how fast 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.600
 I solemnly swear that this is a 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.600
 mischief
