00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.080
 good to everyone here 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:14.820
 and like I said when we have a thousand 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:18.630
 subscribers and hit a mushroom for the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.240
 channel so nothing say my samic camera 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.940
 the camera that I have one is not very good 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.520
 so I do not know what it looks like it will not move 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.619
 a lot and also good this this I'm 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.630
 living basically a room is worth 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.300
 what I have there for the day is a sofa 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.640
 and for the truth, 102 took his eyes off if 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.960
 well your new camera here I have like this already 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.780
 goes 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.790
 they are added basically because now 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.470
 that I have caught the television is 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.449
 too big and I have to enter the 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.820
 camera because if I can not I can not play well 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.519
 and well basically basically it's 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.350
 here where where I am I do everything is worth 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.809
 we would have here the play 3 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.809
 we would have television we would have the 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.399
 helmets the xra pythons of 280 but others 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.629
 we bought that comparison nothing 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.790
 we could practically say that everything 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.610
 this is new here we would have with what 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.009
 recorded the cat very good capturing the 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.899
 true is to record at 1.081 for example in 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.600
 each key 720 media because the game what 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.610
 lets play more so it's very 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.409
