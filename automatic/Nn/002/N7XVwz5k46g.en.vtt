00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.200 

honestly<00:01:08.400> that's<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.610> little<00:01:08.760> bit<00:01:08.880> confusing

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
honestly that's a little bit confusing

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.730 
honestly that's a little bit confusing
because<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.570> just<00:01:09.659> sounds<00:01:09.960> like<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.110> next<00:01:10.409> round

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740

different than some of the other people
is<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.159> stay<00:01:14.550> on<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.790> bridge<00:01:14.970> even<00:01:15.330> though<00:01:15.390> you

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
is to stay on the bridge even though you

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.390 
is to stay on the bridge even though you
just<00:01:15.720> did<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:15.990> with<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.229> previous<00:01:16.560> round<00:01:16.770> stay

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400

on<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> bridge<00:01:17.940> and<00:01:18.180> then<00:01:18.360> because<00:01:18.780> it's

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
on the bridge and then because it's

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.930 
on the bridge and then because it's
easiest<00:01:19.259> at<00:01:19.409> least<00:01:19.560> for<00:01:19.680> myself<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.490> stay<00:01:20.700> on

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.580 
easiest at least for myself to stay on
the<00:01:21.060> bridge<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.540> then<00:01:21.690> just<00:01:22.080> leave<00:01:22.290> one

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
the bridge and then just leave one

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.499 
the bridge and then just leave one
zombie<00:01:22.830> after<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.580> can<00:01:23.759> shoot<00:01:24.060> all

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
zombie after that so you can shoot all

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.030 
zombie after that so you can shoot all
you<00:01:24.720> want<00:01:24.960> stay<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.440> bridge<00:01:25.590> until<00:01:25.950> you

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
you want stay on the bridge until you

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.800 
you want stay on the bridge until you
leave<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.369> one<00:01:26.399> zombie<00:01:27.300> it<00:01:27.390> has<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.690> be<00:01:27.780> a

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
leave like one zombie it has to be a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.630 
leave like one zombie it has to be a
whole<00:01:28.080> zombie<00:01:28.290> if<00:01:28.530> he's<00:01:28.649> missing<00:01:28.920> an<00:01:29.009> arm<00:01:29.190> he

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
whole zombie if he's missing an arm he

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.830 
whole zombie if he's missing an arm he
will<00:01:29.820> disappear<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.300> the<00:01:30.360> next<00:01:30.540> round<00:01:30.659> will

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840

actually just flashing and this isn't

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.420 
actually just flashing and this isn't
essential<00:02:10.380> so<00:02:10.500> if<00:02:10.590> it's<00:02:10.679> not<00:02:10.829> flashing<00:02:11.310> and

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
do it this way and leave one or two

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.890 
do it this way and leave one or two
zombies<00:02:17.370> because<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.239> can<00:02:18.360> see<00:02:18.510> right<00:02:18.690> here

it's<00:02:19.140> still<00:02:19.530> red<00:02:20.070> but<00:02:20.640> what<00:02:20.820> happens<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.299> is

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
it's still red but what happens is is

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.080 
it's still red but what happens is is
when<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.959> finish<00:02:22.320> one<00:02:22.590> round<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.670> next<00:02:23.910> round

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
when you finish one round the next round

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.580 
when you finish one round the next round
starts<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.600> then<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.900> actually<00:02:25.019> turns<00:02:25.350> blue

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
starts and then it actually turns blue

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.350 
starts and then it actually turns blue
so<00:02:25.769> I'm<00:02:25.860> going<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.040> show<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.220> guys<00:02:26.430> by<00:02:27.030> killing

these two zombies right here you're

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.100 
these two zombies right here you're
going<00:02:29.489> to<00:02:29.549> take<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.760> look<00:02:30.000> right<00:02:30.360> back<00:02:30.570> here<00:02:30.900> and

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
going to take a look right back here and

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.170 
going to take a look right back here and
see<00:02:31.350> it<00:02:31.620> just<00:02:31.890> flickered<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.489> went<00:02:32.670> blue<00:02:32.940> so

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
see it just flickered and went blue so

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.819 
see it just flickered and went blue so
this<00:02:33.660> is<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.900> easiest<00:02:34.200> way<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.380> do<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:34.590> this

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
this is the easiest way to do this this

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.110 
this is the easiest way to do this this
is<00:02:34.890> why<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.160> recommend<00:02:35.610> doing<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.850> like<00:02:35.970> this

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120
