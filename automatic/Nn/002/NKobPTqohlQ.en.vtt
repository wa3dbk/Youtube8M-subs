00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.720 

so<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.170> just<00:00:28.380> take<00:00:28.560> your<00:00:28.650> time<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.220> just<00:00:29.310> go

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
so you just take your time and just go

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.999 
so you just take your time and just go
through<00:00:30.030> that<00:00:30.210> it's<00:00:30.539> not<00:00:30.750> as<00:00:31.020> easy<00:00:31.500> as<00:00:31.950> it

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
through that it's not as easy as it

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.939 
through that it's not as easy as it
looks<00:00:32.699> just<00:00:33.180> playing<00:00:33.510> those<00:00:34.050> different

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
looks just playing those different

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:37.250 
looks just playing those different
subdivisions<00:00:35.430> just<00:00:35.880> simply<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.420> can<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:37.050> saw

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
subdivisions just simply I can you saw

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.750 
subdivisions just simply I can you saw
me<00:00:37.380> change<00:00:37.650> sticking<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.160> couple<00:00:38.460> different

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
me change sticking a couple different

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.160 
me change sticking a couple different
times<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.420> play<00:00:39.570> them<00:00:39.690> hand<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.930> hand<00:00:39.960> it

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
times you just play them hand a hand it

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.540 
times you just play them hand a hand it
doesn't<00:00:40.290> matter<00:00:40.560> how<00:00:40.829> you're<00:00:40.980> doing<00:00:41.310> it<00:00:41.430> it's

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
doesn't matter how you're doing it it's

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.490 
doesn't matter how you're doing it it's
really<00:00:41.730> just<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.090> matter<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.480> feeling<00:00:43.200> and

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
really just a matter of feeling and

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.620 
really just a matter of feeling and
hearing<00:00:43.860> how<00:00:44.579> those<00:00:44.880> things<00:00:44.910> work<00:00:45.239> together

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:45.630 
hearing how those things work together

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.870 
hearing how those things work together
at<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.140> same<00:00:46.350> tempo<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.550> know<00:00:47.640> when<00:00:47.790> you

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
at the same tempo you know when you

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.460 
at the same tempo you know when you
stand<00:00:48.090> back<00:00:48.420> sometimes<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.050> just<00:00:49.140> feels<00:00:49.200> like

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
stand back sometimes it just feels like

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.139 
stand back sometimes it just feels like
you're<00:00:49.590> speeding<00:00:49.890> up<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.100> sloping<00:00:50.460> town<00:00:50.850> but

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
you're speeding up a sloping town but

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.610 
you're speeding up a sloping town but
you're<00:00:51.600> not<00:00:51.750> you're<00:00:51.989> actually<00:00:52.110> playing<00:00:52.470> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
you're not you're actually playing the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.040 
you're not you're actually playing the
correct<00:00:53.040> subdivisions<00:00:53.760> with<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.750> click

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
correct subdivisions with the click

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.040 
correct subdivisions with the click
track<00:00:55.520> now<00:00:56.520> let's<00:00:57.000> begin<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.510> move<00:00:57.750> those

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
track now let's begin to move those

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.639 
track now let's begin to move those
around<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.680> drums<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.219> little<00:00:59.460> bit<00:00:59.670> using

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
around the drums a little bit using

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.680 
around the drums a little bit using
different<00:01:01.649> instruments<00:01:02.550> breaking<00:01:03.180> up<00:01:03.360> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
different instruments breaking up the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.119 
different instruments breaking up the
flow<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.229> notes<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:04.799> two<00:01:04.949> different

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
flow so notes on two different

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.069 
flow so notes on two different
instruments<00:01:05.759> and<00:01:05.880> being<00:01:06.540> able<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.810> move

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:07.079 
instruments and being able to move

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:10.399 
instruments and being able to move
around<00:01:07.439> within<00:01:08.179> those<00:01:09.179> different<00:01:09.749> note

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
around within those different note

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.300 
around within those different note
groupings<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.219> one<00:01:12.090> tempo<00:01:12.659> now<00:01:13.530> you're<00:01:13.979> really

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
groupings in one tempo now you're really

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.489 
groupings in one tempo now you're really
going<00:01:14.459> to<00:01:14.549> notice<00:01:14.789> here<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.420> you're<00:01:16.350> going

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:16.499 
going to notice here that you're going

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:18.709 
going to notice here that you're going
to<00:01:16.560> hear<00:01:16.740> those<00:01:16.920> voicings<00:01:17.520> go<00:01:17.729> by<00:01:17.999> and<00:01:18.359> when

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
to hear those voicings go by and when

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:20.510 
to hear those voicings go by and when
those<00:01:18.899> different<00:01:19.529> voicings<00:01:19.920> are<00:01:20.069> happening

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
those different voicings are happening

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.550 
those different voicings are happening
in<00:01:20.609> different<00:01:20.969> note<00:01:21.149> groupings<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:22.079> can<00:01:22.350> throw

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
in different note groupings it can throw

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.620 
in different note groupings it can throw
your<00:01:22.709> ear<00:01:22.979> pretty<00:01:23.340> easily<00:01:23.579> and<00:01:23.969> we<00:01:24.029> discussed

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
your ear pretty easily and we discussed

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.239 
your ear pretty easily and we discussed
that<00:01:24.719> in<00:01:24.929> the<00:01:25.020> other<00:01:25.200> lesson<00:01:25.709> modules<00:01:26.130> of

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:26.249 
that in the other lesson modules of

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:29.179 
that in the other lesson modules of
focusing<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:26.969> the<00:01:27.179> actual<00:01:27.630> pulse<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.350> notes

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
focusing on the actual pulse of notes

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.129 
focusing on the actual pulse of notes
going<00:01:29.549> by<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.759> note<00:01:30.119> flow<00:01:30.389> of<00:01:30.509> notes<00:01:30.719> going<00:01:30.990> by

00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:31.139 
going by the note flow of notes going by

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:33.919 
going by the note flow of notes going by
and<00:01:31.350> not<00:01:31.619> listening<00:01:32.219> for<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.810> voicing<00:01:33.810> of

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
and not listening for the voicing of

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:35.330 
and not listening for the voicing of
what's<00:01:34.170> happening<00:01:34.529> because<00:01:34.679> sometimes<00:01:35.219> it

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
what's happening because sometimes it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.969 
what's happening because sometimes it
can<00:01:35.459> really<00:01:35.670> throw<00:01:35.999> you<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.329> you'll<00:01:36.420> lose<00:01:36.630> one

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
can really throw you and you'll lose one

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.489 
can really throw you and you'll lose one
so<00:01:37.979> let's<00:01:38.249> just<00:01:38.549> demonstrate<00:01:39.240> now<00:01:39.499> moving

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:40.499 
so let's just demonstrate now moving

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:43.789 
so let's just demonstrate now moving
around<00:01:40.889> between<00:01:41.670> different<00:01:42.709> instruments<00:01:43.709> on

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
around between different instruments on

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.069 
around between different instruments on
the<00:01:43.829> kit<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.609> same<00:01:44.909> way<00:01:45.209> that<00:01:45.420> we<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:45.749> did

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
the kit in the same way that we just did

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.149 
the kit in the same way that we just did
and<00:01:46.520> we<00:01:47.520> just<00:01:47.669> put<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.849> click<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.950> play<00:01:49.950> light

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
and we just put the click on play light

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.419 
and we just put the click on play light
just<00:01:50.429> play<00:01:50.549> simple<00:01:51.380> 3<00:01:52.380> 4<00:01:53.189> 1<00:01:54.119> 2<00:01:54.289> &amp;<00:01:55.289> 1<00:01:55.649> 5th<00:01:56.159> but

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
just play simple 3 4 1 2 &amp; 1 5th but

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:12.220 
just play simple 3 4 1 2 &amp; 1 5th but
trip<00:01:57.029> but<00:01:57.349> to<00:01:58.349> be<00:01:58.499> three

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:36.780 

and

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.170 

1<00:02:37.790> triplet<00:02:38.120> 2<00:02:38.390> triplet<00:02:38.630> 3<00:02:39.260> triplet<00:02:39.530> 4<00:02:40.100> triplet

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.050 

it<00:02:44.180> can<00:02:44.360> be<00:02:44.450> a<00:02:44.480> little<00:02:44.720> daunting<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:46.580> do<00:02:46.790> that

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
it can be a little daunting to do that

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.790 
it can be a little daunting to do that
but<00:02:47.300> it's<00:02:47.690> really<00:02:48.050> good<00:02:48.410> for<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:48.680> to

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
but it's really good for you to

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.350 
but it's really good for you to
understand<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.550> relationship<00:02:50.210> between

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
understand the relationship between

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.600 
understand the relationship between
those<00:02:50.810> things<00:02:51.140> in<00:02:51.410> one<00:02:52.340> specific<00:02:53.210> BPM<00:02:54.400> we<00:02:55.400> want

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
those things in one specific BPM we want

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.540 
those things in one specific BPM we want
to<00:02:55.700> take<00:02:55.880> that<00:02:56.150> now<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.810> begin<00:02:57.260> to<00:02:57.770> add<00:02:58.070> a

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
to take that now and begin to add a

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.020 
to take that now and begin to add a
dynamic<00:02:59.360> interplay<00:02:59.930> inside<00:03:00.590> of<00:03:00.800> it<00:03:00.920> start<00:03:01.880> to

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
dynamic interplay inside of it start to

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.110 
dynamic interplay inside of it start to
phrase<00:03:02.420> those<00:03:03.230> fills<00:03:03.650> in<00:03:04.130> a<00:03:04.580> way<00:03:04.820> that<00:03:05.090> makes

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
phrase those fills in a way that makes

we're going to add in our dynamics play

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.740 
we're going to add in our dynamics play
a<00:03:37.280> little<00:03:37.340> bit<00:03:37.640> of<00:03:37.730> phrases<00:03:38.180> here<00:03:38.390> and<00:03:38.540> there

flows together to really start
expressing<00:03:44.030> ourselves<00:03:44.420> on<00:03:44.989> the<00:03:45.530> instrument

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
expressing ourselves on the instrument

so<00:03:46.280> here<00:03:46.700> is<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:47.300> combination<00:03:47.720> performance

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
so here is the combination performance

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.460 
so here is the combination performance
of<00:03:48.830> our<00:03:49.820> facility<00:03:50.450> development<00:03:50.870> exercises

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
of our facility development exercises

00:03:51.470 --> 00:04:38.230 
of our facility development exercises
one<00:03:52.040> two<00:03:52.489> three<00:03:52.790> or
