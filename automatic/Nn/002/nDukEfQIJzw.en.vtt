00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.559 
let me read that again we currently plan
to<00:02:13.230> revert<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.829> ranks<00:02:14.189> of<00:02:14.280> affected<00:02:15.060> accounts

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
to revert the ranks of affected accounts

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.080 
to revert the ranks of affected accounts
back<00:02:16.469> to<00:02:16.769> the<00:02:16.890> approximate<00:02:17.549> level<00:02:17.879> they<00:02:18.030> were

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
back to the approximate level they were

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.009 
back to the approximate level they were
before<00:02:18.569> the<00:02:18.810> violations<00:02:19.590> occurred<00:02:20.030> so<00:02:21.030> if<00:02:21.329> you

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
before the violations occurred so if you

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.349 
before the violations occurred so if you
were<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.170> level<00:02:22.530> 20<00:02:22.859> before<00:02:23.219> you<00:02:23.400> hacked<00:02:23.700> modded

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359
