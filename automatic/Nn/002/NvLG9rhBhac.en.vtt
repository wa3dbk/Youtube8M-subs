 so it was then look at other things Juan 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.000
 diego tell him that we almost did not find 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.740
 the vehicles because we got to the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.420
 parking lot where they supposedly were 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.590
 the cars at midnight we 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.320

 they counted on the salary they are earning from 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.120
 the new thing that now work less hours 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.190
 because they are working for eight hours 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.920
 initially they worked on the others 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.510
 three employees companies are now four 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.550
 which means less workload 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.649
 We were touring the town of 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.480

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.620

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.940

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.930
 this abandonment in quotes of rosita 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.720

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.220
 with a capacity of 17 tons that 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.590
 they worked last night in different 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.600
 localities of the north of Bogota despite 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.280
 of what many thought began 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.830
 to operate these vehicles at midnight 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.540

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.119
 employees who are working from 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.800

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.200
 soon the car arrived as the new 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.690
 night many people thought that the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.550
 compactor cars had no doors and 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.320
 that in Bogota the driver would have to 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.980
 endure the inclement cold of the 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.290
 early morning 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.000
 when I was told that I was going to close 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.110
 doors I thought it was automatic that 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.340
 I was going to press a button 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.469
 they are manual mechanics without manual 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.960
 according to the operators, the workload 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:51.759
 decreased with the new company because of 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.859
 three workers who collected the 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.700
 waste passed to four with the 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:56.700
 new trucks 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.149
 and the cold forgot no more about the night 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.759
 salaries also increased a 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.879

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:13.120
 to million 200 and a collector of 500 thousand 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:14.560
 went on to win up to 600 thousand pesos say 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.390
 employees that at least in 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.120
 chapinero and teusaquillo the engines 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.980
 diesel have responded but they hope that 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.170
 on slopes such as those of the doña fill 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.650
