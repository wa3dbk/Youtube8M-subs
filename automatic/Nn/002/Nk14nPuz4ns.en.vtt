guys how to upgrade the amount of ram

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.990 
guys how to upgrade the amount of ram
you<00:00:10.469> have<00:00:10.559> on<00:00:10.710> your<00:00:10.889> computer<00:00:11.010> for<00:00:11.280> completely

you have on your computer for completely
free<00:00:12.210> this<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:12.990> completely<00:00:13.349> legal<00:00:13.650> actually

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
free this is completely legal actually

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.220 
free this is completely legal actually
Microsoft<00:00:15.089> allows<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.540> do<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:15.809> requires

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
Microsoft allows you to do this requires

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.109 
Microsoft allows you to do this requires
no<00:00:16.590> downloads<00:00:17.100> nothing<00:00:17.580> from<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.820> Internet

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
no downloads nothing from the Internet

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.820 
no downloads nothing from the Internet
can<00:00:18.240> do<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.570> all<00:00:18.810> even<00:00:19.350> if<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.590> have<00:00:19.680> no

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
can do this all even if you have no

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.040 
can do this all even if you have no
internet<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.220> can<00:00:20.340> do<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:20.609> um<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:21.990> is

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
internet you can do this um so this is

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.019 
internet you can do this um so this is
basically<00:00:22.470> um<00:00:22.980> top-grade<00:00:23.400> your<00:00:23.550> ram<00:00:23.730> so

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
basically um top-grade your ram so

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.029 
basically um top-grade your ram so
whether<00:00:24.390> it's<00:00:24.600> for<00:00:24.660> maybe<00:00:25.470> if<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.740> only<00:00:25.859> have

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
whether it's for maybe if you only have

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.650 
whether it's for maybe if you only have
like<00:00:26.070> one<00:00:26.519> gig<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.760> ram<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.390> know<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.599> you

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
like one gig of ram you know and you

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.120 
like one gig of ram you know and you
want<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.900> do<00:00:27.990> more<00:00:28.170> multitasking<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.039> you

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
want to do more multitasking and you

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.609 
want to do more multitasking and you
want<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.580> upgrade<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.570> RAM<00:00:30.660> for<00:00:30.929> gaming<00:00:31.320> or

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
want to upgrade the RAM for gaming or

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.049 
want to upgrade the RAM for gaming or
for<00:00:31.859> video<00:00:31.949> editing<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.610> maybe<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.000> just

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
for video editing and maybe you just

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.700 
for video editing and maybe you just
want<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.360> boost<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.750> up<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.989> bit<00:00:34.020> maybe<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.469> two

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
want to boost it up a bit maybe to two

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.370 
want to boost it up a bit maybe to two
or<00:00:34.800> three<00:00:34.829> gigs<00:00:35.700> or<00:00:35.910> four<00:00:36.149> gigs<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:37.260> is

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
or three gigs or four gigs so this is

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.490 
or three gigs or four gigs so this is
what<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.710> video<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:37.980> for<00:00:38.809> so<00:00:39.809> basically<00:00:40.170> what

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
what this video is for so basically what

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.450 
what this video is for so basically what
this<00:00:40.649> does<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.940> takes<00:00:42.239> actual<00:00:43.170> some<00:00:44.160> memory

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
this does is it takes actual some memory

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.549 
this does is it takes actual some memory
from<00:00:44.670> your<00:00:44.730> actual<00:00:45.570> hard<00:00:45.870> drive<00:00:46.110> storage

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
from your actual hard drive storage

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.180 
from your actual hard drive storage
space<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.820> actually<00:00:48.180> turns<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.719> into

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
space and it actually turns it into

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.549 
space and it actually turns it into
memory<00:00:50.190> which<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.579> which<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.120> uses<00:00:51.570> for<00:00:51.899> RAM

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
memory which is which it uses for RAM

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.880 
memory which is which it uses for RAM
and<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.460> kind<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.730> adds<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:55.680> amount

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
and that kind of adds on to the amount

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.660 
and that kind of adds on to the amount
of<00:00:55.949> RAM<00:00:56.100> which<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.370> already<00:00:56.820> have<00:00:58.520> so<00:00:59.520> that's

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
of RAM which you already have so that's

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.549 
of RAM which you already have so that's
what<00:00:59.850> that<00:00:59.969> does<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:00.989> actually<00:01:01.230> called

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
what that does so it's actually called

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.319 
what that does so it's actually called
virtual<00:01:01.710> Ram<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.219> works<00:01:02.430> exactly<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.969> same<00:01:03.090> as

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
virtual Ram it works exactly the same as

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.960 
virtual Ram it works exactly the same as
physical<00:01:03.510> RAM<00:01:03.930> inside<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.619> computer<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.640> what

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
physical RAM inside the computer so what

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.550 
physical RAM inside the computer so what
you<00:01:06.060> want<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.240> do<00:01:06.330> first<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.290> will<00:01:07.439> work

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
you want to do first is this will work

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.500 
you want to do first is this will work
for<00:01:07.770> Windows<00:01:08.040> XP<00:01:08.430> Windows<00:01:08.610> 7<00:01:09.090> Windows<00:01:09.210> Vista

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
for Windows XP Windows 7 Windows Vista

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.750 
for Windows XP Windows 7 Windows Vista
and<00:01:09.750> I'm<00:01:10.200> assuming<00:01:10.770> Windows<00:01:11.220> 8<00:01:11.369> even<00:01:11.670> though

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
and I'm assuming Windows 8 even though

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.190 
and I'm assuming Windows 8 even though
I'm<00:01:11.820> not<00:01:12.000> haven't<00:01:12.510> really<00:01:12.689> confirmed<00:01:13.020> that

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
I'm not haven't really confirmed that

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.980 
I'm not haven't really confirmed that
the<00:01:14.040> way<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.369> menus<00:01:15.270> will<00:01:15.450> look<00:01:15.659> will<00:01:15.840> be

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the way the menus will look will be

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.230 
the way the menus will look will be
different<00:01:16.320> but<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.710> will<00:01:17.250> be<00:01:17.400> fairly<00:01:17.909> similar

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
different but it will be fairly similar

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.030 
different but it will be fairly similar
so<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:19.080> you're<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.290> Windows<00:01:19.560> 7<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.799> want<00:01:19.950> to

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
so if you're on Windows 7 you want to

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.980 
so if you're on Windows 7 you want to
right-click<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.670> go<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.850> properties<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.600> I'm

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
right-click and go to properties and I'm

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.280 
right-click and go to properties and I'm
pretty<00:01:22.170> sure<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> same<00:01:22.590> Vista<00:01:23.659> Windows<00:01:24.659> XP<00:01:25.080> so

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
pretty sure the same Vista Windows XP so

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.160 
pretty sure the same Vista Windows XP so
I<00:01:25.380> think<00:01:25.470> it's<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.950> slightly<00:01:26.460> different<00:01:27.170> so

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
I think it's a slightly different so

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.480 
I think it's a slightly different so
once<00:01:28.350> you're<00:01:28.530> over<00:01:28.710> here<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.040> want<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> note

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
once you're over here you want to note

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.810 
once you're over here you want to note
the<00:01:29.700> amount<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.090> RAM<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.390> have<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.140> have<00:01:31.820> 6

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
the amount of RAM you have so I have 6

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.030 
the amount of RAM you have so I have 6
gigs<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.299> RAM<00:01:33.509> right<00:01:33.720> now<00:01:33.900> which<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.380> actually

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
gigs of RAM right now which is actually

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.890 
gigs of RAM right now which is actually
in<00:01:35.220> my<00:01:35.430> computer<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> amount

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
in my computer so this is the amount

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.179 
in my computer so this is the amount
around<00:01:37.079> which<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.409> had<00:01:37.560> when<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.770> bought<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
around which I had when I bought the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.890 
around which I had when I bought the
computer<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:39.119> what<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.299> want<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.509> do<00:01:39.600> now<00:01:39.720> is

here automatically badging file size for
all<00:02:18.879> your<00:02:19.090> drives<00:02:19.269> is<00:02:19.450> probably<00:02:19.810> checked<00:02:20.170> so

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
all your drives is probably checked so

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.500 
all your drives is probably checked so
you<00:02:20.409> want<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.650> uncheck<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.099> and<00:02:21.519> also<00:02:21.730> click

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
you want to uncheck that and also click

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.149 
you want to uncheck that and also click
on<00:02:22.659> custom<00:02:23.079> size<00:02:23.260> then<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.590> can<00:02:23.739> change<00:02:23.950> this

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
on custom size then you can change this

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.240 
on custom size then you can change this
so<00:02:24.970> once<00:02:25.269> again<00:02:25.420> if<00:02:25.810> you<00:02:26.019> remember<00:02:26.829> to<00:02:27.099> note

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
so once again if you remember to note

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.280 
so once again if you remember to note
this<00:02:27.489> Ram<00:02:27.760> over<00:02:28.000> here<00:02:28.180> if<00:02:28.569> you<00:02:28.750> forgot<00:02:29.140> it<00:02:29.230> you

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
this Ram over here if you forgot it you

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.110 
this Ram over here if you forgot it you
can<00:02:29.409> usually<00:02:29.500> just<00:02:29.890> check<00:02:30.069> back<00:02:30.099> and<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:31.000> want

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
can usually just check back and you want

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.640 
can usually just check back and you want
to<00:02:31.180> open<00:02:31.390> up<00:02:31.420> a<00:02:31.540> calculator<00:02:32.019> you<00:02:32.140> can<00:02:32.260> do<00:02:32.530> it

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
to open up a calculator you can do it

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.530 
to open up a calculator you can do it
without<00:02:32.769> a<00:02:32.920> calculator<00:02:33.069> but<00:02:33.610> you<00:02:34.000> know<00:02:34.090> it's<00:02:34.269> a

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
without a calculator but you know it's a

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.190 
without a calculator but you know it's a
lot<00:02:34.840> easier<00:02:35.200> with<00:02:35.349> the<00:02:35.440> calculator<00:02:35.860> and<00:02:37.200> 1024

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
lot easier with the calculator and 1024

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.720 
lot easier with the calculator and 1024
megabytes<00:02:38.440> is<00:02:38.980> one<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:39.459> can<00:02:39.609> buy<00:02:39.670> to

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
megabytes is one you can buy to

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.130 
megabytes is one you can buy to
obviously<00:02:40.209> over<00:02:40.359> here<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.629> goes<00:02:40.900> with

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
obviously over here it goes with

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.780 
obviously over here it goes with
megabytes<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:42.189> what<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.370> want<00:02:42.489> to<00:02:42.549> do<00:02:42.640> is

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
megabytes so what you want to do is

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.520 
megabytes so what you want to do is
multiply<00:02:43.239> that<00:02:43.689> by<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.870> amount<00:02:44.049> of<00:02:44.290> RAM<00:02:44.500> you

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
multiply that by the amount of RAM you

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.990 
multiply that by the amount of RAM you
already<00:02:44.980> have<00:02:45.159> on<00:02:45.280> your<00:02:45.340> computer<00:02:45.489> to<00:02:45.909> your

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
already have on your computer to your

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.240 
already have on your computer to your
physical<00:02:46.420> RAM<00:02:46.629> installed<00:02:47.379> memory<00:02:47.560> so<00:02:47.799> minus<00:02:48.069> 6

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
physical RAM installed memory so minus 6

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.190 
physical RAM installed memory so minus 6
I'm<00:02:48.489> gonna<00:02:48.640> multiply<00:02:49.239> that<00:02:49.690> by<00:02:49.750> six<00:02:51.269> 6000<00:02:52.269> 144

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
I'm gonna multiply that by six 6000 144

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.569 
I'm gonna multiply that by six 6000 144
and<00:02:53.739> why<00:02:53.859> you<00:02:53.920> want<00:02:54.069> to<00:02:54.129> do<00:02:54.190> after<00:02:54.400> that<00:02:54.430> is

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
and why you want to do after that is

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.399 
and why you want to do after that is
multiply<00:02:55.120> that<00:02:55.329> number<00:02:55.389> by<00:02:56.519> 1.5<00:02:57.519> and<00:02:58.409> that'll

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
multiply that number by 1.5 and that'll

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:01.050 
multiply that number by 1.5 and that'll
give<00:02:59.560> you<00:02:59.680> nine<00:02:59.980> thousand<00:03:00.519> two<00:03:00.549> hundred<00:03:00.700> and

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
give you nine thousand two hundred and

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.869 
give you nine thousand two hundred and
sixteen<00:03:01.810> for<00:03:02.379> me<00:03:02.530> for<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.250> it'll<00:03:03.430> probably<00:03:03.700> be

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
sixteen for me for you it'll probably be

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:04.890 
sixteen for me for you it'll probably be
a<00:03:03.909> different<00:03:03.970> number<00:03:04.239> depending<00:03:04.720> on<00:03:04.810> the

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
a different number depending on the

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.509 
a different number depending on the
amount<00:03:05.019> of<00:03:05.139> grammage<00:03:05.500> you<00:03:05.650> have<00:03:05.769> so<00:03:06.340> what<00:03:06.370> you

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
amount of grammage you have so what you

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.129 
amount of grammage you have so what you
want<00:03:06.670> to<00:03:06.700> do<00:03:06.819> then<00:03:07.000> is<00:03:07.209> insert<00:03:07.659> the<00:03:07.810> number<00:03:08.049> of

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
want to do then is insert the number of

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:10.589 
want to do then is insert the number of
here<00:03:08.409> I've<00:03:08.650> put<00:03:09.489> it<00:03:09.609> oh<00:03:09.819> yeah<00:03:10.150> because<00:03:10.269> when<00:03:10.569> I

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
here I've put it oh yeah because when I

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.470 
here I've put it oh yeah because when I
did<00:03:10.840> mine<00:03:11.019> I<00:03:11.260> actually<00:03:11.470> use<00:03:12.370> usable<00:03:13.120> Ram<00:03:13.299> but

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
did mine I actually use usable Ram but

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.059 
did mine I actually use usable Ram but
you<00:03:13.569> can<00:03:13.720> do<00:03:13.840> it<00:03:13.930> with<00:03:14.049> your<00:03:14.200> normal<00:03:14.560> Ram<00:03:14.859> I

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
you can do it with your normal Ram I

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.410 
you can do it with your normal Ram I
don't<00:03:15.430> know<00:03:15.519> why<00:03:15.639> I<00:03:15.670> did<00:03:15.849> that<00:03:15.879> but<00:03:16.030> doesn't

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
don't know why I did that but doesn't

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.960 
don't know why I did that but doesn't
really<00:03:16.599> matter<00:03:16.840> so<00:03:17.160> basically<00:03:18.160> what<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:18.849> want

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
really matter so basically what you want

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.189 
really matter so basically what you want
to<00:03:19.000> do<00:03:19.120> is<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:19.239> want<00:03:19.359> to<00:03:19.419> put<00:03:19.569> that<00:03:19.720> number<00:03:19.870> in

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:20.199 
to do is you want to put that number in

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.470 
to do is you want to put that number in
here<00:03:20.620> in<00:03:20.889> initial<00:03:21.370> size<00:03:21.519> and<00:03:21.790> maximum<00:03:22.269> size

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
here in initial size and maximum size

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.479 
here in initial size and maximum size
and<00:03:22.720> then<00:03:23.319> after<00:03:23.590> that<00:03:23.680> you<00:03:23.889> want<00:03:24.069> to<00:03:24.129> click<00:03:24.340> on

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
and then after that you want to click on

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.089 
and then after that you want to click on
set<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.269> then<00:03:25.930> I'll<00:03:26.079> show<00:03:26.440> up<00:03:26.470> over<00:03:26.739> here<00:03:26.829> once

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
set and then I'll show up over here once

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.409 
set and then I'll show up over here once
it<00:03:27.220> shows<00:03:27.370> up<00:03:27.519> over<00:03:27.639> there<00:03:27.849> you<00:03:28.000> want<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.209> click

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.419 
it shows up over there you want to click

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.720 
it shows up over there you want to click
OK<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:29.049> then<00:03:29.680> you<00:03:29.829> want<00:03:29.949> to<00:03:30.010> hit<00:03:30.129> apply<00:03:30.370> for<00:03:30.639> me

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
OK and then you want to hit apply for me

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.159 
OK and then you want to hit apply for me
doesn't<00:03:30.910> show<00:03:31.120> because<00:03:31.419> that<00:03:31.629> already<00:03:31.870> had

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:32.169 
doesn't show because that already had

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.099 
doesn't show because that already had
the<00:03:32.199> violence<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:33.310> then<00:03:33.489> okay<00:03:33.910> apply<00:03:34.840> and

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
the violence and then okay apply and

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:36.869 
the violence and then okay apply and
then<00:03:35.290> okay<00:03:35.769> for<00:03:36.250> most<00:03:36.430> of<00:03:36.579> you'll<00:03:36.669> probably

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 
then okay for most of you'll probably

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:38.970 
then okay for most of you'll probably
already<00:03:37.359> have<00:03:37.690> apply<00:03:37.989> selected<00:03:38.650> on<00:03:38.769> this

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
already have apply selected on this

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.099 
already have apply selected on this
window<00:03:39.250> we<00:03:39.760> want<00:03:39.849> hit<00:03:40.060> apply<00:03:40.599> and<00:03:40.690> then<00:03:40.870> okay

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
window we want hit apply and then okay

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.400 
window we want hit apply and then okay
if<00:03:41.169> it<00:03:41.290> doesn't<00:03:41.620> and<00:03:41.799> then<00:03:43.169> that's<00:03:44.169> pretty

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
if it doesn't and then that's pretty

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.170 
if it doesn't and then that's pretty
much<00:03:44.530> it<00:03:44.709> for<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.889> tutorial<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:45.609> if<00:03:45.910> you<00:03:45.940> want

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
much it for the tutorial and if you want

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.349 
much it for the tutorial and if you want
to<00:03:46.269> see<00:03:46.389> how<00:03:46.569> much<00:03:46.690> RAM<00:03:46.900> you<00:03:46.930> already<00:03:47.319> have<00:03:47.500> the

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
to see how much RAM you already have the

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.300 
to see how much RAM you already have the
demand<00:03:49.359> around<00:03:49.629> which<00:03:49.720> we<00:03:49.810> have<00:03:49.900> now<00:03:50.310> what

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
demand around which we have now what

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.789 
demand around which we have now what
I'll<00:03:51.430> do<00:03:51.790> is<00:03:51.819> not<00:03:52.209> doug<00:03:52.419> 216<00:03:53.290> you<00:03:53.500> want<00:03:53.680> to

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
I'll do is not doug 216 you want to

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.990 
I'll do is not doug 216 you want to
divide<00:03:54.280> that<00:03:54.549> by<00:03:55.560> 1024<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.919> now<00:03:57.609> I<00:03:57.639> actually

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
divide that by 1024 and now I actually

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.780 
divide that by 1024 and now I actually
have<00:03:58.209> nine<00:03:58.569> gigs<00:03:59.019> of<00:03:59.169> ram<00:03:59.409> so<00:03:59.560> I<00:03:59.620> did<00:03:59.859> look<00:04:00.579> not

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
have nine gigs of ram so I did look not

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.240 
have nine gigs of ram so I did look not
for<00:04:00.819> three<00:04:01.599> gigs<00:04:01.870> of<00:04:02.019> ram<00:04:02.199> on<00:04:02.440> to<00:04:02.650> my<00:04:02.739> computer

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
for three gigs of ram on to my computer

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.460 
for three gigs of ram on to my computer
so<00:04:03.510> it's<00:04:04.510> pretty<00:04:04.720> helpful<00:04:04.930> if<00:04:05.169> you<00:04:05.260> want<00:04:05.409> to

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
so it's pretty helpful if you want to

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.599 
so it's pretty helpful if you want to
just<00:04:05.650> boost<00:04:05.769> the<00:04:05.980> performance<00:04:06.459> of<00:04:06.579> your

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
just boost the performance of your

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.479 
just boost the performance of your
computer<00:04:06.730> so<00:04:07.329> the<00:04:07.870> most<00:04:08.019> likely<00:04:08.139> a<00:04:08.650> upgrade

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
computer so the most likely a upgrade

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.770 
computer so the most likely a upgrade
three<00:04:09.790> gigs<00:04:10.000> of<00:04:10.120> ram<00:04:10.329> so<00:04:10.620> it's<00:04:11.620> pretty<00:04:11.769> nice<00:04:12.010> so

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
three gigs of ram so it's pretty nice so

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.250 
three gigs of ram so it's pretty nice so
it's<00:04:13.780> really<00:04:13.959> helpful<00:04:14.639> well<00:04:15.639> and<00:04:15.879> one<00:04:16.510> after

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
it's really helpful well and one after

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.449 
it's really helpful well and one after
you<00:04:17.349> do<00:04:17.470> this<00:04:17.590> it'll<00:04:17.769> probably<00:04:17.829> ask<00:04:18.220> you<00:04:18.430> to

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
you do this it'll probably ask you to

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.800 
you do this it'll probably ask you to
restart<00:04:18.880> your<00:04:18.970> computer<00:04:19.150> and<00:04:19.599> you're<00:04:19.690> going

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
restart your computer and you're going

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.180 
restart your computer and you're going
to<00:04:19.870> have<00:04:19.959> to<00:04:20.049> restart<00:04:20.440> it<00:04:20.560> for<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:20.799> thing<00:04:21.070> to

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
to have to restart it for the thing to

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.219 
to have to restart it for the thing to
actually<00:04:21.489> come<00:04:21.609> into<00:04:21.729> place<00:04:21.940> now<00:04:22.750> will<00:04:23.050> not

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
actually come into place now will not

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.330 
actually come into place now will not
show<00:04:23.590> up<00:04:23.830> over<00:04:24.099> here<00:04:24.460> because<00:04:25.210> over<00:04:25.719> here

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
show up over here because over here

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.920 
show up over here because over here
we<00:04:26.460> show<00:04:26.610> up<00:04:26.699> the<00:04:27.180> actual<00:04:27.449> around<00:04:27.720> because

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
we show up the actual around because

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.659 
we show up the actual around because
this<00:04:28.050> is<00:04:28.110> this<00:04:28.440> is<00:04:28.500> installed<00:04:28.949> memory<00:04:29.340> inside

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
this is this is installed memory inside

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.400 
this is this is installed memory inside
your<00:04:29.880> actual<00:04:30.330> computers<00:04:30.840> not<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.199> amount

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
your actual computers not the amount

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.110 
your actual computers not the amount
around<00:04:31.530> which<00:04:31.740> you<00:04:31.830> actually<00:04:32.010> have<00:04:32.370> it's<00:04:32.970> the

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
around which you actually have it's the

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.600 
around which you actually have it's the
it's<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:33.750> ram<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.530> ram<00:04:34.560> thing<00:04:35.100> installed

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
it's the ram the ram thing installed

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.060 
it's the ram the ram thing installed
into<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.030> actual<00:04:36.449> computer<00:04:36.840> virtual<00:04:37.650> Ram<00:04:37.889> is

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
into the actual computer virtual Ram is

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.950 
into the actual computer virtual Ram is
basically<00:04:38.430> all<00:04:38.729> the<00:04:39.030> RAM<00:04:39.210> which<00:04:39.419> is<00:04:39.449> what<00:04:39.810> your

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
basically all the RAM which is what your

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.020 
basically all the RAM which is what your
computer<00:04:40.320> is<00:04:40.380> actually<00:04:40.530> using<00:04:41.040> so<00:04:41.220> for<00:04:41.790> in<00:04:41.910> my

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
computer is actually using so for in my

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.629 
computer is actually using so for in my
case<00:04:42.060> it<00:04:42.479> would<00:04:42.570> be<00:04:42.720> nine<00:04:42.990> and<00:04:43.430> for<00:04:44.430> you<00:04:44.520> it's

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
case it would be nine and for you it's

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:45.770 
case it would be nine and for you it's
probably<00:04:44.729> going<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.060> be<00:04:45.120> a<00:04:45.150> bit<00:04:45.300> different<00:04:45.479> but

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
probably going to be a bit different but

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.990 
probably going to be a bit different but
depending<00:04:46.410> on<00:04:46.500> the<00:04:46.560> mantra<00:04:46.919> I'm<00:04:47.010> Jeff<00:04:47.280> but

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
depending on the mantra I'm Jeff but

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.280 
depending on the mantra I'm Jeff but
yeah<00:04:48.360> that's<00:04:48.510> pretty<00:04:48.720> much<00:04:48.810> it<00:04:49.050> for<00:04:49.199> this

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
yeah that's pretty much it for this

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.590 
yeah that's pretty much it for this
tutorial<00:04:49.860> if<00:04:50.699> you<00:04:51.210> found<00:04:51.389> this<00:04:51.540> helpful
