thing<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.750> don't<00:00:48.840> really<00:00:48.930> mean<00:00:49.170> there's<00:00:49.350> a

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
thing I don't really mean there's a

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.410 
thing I don't really mean there's a
actual<00:00:50.070> rotation<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.760> should<00:00:50.910> be<00:00:51.000> following

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
actual rotation you should be following

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.560 
actual rotation you should be following
in<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.660> game<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:52.559> melee<00:00:53.160> should<00:00:53.789> be<00:00:54.090> part<00:00:54.449> of

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
in this game but melee should be part of

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.209 
in this game but melee should be part of
that<00:00:54.780> because<00:00:55.230> melee<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.800> one<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.070> most

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
that because melee is one of the most

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.680 
that because melee is one of the most
damaging<00:00:56.489> things<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.300> entire<00:00:57.629> game

why<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.570> important<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.079> supplement

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
why it's so important to supplement

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.770 
why it's so important to supplement
something<00:01:47.040> like<00:01:47.250> KGB<00:01:47.790> into<00:01:48.149> your<00:01:48.390> minigun

gloves

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.940 
gloves
think<00:01:53.490> about<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:54.000> ten<00:01:54.360> seconds<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:55.439> ten

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
think about that in ten seconds in ten

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.130 
think about that in ten seconds in ten
seconds<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.549> swing<00:01:56.880> about<00:01:57.060> every<00:01:57.420> one<00:01:57.659> second

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
seconds you swing about every one second

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.899 
seconds you swing about every one second
with<00:01:58.259> those<00:01:58.409> gloves<00:01:58.649> you're<00:01:59.460> talking<00:01:59.820> about

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
with those gloves you're talking about

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.679 
with those gloves you're talking about
like<00:02:00.290> 2,000<00:02:01.290> damage<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:02.130> ten<00:02:02.700> seconds<00:02:03.240> that's

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
like 2,000 damage in ten seconds that's

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.170 
like 2,000 damage in ten seconds that's
enough<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.110> get<00:02:04.290> rid<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.590> an<00:02:04.920> entire<00:02:05.100> team<00:02:05.909> of

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
enough to get rid of an entire team of

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.350 
enough to get rid of an entire team of
ten<00:02:06.570> people<00:02:07.020> two<00:02:07.920> times<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.520> mean<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.119> depends

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
ten people two times I mean it depends

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.820 
ten people two times I mean it depends
on<00:02:09.479> their<00:02:09.599> classes<00:02:09.989> they're<00:02:10.110> using<00:02:10.470> but<00:02:10.649> I

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
on their classes they're using but I

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.710 
on their classes they're using but I
mean<00:02:11.459> you're<00:02:11.730> talking<00:02:11.849> about<00:02:12.060> destroying<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
mean you're talking about destroying the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.820 
mean you're talking about destroying the
entire<00:02:12.959> team<00:02:13.230> if<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:13.590> can

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
entire team if you can

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.290 
entire team if you can
behind<00:02:14.130> them<00:02:14.280> on<00:02:14.430> something<00:02:14.640> like<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.820> cart<00:02:15.090> on

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
behind them on something like a cart on

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.060 
behind them on something like a cart on
a<00:02:15.540> payload<00:02:15.960> card<00:02:16.170> everyone's<00:02:16.470> stuffed<00:02:16.740> on<00:02:16.890> it

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
a payload card everyone's stuffed on it

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.690 
a payload card everyone's stuffed on it
you<00:02:17.400> could<00:02:17.520> just<00:02:18.350> one-two-three<00:02:19.350> it's

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
you could just one-two-three it's

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.770 
you could just one-two-three it's
ridiculous<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:20.880> if<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.150> would<00:02:21.330> say<00:02:21.480> it's<00:02:21.630> even

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
ridiculous and if I would say it's even

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.830 
ridiculous and if I would say it's even
more<00:02:22.110> powerful<00:02:22.650> than<00:02:23.220> most<00:02:23.610> of<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.210> items<00:02:24.600> in

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
more powerful than most of the items in

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.320 
more powerful than most of the items in
this<00:02:25.170> game<00:02:25.500> specifically<00:02:26.370> because<00:02:26.640> all<00:02:27.180> you

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
this game specifically because all you

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.660 
this game specifically because all you
got<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.540> do<00:02:27.630> is<00:02:27.750> face<00:02:28.080> stab<00:02:28.410> people<00:02:28.860> that's<00:02:29.490> it

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
got to do is face stab people that's it

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.370 
got to do is face stab people that's it
you<00:02:30.120> just<00:02:30.270> walk<00:02:30.360> up<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.660> people<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.080> click<00:02:31.200> on

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
you just walk up to people and click on

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.960 
you just walk up to people and click on
their<00:02:31.530> face<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.100> they're<00:02:32.310> instantly<00:02:32.850> gonna

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
their face and they're instantly gonna

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.660 
their face and they're instantly gonna
explode<00:02:33.510> they're<00:02:33.750> just<00:02:34.170> gonna<00:02:34.260> die<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:34.950> it's

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
explode they're just gonna die so it's

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.970 
explode they're just gonna die so it's
really<00:02:36.030> worth<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.630> put<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:36.960> on<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.440> any

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
really worth it to put this on and any

really worth it to put this on and any
of<00:02:38.160> those<00:02:38.280> type<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:38.670> things<00:02:38.820> you<00:02:38.880> put<00:02:39.120> on<00:02:39.150> the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
of those type of things you put on the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.250 
of those type of things you put on the

philosophy can be put into place you

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.550 
philosophy can be put into place you
just<00:02:45.240> walk<00:02:45.390> around<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.780> he<00:02:45.900> just<00:02:45.930> doesn't

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
just walk around and he just doesn't

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.600 
just walk around and he just doesn't
matter<00:02:46.740> if<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:46.950> hit<00:02:47.070> him<00:02:47.160> in<00:02:47.190> their<00:02:47.340> back

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
matter if you hit him in their back

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
their shoulder they have bought their

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.540 
their shoulder they have bought their
balls<00:02:49.380> like<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.770> you<00:02:49.920> just<00:02:49.950> have<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.280> hit<00:02:50.370> them

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
balls like it you just have to hit them

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.760 
balls like it you just have to hit them
once<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.150> they're<00:02:51.570> just<00:02:51.720> gonna<00:02:51.840> be<00:02:52.170> gone

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
once and they're just gonna be gone

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.220 
once and they're just gonna be gone
you'll<00:02:53.160> see<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.459> in<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.610> kill<00:02:53.760> feed<00:02:54.140> but<00:02:55.140> the

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
you'll see it in the kill feed but the

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.480 
you'll see it in the kill feed but the
reason<00:02:55.470> why<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.620> bring<00:02:55.860> this<00:02:56.010> up<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.310> talk

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
reason why I bring this up and I talk

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.970 
reason why I bring this up and I talk
about<00:02:56.610> supplementing<00:02:57.450> this<00:02:57.660> in<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.200> finding

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
about supplementing this in and finding

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.920 
about supplementing this in and finding
the<00:02:59.070> right<00:02:59.250> times<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.910> use<00:03:00.150> these<00:03:00.360> items<00:03:00.570> is

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
the right times to use these items is

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.570 
the right times to use these items is
because<00:03:01.500> we've<00:03:01.680> all<00:03:01.860> seen<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.280> heavies

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
because we've all seen the heavies

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.030 
because we've all seen the heavies
running<00:03:03.270> around<00:03:03.360> with<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.750> KGB's<00:03:04.320> only<00:03:04.830> and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
running around with the KGB's only and

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.949 
running around with the KGB's only and
then<00:03:05.580> they<00:03:05.820> just<00:03:06.000> get<00:03:06.150> smashed<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.780> they<00:03:06.840> get

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
then they just get smashed and they get

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.240 
then they just get smashed and they get
exploded<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:07.590> they<00:03:07.650> don't<00:03:07.800> really<00:03:07.890> do<00:03:08.100> that

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
exploded and they don't really do that

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.100 
exploded and they don't really do that
much<00:03:08.310> damage<00:03:08.520> maybe<00:03:09.390> they'll<00:03:09.600> go<00:03:09.720> on<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.900> quick

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
much damage maybe they'll go on a quick

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.080 
much damage maybe they'll go on a quick
little<00:03:10.410> string<00:03:10.709> or<00:03:10.890> two<00:03:11.100> maybe<00:03:11.730> they'll<00:03:11.910> kill

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
little string or two maybe they'll kill

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.610 
little string or two maybe they'll kill
one<00:03:12.330> or<00:03:12.360> two<00:03:12.480> people<00:03:12.840> in<00:03:13.020> a<00:03:13.110> row<00:03:13.230> or<00:03:13.410> something

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
one or two people in a row or something

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.530 
one or two people in a row or something
like<00:03:13.709> that<00:03:13.770> get<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.070> few<00:03:14.280> points<00:03:14.430> but<00:03:15.030> if<00:03:15.300> you

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
like that get a few points but if you

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.030 
like that get a few points but if you
supplement<00:03:15.900> those<00:03:16.260> things<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:16.830> you<00:03:16.890> make

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
supplement those things and you make

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.979 
supplement those things and you make
people<00:03:17.220> not<00:03:17.520> sure<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.209> unaware<00:03:18.660> of<00:03:18.840> when

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
people not sure and unaware of when

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.110 
people not sure and unaware of when
you're<00:03:19.140> going<00:03:19.380> to<00:03:19.500> use<00:03:19.769> them<00:03:20.070> that's<00:03:20.730> when<00:03:21.030> you

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
you're going to use them that's when you
