00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
Bible during the Reformation when

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.310 
Bible during the Reformation when
Protestants<00:02:27.240> showed<00:02:27.420> an<00:02:27.540> increasing<00:02:28.110> concern

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
Protestants showed an increasing concern

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.740

for<00:02:28.860> fidelity<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.820> literal<00:02:30.240> meaning<00:02:30.630> of

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
for fidelity to the literal meaning of

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.910 
for fidelity to the literal meaning of
Scripture<00:02:31.430> now<00:02:32.430> yeah<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.910> seems<00:02:33.180> odd<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:34.410> a

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
Scripture now yeah it seems odd that a

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.970 
Scripture now yeah it seems odd that a
so-called<00:02:35.730> Christian<00:02:36.420> leader<00:02:36.660> would<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:37.800> and

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
so-called Christian leader would it and

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.110 
so-called Christian leader would it and
by<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.160> way<00:02:38.340> john<00:02:38.580> paul<00:02:38.790> ii<00:02:38.940> was<00:02:39.090> just

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
by the way john paul ii was just

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.390 
by the way john paul ii was just
canonized<00:02:39.840> as<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.140> saint<00:02:40.170> by<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.830> vatican<00:02:41.250> and

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
canonized as a saint by the vatican and

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.700 
canonized as a saint by the vatican and
it<00:02:42.060> just<00:02:42.270> seems<00:02:42.450> odd<00:02:42.660> that<00:02:42.720> he<00:02:43.170> would<00:02:43.200> declare

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
it just seems odd that he would declare

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.770 
it just seems odd that he would declare
it<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.310> be<00:02:44.460> dangerous<00:02:44.700> for<00:02:45.240> you<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.630> believe

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
it to be dangerous for you to believe

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.810 
it to be dangerous for you to believe
the<00:02:46.110> bible<00:02:46.440> as<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.710> is<00:02:46.830> written<00:02:46.980> but<00:02:47.250> prophecy

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
the bible as it is written but prophecy

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.880 
the bible as it is written but prophecy
does<00:02:48.000> define<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.630> Pope's<00:02:48.840> as<00:02:49.050> antichrist<00:02:49.620> so

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
does define the Pope's as antichrist so

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.160 
does define the Pope's as antichrist so
this<00:02:50.160> is<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.430> be<00:02:50.520> expected<00:02:50.670> I<00:02:51.210> also<00:02:51.900> have<00:02:52.140> a
