00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
 what happens champions today we will talk about the 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.210
 champions with life worth 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.320
 We started talking to them, Juan Arrom, and he's 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.000
 my side is guille gonzález and our 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.860
 first invited to life the penya hello 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.840
 very good guys, a pleasure because 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.580
 the champions arrive and the champions 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.950
 first the real madrid party and schalke 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.500
 in the good veltins-sand the first 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.870
 I think that question is easy can of 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.880
 roberto di matteo a minor team is 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.140
 can you say against this real madrid that 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.460
 comes a little more rural sant josep 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.309
 real possibilities I will not see you the 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.530
 schalke but yes it is true that it is a 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.879
 little different the panoramic that we had 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.290
 when the action draw for 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.390
 tables that he knows now is a 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.420
 little bit better has regained sensations 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.530
 in the bundesliga is winning matches has 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.790
 lowered a little bit of madrid has gone up 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.930
 a little the serve people and I think 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.059
 that the difference is still great 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.640
 precisely what Carlos said 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.720
 ojota lp on twitter at carlos pic al 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.879
 not being right the real madrid the 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.040
 odds that they pass lower than 95 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.110
 to 90 percent maybe because of the injuries 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.790
 those who had the real madrid I do not know how 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.620
 that it seems that very angular pieces of 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.479
 real madrid that last year were 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.460
 keys no longer have them for these 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.870
 good eighths let's see bouquets is low 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.760
 confirmed and abyss 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.440
 Let's see how the Madrid 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.909
 bail cristiano ronaldo and benzema is a 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.750
 Mania that is exposed is also 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.830
 true 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.900
 the schalke and apart from the one that is low 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.910
 it can be a little bit the impact of that 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.200
 take to finish your forecast of this 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.490
 schalke real madrid 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.590
 well i think that madrid can suffer 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.970
 but if you put a result for me 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.229
 tie with goals a victory for the 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.280
 minimum does not expect a result that 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.650
 leaves in Madrid the tie marked 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.600
 also that our comments can comment 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.850
 followers that comment on the match that 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.650
 think of a forecast and give us a 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.660
 result also because I think so 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.280
 we can generate debate and we go to 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.630
 next issue weigh and the chelsea 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.840
 great match 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.250
 ap 68 chelsea sheet zar ibrahimovic do 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.630
 just renewed it seems like it's a 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.330
 solid project for the whole 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.130
 Londoner and ibrahimovic we already know how 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.440
 It's ibrahimovic inside his ego too 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.030
 he is a great player who marks the 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.310
 differences what I hope is a 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.170
 pretty close tie and it's very 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.420
 competed because they are teams with 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.649
 players of the highest level and there the 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.450
 good good makes the difference 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.950
 obviously I think I 'm getting married by the 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.110
 ibrahimovic cels by the psoe are 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.940
 which are very clear stars in 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.620
 one and another team tell us andrés 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.660
 cabrera andrés low bar inter 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.610
 I would bet for being without greater security 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.040
 the qualifiers between the stars 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.770
 medications for one hundred 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.390
 you are so forceful 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.300
 and I did not want to know right now 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.560
 ibrahimovic just takes you out on time 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.700
 the moment but is that what to do to day 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.590
 today at the moment he is in 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.660
 the season is practically constant 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.430
 so I think a little bit above 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.980
 from the help of nazaret miguel angel ruiz 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.720
 it tells us without a doubt home not by goals or 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.190
 by performance in figures but by the 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.520
 ability to change the sign of the 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.690
 matches good I am I am very let 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.800
 do I think it's going to be one more piece 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.380
 condition for pro-chelsea 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.290
 against psg what does have a little dot 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:01.690
 more above but I think we will be 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.970
 which is one of the most unbalanced to 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.920
 priori is that of shakhtar donesk bayern 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.710
 from Munich the guardiola pep team that 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.600
 it may look like it's favorite but 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.370
 it does not come at a good time more than anything 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.020
 because it plays at 1200 kilometers of 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.000
 distance of gifts because we know that 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.130
 there is a conflict but it is that the bayern 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.020
 of pep not only is not good in the 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.880
 bundesliga but you need that 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.940
 incentive of champions league 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.110
 rebound in the European competition if 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.000
 you look at the first half of the 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.370
 season it seemed that it is beginning to 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.049
 stabilize because I think that 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.810
 such that has alex teixeira has 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.760
 tyson has marlowe gas the shakhtar 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.709
 has its options especially for the 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.090
 type of player you have to do 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.209
 many years playing backlash 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.180
 good explosive driving 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.739
 we go from basel to that basel 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.420
 port of the lopetegui ports that 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.790
 is playing at a good level 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.769
 yes the ico that with a low 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.780
 quite notorious because it is solved 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.040
 that is fabian to be the son of a ture line 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.900
 balanced and especially fun of 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.430
 see so he's clueless he's never going to 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.129
 be fun now we go with the 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.319
 favorite section of beille and 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.840
 Reasonable disappearance in the first place 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.250
 we have one of the most coaches 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.440
 charismatic jose mourinho whom he 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.390
 It seems 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.490
 a plan to write there we have the 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.040
 elche coach the second one seemed 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:21.180
 reasonable is that of mario götze player 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.180
 of the Munich Bayern with 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.520
 franz beckenbauer as a young man of course 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.360
 from the good kaiser we said goodbye 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.670
 thank you 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.230
