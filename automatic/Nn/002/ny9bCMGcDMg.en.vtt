00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
cut a line like here and then make a

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.180 
cut a line like here and then make a
square<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:34.320> so<00:02:35.320> this<00:02:35.470> will<00:02:35.650> go<00:02:35.740> here<00:02:36.040> and

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
square and so this will go here and

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.670 
square and so this will go here and
they'll<00:02:36.520> go<00:02:36.730> around<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:37.360> then<00:02:37.750> go<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.530> the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
they'll go around and then go to the

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.610 
they'll go around and then go to the
square<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:40.420> can<00:02:40.600> still<00:02:40.900> do<00:02:41.050> that<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.380> took

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
square and it can still do that I took

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.270 
square and it can still do that I took
