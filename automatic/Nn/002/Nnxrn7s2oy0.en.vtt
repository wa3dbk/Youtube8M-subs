time around to actually talk about it

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
and I decided what better way to start

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.000 
and I decided what better way to start
off<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.400> video<00:00:26.580> than<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.330> talk<00:00:27.599> about

Gintama didn't all of us supposedly

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.680 
Gintama didn't all of us supposedly
earlier<00:00:31.380> today<00:00:31.800> got<00:00:32.430> announced<00:00:32.940> for<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.180> new

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
earlier today got announced for a new

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.540 
earlier today got announced for a new
series<00:00:34.230> now<00:00:34.410> necessarily<00:00:35.100> from<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.399> new

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
series now necessarily from this new

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.709 
series now necessarily from this new
series<00:00:35.850> from<00:00:35.910> what<00:00:36.120> I've<00:00:36.239> read<00:00:36.390> from<00:00:36.570> the

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
series from what I've read from the

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.869 
series from what I've read from the
article<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.350> was<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.590> Anime<00:00:38.010> News<00:00:38.160> Network

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
article that was on Anime News Network

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.270 
article that was on Anime News Network
it<00:00:39.180> doesn't<00:00:39.629> necessarily<00:00:39.780> say<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.250> a

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
it doesn't necessarily say that it is a

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.970 
it doesn't necessarily say that it is a
reboot<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.059> I'm<00:00:42.270> going<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.540> assume<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.620> this

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
reboot so I'm going to assume that this

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.779 
reboot so I'm going to assume that this
new<00:00:44.190> Gintama<00:00:44.700> coming<00:00:45.180> out<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.840> spring<00:00:46.260> 2015<00:00:47.160> is

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
new Gintama coming out in spring 2015 is

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.360 
new Gintama coming out in spring 2015 is
going<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.390> continue<00:00:49.050> where<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.680> anime<00:00:50.100> left

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
going to continue where the anime left

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.330 
going to continue where the anime left
off<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.809> guess<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.829> time<00:00:53.010> for<00:00:53.039> me<00:00:53.309> to

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
off of so I guess this is time for me to

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.779 
off of so I guess this is time for me to
actually<00:00:54.530> start<00:00:55.530> watching<00:00:55.829> Gintama<00:00:56.399> because

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
actually start watching Gintama because

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.790 
actually start watching Gintama because
I've<00:00:56.969> been<00:00:57.149> asked<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.660> actually<00:00:58.199> read<00:00:58.500> or

I've been asked you actually read or

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.680 
I've been asked you actually read or
watch<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.460> series<00:00:59.640> for<00:00:59.910> quite<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> long<00:01:00.359> time

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.340 
and I've kind of just thrown it to the
side<00:01:03.180> because<00:01:03.300> I'm<00:01:03.480> like<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.780> just<00:01:03.840> don't<00:01:04.110> feel

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
know a nice segue for like earlier this

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.420 
know a nice segue for like earlier this
year<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.200> was<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.320> really<00:01:46.560> good<00:01:46.829> series<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.310> mean

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
year it was a really good series I mean

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.010 
year it was a really good series I mean
it's<00:01:47.579> not<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.820> most<00:01:47.970> groundbreaking<00:01:48.360> it

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
it's not the most groundbreaking it

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.539 
it's not the most groundbreaking it
didn't<00:01:49.290> really<00:01:49.470> accomplish<00:01:49.680> much<00:01:49.979> with<00:01:50.340> its

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
didn't really accomplish much with its

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.639 
didn't really accomplish much with its
first<00:01:50.790> season<00:01:51.180> but<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.750> was<00:01:51.840> fun<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.320> it's

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
first season but it was fun and it's
