00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
arse on this map is absolutely beautiful

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.139 
arse on this map is absolutely beautiful
it<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.690> one<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.800> best<00:00:59.070> themes<00:00:59.579> one<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.000> the

to<00:01:12.330> talk<00:01:12.450> about<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> replayability<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.740> this

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
to talk about the replayability of this

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.890 
to talk about the replayability of this
map<00:01:14.070> there<00:01:14.520> are<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> couple<00:01:15.090> problems<00:01:15.509> with

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
map there are a couple problems with

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.770 
map there are a couple problems with
this<00:01:16.020> map<00:01:16.229> i<00:01:16.439> will<00:01:16.799> say<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.220> there<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> bug

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
this map i will say it there is a bug

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.350 
this map i will say it there is a bug
with<00:01:18.990> them<00:01:19.229> with<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> payload<00:01:20.460> right<00:01:21.150> now

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
with them with the payload right now

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.890 
with them with the payload right now
where<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:22.820> have<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.970> score<00:01:24.270> have<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.810> score

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
where you have to score have to score

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.870 
where you have to score have to score
three<00:01:25.500> times<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> payload<00:01:26.220> actually<00:01:26.700> win

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
three times of the payload actually win

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.190 
three times of the payload actually win
the<00:01:27.000> round<00:01:27.119> instead<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.600> one<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.840> don't<00:01:27.990> know<00:01:28.110> if

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the round instead of one I don't know if

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.050 
the round instead of one I don't know if
this<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.350> intentional<00:01:28.799> but<00:01:29.100> it's<00:01:29.280> there<00:01:29.939> are

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
this is intentional but it's there are

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.730 
this is intentional but it's there are
no<00:01:30.240> other<00:01:30.360> payload<00:01:30.810> maps<00:01:31.049> like<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.439> which<00:01:31.590> is

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
no other payload maps like that which is

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.770 
no other payload maps like that which is
kind<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.040> weird<00:01:32.220> but<00:01:32.369> anyways<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:33.570> still

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
kind of weird but anyways it still

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.330 
kind of weird but anyways it still
doesn't<00:01:33.960> really<00:01:34.170> stop<00:01:34.560> us<00:01:34.740> from<00:01:34.829> enjoying<00:01:35.040> it

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
doesn't really stop us from enjoying it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.830 
doesn't really stop us from enjoying it
up<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:35.640> very<00:01:35.909> very<00:01:36.030> nice<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.509> find<00:01:36.810> that

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
up and it's very very nice I find that

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.780 
up and it's very very nice I find that
there<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.259> there<00:01:37.320> should<00:01:37.650> be<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:38.009> little<00:01:38.579> bit

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
there that there should be a little bit

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.640 
there that there should be a little bit
a<00:01:39.000> little<00:01:39.119> bit<00:01:39.390> more<00:01:39.689> passages<00:01:40.200> through<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
a little bit more passages through the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.819 
a little bit more passages through the
map<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.430> allow<00:01:41.670> no<00:01:42.570> custom<00:01:42.930> looks<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.680> little

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
map to allow no custom looks a little

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.260 
map to allow no custom looks a little
bit<00:01:43.979> more<00:01:44.100> fighting<00:01:44.430> maybe<00:01:44.610> more<00:01:44.939> than<00:01:44.970> one

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
bit more fighting maybe more than one

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.719 
bit more fighting maybe more than one
stage<00:01:45.630> but<00:01:45.899> it's<00:01:46.470> still<00:01:46.649> very<00:01:46.979> understandable

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
stage but it's still very understandable

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.760 
stage but it's still very understandable
but<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.060> replayability<00:01:48.500> after<00:01:49.500> playing<00:01:49.680> a

but the replayability after playing a

because<00:01:57.329> there's<00:01:57.479> no<00:01:57.600> other<00:01:57.689> points<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.290> map

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
because there's no other points and map

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.149 
because there's no other points and map

said<00:02:35.410> anyways<00:02:36.010> map<00:02:36.730> design<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:37.270> can<00:02:37.420> go

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
said anyways map design you can go

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.510 
said anyways map design you can go
underground<00:02:37.840> right<00:02:38.200> there<00:02:38.410> as<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:39.190> see<00:02:39.400> that

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
underground right there as you see that

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.860 
underground right there as you see that
I<00:02:39.580> don't<00:02:39.760> actually<00:02:39.970> visit<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.420> underground

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
I don't actually visit the underground

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.750 
I don't actually visit the underground
but<00:02:41.080> besides<00:02:41.440> for<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:42.310> middle<00:02:42.550> and<00:02:42.700> the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
but besides for that the middle and the

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.490 
but besides for that the middle and the
underground<00:02:43.060> there<00:02:43.209> are<00:02:43.300> no<00:02:43.390> other<00:02:43.600> passages

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
underground there are no other passages

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.110 
underground there are no other passages
connecting<00:02:45.100> both<00:02:45.280> bases<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:45.850> that's<00:02:46.030> a

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
connecting both bases and that's a

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.400 
connecting both bases and that's a
little<00:02:46.330> problem<00:02:46.630> that<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:46.810> see<00:02:46.870> there<00:02:47.170> there

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
little problem that I see there there

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.230 
little problem that I see there there
could<00:02:47.620> have<00:02:47.709> been<00:02:47.770> maybe<00:02:48.610> a<00:02:48.760> little<00:02:48.880> bit<00:02:49.090> more

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
could have been maybe a little bit more

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.900 
could have been maybe a little bit more
expanding<00:02:49.840> towards<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.320> sides<00:02:50.670> or<00:02:51.670> maybe

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
expanding towards the sides or maybe

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.880 
expanding towards the sides or maybe
some<00:02:52.150> passage<00:02:52.540> towards<00:02:52.990> the<00:02:53.290> top<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:53.800> would

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
some passage towards the top that would

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.440 
some passage towards the top that would
have<00:02:53.980> been<00:02:54.070> never<00:02:54.370> made<00:02:54.610> them<00:02:54.700> out<00:02:54.820> a<00:02:54.940> lot<00:02:55.300> more

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
have been never made them out a lot more

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.820 
have been never made them out a lot more
interesting<00:02:55.900> if<00:02:56.020> there<00:02:56.170> was<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.320> top<00:02:56.590> level

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
interesting if there was a top level

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.090 
interesting if there was a top level
gameplay<00:02:57.270> our<00:02:58.270> passages<00:02:58.810> included<00:02:59.320> it<00:02:59.980> would

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
gameplay our passages included it would

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.890 
gameplay our passages included it would
have<00:03:00.190> made<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.430> map<00:03:00.580> you<00:03:00.730> know<00:03:00.850> like<00:03:01.570> ten

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
have made the map you know like ten

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.570 
have made the map you know like ten
times<00:03:02.080> better<00:03:02.320> I<00:03:02.590> know<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:02.980> map<00:03:03.100> is<00:03:03.250> still<00:03:03.430> not

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
times better I know the map is still not

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.130 
times better I know the map is still not
finished<00:03:03.760> like<00:03:04.030> I<00:03:04.150> know<00:03:04.420> it's<00:03:04.660> an<00:03:04.720> abandoned

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
finished like I know it's an abandoned

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.630 
finished like I know it's an abandoned
project<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.709> some<00:03:05.980> people<00:03:06.220> still<00:03:06.400> play<00:03:06.520> this

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
project and some people still play this

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.750 
project and some people still play this
map<00:03:06.820> but<00:03:06.940> i<00:03:07.060> find<00:03:07.390> this<00:03:07.620> map<00:03:08.620> does<00:03:08.950> have<00:03:09.580> a<00:03:09.640> lot

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
map but i find this map does have a lot

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.340 
map but i find this map does have a lot
of<00:03:09.820> potential<00:03:10.330> unfortunately<00:03:11.050> it<00:03:11.140> was<00:03:11.230> one<00:03:11.320> of

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
of potential unfortunately it was one of

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.500 
of potential unfortunately it was one of
those<00:03:11.470> maps<00:03:11.739> that<00:03:11.890> was<00:03:12.010> dropped<00:03:12.250> in<00:03:12.550> favor<00:03:12.610> of

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
those maps that was dropped in favor of

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.570 
those maps that was dropped in favor of
you<00:03:13.750> know<00:03:13.870> doing<00:03:14.110> other<00:03:14.380> other<00:03:14.950> projects<00:03:15.459> but

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
you know doing other other projects but

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.930 
you know doing other other projects but
still<00:03:16.080> so<00:03:17.080> in<00:03:17.230> terms<00:03:17.410> of<00:03:17.590> map<00:03:17.769> design<00:03:18.010> it's<00:03:18.400> not

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
still so in terms of map design it's not

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.150 
still so in terms of map design it's not
fantastic<00:03:19.480> but<00:03:19.780> it's<00:03:20.019> not<00:03:20.200> bad<00:03:20.590> either<00:03:20.800> and

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
fantastic but it's not bad either and

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.600 
fantastic but it's not bad either and
still<00:03:21.550> gets<00:03:21.760> me<00:03:21.880> a<00:03:22.180> seven<00:03:22.810> on<00:03:22.930> 10<00:03:23.500> because<00:03:24.310> it's

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
still gets me a seven on 10 because it's

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.270 
still gets me a seven on 10 because it's
still<00:03:24.850> great<00:03:25.530> even<00:03:26.530> though<00:03:26.620> it<00:03:26.650> has<00:03:26.830> a<00:03:26.890> couple

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
still great even though it has a couple

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.130 
still great even though it has a couple
flaws<00:03:27.489> it's<00:03:27.790> still<00:03:28.030> great<00:03:28.209> so<00:03:28.840> overall

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
flaws it's still great so overall

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.780 
flaws it's still great so overall
talking<00:03:29.620> about<00:03:29.799> this<00:03:29.920> map<00:03:30.160> we<00:03:30.340> played<00:03:30.370> it<00:03:30.760> for

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
talking about this map we played it for

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.690 
talking about this map we played it for
about<00:03:31.060> an<00:03:31.600> hour<00:03:31.810> or<00:03:32.019> so<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.620> you<00:03:33.430> know<00:03:33.519> the

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
about an hour or so and you know the

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.970 
about an hour or so and you know the
overall<00:03:34.330> feeling<00:03:34.690> that<00:03:34.900> I<00:03:34.930> got<00:03:35.140> people<00:03:35.680> very

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
overall feeling that I got people very

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.520 
overall feeling that I got people very
like<00:03:36.310> enjoyed<00:03:36.670> this<00:03:36.820> map<00:03:37.030> very<00:03:37.360> much<00:03:37.600> as<00:03:38.410> I

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
like enjoyed this map very much as I

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.660 
like enjoyed this map very much as I
said<00:03:38.680> there's<00:03:38.799> a<00:03:38.860> lot<00:03:39.040> of<00:03:39.070> tight<00:03:39.310> gameplay

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
said there's a lot of tight gameplay

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.330 
said there's a lot of tight gameplay
going<00:03:39.940> on<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.209> engineer<00:03:40.630> spots<00:03:41.160> good<00:03:42.160> Luke

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
going on the engineer spots good Luke

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.560 
going on the engineer spots good Luke
could<00:03:42.670> use<00:03:42.820> a<00:03:42.850> little<00:03:43.060> work<00:03:43.180> because<00:03:45.570> there's

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
could use a little work because there's

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.590 
could use a little work because there's
there's<00:03:47.019> no<00:03:47.170> really<00:03:47.440> turtling<00:03:47.950> spots<00:03:48.310> and

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
there's no really turtling spots and

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.910 
there's no really turtling spots and
every<00:03:49.600> single<00:03:49.870> ngness<00:03:50.230> can<00:03:50.440> be<00:03:50.530> taken<00:03:50.830> down

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
every single ngness can be taken down

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.620 
every single ngness can be taken down
really<00:03:51.310> easily<00:03:51.430> because<00:03:52.030> there's<00:03:52.180> no<00:03:52.360> really

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
really easily because there's no really

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.900 
really easily because there's no really
spots<00:03:52.900> where<00:03:53.220> engineers<00:03:54.220> can<00:03:54.580> actually

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
spots where engineers can actually

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.810 
spots where engineers can actually
safely<00:03:55.420> set<00:03:55.630> up<00:03:55.750> there's<00:03:56.410> just<00:03:56.500> uncommon<00:03:57.070> for

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
safely set up there's just uncommon for

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.670 
safely set up there's just uncommon for
a<00:03:57.910> well-balanced<00:03:58.510> tf2<00:03:58.900> map<00:03:59.230> at<00:03:59.380> least<00:03:59.500> on

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
a well-balanced tf2 map at least on

a well-balanced tf2 map at least on
every<00:03:59.890> tf2<00:04:00.250> valve<00:04:00.519> map<00:04:00.760> there's<00:04:01.120> a<00:04:01.239> good<00:04:01.480> spot

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
every tf2 valve map there's a good spot

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.449 
every tf2 valve map there's a good spot
or<00:04:01.959> two<00:04:01.989> where<00:04:02.320> engineers<00:04:02.560> can<00:04:02.920> actually<00:04:03.250> set

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
or two where engineers can actually set

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.060 
or two where engineers can actually set
up<00:04:03.489> without<00:04:04.480> a<00:04:04.540> problem<00:04:04.900> now<00:04:05.590> that<00:04:05.739> I'm<00:04:05.830> saying

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
up without a problem now that I'm saying

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.880 
up without a problem now that I'm saying
that<00:04:06.160> this<00:04:06.280> is<00:04:06.430> a<00:04:06.459> bad<00:04:06.700> thing<00:04:06.730> it's<00:04:07.180> just<00:04:07.890> some

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
that this is a bad thing it's just some

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.289 
that this is a bad thing it's just some
what<00:04:09.010> bothered<00:04:09.370> me<00:04:09.430> some<00:04:09.640> time<00:04:09.790> sir<00:04:09.970> it<00:04:10.180> you

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
what bothered me some time sir it you

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.240 
what bothered me some time sir it you
could<00:04:10.450> set<00:04:10.600> up<00:04:10.690> inside<00:04:10.959> the<00:04:11.110> barn<00:04:11.350> which<00:04:12.070> is<00:04:12.220> a

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
could set up inside the barn which is a

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.009 
could set up inside the barn which is a
one<00:04:12.850> of<00:04:12.880> the<00:04:13.000> only<00:04:13.120> spots<00:04:13.480> which<00:04:13.660> actually

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
one of the only spots which actually

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.470 
one of the only spots which actually
safe<00:04:14.320> to<00:04:14.440> set<00:04:14.590> up<00:04:14.680> but<00:04:15.180> setting<00:04:16.180> up<00:04:16.269> in<00:04:16.389> your

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
safe to set up but setting up in your

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.759 
safe to set up but setting up in your
own<00:04:16.510> base<00:04:16.810> like<00:04:17.049> this<00:04:17.260> when<00:04:17.470> you<00:04:17.560> have<00:04:17.680> to

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
own base like this when you have to

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:18.090 
own base like this when you have to
rappel

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
rappel

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.650 
rappel
it's<00:04:18.310> kind<00:04:18.490> of<00:04:18.550> hard<00:04:18.700> so<00:04:18.970> overall<00:04:19.300> guys<00:04:19.630> I

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
it's kind of hard so overall guys I

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.270 
it's kind of hard so overall guys I
think<00:04:20.080> in<00:04:20.260> my<00:04:20.410> own<00:04:20.530> judgment<00:04:20.890> I<00:04:20.980> would<00:04:21.130> give

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
think in my own judgment I would give

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.820 
think in my own judgment I would give
the<00:04:21.459> map<00:04:21.640> a<00:04:21.880> 7<00:04:22.420> on<00:04:22.480> 10<00:04:22.750> just<00:04:23.170> because<00:04:23.470> it<00:04:23.590> needs

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
the map a 7 on 10 just because it needs

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.710 
the map a 7 on 10 just because it needs
some<00:04:24.040> reworking<00:04:24.310> and<00:04:24.670> some<00:04:24.850> bugs<00:04:25.120> but<00:04:25.600> it's

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
some reworking and some bugs but it's

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.590 
some reworking and some bugs but it's
still<00:04:25.960> a<00:04:26.020> very<00:04:26.470> very<00:04:27.340> nice<00:04:27.550> map<00:04:27.880> I<00:04:28.090> really<00:04:28.510> hope

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
still a very very nice map I really hope

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.190 
still a very very nice map I really hope
