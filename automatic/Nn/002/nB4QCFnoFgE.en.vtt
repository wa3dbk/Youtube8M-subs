 ideals in an inhuman manner leads 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.460
 its criminal policy 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.579
 previously in Odessa unknown was abducted

 the flag of Novorossia did the same 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.979
 information about the monument 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.719

 unique historical traditions 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:27.500
 never forgive desecration and 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.539
 humiliation finally residents of the city fill 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.549
 having eaten the promise of the Ukrainian authorities 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.380
 began to understand what devastation 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.979
 the state is moving fast 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.319
 Ukraine 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.049
 Ukrainian vandals marveling at their 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:41.060
 courage can only destroy nothing 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.459
 suggesting instead local observers 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.679
 connect this crime with war 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:46.969
 monuments started in the area after 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:48.860
 change of power in Kiev 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:51.679

 Grigory Kotovsky 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.459
 the main purpose of the organizers and 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.739
 masterminds is not a struggle for 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.079
 European values and incitement 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.280
 hate between nations and destruction 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.280
 cultural values 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.730

 the meeting is currently number 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.209
 homeless children increased due to 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.519
 fighting in the Donetsk people 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.140
 Republic law enforcement officers together with 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.790
 children's affairs directors

 local educational institutions held 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.549
 meeting 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.920
 as noted by participants now 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.299
 time the number of minors 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.670
 engaged in vagrancy increased 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.069
 the main reason fighting in 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.739
 Donetsk People's Republic in this 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.720
 The moment we have fixed the amount not 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.769
 I will speak but there are children who 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.930
 participated and 8 and 10 and 14 years that is 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:19.799
 how would it be a very important indicator 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.049
 who screams to herself ie children 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.810
 it is necessary to save as much as possible from 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.549
 of what happens to work with children 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.470
 in the Petrovsky district organized 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.629
 juvenile department 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.470
 his task is to control and fight child 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.690
 by crime 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.250
 according to law enforcement officers most 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.950
 common offenses 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.489
 juvenile theft but is there 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:45.329
 more serious there are children who stayed 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:47.450
 without parents connection with what grows without 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.500
 homelessness and neglect 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.549
 involvement increases 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.700
 minors in 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:57.480
 crime 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.669
 here and we are all to cinnamon we 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.040
 We also control the work on 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.720
 updating orphan lists this will allow 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.940
 supervise the guardians on the subject 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.069
 maintenance and parenting now 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.780
 such work is the main task 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.780
 Notes Service for Children 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.849
 Petrovsky district administration now we 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.200
 working with a focus on orphans and 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.320
 children without parental care 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.910
 because it is unfortunately that moment 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.169
 who will never leave us 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.620
 objective circumstances 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.570
 Now we are planning to reestablish 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.889
 I would even say work with children 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.139
 who found themselves in difficult life 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.720
 circumstances 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:36.870
 prevention vagrancy they are the most 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.440
 We are weak and therefore children should 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.240
 know where and come to whom to turn and 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.139
 parents can say the same to 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.659
 pay more 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.759
 attention to children the nearest plans 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:49.770
 law enforcement educators conduct in 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:52.409
 schools of preventive conversations with children and 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.270
 their parents aim to protect as much as possible 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:57.110
 the younger generation from committing 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.110
 of crimes
