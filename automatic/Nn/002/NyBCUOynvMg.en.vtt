00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
days he had gotten much better about

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.500 
days he had gotten much better about
that<00:04:01.560> first<00:04:02.310> he<00:04:02.519> was<00:04:02.640> always<00:04:02.819> squirming

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
that first he was always squirming

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.610 
that first he was always squirming
wedding<00:04:04.519> we've<00:04:05.519> got<00:04:05.760> 13<00:04:06.510> and<00:04:07.019> he's<00:04:07.200> got<00:04:07.410> to<00:04:07.530> be

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
wedding we've got 13 and he's got to be

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:18.080 
wedding we've got 13 and he's got to be
unfortunate<00:04:08.250> industry<00:04:15.919> longer<00:04:16.950> it<00:04:17.729> started

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
unfortunate industry longer it started

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.050 
unfortunate industry longer it started
early<00:04:18.239> so<00:04:18.840> what<00:04:18.959> I<00:04:19.019> do<00:04:19.079> at<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.440> end<00:04:19.470> is<00:04:20.100> I<00:04:20.519> clip

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
early so what I do at the end is I clip

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.260 
early so what I do at the end is I clip
them<00:04:21.239> so<00:04:21.870> it's<00:04:22.139> free<00:04:22.500> to<00:04:22.830> anyone<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.550> always

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.600 
them so it's free to anyone I always
make<00:04:24.540> sure<00:04:24.570> he<00:04:25.020> ends<00:04:25.560> with<00:04:25.770> something<00:04:26.370> I'm

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
make sure he ends with something I'm

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.580 
make sure he ends with something I'm
just<00:04:26.729> alone<00:04:27.210> with<00:04:27.419> a<00:04:27.660> good<00:04:27.870> treat<00:04:28.200> so<00:04:28.470> it

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
just alone with a good treat so it

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:35.500 
just alone with a good treat so it
always<00:04:28.740> ends<00:04:29.310> on<00:04:29.490> a<00:04:29.520> real<00:04:29.789> nice<00:04:30.030> note<00:04:30.510> for<00:04:31.169> him

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.689 

and<00:04:36.510> that<00:04:37.289> could<00:04:37.470> be<00:04:37.650> a<00:04:37.680> really<00:04:38.070> good<00:04:38.340> rate<00:04:38.580> of

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
and that could be a really good rate of

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:54.579 
and that could be a really good rate of
teaching<00:04:39.090> to<00:04:39.270> light<00:04:39.449> pressure

00:04:54.579 --> 00:04:54.589 

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:56.289 

the<00:04:54.919> same<00:04:55.159> thing<00:04:55.489> you<00:04:55.609> could<00:04:55.819> do<00:04:55.999> with<00:04:56.179> the

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:56.299 
the same thing you could do with the

00:04:56.299 --> 00:05:00.159 
the same thing you could do with the
nail<00:04:56.599> clippers<00:04:57.169> I<00:04:57.559> did<00:04:58.549> do<00:04:58.759> a<00:04:58.789> video<00:04:59.239> on<00:04:59.599> using

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
nail clippers I did do a video on using

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.069 
nail clippers I did do a video on using
sandpaper<00:05:00.799> teaching<00:05:01.519> them<00:05:01.729> to<00:05:01.839> file<00:05:02.839> their

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:03.079 
sandpaper teaching them to file their

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:06.279 
sandpaper teaching them to file their
own<00:05:03.109> nails<00:05:03.469> for<00:05:03.709> Justin<00:05:04.389> Johnston<00:05:05.389> came<00:05:06.049> in

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
own nails for Justin Johnston came in

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:07.689 
own nails for Justin Johnston came in
first

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:07.699 
first

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.689 
first
so<00:05:08.259> really<00:05:09.259> it<00:05:09.439> just<00:05:09.499> happens<00:05:09.949> naturally<00:05:10.159> even

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
so really it just happens naturally even

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:12.399 
so really it just happens naturally even
if<00:05:10.759> they<00:05:10.879> do<00:05:10.999> it<00:05:11.179> first<00:05:11.419> and<00:05:11.659> if<00:05:11.929> a<00:05:12.079> lot<00:05:12.289> of

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:12.409 
if they do it first and if a lot of

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:13.779 
if they do it first and if a lot of
times<00:05:12.559> of<00:05:12.679> development<00:05:13.099> they<00:05:13.159> can<00:05:13.399> get<00:05:13.639> to<00:05:13.759> be

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
times of development they can get to be

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.119 
times of development they can get to be
quite<00:05:14.119> serious<00:05:14.359> being<00:05:14.809> from<00:05:15.169> again<00:05:15.439> you're

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:16.129 
quite serious being from again you're

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:18.659 
quite serious being from again you're
already<00:05:16.369> having<00:05:16.609> a<00:05:16.819> real<00:05:17.089> reaction<00:05:17.989> to<00:05:18.199> this

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
already having a real reaction to this

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:24.099 
already having a real reaction to this
give<00:05:19.669> me<00:05:19.699> a<00:05:19.849> call<00:05:22.089> because<00:05:23.089> there<00:05:23.389> are<00:05:23.539> steps

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:24.109 
give me a call because there are steps

00:05:24.109 --> 00:05:28.019 
give me a call because there are steps
should<00:05:24.289> be<00:05:24.559> careful<00:05:25.249> steps<00:05:25.489> to<00:05:25.819> to<00:05:26.209> undo<00:05:26.629> that

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:28.029 
should be careful steps to to undo that

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:30.819 
should be careful steps to to undo that
but<00:05:29.029> even<00:05:29.449> with<00:05:29.719> puppies<00:05:30.139> allowed<00:05:30.409> to<00:05:30.559> do<00:05:30.679> is

but if you canter yourself at least go
through<00:06:31.580> the<00:06:31.819> motions<00:06:32.150> of<00:06:32.270> conditioning<00:06:32.840> them

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
through the motions of conditioning them

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.959 
through the motions of conditioning them
at<00:06:33.110> home<00:06:33.379> so<00:06:33.710> that<00:06:33.740> it's<00:06:33.979> not<00:06:34.189> so<00:06:34.520> frightening

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:34.969 
at home so that it's not so frightening

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:39.149 
at home so that it's not so frightening
for<00:06:35.389> them

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:39.159 

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:41.520 

you<00:06:40.159> move<00:06:40.310> doesn't<00:06:40.610> seem<00:06:40.879> like<00:06:41.030> they're<00:06:41.180> first
