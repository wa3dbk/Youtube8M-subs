usable<00:01:29.880> space<00:01:30.090> as<00:01:30.660> a<00:01:31.200> sixteen<00:01:31.800> by<00:01:32.100> twenty

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
usable space as a sixteen by twenty

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.390

instead<00:01:33.330> of<00:01:33.420> an<00:01:33.510> eighteen<00:01:33.810> by<00:01:33.990> 22<00:01:34.530> because<00:01:35.250> as

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
instead of an eighteen by 22 because as

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.300 
instead of an eighteen by 22 because as
we<00:01:35.550> all<00:01:35.700> know<00:01:35.880> fat<00:01:36.540> quarters<00:01:36.990> are<00:01:37.140> all<00:01:37.440> not<00:01:38.070> all

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
we all know fat quarters are all not all

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.600 
we all know fat quarters are all not all
created<00:01:38.760> equal<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:40.560> what<00:01:40.710> I'm<00:01:40.830> going<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.160> do<00:01:41.340> is

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
created equal so what I'm going to do is

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.840 
created equal so what I'm going to do is
take<00:01:41.910> this<00:01:42.090> back<00:01:42.150> board<00:01:42.660> and<00:01:43.400> I'm<00:01:44.400> going<00:01:44.790> to

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
take this back board and I'm going to

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.600 
take this back board and I'm going to
slice<00:01:45.180> off<00:01:45.420> an<00:01:45.600> edge<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.110> get<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:48.200> straight<00:01:49.200> edge

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
slice off an edge to get a straight edge

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.240 
slice off an edge to get a straight edge
and<00:01:50.610> we'll<00:01:50.910> get<00:01:51.060> rid<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.890> then<00:01:52.890> I'll<00:01:53.010> turn

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
and we'll get rid of that then I'll turn

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.219 
and we'll get rid of that then I'll turn
my<00:01:53.520> mat<00:01:54.180> sideways

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.660 

line<00:02:00.229> up<00:02:00.409> the<00:02:00.440> ruler<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:01.190> get<00:02:01.310> a<00:02:01.340> straightedge

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
line up the ruler to get a straightedge

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:12.300 
line up the ruler to get a straightedge
and<00:02:05.770> make<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.950> second<00:02:07.310> cut<00:02:09.340> from<00:02:10.340> this<00:02:10.520> point

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
and make the second cut from this point

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.920 
and make the second cut from this point
anything<00:02:13.310> is<00:02:13.490> fair<00:02:13.670> game<00:02:13.730> you've<00:02:14.480> got<00:02:14.690> all<00:02:14.810> the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
anything is fair game you've got all the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.449 
anything is fair game you've got all the
different<00:02:15.260> cuts<00:02:15.440> that<00:02:15.739> you<00:02:15.890> can<00:02:16.069> make<00:02:16.250> with

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
different cuts that you can make with

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:25.240 
different cuts that you can make with
this<00:02:16.640> ruler<00:02:21.819> and<00:02:22.819> first<00:02:23.690> we'll<00:02:23.840> cut<00:02:24.050> a<00:02:24.260> two<00:02:25.130> and

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
this ruler and first we'll cut a two and

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.809 
this ruler and first we'll cut a two and
a<00:02:25.340> half<00:02:25.520> inch<00:02:25.840> strip<00:02:27.400> so<00:02:28.400> what<00:02:28.550> this<00:02:28.670> allows

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
a half inch strip so what this allows
