00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:13.170
 hello today we have a series on our member 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.290
 assembly sailboat 11 apostles and today we 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.140
 we will finish in the meadow 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:25.649
 but first I sewed paint cannon ports 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:28.500
 that then nothing is nowhere to lyapat than 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:30.230
 now actually doing already passed 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.260
 a few weeks of this moment like me 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.710
 did deck decking and during that time she 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.240
 I must say pretty cracked cracked 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.510
 that is, where there were gaps 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:45.900
 they became big where there was no chili 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.520
 they believe in common not scary so 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.140
 farther 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.450
 more realistic it turns out too we paint 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.050
 now cannon ports 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:00.770
 I hope black matt acrylic 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.939
 if not wrong again of course 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.710
 like matt well then painting 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.390
 completed 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.159
 not very high quality course 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.490
 on principle it doesn't matter because it's all 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.270
 will be hidden by the trim manifested 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:23.820
 wood texture also appeared dishes all 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:26.010
 the idea that glued the details yet 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.740
 Of course, not all dried up until the end of our 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:32.790
 steam starts to draw a line on a couple for 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.970
 who will imitate the junction doing 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.479
 it was a simple pencil and a solid well 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.880
 of course on the line 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.210
 now I will spend a couple 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.210
 experimental lines 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:02:00.930
 tell what to aim pretty 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:02:03.060
 it is difficult well here is something like this on the video even 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.300
 by the way is not visible I will not do 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.000
 or such fat fat as well for 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:16.830
 tick on them 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:23.100
 so that now I will promote more 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:24.930
 let's see it will be noticeable or not honest 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.010
 say the result I don't really like 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:32.670
 these pencil lines and I already because 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:40.010
 do without them here inflicted a few 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:43.280
 pieces right now, I try to imitate even if 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:47.540
 cross to see how it will turn out 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.880
 Well, if I leave something as it is 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:56.070
 I can say extremely dissatisfied 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:58.770
 how is imitation of board joints well 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.800
 and I will also help you to leave 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.440
 it would be desirable therefore already purely for 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.370
 I'll check here 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.390
 solid pencil 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:15.000
 endlessly you have to undermine 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:18.690
 but what to do so that's about the looks 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.590
 I 'll finish it now and cut logan 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:28.510
 scribbled already about the deck result if 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:31.990
 honestly less and less like well 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.300
 now probably no way back in 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.060
 In general, all scattered 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.230
 I certainly do not advise anyone of this method 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.370
 imitations 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:44.340
 joints of boards what to do found steel 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:56.350
 such a useful removal tool 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:59.440
 dust so decided not to cover any 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.209
 oil did again like a magazine 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.580
 let's see what happens 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.580
 that is, just paint varnish 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.740
 I decided to apply varnish without oil because 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.200
 all the same if I cover with oil the deck then 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:18.850
 will have to follow already in all this 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:22.540
 style throughout the ship construction ie 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.430
 if the decks are oil and the hull is usually 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.700
 painted drown seems to me not 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:31.120
 look good 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:34.330
 so I will do it this way 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.080
 before and after the varnish is a little darker here api 7 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.080
 active 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:45.139
 covering the deck floor for some reason the beech is very 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.439
 darkened much I did not even expect that 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.509
 will be 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:51.860
 because it was painting oak slats and 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.900
 the coin itself I do not know what birch she 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.599
 sleeps did not change what oak river 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.629
 the roll itself was so red 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:00.770
 shade 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:01.819
 it seems even to mind cool now 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.830
 of course I will finish 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:09.860
 and show what happened first layer 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:15.860
 ready now it will dry up and be 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:19.629
 apply the second front is almost dry 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.629
 such a color is obtained 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:30.340
 who cares what the lag is 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.340
 Matt acrylic company sonnet Petersburg 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.250
 well here and we will put the second varnish coat 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:42.360
 He will she the final now dries up 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:48.710
 already 3 will not cause such a color 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:53.880
 turned out fell and would certainly too 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:55.710
 bold on drew give vision well 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.980
 now nothing can be done so carried 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:01.530
 spider on shoot well at least 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.480
 I think the decision is not to cover and 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.190
 no butter there alone or not 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.080
 use which talent which color 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:11.700
 attached was right because light and 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:13.530
 so changed the darkened deck here 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.419
 Now I look at the camera display of course 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.210
 doesn't look like you really don't know 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:20.639
 how will the monitor look at the light 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.080
 I would say the same thing that I wanted 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.970
 turned out 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.490
 the album case itself is linen I have of course 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:31.870
 they will not 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:34.120
 will finally start doing roughing 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.460
 plating but this was next 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.030
 video and all this thanks for watching 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.030
 and bye
