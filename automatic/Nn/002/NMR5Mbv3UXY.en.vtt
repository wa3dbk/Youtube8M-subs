this stack I'm not sure how good a
format<00:03:54.540> a<00:03:54.569> 13<00:03:55.229> is<00:03:55.440> but<00:03:55.829> I<00:03:56.099> do<00:03:56.879> know<00:03:57.120> his<00:03:57.540> shock

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
format a 13 is but I do know his shock

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.050 
format a 13 is but I do know his shock
effect<00:03:58.190> kills<00:03:59.190> a<00:03:59.310> lot<00:03:59.340> of<00:03:59.549> the<00:03:59.609> creatures<00:03:59.940> in

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
effect kills a lot of the creatures in

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.750 
effect kills a lot of the creatures in
the<00:04:00.150> format<00:04:00.919> so<00:04:01.919> we're<00:04:02.280> going<00:04:02.370> to<00:04:02.459> try<00:04:02.609> them

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
the format so we're going to try them

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.949 
the format so we're going to try them
out<00:04:02.849> and<00:04:02.909> see<00:04:03.060> if<00:04:03.150> we<00:04:03.269> like<00:04:03.419> him<00:04:03.599> and<00:04:05.810> we<00:04:06.810> have

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
out and see if we like him and we have

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.569 
out and see if we like him and we have
the<00:04:07.260> two<00:04:07.379> teachings<00:04:07.739> obviously<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.430> for

the two teachings obviously and for

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.259 
the two teachings obviously and for

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269

outgoing truth the capsized and the
stagger<00:04:15.150> shock<00:04:15.479> and<00:04:16.880> obviously<00:04:17.880> against<00:04:18.120> like

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
stagger shock and obviously against like

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.199 
stagger shock and obviously against like
in<00:04:18.720> fact<00:04:19.620> or<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.070> storm<00:04:20.280> combo<00:04:20.639> that<00:04:20.669> goes<00:04:21.000> off

in fact or the storm combo that goes off
and<00:04:21.419> empty<00:04:21.659> the<00:04:21.690> warrens<00:04:21.900> we<00:04:22.139> want<00:04:22.320> the

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:22.469 
and empty the warrens we want the

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:24.469 
and empty the warrens we want the
seismic<00:04:22.830> shelter<00:04:23.130> that<00:04:23.340> just<00:04:23.580> wrecks<00:04:24.240> them

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
seismic shelter that just wrecks them

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.370 
seismic shelter that just wrecks them
same<00:04:24.840> with<00:04:24.990> that<00:04:25.020> growing<00:04:25.260> truth

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
same with that growing truth

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.640 
same with that growing truth
and<00:04:27.210> you<00:04:28.210> know<00:04:28.350> generally<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.440> slower

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
and you know generally the slower

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.260 
and you know generally the slower
matchup<00:04:30.190> so<00:04:30.310> we<00:04:30.400> have<00:04:30.490> the<00:04:30.580> capsized<00:04:31.030> and

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
matchup so we have the capsized and

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.730 
matchup so we have the capsized and
against<00:04:31.600> aggro<00:04:31.810> we<00:04:32.140> can<00:04:32.290> teachings<00:04:32.650> for

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
against aggro we can teachings for

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.760 
against aggro we can teachings for
either<00:04:32.830> stagger<00:04:33.190> shock<00:04:33.520> or<00:04:33.820> lightning<00:04:34.450> bolt

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
either stagger shock or lightning bolt

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.010 
either stagger shock or lightning bolt
and<00:04:36.150> that's<00:04:37.150> about<00:04:37.270> it<00:04:37.390> for<00:04:37.510> the<00:04:37.690> main<00:04:37.840> deck

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
and that's about it for the main deck

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.750 
and that's about it for the main deck
and<00:04:38.820> for<00:04:39.820> the<00:04:39.880> sideboard<00:04:40.450> I<00:04:41.400> just<00:04:42.400> mostly

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
and for the sideboard I just mostly

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.030 
and for the sideboard I just mostly
through<00:04:42.970> it<00:04:43.060> together<00:04:43.410> looking<00:04:44.410> at<00:04:44.560> list<00:04:44.830> that

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
through it together looking at list that

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.740 
through it together looking at list that
I<00:04:45.100> found<00:04:45.340> online<00:04:45.550> that<00:04:45.820> have<00:04:46.240> been<00:04:46.390> three

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
I found online that have been three

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.430 
I found online that have been three
wanting<00:04:47.020> and<00:04:47.140> following<00:04:47.620> dailies<00:04:48.040> and<00:04:49.440> we

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
wanting and following dailies and we

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
have you know two standard more card

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.580 
have you know two standard more card

deep<00:04:53.770> analysis<00:04:54.310> is<00:04:54.540> against<00:04:55.540> like<00:04:55.660> mono<00:04:55.870> red

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
deep analysis is against like mono red

deep analysis is against like mono red
or<00:04:56.470> red<00:04:56.500> you<00:04:57.010> know<00:04:57.130> just<00:04:57.340> decks<00:04:57.910> with<00:04:58.060> red<00:04:58.240> and
