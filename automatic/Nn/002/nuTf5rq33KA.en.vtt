00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.619
 even just to install hooks 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:26.080

 Talk like that, I decided to go there at the prison. 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:42.340
 to do here is how I tell myself if 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:45.250

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.289
 I think these boots have great towers that 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.739
 the initial goal is to lower this 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:52.710
 profile and to that own the hamas 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.230
