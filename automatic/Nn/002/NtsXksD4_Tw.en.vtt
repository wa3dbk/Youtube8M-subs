00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
choice I think I chose a good car let's

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.160 
choice I think I chose a good car let's
race<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.420> bit<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:27.330> hunting<00:02:27.599> is<00:02:27.690> not<00:02:27.780> perfect<00:02:28.110> on

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
race a bit the hunting is not perfect on

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.350 
race a bit the hunting is not perfect on
it<00:02:28.319> but<00:02:30.200> suppose<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.410> can<00:02:31.500> be<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:32.010> know

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
it but suppose that can be you know

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.000 
it but suppose that can be you know
changed<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.569> guess<00:02:34.349> it's<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.620> rear-wheel<00:02:34.920> drive

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
changed I guess it's a rear-wheel drive

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.460 
changed I guess it's a rear-wheel drive
car<00:02:35.099> so<00:02:35.640> there<00:02:35.819> we<00:02:35.910> go<00:02:35.940> that's<00:02:36.390> do<00:02:37.140> our<00:02:37.290> first
