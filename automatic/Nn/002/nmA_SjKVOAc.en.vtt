new world and also you just saw there

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.160 
new world and also you just saw there
that<00:02:11.190> my<00:02:11.670> diamond<00:02:12.360> sword<00:02:12.480> takes<00:02:12.750> damage<00:02:13.080> will

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
that my diamond sword takes damage will

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.710 
that my diamond sword takes damage will
never<00:02:13.350> use<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:14.010> actually<00:02:14.310> shows<00:02:14.720> how

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
never use it and it actually shows how

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.330 
never use it and it actually shows how
much<00:02:15.959> health<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.560> could<00:02:16.739> say<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:17.160> it's

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
much health you could say that it's

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.699 
much health you could say that it's
actually<00:02:17.580> got<00:02:17.700> left<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.959> durability<00:02:19.440> of

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
actually got left and the durability of

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.740 
actually got left and the durability of
it<00:02:20.070> says<00:02:20.310> pretty<00:02:20.550> useful<00:02:21.000> because<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:21.630> is

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
it says pretty useful because this is

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.100 
it says pretty useful because this is
the<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.350> normal<00:02:23.160> hot<00:02:24.090> bar<00:02:24.300> which<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:24.900> can

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
the the normal hot bar which you can

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.220 
the the normal hot bar which you can
place<00:02:25.590> all<00:02:25.739> your<00:02:25.860> items<00:02:26.250> in<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.750> left<00:02:27.989> is

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
place all your items in to the left is

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.020 
place all your items in to the left is
of<00:02:28.350> course<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.709> armor<00:02:29.100> now<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.520> one<00:02:29.790> little

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
of course the armor now the one little

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.360 
of course the armor now the one little
problem<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.510> this<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.650> does<00:02:31.950> cover

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
problem of this is that it does cover

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.199 
problem of this is that it does cover
the<00:02:33.209> actual<00:02:33.830> durability<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:34.860> your<00:02:35.070> armor<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:36.000> I

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
the actual durability of your armor so I

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.360 
the actual durability of your armor so I

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
kind of know how far away you are to

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.690 
kind of know how far away you are to
basically<00:02:45.930> losing<00:02:46.380> her<00:02:46.500> armor<00:02:46.799> but<00:02:47.370> yeah

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
basically losing her armor but yeah

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.600 
basically losing her armor but yeah
anyway<00:02:48.090> at<00:02:48.239> least<00:02:48.269> us<00:02:48.570> there<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.430> course

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
anyway at least us there and of course

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.640 
anyway at least us there and of course
if<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.790> take<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.000> helmet<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.450> feel<00:02:51.660> take<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.290> out<00:02:52.410> so

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
if I take a helmet I feel take it out so

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.610 
if I take a helmet I feel take it out so
there<00:02:52.830> but<00:02:53.010> designated<00:02:53.580> places<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.620> over

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
there but designated places and over

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.039 
there but designated places and over
than<00:02:55.769> others<00:02:56.130> in<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.610> top<00:02:57.299> right<00:02:57.600> of<00:02:57.630> the

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
than others in the top right of the

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.729 
than others in the top right of the
compact<00:02:58.620> HUD<00:02:59.340> there<00:03:00.150> is<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.570> compass<00:03:01.080> clock

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
compact HUD there is the compass clock

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.370 
compact HUD there is the compass clock
arrow<00:03:02.340> count<00:03:02.880> as<00:03:03.120> well<00:03:03.390> as<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.720> actual<00:03:04.110> time

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
arrow count as well as the actual time

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.130 
arrow count as well as the actual time
so<00:03:04.590> now<00:03:04.950> it<00:03:05.100> is<00:03:05.220> 421<00:03:06.090> p.m.<00:03:06.420> in<00:03:06.690> England<00:03:07.019> right
