ahead and just do some basic stretching
I<00:01:38.869> find<00:01:39.380> that<00:01:39.500> stretching<00:01:39.950> is<00:01:40.100> extremely

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
I find that stretching is extremely

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.459 
I find that stretching is extremely
important<00:01:41.060> as<00:01:41.180> it<00:01:41.329> helps<00:01:41.570> reduce<00:01:41.719> the<00:01:41.930> muscle

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:42.469 
important as it helps reduce the muscle

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.920 
important as it helps reduce the muscle
