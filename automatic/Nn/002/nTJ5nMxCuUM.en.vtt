especially from last year you can't say
there's<00:07:05.370> no<00:07:05.460> expectation<00:07:05.730> because<00:07:06.030> there<00:07:06.270> is

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:06.420 
there's no expectation because there is

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.750 
there's no expectation because there is
there's<00:07:06.990> a<00:07:07.050> very<00:07:07.350> high<00:07:07.440> expectation<00:07:08.220> so<00:07:08.670> all
