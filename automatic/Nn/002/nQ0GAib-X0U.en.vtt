be a multiple part series and our video
lessons<00:00:10.719> as<00:00:10.929> we<00:00:11.110> look<00:00:11.259> at<00:00:11.440> today<00:00:11.769> humidity<00:00:12.759> and

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030 
lessons as we look at today humidity and

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.879 
lessons as we look at today humidity and
convection<00:00:13.389> currents<00:00:13.869> now<00:00:14.589> we're<00:00:14.740> going<00:00:14.829> to

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:14.889 
convection currents now we're going to

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.320 
convection currents now we're going to
look<00:00:14.980> at<00:00:15.070> the<00:00:15.219> instruments<00:00:15.759> that<00:00:15.909> actually

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
look at the instruments that actually

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.269 
look at the instruments that actually
measure<00:00:16.600> humidity<00:00:17.170> in<00:00:17.350> our<00:00:17.470> atmosphere<00:00:17.619> and

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
measure humidity in our atmosphere and

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.130 
measure humidity in our atmosphere and
humidity<00:00:18.970> is<00:00:19.150> really<00:00:19.420> important<00:00:19.810> especially

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
humidity is really important especially

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.710 
humidity is really important especially
relative<00:00:20.710> humidity<00:00:21.189> which<00:00:21.699> says<00:00:21.939> exactly<00:00:22.480> how

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
relative humidity which says exactly how

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.659 
relative humidity which says exactly how
much<00:00:22.869> water<00:00:23.140> is<00:00:23.349> in<00:00:23.380> our<00:00:23.560> atmosphere<00:00:23.679> and<00:00:24.490> what

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:24.669 
much water is in our atmosphere and what

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:25.679 
much water is in our atmosphere and what
are<00:00:24.759> the<00:00:24.820> chances<00:00:25.179> that<00:00:25.240> we're<00:00:25.419> going<00:00:25.509> to<00:00:25.570> get

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
are the chances that we're going to get

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.960 
are the chances that we're going to get
precipitation<00:00:26.439> in<00:00:26.740> the<00:00:26.800> form<00:00:26.919> of<00:00:27.339> rain<00:00:27.400> or

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
precipitation in the form of rain or

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.480 
precipitation in the form of rain or
snow<00:00:28.060> sleet<00:00:29.019> or<00:00:29.050> hail<00:00:29.199> we're<00:00:30.099> also<00:00:30.249> going<00:00:30.429> to

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
snow sleet or hail we're also going to

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.310 
snow sleet or hail we're also going to
be<00:00:30.609> looking<00:00:30.849> at<00:00:30.970> convection<00:00:31.449> currents<00:00:31.749> now

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
be looking at convection currents now

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.050 
be looking at convection currents now
convection<00:00:32.829> currents<00:00:33.130> are<00:00:33.220> basically<00:00:33.550> formed

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.060 
convection currents are basically formed

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.910 
convection currents are basically formed
by<00:00:34.510> warm<00:00:34.840> and<00:00:35.140> cold<00:00:35.320> air<00:00:35.500> coming<00:00:35.800> from

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
by warm and cold air coming from

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.650 
by warm and cold air coming from
different<00:00:36.190> parts<00:00:36.550> of<00:00:36.610> our<00:00:36.730> world<00:00:36.760> and<00:00:37.510> how

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
different parts of our world and how

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.000 
different parts of our world and how
these<00:00:37.810> two<00:00:38.080> different<00:00:38.470> types<00:00:38.680> of<00:00:38.830> weather

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
these two different types of weather

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.250 
these two different types of weather
fronts<00:00:39.550> or<00:00:39.940> warm<00:00:40.390> and<00:00:40.540> cold<00:00:40.720> fronts<00:00:41.080> come

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
fronts or warm and cold fronts come

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.080 
fronts or warm and cold fronts come
together<00:00:41.560> to<00:00:42.070> kind<00:00:42.220> of<00:00:42.310> fight<00:00:42.550> for<00:00:42.790> the<00:00:42.850> space

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
together to kind of fight for the space

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.760 
together to kind of fight for the space
that<00:00:43.270> they're<00:00:43.480> in<00:00:43.630> and<00:00:43.930> also<00:00:44.230> create<00:00:44.650> his

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
that they're in and also create his

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.040 
that they're in and also create his
services<00:00:45.160> in<00:00:45.280> our<00:00:45.490> atmosphere<00:00:45.790> so<00:00:46.720> look<00:00:46.930> at

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
services in our atmosphere so look at

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.720 
services in our atmosphere so look at
this<00:00:47.080> particular<00:00:47.290> series<00:00:47.980> today<00:00:48.220> and<00:00:48.640> I<00:00:48.700> hope

at right here we're going to be looking

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.890 
at right here we're going to be looking
at<00:00:54.610> how<00:00:54.640> smoke<00:00:55.390> is<00:00:56.050> basically<00:00:56.530> utilized<00:00:56.950> and

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
at how smoke is basically utilized and

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.510 
at how smoke is basically utilized and
showing<00:00:58.900> how<00:00:58.960> convection<00:00:59.410> currents<00:00:59.710> work<00:00:59.890> so

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
showing how convection currents work so

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.070 
showing how convection currents work so
basically<00:01:00.880> what<00:01:01.030> we've<00:01:01.180> done<00:01:01.330> over<00:01:01.390> sweet<00:01:01.840> set

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
basically what we've done over sweet set

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.170 
basically what we've done over sweet set
up<00:01:02.200> this<00:01:02.320> aquarium<00:01:02.710> and<00:01:03.130> the<00:01:03.670> aquarium<00:01:04.059> has

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
up this aquarium and the aquarium has

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.300 
up this aquarium and the aquarium has
candles<00:01:04.659> burning<00:01:04.930> in<00:01:04.989> one<00:01:05.170> end<00:01:05.379> and<00:01:05.560> it<00:01:06.160> does

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
candles burning in one end and it does

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.010 
candles burning in one end and it does
not<00:01:06.430> have<00:01:06.640> anything<00:01:06.850> on<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.150> other<00:01:07.270> end<00:01:07.450> now

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
not have anything on the other end now

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.810 
not have anything on the other end now
we<00:01:08.080> sealed<00:01:08.470> up<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.710> top<00:01:08.920> of<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:09.160> aquarium<00:01:09.670> and

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
we sealed up the top of the aquarium and

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.420 
we sealed up the top of the aquarium and
put<00:01:10.540> two<00:01:10.660> chimneys<00:01:10.930> at<00:01:11.170> the<00:01:11.230> top<00:01:11.440> now<00:01:12.160> one

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
put two chimneys at the top now one

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.710 
put two chimneys at the top now one
chimney<00:01:12.640> is<00:01:12.820> going<00:01:12.970> to<00:01:13.060> be<00:01:13.120> directly<00:01:13.480> above

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
chimney is going to be directly above

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.970 
chimney is going to be directly above
the<00:01:13.870> candles<00:01:14.290> and<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:14.620> other<00:01:14.740> one<00:01:14.950> is

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
the candles and the other one is

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.460 
the candles and the other one is
basically<00:01:15.580> open<00:01:16.090> to<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.510> sphere<00:01:17.170> of<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:17.320> year

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
basically open to the sphere of the year

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.960 
basically open to the sphere of the year
in<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.650> room<00:01:17.830> and<00:01:18.610> so<00:01:18.730> what's<00:01:18.909> happening

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
in the room and so what's happening

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.990 
in the room and so what's happening
basically<00:01:19.720> is<00:01:19.990> as<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:21.040> hot<00:01:21.430> air<00:01:21.610> is<00:01:21.730> warm

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
basically is as the hot air is warm

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.120 
basically is as the hot air is warm
inside<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.750> aquarium<00:01:23.050> that<00:01:23.470> has<00:01:23.620> the<00:01:23.740> candles

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
inside the aquarium that has the candles

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.310 
inside the aquarium that has the candles
on<00:01:24.490> it<00:01:24.520> it's<00:01:25.120> going<00:01:25.330> to<00:01:25.420> rise<00:01:25.659> up<00:01:25.960> out<00:01:26.110> of<00:01:26.170> the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
on it it's going to rise up out of the

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.770 
on it it's going to rise up out of the
aquarium<00:01:26.560> now<00:01:27.490> because<00:01:28.150> the<00:01:28.270> air<00:01:28.450> is<00:01:28.480> rising

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
aquarium now because the air is rising

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.020 
aquarium now because the air is rising
up<00:01:29.230> it<00:01:29.500> would<00:01:29.800> create<00:01:30.010> a<00:01:30.130> vacuum<00:01:30.400> if<00:01:30.790> we<00:01:30.909> were

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
up it would create a vacuum if we were

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.330 
up it would create a vacuum if we were
to<00:01:31.120> release<00:01:31.540> air<00:01:31.930> without<00:01:32.470> having<00:01:32.890> other<00:01:33.100> air

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
to release air without having other air

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.460 
to release air without having other air
come<00:01:33.550> in<00:01:33.670> to<00:01:33.790> replace<00:01:34.090> it<00:01:34.300> so<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.080> colder<00:01:35.440> air

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
come in to replace it so the colder air

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.110 
come in to replace it so the colder air
on<00:01:35.800> the<00:01:35.920> other<00:01:36.100> side<00:01:36.400> of<00:01:36.430> the<00:01:36.520> aquarium<00:01:36.790> is

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
on the other side of the aquarium is

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.330 
on the other side of the aquarium is
coming<00:01:37.479> in<00:01:37.630> through<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.200> event<00:01:38.650> basically

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
coming in through the event basically

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.620 
coming in through the event basically
you're<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.580> chimney<00:01:39.880> on<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.120> other<00:01:40.300> side<00:01:40.600> of

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
you're the chimney on the other side of

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.420 
you're the chimney on the other side of
the<00:01:40.750> aquarium<00:01:41.020> and<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.800> creates<00:01:42.100> a<00:01:42.220> live

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
the aquarium and it creates a live

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.950 
the aquarium and it creates a live
convection<00:01:43.060> current<00:01:43.390> that<00:01:43.479> comes<00:01:43.690> through

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
convection current that comes through

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.170 
convection current that comes through
now<00:01:44.590> we<00:01:44.650> can't<00:01:44.950> see<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.310> support<00:01:45.729> so<00:01:45.909> we<00:01:46.030> need

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
now we can't see the support so we need

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.219 
now we can't see the support so we need
to<00:01:46.270> have<00:01:46.390> something<00:01:46.750> that<00:01:46.870> we<00:01:46.960> can<00:01:47.080> identify

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
to have something that we can identify

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.500 
to have something that we can identify
the<00:01:47.650> current<00:01:48.130> with<00:01:48.280> and<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.120> current<00:01:49.420> is

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
the current with and the current is

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.850 
the current with and the current is
basically<00:01:49.840> going<00:01:49.930> to<00:01:49.990> be<00:01:50.080> identified<00:01:50.229> the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
basically going to be identified the

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.020 
basically going to be identified the
aquarium<00:01:51.310> by<00:01:51.729> utilizing<00:01:52.270> some<00:01:52.420> incense

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
aquarium by utilizing some incense

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.760 
aquarium by utilizing some incense
we<00:01:53.150> burn<00:01:53.360> and<00:01:53.900> we<00:01:53.990> put<00:01:54.140> in<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.290> top<00:01:54.500> of<00:01:54.530> the

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
we burn and we put in the top of the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.190 
we burn and we put in the top of the
chimney<00:01:55.010> that's<00:01:55.640> on<00:01:55.790> the<00:01:55.909> cold<00:01:56.119> side<00:01:56.210> now

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
chimney that's on the cold side now

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.450 
chimney that's on the cold side now
essentially<00:01:57.530> what's<00:01:57.710> happening<00:01:58.070> is<00:01:58.190> as<00:01:58.340> the

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
essentially what's happening is as the

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.580 
essentially what's happening is as the
color<00:01:58.700> is<00:01:58.940> being<00:01:59.150> pulled<00:01:59.450> in<00:01:59.600> to<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:00.290> aquarium

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
color is being pulled in to the aquarium

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.109 
color is being pulled in to the aquarium
to<00:02:00.920> replace<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.460> warm<00:02:01.700> air<00:02:01.880> that's<00:02:02.060> coming

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
to replace the warm air that's coming

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.149 
to replace the warm air that's coming
out<00:02:02.479> on<00:02:02.659> the<00:02:02.690> other<00:02:02.780> side<00:02:03.049> we're<00:02:03.860> going<00:02:03.950> to<00:02:04.040> see

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
out on the other side we're going to see

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.190 
out on the other side we're going to see
smoke<00:02:04.460> coming<00:02:04.490> through<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:05.479> creating<00:02:05.960> a

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
smoke coming through and creating a

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.169 
smoke coming through and creating a
basically<00:02:06.619> a<00:02:06.740> convection<00:02:07.310> current<00:02:07.670> so<00:02:08.149> that

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
basically a convection current so that

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.180 
basically a convection current so that
we<00:02:08.390> can<00:02:08.539> see<00:02:08.750> it<00:02:08.899> now<00:02:09.110> this<00:02:09.709> essentially<00:02:10.160> is

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
we can see it now this essentially is

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.550 
we can see it now this essentially is
what<00:02:10.429> works<00:02:10.700> in<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.420> atmosphere<00:02:11.959> we<00:02:12.470> have

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
what works in the atmosphere we have

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.690 
what works in the atmosphere we have
convection<00:02:12.830> currents<00:02:13.250> all<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.520> time

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
convection currents all the time

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.729 
convection currents all the time
basically<00:02:14.690> we<00:02:14.810> have<00:02:14.840> warm<00:02:15.290> air<00:02:15.500> that's<00:02:15.680> coming

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
basically we have warm air that's coming

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.559 
basically we have warm air that's coming
out<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.100> tropical<00:02:16.610> side<00:02:16.819> of<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.510> earth

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
out the tropical side of the earth

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.750 
out the tropical side of the earth
basically<00:02:18.050> all<00:02:18.440> around<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.770> equator<00:02:18.920> that<00:02:19.670> is

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
basically all around the equator that is

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.760 
basically all around the equator that is
constantly<00:02:19.970> rising<00:02:20.360> up<00:02:20.750> because<00:02:21.319> it<00:02:21.440> receives

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
constantly rising up because it receives

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.350 
constantly rising up because it receives
the<00:02:21.890> most<00:02:22.010> sunlight<00:02:22.310> regardless<00:02:23.090> of<00:02:23.239> the

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
the most sunlight regardless of the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.780 
the most sunlight regardless of the
season<00:02:23.690> so<00:02:24.380> that's<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.739> warm<00:02:24.980> tropical<00:02:25.370> air

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
season so that's the warm tropical air

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.610 
season so that's the warm tropical air
well<00:02:26.390> it<00:02:26.450> always<00:02:26.570> competes<00:02:27.050> against<00:02:27.470> the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
well it always competes against the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.830 
well it always competes against the
colder<00:02:28.070> more<00:02:28.430> dense<00:02:28.700> air<00:02:28.970> that's<00:02:29.420> coming<00:02:29.540> off

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
colder more dense air that's coming off

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.180 
colder more dense air that's coming off
the<00:02:29.989> north<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.410> south<00:02:30.560> poles<00:02:30.890> of<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.070> earth

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
the north and south poles of the earth

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.280 
the north and south poles of the earth
so<00:02:31.850> we<00:02:31.940> consistently<00:02:32.360> have<00:02:32.630> these<00:02:32.810> convection

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
so we consistently have these convection

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.680 
so we consistently have these convection
currents<00:02:33.680> that<00:02:34.100> are<00:02:34.160> continuing<00:02:34.820> cycling

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
currents that are continuing cycling

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.750 
currents that are continuing cycling
through<00:02:36.260> our<00:02:36.380> atmosphere<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:37.190> causing

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
through our atmosphere and causing

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.550 
through our atmosphere and causing
weather<00:02:37.940> adjustments<00:02:38.569> and<00:02:38.690> also<00:02:39.200> causing

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
weather adjustments and also causing

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.770 
weather adjustments and also causing
storms<00:02:39.950> in<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.220> clouds<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.700> build<00:02:41.000> up<00:02:41.180> during

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
storms in the clouds to build up during

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.449 
storms in the clouds to build up during
these<00:02:41.900> storms<00:02:42.050> and<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:43.040> this<00:02:43.160> is<00:02:43.310> basically

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
these storms and so this is basically

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.699 
these storms and so this is basically
how<00:02:43.819> convection<00:02:44.300> currents<00:02:44.630> are<00:02:44.750> formed<00:02:45.110> okay

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
how convection currents are formed okay

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.050 
how convection currents are formed okay
in<00:02:45.769> this<00:02:45.890> part<00:02:46.190> of<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.430> video<00:02:46.550> we're<00:02:46.880> going<00:02:46.970> to

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
in this part of the video we're going to

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.780 
in this part of the video we're going to
be<00:02:47.120> basically<00:02:47.360> looking<00:02:47.840> at<00:02:47.989> psychrometer<00:02:48.830> now

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
be basically looking at psychrometer now

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.280 
be basically looking at psychrometer now
sigh<00:02:49.970> kilometers<00:02:50.450> are<00:02:50.600> basically<00:02:51.050> an

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
sigh kilometers are basically an

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.720 
sigh kilometers are basically an
instrument<00:02:51.769> that's<00:02:51.860> used<00:02:52.130> by<00:02:52.280> weather

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
instrument that's used by weather

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.670 
instrument that's used by weather
forecasters<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.930> determine<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.530> relative

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
forecasters to determine the relative

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.400 
forecasters to determine the relative
humidity<00:02:55.310> in<00:02:55.430> our<00:02:55.550> atmosphere<00:02:55.930> now<00:02:56.930> relative

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
humidity in our atmosphere now relative

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.770 
humidity in our atmosphere now relative
humidity<00:02:57.860> essentially<00:02:58.610> is<00:02:59.060> how<00:02:59.600> much

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
humidity essentially is how much

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.289 
humidity essentially is how much
moisture<00:03:00.079> is<00:03:00.380> in<00:03:00.560> here<00:03:00.829> based<00:03:01.549> upon<00:03:01.760> how<00:03:02.180> much

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
moisture is in here based upon how much

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:03.970 
moisture is in here based upon how much
moisture<00:03:02.600> the<00:03:02.900> air<00:03:03.049> can<00:03:03.290> hold<00:03:03.320> at<00:03:03.739> a<00:03:03.769> given

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
moisture the air can hold at a given

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.220 
moisture the air can hold at a given
temperature<00:03:04.299> now<00:03:05.299> in<00:03:05.390> class<00:03:05.750> today<00:03:05.989> we

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
temperature now in class today we

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.840 
temperature now in class today we
actually<00:03:06.560> made<00:03:06.769> some<00:03:06.980> cups<00:03:07.220> I<00:03:07.370> kilometers

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
actually made some cups I kilometers

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.360 
actually made some cups I kilometers
basically<00:03:08.750> we<00:03:08.900> use<00:03:09.049> two<00:03:09.260> thermometers<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:10.100> we

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
basically we use two thermometers and we

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.280 
basically we use two thermometers and we
set<00:03:10.670> them<00:03:10.790> on<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:10.970> outside<00:03:11.690> of<00:03:11.900> some<00:03:12.140> tubs

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
set them on the outside of some tubs

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.569 
set them on the outside of some tubs
so<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:13.680> they<00:03:13.769> wouldn't<00:03:14.010> come<00:03:14.250> in<00:03:14.370> contact

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
so that they wouldn't come in contact

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.420 
so that they wouldn't come in contact
with<00:03:14.879> the<00:03:15.000> table<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.870> we<00:03:16.290> went<00:03:16.500> one<00:03:16.829> end<00:03:17.159> with

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
with the table and we went one end with

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.670 
with the table and we went one end with
a<00:03:17.459> cotton<00:03:17.760> swab<00:03:17.969> that<00:03:18.239> was<00:03:18.659> admitted<00:03:19.409> water

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
a cotton swab that was admitted water

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.399 
a cotton swab that was admitted water
and<00:03:19.980> then<00:03:20.430> we<00:03:20.549> left<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.849> underside<00:03:21.269> ride<00:03:21.569> and

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
and then we left the underside ride and

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:23.839 
and then we left the underside ride and
we<00:03:22.530> put<00:03:22.709> this<00:03:22.829> in<00:03:22.980> front<00:03:23.099> of<00:03:23.189> a<00:03:23.310> fan<00:03:23.489> in<00:03:23.760> our

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
we put this in front of a fan in our

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.670 
we put this in front of a fan in our
classroom<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.930> we<00:03:25.109> were<00:03:25.200> able<00:03:25.319> to<00:03:25.500> use<00:03:25.650> a

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
classroom and we were able to use a

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.949 
classroom and we were able to use a
chart<00:03:26.040> based<00:03:26.430> upon<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.939> differences<00:03:27.510> in<00:03:27.780> the

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
chart based upon the differences in the

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.929 
chart based upon the differences in the
two<00:03:27.989> temperature<00:03:28.530> readings<00:03:28.859> and<00:03:29.400> based<00:03:29.790> on

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:29.939 
two temperature readings and based on

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:31.880 
two temperature readings and based on
those<00:03:30.060> two<00:03:30.239> temperatures<00:03:30.750> water<00:03:31.409> relative

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
those two temperatures water relative

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.979 
those two temperatures water relative
humidity<00:03:32.340> would<00:03:32.519> be<00:03:32.609> in<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.790> right<00:03:32.939> now<00:03:33.810> this

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
humidity would be in the right now this

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.899 
humidity would be in the right now this
is<00:03:34.109> why<00:03:34.290> weather<00:03:35.010> forecasters<00:03:35.700> or

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
is why weather forecasters or

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.059 
is why weather forecasters or
meteorologist<00:03:36.840> would<00:03:37.019> use<00:03:37.290> if<00:03:37.859> they<00:03:38.010> were

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
meteorologist would use if they were

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.129 
meteorologist would use if they were
using<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.489> handheld<00:03:38.790> instrument<00:03:39.139> basically

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
using a handheld instrument basically

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:41.780 
using a handheld instrument basically
this<00:03:40.260> handheld<00:03:40.590> instrument<00:03:40.920> is<00:03:41.400> used<00:03:41.430> in

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
this handheld instrument is used in

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.729 
this handheld instrument is used in
their<00:03:41.909> hand<00:03:42.150> but<00:03:42.480> on<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.659> string<00:03:42.959> is<00:03:43.230> slung

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
their hand but on the string is slung

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.190 
their hand but on the string is slung
around<00:03:43.939> outside<00:03:44.939> and<00:03:45.629> they<00:03:45.720> basically<00:03:45.870> would

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
around outside and they basically would

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.050 
around outside and they basically would
have<00:03:46.379> one<00:03:46.620> side<00:03:46.799> of<00:03:46.859> the<00:03:47.370> monitor<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:47.939> would

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
have one side of the monitor that would

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.910 
have one side of the monitor that would
be<00:03:48.180> left<00:03:48.359> with<00:03:48.659> the<00:03:49.260> end<00:03:49.349> of<00:03:49.439> the<00:03:49.530> motor<00:03:49.829> that

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
be left with the end of the motor that

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.069 
be left with the end of the motor that
we<00:03:50.280> left<00:03:50.489> dry<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:51.120> by<00:03:51.510> using<00:03:51.689> the<00:03:51.900> same

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
we left dry and by using the same

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.289 
we left dry and by using the same
calculations<00:03:52.769> we<00:03:52.919> used<00:03:53.129> in<00:03:53.310> class<00:03:53.519> you<00:03:54.180> would

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
calculations we used in class you would

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.449 
calculations we used in class you would
determine<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:54.810> relative<00:03:54.959> humidity<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.859> the

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
determine the relative humidity and the

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.759 
determine the relative humidity and the
atmosphere<00:03:56.609> in<00:03:57.180> a<00:03:57.299> given<00:03:57.569> area<00:03:57.689> so<00:03:58.620> I<00:03:58.680> hope

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
atmosphere in a given area so I hope

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.740 
atmosphere in a given area so I hope
this<00:03:58.859> helps<00:03:59.250> without<00:03:59.669> how<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.060> read<00:04:00.329> relative

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
this helps without how to read relative

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.640 
this helps without how to read relative
humidity<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:01.590> what<00:04:01.739> a<00:04:01.769> seismometer<00:04:02.220> it<00:04:02.549> is

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
humidity and what a seismometer it is

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.990 
humidity and what a seismometer it is
