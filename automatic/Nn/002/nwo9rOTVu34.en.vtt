a video of those they're not worthy but
mainly<00:00:55.050> because<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.410> believe<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.680> tweeters<00:00:55.980> in

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
mainly because I believe the tweeters in

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.119 
mainly because I believe the tweeters in
them<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.489> pissed<00:00:56.760> at<00:00:56.879> them<00:00:56.969> right<00:00:57.090> now<00:00:57.149> but

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
them so pissed at them right now but

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.340 
them so pissed at them right now but
basically<00:00:59.129> there's<00:01:00.000> no<00:01:00.120> really<00:01:00.359> no<00:01:00.780> real<00:01:01.170> way

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
basically there's no really no real way

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.369 
basically there's no really no real way
to<00:01:01.379> access<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.039> tweeters<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:03.199> it's<00:01:04.199> quite

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
to access the tweeters and it's quite

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.480 
to access the tweeters and it's quite
difficult<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.739> clean<00:01:05.720> but<00:01:06.979> it<00:01:07.979> covers<00:01:08.220> our

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
difficult to clean but it covers our

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.130
