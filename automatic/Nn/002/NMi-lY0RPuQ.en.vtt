00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.589
 already know congratulations like it 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 vitesse just makes two buddies too 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.099
 big as today 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.540
 after 2 maybe exaggerating make for 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.320
 us the better party we prepare 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.969
 she nominated 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.700
 we have had the first good football too 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.839
 played second half I thought we were 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.039
 because the plane did not play on the hunt 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.449
 went to that third goal because I think 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.980
 it just has to score that third goal 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.289
 then the match is over as long as it is two 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.980
 one still remains exciting 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.300
 but otherwise I think he is 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.599
 played well 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.000
 think we have played well first 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.470
 half still ask very good position game 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.050
 yes but you know they are on top 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.600
 fly here with the athletes behind it and 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.190
 its that the flight is busy but is a lot 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.600
 detail and rounds 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.120
 At some point they went further back and forth 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.040
 came in french football and I think the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.329
 first half to leave a few extra 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.309
 goals would make the game ever 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.899
 to throw something up but already had one 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.420
 I just noticed a good victory 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.160
 in the cats come here was what did you want 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.899
 about the second goal of vitesse die 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.699
 above it shot through by the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.949
 goalkeeper and mourning player 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.590
 and it actually feels that you 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.030
 men must discard understood 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.180
 yes I think the rule is the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.640
 the referee decides whether or not a team de 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.610
 ball must return or passed 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.439
 may be and yes that moment stood nac 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.420
 next press and in shots rights that 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.790
 figure is could grab I believe again and again 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.040
 combine but I think we combine 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.470
 that they at where the seven airport and 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.970
 we just continued to play the interest 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.340
 no one on the field with an injury 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.299
 or so so I don't know where that commotion 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.470
 comes from 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.390
 I don't think it the other way around either 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.409
 had done the right thing 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.700
 corner point 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.960
 beating yo in the netherlands that concerns 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.369
 because of it I find it as nonsense as them 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.720
 play is based we shine with 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.579
 have spoken to each other then you have one 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.810
 band back ever but you already have to 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.369
 his opponent wants to change that 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.689
 ball back oh you were soon 3 0 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.159
 a ball must go back 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.899
 throwing a dick story to someone 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.070
 play football and make sure you win 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.620
 and do not involve this sort of thing 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.450
 and around it you have such a second one 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.540
 be half flatter 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.310
 how did i think we were too much 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.710
 unknowingly quickly thought of it 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.150
 hold on to that lead and I think 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.530
 always that you have the best that prosperity 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.210
 can be held by that third party 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.800
 but then you have to be there too 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.540
 go to the end of the hunt and there 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.310
 I think we checked back for it 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.780
 we have not played at all 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.430
 been the trouble if they lost the ball 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.740
 we were immediately busy and we had 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.110
 the ball back very quickly so have that 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.880
 we did excellent but forward 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.450
 I think we are in the final phase 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.459
 actually have to create more naps 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.010
 team with a lot of purchasing power and they try 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.390
 also but i think it 's good by 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.880
 Dekker continued giving them little 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.470
 came to our goal and yes it is 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.680
 where he is they came combi the ball 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.660
 easily in the hands of a yes that 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.130
 We did well and what you said I think 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.600
 nakken the first half for all your previous ones 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.239
 give in the second half so she started 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.350
 yet equally fanatical and as tight this 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.570
 also gone 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.310
 too bad we omit this every 3 and 4 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.900
 who don't score so it 's one 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.000
 have an easier evening because you know 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.310
 never how it goes but keep it right 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.970
 done little given away and rightly three 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.970
 points taken note
