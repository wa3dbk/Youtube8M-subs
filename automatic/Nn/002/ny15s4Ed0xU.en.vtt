making another lucky is I think it's a

dream a lot in the duck he was one of

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.830 
dream a lot in the duck he was one of
the<00:00:36.270> first<00:00:36.720> PC<00:00:37.530> game<00:00:37.740> I<00:00:37.920> played<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.880> straight

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.560 

honestly<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.989> applied<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.010> infer<00:00:44.580> and<00:00:44.790> because

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
honestly I applied to infer and because

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:56.689 
honestly I applied to infer and because
of<00:00:46.940> this<00:00:47.940> game<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.660> was<00:00:48.870> incredible<00:00:55.220> Atari<00:00:56.220> had

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
of this game it was incredible Atari had

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.450 
of this game it was incredible Atari had
available<00:00:57.510> along<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.199> dark<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:59.250> said

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
available along the dark and we said

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.420 
available along the dark and we said
this<00:00:59.820> would<00:01:00.090> be<00:01:00.150> our<00:01:00.449> dream<00:01:00.720> project<00:01:01.590> we<00:01:02.100> want

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
this would be our dream project we want

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.970 
this would be our dream project we want
to<00:01:02.820> pitch<00:01:03.089> our<00:01:03.510> ideas<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.440> what<00:01:04.620> along<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
to pitch our ideas of what along the

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.190 
to pitch our ideas of what along the
dark<00:01:05.190> should<00:01:05.339> be<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:09.150> first<00:01:09.390> proposal<00:01:09.810> have

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
dark should be the first proposal have

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.350 
dark should be the first proposal have
the<00:01:10.350> concept<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.890> DM<00:01:11.190> was<00:01:11.400> maybe<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:12.300> little

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
the concept of the DM was maybe a little

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.760 
the concept of the DM was maybe a little
bit<00:01:12.659> too<00:01:13.020> ambitious<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:14.510> innovative

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
bit too ambitious and innovative

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.490 
bit too ambitious and innovative
so<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:17.460> means<00:01:17.700> too<00:01:17.909> risky<00:01:18.360> for<00:01:18.390> producer

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
so that means too risky for producer

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.969 
so that means too risky for producer
we<00:01:19.860> worked<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.430> think<00:01:20.760> at<00:01:21.120> month<00:01:21.860> making<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
we worked I think at month making the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.910 
we worked I think at month making the
full<00:01:23.220> design<00:01:23.760> proving<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.930> trying<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.590> prove

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
full design proving that trying to prove

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.010 
full design proving that trying to prove
that<00:01:26.549> we<00:01:26.850> were<00:01:27.270> able<00:01:27.510> to<00:01:27.540> make<00:01:27.750> it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.960 

we<00:01:32.020> gave<00:01:32.259> all<00:01:32.530> our<00:01:32.560> hearts<00:01:33.130> we<00:01:33.310> got<00:01:33.520> Senate's

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
we gave all our hearts we got Senate's

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.090 
we gave all our hearts we got Senate's
in<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.840> concept<00:01:35.290> and<00:01:35.439> said<00:01:35.590> this<00:01:35.710> is<00:01:35.860> what<00:01:36.009> we

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
in the concept and said this is what we

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.380 
in the concept and said this is what we
believe<00:01:36.399> and<00:01:36.610> this<00:01:36.700> is<00:01:36.850> our<00:01:36.970> vision<00:01:37.210> that

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
believe and this is our vision that

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.679 
believe and this is our vision that
alone<00:01:37.810> should<00:01:37.960> be<00:01:38.170> butts<00:01:39.159> at<00:01:39.310> that<00:01:39.460> moment

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
alone should be butts at that moment

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.210 
alone should be butts at that moment
Atari<00:01:40.689> was<00:01:40.930> not<00:01:41.110> sure<00:01:41.320> we<00:01:41.560> were<00:01:41.680> able<00:01:41.829> to<00:01:41.979> make

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
Atari was not sure we were able to make

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.819 
Atari was not sure we were able to make
it<00:01:42.369> because<00:01:43.060> it<00:01:43.180> was<00:01:43.329> so<00:01:43.509> ambitious<00:01:43.740> when<00:01:44.740> you

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
it because it was so ambitious when you

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.620 
it because it was so ambitious when you
see<00:01:44.979> the<00:01:45.100> game<00:01:45.310> this<00:01:46.000> was<00:01:46.210> from<00:01:46.360> the<00:01:46.539> beginning

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
see the game this was from the beginning

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.800 
see the game this was from the beginning
for<00:01:47.560> example<00:01:47.920> everything<00:01:48.159> collapsing<00:01:48.850> the

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
for example everything collapsing the

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.889 
for example everything collapsing the
real<00:01:50.380> use<00:01:50.619> of<00:01:50.799> objects<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.780> manipulation<00:01:52.780> of

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
real use of objects the manipulation of

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.289 
real use of objects the manipulation of
the<00:01:53.020> objects<00:01:53.439> everything<00:01:53.979> was<00:01:54.159> in<00:01:54.340> the

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
the objects everything was in the

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.679 
the objects everything was in the
original<00:01:55.990> and<00:01:56.979> a<00:01:57.130> certain<00:01:57.520> time<00:01:57.789> they<00:01:58.479> said

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
original and a certain time they said

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.289 
original and a certain time they said
well<00:01:58.840> maybe<00:01:59.020> yeah<00:01:59.860> guys<00:02:00.310> this<00:02:00.579> these<00:02:00.970> ideas

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
well maybe yeah guys this these ideas

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:02.490 
well maybe yeah guys this these ideas
are<00:02:01.450> great<00:02:01.600> but<00:02:01.780> maybe<00:02:02.020> it's<00:02:02.229> a<00:02:02.319> bit<00:02:02.470> too

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
are great but maybe it's a bit too

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.680 
are great but maybe it's a bit too
ambitious<00:02:02.979> it's<00:02:03.429> maybe<00:02:04.000> it's<00:02:04.179> not<00:02:04.360> what<00:02:04.569> we

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
ambitious it's maybe it's not what we

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.340 
ambitious it's maybe it's not what we
can<00:02:04.899> it<00:02:05.440> can<00:02:05.649> be<00:02:05.799> realized<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.520> ice<00:02:06.670> when<00:02:06.909> we

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
can it can be realized and ice when we

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.010 
can it can be realized and ice when we
actually<00:02:08.350> got<00:02:08.709> killed<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.549> project<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.209> was

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.270 

they<00:02:13.770> decided<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.220> give<00:02:14.490> us<00:02:14.520> six<00:02:15.270> months<00:02:15.420> to

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
they decided to give us six months to

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.120 
they decided to give us six months to
give<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.430> try<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.000> we<00:02:18.120> made<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.630> prototype<00:02:19.260> we

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
give it a try so we made a prototype we

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.950 
give it a try so we made a prototype we
worked<00:02:20.430> on<00:02:20.780> put<00:02:21.780> on<00:02:22.070> an<00:02:23.070> exercise<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.790> making<00:02:24.000> a

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
worked on put on an exercise of making a

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.400 
worked on put on an exercise of making a
small<00:02:25.770> piece<00:02:26.630> what<00:02:27.630> we<00:02:27.780> call<00:02:27.930> in<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.380> industry

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
small piece what we call in the industry

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.190 
small piece what we call in the industry
a<00:02:28.860> vertical<00:02:29.280> slice<00:02:29.550> we<00:02:30.300> made<00:02:30.480> our<00:02:30.780> first

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
a vertical slice we made our first

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.000 
a vertical slice we made our first
prototype<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:32.040> we<00:02:32.550> were<00:02:32.700> able<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.360> have<00:02:34.010> Hiro

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
prototype and we were able to have Hiro

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.200 
prototype and we were able to have Hiro
able<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.880> run<00:02:36.870> jump<00:02:37.290> go<00:02:38.070> in<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.310> car<00:02:38.550> go<00:02:38.820> out<00:02:39.000> of

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
able to run jump go in the car go out of

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.430 
able to run jump go in the car go out of
the<00:02:39.330> car<00:02:39.510> use<00:02:40.230> every<00:02:40.800> object<00:02:41.160> around<00:02:42.260> we<00:02:43.260> said

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
the car use every object around we said

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.400 
the car use every object around we said
okay<00:02:43.770> now<00:02:44.250> we<00:02:44.310> can<00:02:44.640> be<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.000> food<00:02:45.750> adventure<00:02:45.960> game

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
okay now we can be a food adventure game

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.190 
okay now we can be a food adventure game
we<00:02:47.100> worked<00:02:47.430> really<00:02:47.880> hard<00:02:48.000> we've<00:02:48.600> invested<00:02:49.050> so
