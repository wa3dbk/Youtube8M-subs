00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
where the net joins the body you know

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
where the net joins the body you know
they<00:01:54.520> used<00:01:54.640> to<00:01:54.670> call<00:01:54.850> this<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.119> neck<00:01:55.300> block

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540

they used to call this the neck block
right<00:01:55.930> this<00:01:56.290> area<00:01:57.780> changed<00:01:58.780> a<00:01:58.840> lot<00:01:58.990> and<00:01:59.760> the

right this area changed a lot and the

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.320 
right this area changed a lot and the
first<00:02:01.060> ones<00:02:01.420> weren't<00:02:02.160> fortified<00:02:03.160> like<00:02:04.060> right

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
first ones weren't fortified like right

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.990 
first ones weren't fortified like right
in<00:02:04.450> this<00:02:04.539> area<00:02:04.899> where<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.140> neck<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:06.399> it's<00:02:06.640> you

in this area where the neck and it's you

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.900 
in this area where the neck and it's you
know<00:02:07.380> thickest<00:02:08.380> would<00:02:08.979> join<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.399> body<00:02:09.610> so<00:02:09.850> it

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
know thickest would join the body so it

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.850 
know thickest would join the body so it
was<00:02:10.000> fairly<00:02:10.240> thin<00:02:10.690> but<00:02:10.960> if<00:02:11.350> you<00:02:11.440> look<00:02:11.590> closely

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
was fairly thin but if you look closely

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.880 
was fairly thin but if you look closely

if you had heavier strings on your

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.160 
if you had heavier strings on your
instrument<00:02:33.910> then<00:02:34.660> there'd<00:02:34.840> be<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:34.960> lot<00:02:35.110> of

instrument then there'd be a lot of
pressure<00:02:35.470> dinner<00:02:35.940> but<00:02:36.940> this<00:02:37.740> SG<00:02:38.740> standard<00:02:39.300> has

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
a fortified area there that's not too

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.300 
a fortified area there that's not too
bulky<00:02:43.360> and<00:02:44.110> some<00:02:44.319> of<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.500> cheaper<00:02:44.800> s<00:02:45.040> keys

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
have this great big block that used to

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.630 
have this great big block that used to
come<00:02:47.230> out<00:02:47.260> those<00:02:47.530> you<00:02:47.770> know<00:02:47.860> really<00:02:48.100> ugly<00:02:48.280> to

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
come out those you know really ugly to

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.590 
come out those you know really ugly to
look<00:02:48.940> at

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
look at

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.900 
look at
plus<00:02:50.020> when<00:02:50.230> you<00:02:50.319> played<00:02:50.590> it<00:02:50.770> up<00:02:50.860> in<00:02:51.010> here<00:02:51.220> you

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
plus when you played it up in here you

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.550 
plus when you played it up in here you
know<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.120> felt<00:02:52.270> this<00:02:52.420> big<00:02:52.660> piece<00:02:52.900> of<00:02:52.930> wood<00:02:53.260> hit

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
know you felt this big piece of wood hit

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.830 
know you felt this big piece of wood hit
you<00:02:54.160> know<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.370> Pamir<00:02:54.760> has<00:02:54.970> your<00:02:55.209> come<00:02:55.450> here<00:02:55.690> so

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
you know the Pamir has your come here so

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.380 
you know the Pamir has your come here so
it<00:02:55.900> wasn't<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.230> comfortable<00:02:56.740> to<00:02:56.830> play<00:02:57.010> either

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
it wasn't the comfortable to play either

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.070 
it wasn't the comfortable to play either
so<00:02:58.440> these<00:02:59.440> are<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.709> most<00:02:59.860> desirable<00:03:00.780> design<00:03:01.780> I

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
so these are the most desirable design I

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.240 
so these are the most desirable design I
think<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:03.700> also<00:03:04.270> like<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:04.870> fact<00:03:04.900> that<00:03:05.260> the

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
think and I also like the fact that the

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.130 
think and I also like the fact that the
standards<00:03:06.790> have<00:03:06.940> this<00:03:07.120> binding<00:03:07.720> on<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.960> net

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
standards have this binding on the net

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.940 
standards have this binding on the net
which<00:03:08.470> gives<00:03:08.710> it<00:03:08.830> a<00:03:08.920> more<00:03:09.070> elegant

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
which gives it a more elegant

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.860 
which gives it a more elegant
