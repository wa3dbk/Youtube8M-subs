00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
with some flour okay and we're going to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.049 
with some flour okay and we're going to
go<00:00:46.050> ahead<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.260> create<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.800> dough<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.219> I'm<00:00:47.610> let

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
go ahead and create the dough so I'm let

go ahead and create the dough so I'm let
me<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.360> explain<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.780> ingredients<00:00:49.200> here<00:00:49.320> we

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
me just explain the ingredients here we

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.310 
me just explain the ingredients here we
get<00:00:49.530> some<00:00:49.680> semolina<00:00:49.980> flour<00:00:50.190> water<00:00:50.969> yeast<00:00:51.360> a

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
get some semolina flour water yeast a

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.290 
get some semolina flour water yeast a
little<00:00:52.890> bit<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.100> honey<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:54.090> will<00:00:54.270> help

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
little bit of honey and this will help

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.510 
little bit of honey and this will help
to<00:00:54.750> activate<00:00:55.379> some<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.829> yeast<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.370> give

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
to activate some of that yeast and give

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.279 
to activate some of that yeast and give
it<00:00:56.550> some<00:00:56.820> food<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.270> get<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.629> thing<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:58.050> pop

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
it some food and get this thing to pop

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.080 
it some food and get this thing to pop
up<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.649> instead<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.100> sugar<00:00:59.430> because<00:00:59.940> it's

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
up so instead of sugar because it's

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.900 
up so instead of sugar because it's
better<00:01:00.270> shines<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.840> sugar<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.920> let's<00:01:02.760> begin

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
better shines you sugar so let's begin

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.100 
better shines you sugar so let's begin
at<00:01:03.090> first<00:01:03.390> we're<00:01:03.570> going<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.750> we're<00:01:03.930> going<00:01:04.049> to

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
at first we're going to we're going to

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.750 
at first we're going to we're going to
start<00:01:04.379> by<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:06.920> putting<00:01:07.920> these<00:01:08.189> wet

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
start by and putting these wet

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.660 
start by and putting these wet
ingredients<00:01:09.299> together<00:01:09.450> first<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.310> so<00:01:11.310> we

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
ingredients together first and so we

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.149 
ingredients together first and so we
have<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.030> honey<00:01:12.360> we<00:01:12.780> have<00:01:13.020> our<00:01:13.260> yeast<00:01:13.530> which

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
have that honey we have our yeast which

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.219 
have that honey we have our yeast which
is<00:01:14.310> approximately<00:01:14.610> one<00:01:15.090> package<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.049> that's

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
is approximately one package and that's

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.200 
is approximately one package and that's
active<00:01:16.619> dry<00:01:16.770> yeast<00:01:16.799> that's<00:01:17.159> active<00:01:17.549> tiny<00:01:17.820> so

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
active dry yeast that's active tiny so

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.280 
active dry yeast that's active tiny so
we're<00:01:18.330> going<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.509> put<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.869> little<00:01:19.110> bit<00:01:19.200> of

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
we're going to put in a little bit of

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.580 
we're going to put in a little bit of
salt<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:20.150> about<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> quarter<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.630> teaspoon<00:01:21.810> and

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.969 
salt a about a quarter of a teaspoon and
I<00:01:23.580> have<00:01:23.790> two<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> half<00:01:24.270> cups<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.600> flour<00:01:24.979> so

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
I have two and a half cups of flour so

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.880 
I have two and a half cups of flour so
it's<00:01:26.159> semolina<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:27.060> Emily<00:01:27.420> okay<00:01:27.720> okay<00:01:27.990> so

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
usually what we do first as we get this

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.630 
usually what we do first as we get this
to<00:01:31.670> activate<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.180> we'll<00:01:34.110> mix<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.130> around<00:01:35.250> here

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
to activate and we'll mix it around here

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.830 
to activate and we'll mix it around here
first<00:01:37.009> now<00:01:38.009> with<00:01:38.310> some<00:01:38.520> yeast<00:01:39.000> starters<00:01:39.750> don't

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
first now with some yeast starters don't

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.200 
first now with some yeast starters don't
you<00:01:40.020> let<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.590> sit<00:01:40.860> for<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.130> while<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.579> bubble<00:01:41.909> is

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
you let it sit for a while and bubble is

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.480 
you let it sit for a while and bubble is
that<00:01:42.420> correct<00:01:42.600> yes<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:43.320> run<00:01:43.470> on<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.890> run

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
that correct yes I can run on this run

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.600 
that correct yes I can run on this run
this<00:01:44.670> insulting

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
this insulting

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.490 
this insulting
so<00:01:48.270> I'll<00:01:48.390> just<00:01:48.420> mix<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.900> around<00:01:49.050> a<00:01:49.350> little

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500
