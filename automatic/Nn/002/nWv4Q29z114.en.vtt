the on the internet you're going to

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.440 
the on the internet you're going to
learn<00:01:08.830> how<00:01:09.070> to<00:01:09.100> do<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.400> power<00:01:09.610> jump<00:01:09.970> but<00:01:10.420> I

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
learn how to do the power jump but I

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.960 
learn how to do the power jump but I
wonder<00:01:10.930> we<00:01:11.470> call<00:01:11.650> it<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:11.950> power<00:01:12.100> jump<00:01:12.490> because

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
wonder we call it the power jump because

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.460 
wonder we call it the power jump because
from<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.330> power<00:01:13.479> jump<00:01:13.780> you<00:01:13.869> can<00:01:13.930> do<00:01:14.080> doubles

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
from the power jump you can do doubles

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.700 
from the power jump you can do doubles
triples<00:01:14.890> quadruples<00:01:15.750> principals<00:01:16.750> don't
