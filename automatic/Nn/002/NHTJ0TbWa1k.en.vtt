actually<00:04:08.700> at<00:04:08.790> home<00:04:09.030> I<00:04:09.210> was<00:04:09.360> in<00:04:09.480> Georgia<00:04:09.690> I<00:04:09.930> was

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
actually at home I was in Georgia I was

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.470 
actually at home I was in Georgia I was
I<00:04:10.470> was<00:04:10.890> actually<00:04:11.040> just<00:04:11.370> left<00:04:11.670> and<00:04:12.060> I<00:04:12.120> was<00:04:12.210> going

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
I was actually just left and I was going

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.230 
I was actually just left and I was going
real<00:04:12.690> hard<00:04:12.960> in<00:04:13.490> the<00:04:14.490> infirmary

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
real hard in the infirmary

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.120 
real hard in the infirmary
so<00:04:15.360> the<00:04:15.480> lot<00:04:15.630> actually<00:04:15.960> gave<00:04:16.260> you<00:04:16.440> time<00:04:16.710> to<00:04:16.890> get

back<00:04:17.340> to<00:04:17.580> where<00:04:17.700> you<00:04:17.850> like<00:04:18.390> I<00:04:18.480> said<00:04:18.720> Lord<00:04:19.260> works
