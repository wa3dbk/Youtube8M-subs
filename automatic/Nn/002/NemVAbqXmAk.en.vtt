00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.799
 and the bedrooms are a very 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.920
 special and we must lend a lot 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.170
 attention to its decoration since this one 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:27.029
 can influence the quality of 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:29.880
 our rest the color is fundamental 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.980
 in the decoration and in a bedroom its 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.410
 election must be at the service of the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.290
 tranquility when painting 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.230
 walls choose soft light shades and 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.660
 warm like your own skin this is the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.280
 beige case cream yellow 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.860
 straw or salmon also result 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.750
 envelopes the warm grays the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.750
 green water and turquoise 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.960
 starting from this base we can start 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.120
 to think about the decoration of our 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.180
 bedroom and the style that we are 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.550
 looking for the classic patterns 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.350
 decorative have become more flexible 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.350
 very much giving way to new schemes 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.170
 let's start with a bedroom in shades 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.960
 creams beige and brown is wood 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.940
 always offers a plus of elegance for 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.340
 what combines perfectly with almost 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:31.070
 all the tones and we can give more 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:33.860
 warmth through textiles avoids 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.660
 choose strong and saturated colors these 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.610
 They generally tend to keep you 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.490
 awake rather than help 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.710
 fall asleep however if 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.200
 you prefer to incorporate some color in 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.320
 the walls that is in small doses 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.750
 the strong colors of this year are the 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:57.110
 raspberry the blue emerald green 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:59.630
 electric and yellow in general the color 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.490
 of the walls will have a lot to do with 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.490
 the style you want for your room 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.740
 the windows are essential in this 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.110
 space the environment must have a 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.960
 good ventilation that purifies the air 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.360
 in the morning this ventilation and the 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.730
 The passage of natural light is favorable for 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.650
 health but in moments of rest or 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.890
 privacy curtains or blinds 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.870
 will take a fundamental role the color and 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.940
 The texture of the fabric will allow 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.000
 different levels of light in both 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.250
 directions this web in turn should go 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.130
 coordinated with the rest of the textiles of the 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.230
 bedroom on the other hand light 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.720
 artificial that illuminates the environment in 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.270
 Night schedules should not be a light 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.270
 direct or powerful on the contrary 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.160
 we should look for hanging artifacts and 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.800
 lamps that reflect a type of 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.350
 diffuse or indirect lighting 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.420
 bedside tables or individual lamps are a 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.790
 common element to enjoy a 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.790
 reading without disturbing the sleeper 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.060
 the main piece of this room is 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.910
 the bed and it should also be a space for 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.220
 calm remember that this is where you sleep 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.520
 you rest raisins time thinking or 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.010
 reading the bedding is one of the 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.770
 pieces with greater presence at first 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.320
 view must adapt to the scheme of 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.880
 colors or color chart that you have 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.470
 chosen for all the decoration 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.450
 Usually the colors chosen are the 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.480
 beige white and a variety of 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.620
 neutral tones but you can join 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.870
 color in pillows or small blankets 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.420
 You can have more designs quilts 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.000
 vibrant within the same scheme to 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.170
 change them and so modify the look of 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.170
 the bed periodically 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.069
 if you do not have a built-in closet 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.530
 get one that also has harmony 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.689
 with the bedroom decor that is 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.599
 of dark colors and that makes it 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:09.129
 reduce clutter in the room 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.800
 granting that sense of tranquility 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:14.500
 what do we need 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.590
 pixar warmth is the best that can us 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.350
 pass after a good rest singles 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.840
 warm floors like solid wood or 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.210
 laminated and you dress them with rugs 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.770
 Long- haired wool that will tuck your feet 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.770
 when walking barefoot 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:33.689
 decorating our bedroom is a task 

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:36.150
 very intimate in which our 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:38.759
 personality is reflected by 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.889
 countless details find the 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:44.129
 Perfect balance between functionality 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:47.009
 and design is paramount I do not think so 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:50.270
 so much lucidly making a change in the 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.270
 decoration of your bedroom 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.389
