00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello friends with you pasha and trader and 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.830
 I will start now 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.150
 processing details directly all 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.150
 prepared prepared prepared 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.449
 boring head completely goes away she 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.880
 in all detail here she will describe 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.039
 here are such a circular motion with this 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.800
 cutter 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.699
 on this part will be made 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.149
 times 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:35.489
 radius will delve on 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:38.250
 for a start he hit millimeters hit 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:43.340
 millimeter for an hour I already went deep on these 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:46.530
 half a millimeter and turn on the spindle 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.120
 milling machine and start producing 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.120
 residual work 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.509
 Well, generally half a millimeter is the most to me 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:33.549
 it seems the best option is not installing 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:36.189
 overloaded here and in general beats like 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:39.240
 such is not felt and goes in general 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.240
 everything is not bad 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.680
 add another half millimeter 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.600
 everything turns out pretty good and 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.710
 as they say things go office writes 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.350
 Already here something becomes visible now 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:11.450
 cover the light from where 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:16.470
 here from here now this already turns 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:21.320
 Tinker now let us give a closer look 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.320
 to be seen and go further 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:19.729
 so add the next half millimeter and 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.729
 prepare for work 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:08.910
 but now dear viewer we kill with 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:13.280
 the parties here are the kind you organize you 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.280
 see how it happens by 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.159
 this 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:57.539
 dear viewers now we'll see 

00:06:53.159 --> 00:07:02.009
 what do I get here 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:05.360
 such is the detail of the south now 

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:10.520
 appears see a circle such 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:13.250
 here with a diameter of 100 12 millimeters with 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:17.629
 using such a boring head 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.629
 it was all done 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.620
 Well, in general, there are already the last 

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:25.710
 portrait touches 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:29.849
 I do not want to distract your attention 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:32.400
 here is your time here are the details already 

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:34.949
 almost ready to finish it
