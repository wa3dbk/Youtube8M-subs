another video and today we are going to
actually<00:00:06.509> show<00:00:07.020> you<00:00:07.560> exactly<00:00:08.040> step<00:00:08.429> by<00:00:08.460> step

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
actually show you exactly step by step

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.650 
actually show you exactly step by step
on<00:00:10.170> our<00:00:10.920> progression<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:12.090> teaching<00:00:12.599> of

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
on our progression of the teaching of

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.629 
on our progression of the teaching of
split<00:00:12.840> jerk<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.230> our<00:00:13.290> athletes<00:00:13.400> so<00:00:14.400> this

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
split jerk to our athletes so this

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:15.700 
split jerk to our athletes so this
seemed<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.820> be<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.910> three<00:00:15.089> part<00:00:15.120> video<00:00:15.389> series

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 
seemed to be a three part video series

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.680 
seemed to be a three part video series
today<00:00:16.710> will<00:00:16.980> be<00:00:17.039> part<00:00:17.279> 1<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:18.000> we're<00:00:18.510> going<00:00:18.539> to

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
today will be part 1 and we're going to

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.630 
today will be part 1 and we're going to

just take you through our the very basic
progression<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.630> taking<00:00:22.109> someone<00:00:22.320> who's

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
progression of taking someone who's

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.580 
progression of taking someone who's
never<00:00:23.029> done<00:00:24.029> any<00:00:24.240> sort<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:25.140> know<00:00:25.170> push

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
never done any sort of you know push

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.830 
never done any sort of you know push
jerk<00:00:25.769> or<00:00:25.980> split<00:00:26.189> jerk<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.519> their<00:00:26.640> life<00:00:26.840> to

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
teaching them the full split jerk and

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.980 
teaching them the full split jerk and
we've<00:00:29.550> done<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.179> matter<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.840> few

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
we've done this in a matter of a few

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.220 
we've done this in a matter of a few
hours<00:00:31.050> at<00:00:31.830> certain<00:00:32.340> clinics<00:00:32.870> but<00:00:33.870> if<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.079> have

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
hours at certain clinics but if we have

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.110 
hours at certain clinics but if we have
somebody<00:00:34.440> for<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> matter<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.399> few<00:00:35.550> months<00:00:35.910> or

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
somebody for a matter of a few months or

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.420 
somebody for a matter of a few months or
you<00:00:36.719> know<00:00:36.840> longer<00:00:37.200> than<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.530> we'll<00:00:38.250> take<00:00:38.370> our

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
you know longer than that we'll take our

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.889 
you know longer than that we'll take our
time<00:00:38.579> with<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.940> progressions<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.570> make<00:00:39.750> sure

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
time with the progressions and make sure

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.540 
time with the progressions and make sure
that<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.200> techniques<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.950> positions

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
that the techniques and the positions

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.299 
that the techniques and the positions
are<00:00:41.700> sore<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.420> know<00:00:42.540> solidify<00:00:42.780> their<00:00:43.309> rush

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
are sore you know solidify their rush

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.400 
are sore you know solidify their rush
but<00:00:45.030> for<00:00:45.690> today<00:00:45.899> we're<00:00:46.079> going<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.260> go<00:00:46.379> over

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
but for today we're going to go over

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.580 
but for today we're going to go over
part<00:00:47.370> 1<00:00:47.520> which<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.480> going<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.079> push

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
part 1 which is going to be the push

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.670 
part 1 which is going to be the push
press<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.129> then<00:00:50.940> into<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.390> push<00:00:51.600> jerk<00:00:51.629> okay

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
press and then into the push jerk okay

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.819 
press and then into the push jerk okay
so<00:00:53.070> if<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.280> know<00:00:53.370> push<00:00:53.789> press<00:00:54.030> report<00:00:54.829> it

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
so if you know push press report it

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.130 
so if you know push press report it
involves<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:57.059> beginning<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.870> dip<00:00:58.020> and

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
involves the beginning of the dip and

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.630 
involves the beginning of the dip and
drive<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.500> switcher<00:00:58.920> okay<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
drive to the switcher okay so the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.549 
drive to the switcher okay so the
different<00:00:59.910> Drive<00:01:00.030> literally<00:01:00.420> means<00:01:00.629> we're

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
different Drive literally means we're

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.470 
different Drive literally means we're
just<00:01:01.770> bending<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.100> knees<00:01:02.370> slightly<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> lot

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
just bending the knees slightly to a lot

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.119 
just bending the knees slightly to a lot
of<00:01:03.510> quarter<00:01:03.780> squat<00:01:03.960> position<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.559> then

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
of quarter squat position and then

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.039 
of quarter squat position and then
standing<00:01:05.430> back<00:01:05.610> up<00:01:05.869> okay

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
standing back up okay

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.750 
standing back up okay
so<00:01:07.500> again<00:01:07.770> you'll<00:01:07.920> notice<00:01:08.100> from<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.520> side

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
so again you'll notice from the side

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.289 
so again you'll notice from the side
here<00:01:09.030> when<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.420> do<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.780> dipping<00:01:10.080> drive<00:01:11.299> when

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299

we'll show you at the bar in a second

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.530

contrary<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.750> know<00:01:24.869> typical<00:01:25.290> squat

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
contrary to you know typical squat

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.870 
contrary to you know typical squat
movement<00:01:25.830> patterns<00:01:26.340> where<00:01:26.430> everybody<00:01:26.670> wants

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
movement patterns where everybody wants

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.100 
movement patterns where everybody wants
to

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
to

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.470 
to
they're<00:01:27.260> asked<00:01:27.530> back<00:01:27.710> like<00:01:27.950> this<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:28.460> then<00:01:29.240> go

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
they're asked back like this and then go

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.750 
they're asked back like this and then go
down<00:01:29.660> ok<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.740> different<00:01:31.070> driving<00:01:31.250> involves<00:01:31.700> a

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
down ok the different driving involves a

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.550 
down ok the different driving involves a
knees<00:01:31.910> the<00:01:32.180> knees<00:01:32.210> bending<00:01:32.780> alright<00:01:33.290> and<00:01:33.500> the

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
knees the knees bending alright and the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.540 
knees the knees bending alright and the
reason<00:01:33.770> these<00:01:33.980> could<00:01:34.280> you<00:01:34.340> need<00:01:34.400> to<00:01:34.460> stretch

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
reason these could you need to stretch

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.760 
reason these could you need to stretch
those<00:01:34.970> quads<00:01:35.000> in<00:01:35.870> order<00:01:36.170> to<00:01:36.260> get<00:01:36.380> a<00:01:36.410> very<00:01:36.590> nice

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
those quads in order to get a very nice

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.550 
those quads in order to get a very nice
solid<00:01:37.130> contraction<00:01:37.610> up<00:01:37.760> in<00:01:37.910> the<00:01:38.000> bar<00:01:38.180> okay<00:01:38.660> but

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
solid contraction up in the bar okay but
