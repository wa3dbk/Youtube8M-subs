00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.539 
without having to spend a lot of money
and<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.460> picked<00:01:23.939> up<00:01:24.860> four<00:01:25.860> packs<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.340> these

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.359 
and so I picked up four packs of these
there<00:01:26.759> are<00:01:26.909> six<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.479> each<00:01:28.439> pack<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.130> there's

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
there are six in each pack so there's

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.429
