00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
in but that's that's just not good

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.630 
in but that's that's just not good
they're<00:00:51.660> they're<00:00:52.430> completely<00:00:53.430> not

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
they're they're completely not

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
respecting the fence at all so we kind

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.709 
respecting the fence at all so we kind
of<00:00:56.820> have<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.230> take<00:00:58.230> some<00:00:58.469> measures

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
of have to take some measures

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.310 
of have to take some measures
unfortunately<00:01:00.719> what<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:00.870> means<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.289> that

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
unfortunately what this means is that

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.250 
unfortunately what this means is that
they're<00:01:01.590> not<00:01:01.770> going<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.250> have<00:01:02.870> free<00:01:03.870> access

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
they're not going to have free access

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.039 
they're not going to have free access
and<00:01:04.860> bigger<00:01:05.700> pastures<00:01:06.090> anymore<00:01:06.479> instead

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
and bigger pastures anymore instead

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.539 
and bigger pastures anymore instead
they're<00:01:07.200> gonna<00:01:07.290> be<00:01:07.530> boxed<00:01:07.860> into<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> small<00:01:08.460> pen

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
they're gonna be boxed into a small pen

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.750 
they're gonna be boxed into a small pen
and<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:12.030> means<00:01:12.240> increased<00:01:12.810> feeding<00:01:13.170> and

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
and that means increased feeding and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.490 
and that means increased feeding and
less<00:01:14.760> exercise<00:01:15.530> but<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.860> do<00:01:17.130> hear<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.500> prior

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
70 pounds for the pigs they they don't

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.260 
70 pounds for the pigs they they don't
feel<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> shock<00:01:30.600> as<00:01:30.810> much<00:01:31.189> so<00:01:32.189> I'm<00:01:32.610> hoping

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
feel the shock as much so I'm hoping

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.170 
feel the shock as much so I'm hoping
that<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.259> can<00:01:34.350> keep<00:01:34.500> them<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.280> pen<00:01:35.700> for

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
that I can keep them in this pen for

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.760 
that I can keep them in this pen for
maybe<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.780> month<00:01:37.520> weight<00:01:39.380> start<00:01:40.380> feeding<00:01:40.590> them

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
maybe a month weight start feeding them

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.710 
maybe a month weight start feeding them
two<00:01:41.189> times<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.549> day<00:01:41.579> instead<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.119> one<00:01:42.329> because<00:01:42.689> I

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
two times a day instead of one because I

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.719 
two times a day instead of one because I
was<00:01:42.869> relying<00:01:43.079> on<00:01:43.290> them<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.920> get<00:01:44.009> forage<00:01:44.399> there

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
was relying on them to get forage there

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.100 
was relying on them to get forage there
for<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.689> lot<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.899> their<00:01:45.990> food<00:01:47.630> hoping<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.840> I

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
for a lot of their food hoping that I

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.130 
for a lot of their food hoping that I
can<00:01:49.439> let<00:01:49.560> them<00:01:49.649> out<00:01:49.770> again<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.579> maybe<00:01:51.420> by

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
can let them out again and and maybe by

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.899 
can let them out again and and maybe by
then<00:01:52.409> they'll<00:01:52.680> have<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.860> better<00:01:53.280> respect<00:01:53.670> for

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
then they'll have a better respect for

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.880 
then they'll have a better respect for
the<00:01:54.030> electric<00:01:54.329> fence<00:01:54.590> because<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.770> way

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
the electric fence because of the way

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.080 
the electric fence because of the way
I'm<00:01:56.009> going<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.189> set<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.430> up<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.759> I'll<00:01:56.850> show<00:01:57.030> you

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
I'm going to set it up and I'll show you

took<00:02:18.400> me<00:02:18.580> about<00:02:18.819> two<00:02:19.209> hours<00:02:19.239> to<00:02:19.780> do<00:02:19.959> which

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
took me about two hours to do which

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.610 
took me about two hours to do which
isn't<00:02:20.709> really<00:02:20.860> scalable<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:22.420> I'm<00:02:23.290> gonna<00:02:23.410> have

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
isn't really scalable so I'm gonna have

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.410 
isn't really scalable so I'm gonna have
to<00:02:23.650> do<00:02:24.489> something<00:02:24.760> else<00:02:24.850> for<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.180> shelter

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420

to<00:04:59.030> obey<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.360> fence<00:05:00.740> before<00:05:01.740> it<00:05:02.220> turns<00:05:02.430> into<00:05:02.550> a

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
to obey the fence before it turns into a

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:07.060 
to obey the fence before it turns into a
my<00:05:02.760> bit<00:05:02.970> or<00:05:03.120> turn<00:05:03.840> this<00:05:04.020> into<00:05:04.200> a<00:05:05.120> mobile<00:05:06.120> pen
