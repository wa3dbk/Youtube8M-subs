00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.049
 Good day I am a sales consultant 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:12.349
 Shopping complex Aktivku my name is 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:15.449
 have an ark today i will tell you 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.769
 general characteristics of pro inflatable 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.470
 pvc motor boats 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.789
 let's start from the very beginning what pvc is 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.400
 let's try to figure it out 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.279
 pvc or polyvinyl chloride is 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.410
 synthetic material in motor boats 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.919
 only reinforced material is used 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.530
 what is it on polyester fabric 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:38.760
 alternately applied layers of pvc materials 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.810
 I can the number of layers is from 5 to 9 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.890
 in our conditions for our reservoirs 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.440
 acceptable and optimal will be 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.380
 amount of materials from 5 to 7 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.000
 next parameter we will try 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.880
 figure out this boat dimension and 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.100
 maximum motor power parameters 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.940
 will be quite narrow and it will be possible 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.280
 some exceptions but try first 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.019
 lengths from two 70 to three meters 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.390
 these boats from the right will suit for 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.540
 one or two people here they can 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.430
 be equipped with boat motors up to 5 8 sep 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.260
 Well, again , I will repeat maybe 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.440
 will be the exception of the following parameters 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.850
 from three to three and a half meters these 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.340
 motor boats will fit 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.320
 already for three people maybe even for 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.750
 move in four and be equipped 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.210
 will be boat motors up to 15 sue and 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.729
 last let's say so a category from three with 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.890
 half meters and further why not 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.560
 restrictions because the possibilities are both 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.500
 would be further huge boats and 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.659
 equipping with a motor i.e. it is from 15 forces 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.729
 I have to apply almost 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.399
 in some marine conditions as follows 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.990
 parameters we will deal with you and 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.270
 number of compartments because for 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.100
 many it will be a question at 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.319
 modern production conditions 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.100
 associated quality features like 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.780
 weld seam 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.030
 so will be glued approximately 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.340
 equally so in this category 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.859
 cannot be distinguished 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.530
 something specifically following parameters 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:05.329
 will be the amount of sealed 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.810
 spoon compartments minimum quantity 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:10.250
 used in motorboats it's two 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.269
 but the most optimal from this 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.330
 naturally your will depend 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:17.630
 water safety 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:25.760
 the more the better, that is 3 3 + 14 + 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:28.370
 1 will be the most optimal as follows 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.730
 criteria will be type there are no three 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.800
 main types of days he batten floor of 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.060
 represents himself 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.550
 waterproof plywood that fits 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.200
 special pockets yes on the floor 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.740
 usually applied on economy boats 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.480
 class and is one of the most but not 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.510
 what unreliable tell me very 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.600
 can conveniently like your one small 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.120
 plus you have it - this is a big volume with 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.180
 transport the following type of bottom 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.650
 will go full mortgage he 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:03.530
 happens either plywood or aluminum plus 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.650
 and will be like one such 2 0 name 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.540
 would be preferable in terms of what 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:13.020
 just will have possess a little less 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:15.540
 weight and more durable precisely when 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.060
 operated and the last type of bottom is 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.630
 low pressure inflatable bottom main 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.490
 the advantage of such a bottom is 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.730
 possibility of extinguishing small blows 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:28.790
 candy bar meaning you will experience 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.560
 less discomfort when driving but 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.930
 the main drawback of this will be 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.420
 uneven but in the boat itself 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:41.690
 the next rank dash steppe will be 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:44.240
 the cylinder and its diameter is clear that than 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.410
 more balloon the more you will have 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.680
 splash protection 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.410
 but there is a reverse side of the coin 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.150
 accordingly, the smaller the volume will be 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.610
 so-called interior spaces 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.860
 or like Peter therefore all manufacturers 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.010
 make some compromise either big 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:04.430
 balloon and small as a view or less 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.410
 balloon and add a little extra 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.000
 spaces inside the boat which like 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.000
 the rule never happens much 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:21.970
 the next characteristic will be 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:24.410
 seat either seaward at the can 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.560
 There are several manufacturers 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.780
 seat mounting options but buttons 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.810
 select the main ones the first option 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.949
 this mount lipase liters the most 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.290
 common mounting option 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:38.600
 seat from all manufacturers is 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.720
 one of the most reliable and samovly and 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.729
 the benefits are what 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.820
 seat moves along the length here is 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.169
 So you can always rest under him 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.520
 adjust so that you were 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.350
 really comfortable and comfortable 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.870
 every particular situation outside 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.389
 depending on whether you manage 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.490
 either working with the second 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.460
 an attachment option for boats will be 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.199
 mount in a liter introduced it in principle 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.360
 quite reliable mounting option 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:08.419
 cans but he has just huge 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.350
 the number of flaws the first is 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.510
 naturally 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.690
 their 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.450
 movable relative to length that is not 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.010
 always comfortable to sit or work with 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.140
 motor or work with oars 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.870
 you have to change from one shop 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.900
 to another and again with further 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.700
 movement is not always two or more people 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.010
 it will be comfortable exactly in this position 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.990
 the following parameters will be 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.550
 transom 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.350
 motor boats usually transom 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.680
 sometimes glued to warm there are no two 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.440
 species 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.170
 either special plastic is glued in 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.120
 holders that most reliable either 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.580
 glue using exactly the same 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.260
 reinforced pvc transom as a rule 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.110
 be made of waterproof finca 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.400
 plywood with various thicknesses and 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.680
 some manufacturers add 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.190
 extra reinforcement either plastic 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.820
 cover plate 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:00.520
 either metal that provide 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:04.590
 durability trance and removal of damage 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.590
 protective motor damage 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:13.080
 absolutely all manufacturers at 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:14.099
 boat manufacturing use either 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.960
 import accessories 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:19.830
 either furniture manufacturing 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:23.039
 regardless of the price range or 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.900
 price segment of vodka important 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:25.919
 it would pay attention to availability 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.449
 accessories 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:32.999
 that is, it is extra comfort and 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:34.919
 added convenience when traveling 

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:38.900
 all optional accessories 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:42.089
 soft lining bags nasal lockers 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:44.389
 running you are parking brand and all this 

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:48.889
 provide you a comfortable rest and 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:48.889
 a pleasant pastime in nature 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:56.520
 being on the water and moving in a boat 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.469
 by 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.960
 pond remember about proper 

00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:02.999
 safety of use later in the summer and with 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.969
 you were there as sergey with a consultant 

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:06.809
 trade complex asset come to us 

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:11.659
 we will always help you 

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:11.659
 I say goodbye to all the best
