00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.260 

yeah<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:40.050> this<00:01:41.050> doesn't<00:01:41.410> really<00:01:41.830> help<00:01:42.400> but

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270

it's good if you have qualities and
related<00:01:47.290> clips<00:01:52.830> yeah<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:56.500> get<00:01:56.590> a<00:01:56.650> position

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
related clips yeah you get a position

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.940 
related clips yeah you get a position
just<00:01:59.490> like<00:02:00.490> a<00:02:00.640> basic<00:02:01.410> finger<00:02:02.410> positioning

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
just like a basic finger positioning

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.370 
just like a basic finger positioning
maybe<00:02:03.509> they're<00:02:04.509> back<00:02:05.500> finger<00:02:07.110> right<00:02:08.110> down

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
maybe they're back finger right down

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.000 
maybe they're back finger right down
here<00:02:09.209> on<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.240> tail<00:02:10.509> on<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:11.020> point<00:02:11.380> of<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.800> tell

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
here on the tail on the point of to tell

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
the kickflip maybe like a knowledge for

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.210 
the kickflip maybe like a knowledge for
kids<00:02:19.990> book<00:02:21.120> yeah<00:02:22.120> he's<00:02:22.959> so<00:02:23.590> finger

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
once you've got the finger positioning

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.600 
once you've got the finger positioning
you<00:02:36.970> ever<00:02:37.090> put<00:02:37.959> yourself<00:02:38.170> in<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:38.950> position<00:02:38.980> like

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
you ever put yourself in a position like

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:49.970 
you ever put yourself in a position like
this<00:02:42.000> gross<00:02:43.800> pop<00:02:44.800> and<00:02:46.200> when<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.320> pop<00:02:48.239> pop<00:02:49.239> it

flick it like a k-put but this is when
this<00:02:54.790> is<00:02:55.000> where<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.810> front<00:02:56.200> side<00:02:56.380> would<00:02:56.590> come

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
this is where the front side would come

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.940 
this is where the front side would come
because<00:02:57.820> you<00:02:58.390> have<00:02:58.570> to<00:02:58.810> do<00:02:58.930> like<00:02:59.170> a<00:02:59.500> frontside

but thermally it doesn't so keep
practicing<00:04:05.610> remember<00:04:06.610> finger<00:04:07.570> positioning

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
practicing remember finger positioning

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.510 
practicing remember finger positioning
the<00:04:09.280> fall<00:04:09.750> from<00:04:10.750> sighs<00:04:11.050> motion<00:04:11.590> thing

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
the fall from sighs motion thing

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:20.820 
the fall from sighs motion thing
something<00:04:13.860> right<00:04:14.860> here<00:04:15.959> just<00:04:16.959> like<00:04:17.560> that<00:04:19.830> then

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
something right here just like that then

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.970 
something right here just like that then
you<00:04:21.370> can<00:04:21.400> do<00:04:21.730> the<00:04:21.790> catch<00:04:22.440> in<00:04:23.440> two<00:04:23.710> different

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
you can do the catch in two different

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.140 
you can do the catch in two different
ways<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:25.450> first<00:04:25.720> thing<00:04:25.930> is<00:04:25.960> so<00:04:26.800> right<00:04:27.670> here

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150
