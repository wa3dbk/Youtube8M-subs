live<00:01:34.049> streams<00:01:34.470> things<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.610> nature<00:01:35.960> so

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
live streams things of that nature so

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.950 
live streams things of that nature so
two<00:01:37.020> people<00:01:37.409> from<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.670> states<00:01:38.970> could<00:01:39.810> be

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
two people from the states could be

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.569 
two people from the states could be
North<00:01:40.259> America<00:01:40.680> Canada<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.220> know<00:01:41.250> whatever

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
North America Canada you know whatever

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.370 
North America Canada you know whatever
but<00:01:42.270> basically<00:01:42.570> from<00:01:42.810> North<00:01:42.990> America

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
but basically from North America

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.069 
but basically from North America
something<00:01:43.740> close<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:43.979> my<00:01:44.310> time<00:01:44.579> zone<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.600> now

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
something close to my time zone and now

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.929 
something close to my time zone and now
also<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.770> other<00:01:46.920> caveat<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.579> we're<00:01:47.759> probably

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
also the other caveat is we're probably

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.069 
also the other caveat is we're probably
only<00:01:48.119> going<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.390> be<00:01:48.450> looking<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.720> people<00:01:48.990> who

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
only going to be looking to people who

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.649 
only going to be looking to people who
are<00:01:49.200> 18<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.920> older<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:51.270> one<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.630> reasons

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
are 18 and older and one of the reasons

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.090 
are 18 and older and one of the reasons
for<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.380> know<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.829> going<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.040> be

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
for that I know this is going to be

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.429 
for that I know this is going to be
upsetting<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:54.360> when<00:01:54.540> you're<00:01:54.750> too<00:01:55.200> young

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
upsetting is that when you're too young

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.999 
upsetting is that when you're too young
you<00:01:55.860> can't<00:01:56.159> commit<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.840> times<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.500> we

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
you can't commit to the times that we

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.069 
you can't commit to the times that we
need<00:01:59.340> because<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.939> need<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.570> go<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.780> school

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
hobbies committing to this kind of thing

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.910 
hobbies committing to this kind of thing
is<00:02:09.360> impossible<00:02:09.690> that's<00:02:10.440> one<00:02:10.560> of<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.679> reasons

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
is impossible that's one of the reasons

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.400 
is impossible that's one of the reasons
why<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.039> don't<00:02:11.220> see<00:02:11.340> Lizzy<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.730> every<00:02:12.150> bit

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
why you don't see Lizzy and every bit

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.590 
why you don't see Lizzy and every bit

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
things get inappropriate in which case

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.230 
things get inappropriate in which case
it'd<00:02:33.470> be<00:02:33.710> better<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:34.070> have<00:02:34.220> adults<00:02:34.880> people

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
it'd be better to have adults people

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.880 
it'd be better to have adults people
dealing<00:02:35.570> with<00:02:35.690> those<00:02:35.870> situations<00:02:36.500> instead<00:02:36.680> of

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
dealing with those situations instead of

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.130 
dealing with those situations instead of
putting<00:02:37.160> younger<00:02:37.910> ones<00:02:38.090> in<00:02:38.240> charge<00:02:38.270> of<00:02:38.720> that

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
putting younger ones in charge of that

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.110 
putting younger ones in charge of that
kind<00:02:39.290> of<00:02:39.380> stuff<00:02:39.620> so<00:02:40.100> this<00:02:40.340> doesn't<00:02:40.580> work<00:02:40.790> for

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
kind of stuff so this doesn't work for

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.330 
kind of stuff so this doesn't work for
us<00:02:41.230> that<00:02:42.230> way<00:02:42.380> so<00:02:42.800> I<00:02:42.860> know<00:02:42.950> that's<00:02:43.100> going<00:02:43.190> to<00:02:43.280> be

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
us that way so I know that's going to be

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.860 
us that way so I know that's going to be
upsetting<00:02:43.730> for<00:02:43.850> some<00:02:44.030> of<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.270> but<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:44.810> have

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
upsetting for some of you but you have

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
to kind of understand our reason now i

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.640 
to kind of understand our reason now i
will<00:02:47.210> say<00:02:47.390> there<00:02:47.600> is<00:02:47.720> one<00:02:48.020> potential

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
will say there is one potential

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.680 
will say there is one potential
difference<00:02:49.280> if<00:02:49.820> there's<00:02:50.090> some<00:02:50.210> people<00:02:50.360> who

difference if there's some people who

crew but if they would we would maybe

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.250 
crew but if they would we would maybe
give<00:03:04.970> consideration<00:03:05.450> to<00:03:05.660> some<00:03:05.900> people<00:03:06.140> like

give consideration to some people like
that<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:06.740> would<00:03:07.430> say<00:03:07.640> that<00:03:07.670> I<00:03:07.850> probably

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
that I would say that I probably

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.450 
that I would say that I probably
wouldn't<00:03:08.510> go<00:03:08.570> below<00:03:08.840> 16<00:03:09.350> when<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:10.130> comes<00:03:10.310> to

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
wouldn't go below 16 when it comes to

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.920 
wouldn't go below 16 when it comes to
adding<00:03:10.610> people<00:03:11.060> so<00:03:11.330> they<00:03:11.450> would<00:03:11.570> need<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.840> be

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
adding people so they would need to be

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.590
