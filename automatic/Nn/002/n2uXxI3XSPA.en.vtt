00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello you welcome school wanna 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.190
 know and i'm she is a master teacher 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.189
 biology 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.910
 Now we will analyze the task from 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.040
 particles and and demonstration options ege 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.740
 on biology for 2013 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.480
 so our question is why the ecosystem 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.050
 mixed forest is considered more 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.840
 sustainable ecosystem than spruce forests 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:28.859
 so I remind you that we need particles 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.520
 choose the shortest number 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.950
 items that is usually April 3 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.170
 we will try to lie in them and let's 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.360
 remember that mixed forest 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.059
 different from purple in that 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.379
 It is also present in addition to the coniferous and 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.100
 deciduous trees 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.930
 that is, the diversity of species even trees 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.989
 will be much wider 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.910
 mixed forest this will be our first 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.039
 option first point from the answer that 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.219
 mixed forests greater variety 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.949
 species than spruce and it leads to paint 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.920
 ecosystem sustainability 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:10.080
 it also follows from this that in mixed 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.619
 the forest will also be a greater variety 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.250
 animal species that live there 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.060
 and as a result there will be a longer and 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.860
 more branched supply chains 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.900
 this will be our second point we them 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.450
 mention that in mixed sun and 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.420
 supply longer and branched 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:35.189
 which also leads to more sustainability 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.840
 this system and the last in the answers 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.020
 mention layering 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.909
 but you can write this principle although I would 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.000
 probably therefore began to write 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.310
 that he is a mixed forest of tiers more than 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.549
 him 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.890
 layering this implies 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.329
 tree height distribution and this 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.090
 is adaptability to 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.450
 illumination i.e. for example cold 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.280
 the forest will be only tall trees and pines 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.830
 mixed be undersized birch 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:12.700
 teeth and aspens and so on here and or so 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.530
 we have three answer choices with 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.480
 you were a school want to know and I'm alone 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.520
 Maystrenko subscribe to our feed 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.440
 on youtube and that nauru come to 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.100
 us on the courses of Moscow and who quits 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.100
 together with us
