00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.360
 Good day, knitting lovers 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.420
 spokes of this video tutorial will be 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:26.230
 demonstrated knitting process 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:31.280
 tight elastic band this is the front side this 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:35.829
 wrong side this pattern can be 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:41.410
 use knitting hats and scarves 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:45.800
 sweaters and maybe in other products 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.960
 This pattern fits on an even number. 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.390
 loops 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:55.340
 height rapport repeated in 4 rows 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.340
 but before you start this knitting 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.200
 several items should be knitted 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:05.720
 rows 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:09.229
 better odd number of rows with 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.500
 alternating starting 1 purl 1 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:21.290
 facial purl facial and so on 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:25.250
 end of the row then perform the report on 4 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:30.439
 rows so we are now about knit 4 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:32.560
 a series of rapport and this figure 1 loop 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.560
 removed 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:42.980
 nakid 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:46.390
 the next loop is taken off facial like 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:51.350
 performed until the end of the number of capes 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:02:00.400
 the loop is removed front face 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:02:05.650
 the loop is removed front face and 3 person 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:09.250
 facial does not perform so until the end of the series 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:17.510
 the last edge is always knit 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:24.160
 purl 2 row of our pattern 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:28.480
 first remove provyazyvaem purse 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.850
 nakid and these loops we remove 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:36.190
 make sure to sleep right 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:45.490
 fell into a loop and re-shoot her 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:47.560
 purl nakid we remove purl 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:51.250
 nakid we shoot 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:56.140
 repeat in this way until the end of the row and 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.140
 the last edge of the back 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:07.450
 purl nakid we remove purl 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:12.950
 nakid we shoot 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:18.550
 knitting 3 rows until the end of the row 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.550
 pattern first remove 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:27.110
 do a cape and all these three loops then 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:31.550
 there are two nakida and one loop we are all 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:34.340
 Together we remove it and remove 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:40.400
 be sure to follow right sleep 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:43.680
 got exactly in the loop front and rapport 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:50.010
 we recap 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:57.409
 remove the loops front cover 3 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:04:03.650
 we remove the loops front cover 3 we remove 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:03.650
 thus repeat until the end of the row 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:22.230
 knitting 4 rows of the first pattern remove 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:27.210
 then 1 purl and then we need everything 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:32.160
 these 4 loops knit facial when 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:34.980
 this grab the back wall here 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:40.740
 carefully look to sleep right 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:46.070
 entered the loop or behind the back wall 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.070
 we are capturing the thread 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:57.850
 and knit 4 together front of the back 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:06.640
 lower the wall loops and repeat 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:09.120
 backside report 4 together front 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.120
 back wall 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.030
 wrong side 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:31.639
 four together front behind the back wall 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:43.170
 be sure to follow and to make spokes 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.780
 he was entering this loop perhaps because 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.820
 of this 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.020
 the thread will cling and process 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:55.430
 knitting inhibited 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:55.430
 and 1 more purl 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:12.039
 four together facial 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:17.229
 so we perform until the end of row 4 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:21.580
 a row of our pattern is knitted then height 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:23.699
 fav repeat from 1 to 4 these rows 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:30.819
 which we are with you right now 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:35.229
 the necessary number of times we watch it 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:40.469
 the front should be the side of it 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:43.330
 purl knitting dense yarn consumption 

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:46.990
 big goes but and 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:52.809
 the product is connected and this pattern will be 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:55.599
 very warm and so if you liked 

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:59.289
 this pattern 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:07:05.169
 this video lesson put class share 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:08.740
 this video write comments 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:12.729
