00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.319 
if you have any issues with knees even

if you don't have issues with knees if

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.609 
if you don't have issues with knees if
you<00:01:57.479> use<00:01:57.600> hiking<00:01:57.899> poles<00:01:58.110> on<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.320> way<00:01:58.409> down

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
you're going to take a lot of stress off

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.280 
you're going to take a lot of stress off
your<00:01:59.969> knees<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.540> find<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.899> really<00:02:00.930> valuable

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
your knees so I find it really valuable

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.740 
your knees so I find it really valuable
for<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.939> in<00:02:02.939> fact<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.270> even<00:02:03.299> have<00:02:03.509> some

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
for that in fact I even have some

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.109 
for that in fact I even have some
friends<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.110> hike<00:02:04.290> with<00:02:04.500> now<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:05.119> have

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
friends I hike with now that have

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.080

lighter<00:02:06.360> loads<00:02:07.129> but<00:02:08.129> they<00:02:08.280> have<00:02:08.489> knee

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
lighter loads but they have knee

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.210 
lighter loads but they have knee
problems<00:02:09.860> consistently<00:02:10.860> when<00:02:11.039> they<00:02:11.129> go

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
problems consistently when they go

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.190 
problems consistently when they go
downhill<00:02:11.430> it's<00:02:12.209> like<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.510> think<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.900> hiking

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
downhill it's like I think the hiking

downhill it's like I think the hiking
pole

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
pole

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.410 
pole
might<00:02:13.720> be<00:02:13.900> worth<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.409> extra<00:02:14.940> pound<00:02:15.940> or<00:02:16.120> two<00:02:16.239> to

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
might be worth the extra pound or two to

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.780 
might be worth the extra pound or two to
bring<00:02:16.629> so<00:02:17.440> they<00:02:17.680> do<00:02:17.739> have<00:02:18.010> their<00:02:18.159> values<00:02:18.519> now

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
bring so they do have their values now

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.729 
bring so they do have their values now
trust<00:02:19.120> me<00:02:19.209> there<00:02:19.450> are<00:02:19.569> times<00:02:19.810> where<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.260> feel

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
trust me there are times where I feel

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.800 
trust me there are times where I feel
like<00:02:20.799> I<00:02:21.220> wish<00:02:21.519> I<00:02:21.640> did<00:02:21.819> have<00:02:21.849> some<00:02:22.209> polls<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.720> I

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
like I wish I did have some polls and I

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.869 
like I wish I did have some polls and I
would<00:02:23.049> benefit<00:02:23.470> from<00:02:23.530> them<00:02:23.890> but<00:02:24.310> when<00:02:24.760> you're

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
would benefit from them but when you're

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.850 
would benefit from them but when you're
down<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.209> like<00:02:25.360> nine<00:02:25.540> or<00:02:25.720> ten<00:02:25.870> pounds<00:02:26.379> and<00:02:26.530> a

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
down to like nine or ten pounds and a

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.490 
down to like nine or ten pounds and a
pound<00:02:27.430> or<00:02:27.580> two<00:02:27.700> of<00:02:27.849> polls<00:02:28.200> that's<00:02:29.200> a<00:02:29.319> big

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
pound or two of polls that's a big

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.960 
pound or two of polls that's a big
percentage<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:30.010> your<00:02:30.099> weight<00:02:30.280> so<00:02:30.489> I<00:02:30.519> can't

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
percentage of your weight so I can't

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.390 
percentage of your weight so I can't
really<00:02:31.209> justify<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.660> for<00:02:32.040> overall<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.340> just

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
really justify it for overall I just

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.280 
really justify it for overall I just
think<00:02:33.910> I<00:02:33.970> benefit<00:02:34.360> more<00:02:34.629> personally<00:02:35.140> without

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
think I benefit more personally without

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.170 
think I benefit more personally without
them<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:36.069> if<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.310> do<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.459> water<00:02:36.670> crossing<00:02:37.060> or

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
them and if I do a water crossing or

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.330 
them and if I do a water crossing or
something<00:02:37.450> I'll<00:02:37.569> grab<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.810> stick<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.410> I<00:02:39.129> can

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
something I'll grab a stick and I can

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.610 
something I'll grab a stick and I can
kind<00:02:39.519> of<00:02:39.610> make<00:02:39.730> things<00:02:39.910> work<00:02:40.379> but<00:02:41.379> it<00:02:41.470> should

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
kind of make things work but it should

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.979 
kind of make things work but it should
also<00:02:41.860> be<00:02:42.190> noted<00:02:42.220> that<00:02:42.610> you<00:02:43.239> don't<00:02:43.690> have<00:02:43.870> to

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
also be noted that you don't have to

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.930 
also be noted that you don't have to
hike<00:02:44.140> with<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.470> probably<00:02:45.310> get<00:02:45.430> by<00:02:45.549> a<00:02:45.579> lot<00:02:45.849> of

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
hike with to probably get by a lot of

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.250 
hike with to probably get by a lot of
times<00:02:46.090> with<00:02:46.239> just<00:02:46.360> one<00:02:46.599> in<00:02:46.840> which<00:02:46.959> case<00:02:47.170> you

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
times with just one in which case you

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.890 
times with just one in which case you
can<00:02:47.290> cut<00:02:47.530> your<00:02:47.620> price<00:02:47.829> in<00:02:48.010> half<00:02:48.390> although<00:02:49.390> if<00:02:49.720> I

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
can cut your price in half although if I

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.479 
can cut your price in half although if I
got<00:02:50.110> a<00:02:50.140> really<00:02:50.379> nice<00:02:50.560> lightweight<00:02:50.920> pair<00:02:51.340> which

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
got a really nice lightweight pair which

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.009 
got a really nice lightweight pair which
I<00:02:51.609> probably<00:02:51.879> would<00:02:52.239> it<00:02:52.540> would<00:02:52.629> still<00:02:52.900> be

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
I probably would it would still be

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.670 
I probably would it would still be
pretty<00:02:53.470> expensive<00:02:54.720> but<00:02:55.720> that<00:02:56.019> is<00:02:56.170> an<00:02:56.319> option

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
pretty expensive but that is an option

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.099 
pretty expensive but that is an option
you<00:02:56.859> know<00:02:57.069> could<00:02:57.430> invest<00:02:58.120> in<00:02:58.299> one<00:02:58.510> single<00:02:58.900> five

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
you know could invest in one single five

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
you can take them apart it's like grime

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.250 
you can take them apart it's like grime

anyway<00:04:56.500> long<00:04:56.680> story<00:04:56.710> short<00:04:57.190> you<00:04:57.430> can<00:04:58.360> save<00:04:58.540> a

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
anyway long story short you can save a

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.140 
anyway long story short you can save a
lot<00:04:58.720> of<00:04:58.780> money<00:04:58.870> by<00:04:59.080> doing<00:04:59.139> this<00:04:59.850> but<00:05:00.850> they<00:05:00.970> will

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
lot of money by doing this but they will

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.340 
lot of money by doing this but they will
break<00:05:01.360> eventually<00:05:01.840> but<00:05:01.930> if<00:05:02.050> you're<00:05:02.169> just

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
break eventually but if you're just

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.980 
break eventually but if you're just
starting<00:05:02.470> I'd<00:05:02.979> say<00:05:03.190> go<00:05:03.669> ahead<00:05:03.780> that<00:05:04.780> would<00:05:04.900> be

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
starting I'd say go ahead that would be

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.540 
starting I'd say go ahead that would be
worth<00:05:05.139> it<00:05:05.350> if<00:05:05.470> they<00:05:05.560> last<00:05:05.740> two<00:05:05.889> years<00:05:06.070> it's<00:05:06.220> 15

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
worth it if they last two years it's 15

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.490 
worth it if they last two years it's 15
bucks<00:05:06.729> a<00:05:06.880> year<00:05:07.120> and<00:05:07.300> you<00:05:07.840> might<00:05:07.990> find<00:05:08.229> out<00:05:08.350> like

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
bucks a year and you might find out like
