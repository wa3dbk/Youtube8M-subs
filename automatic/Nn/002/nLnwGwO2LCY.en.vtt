00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.819
 today in kitchen version 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.820
 let's make a drink out fashion this 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.340
 it's a drink something strong is sweet but 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.650
 basically it's pure liquor is something like that 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.450
 to throw face with the race and walk 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.060
 drinking and the liter of whiskey no more 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.140
 always then everything is slowly 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.140
 calmly what 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.520
 to start this drink I will use 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.920
 a bit of posture or bitter liquor 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.600
 is this bottle that I have here so 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.230
 they are going to last a jet 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.320
 because it is something very very strong is a 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.600
 appetizer 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.350
 how are we going to see a few drops here I have 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.810
 like 10 droplets in this show I put 10 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.850
 because you want some on the way 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.930
 the recipes say that you occupy 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.100
 less 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.300
 right away I will place 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.860
 a little lung 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.860
 and many confuse it with whiskey 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.660
 and if I tell you a little why 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.660
 the truth is that it takes the chats 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.710
 then basically with a drink of 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.740
 these are already very tasty 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.490
 I'm going to put a little soap water 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.759
 natural 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.390
 but that can get you mineral water if 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.390
 you like 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.330
 and the last touch 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.330
 a little 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.939
 they already have their golf passion a drink 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.390
 very virile something that would take charlie sheen 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.920
 or failing to swanson ron me 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.920
 dismissal and health 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.090
