00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.249 
go into the TARDIS look at this it's
just<00:01:59.250> amazing<00:01:59.579> it's<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.180> prebuilt<00:02:00.719> house

school there were no lag as well when I

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.839 
school there were no lag as well when I
built<00:03:03.129> it<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:04.319> pretty<00:03:05.319> cool<00:03:05.500> but<00:03:06.430> yeah<00:03:06.700> I'm

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
built it so pretty cool but yeah I'm

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.910 
built it so pretty cool but yeah I'm
good<00:03:07.030> day<00:03:07.180> outside<00:03:07.360> just<00:03:08.049> see<00:03:08.319> what<00:03:08.500> I'm

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
good day outside just see what I'm

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.759 
good day outside just see what I'm
curious<00:03:09.340> so<00:03:10.209> outside<00:03:10.720> is<00:03:12.150> nothing<00:03:13.650> is<00:03:14.650> that

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
curious so outside is nothing is that

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.099 
curious so outside is nothing is that
that's<00:03:15.310> another<00:03:15.640> TARDIS<00:03:16.120> so<00:03:16.660> I<00:03:16.690> guess<00:03:16.870> it's

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
that's another TARDIS so I guess it's

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.720 
that's another TARDIS so I guess it's
the<00:03:17.200> spawns<00:03:17.709> like<00:03:18.430> this<00:03:19.120> massive<00:03:19.420> house

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
the spawns like this massive house

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.940 
the spawns like this massive house
whatever<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:21.910> is<00:03:22.060> in<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:23.200> in<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.620> middle<00:03:23.829> of

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
whatever it is in the in the middle of

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.819 
whatever it is in the in the middle of

really<00:05:28.870> want<00:05:29.020> but<00:05:29.590> yeah<00:05:29.949> that's<00:05:30.130> read<00:05:30.400> it<00:05:30.550> for

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
really want but yeah that's read it for

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.550 
really want but yeah that's read it for
this<00:05:30.789> mod<00:05:31.030> like<00:05:31.720> said<00:05:31.960> I<00:05:31.990> can't<00:05:32.229> really<00:05:32.380> go

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
through all of it because the video

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.640 
through all of it because the video
