the<00:00:05.009> light<00:00:05.160> bulbs<00:00:05.549> in<00:00:05.730> a<00:00:05.819> fixture<00:00:06.150> like<00:00:06.390> this

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.010 
the light bulbs in a fixture like this

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.549 
the light bulbs in a fixture like this
usually<00:00:08.010> this<00:00:08.730> bottom<00:00:09.240> cap<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.840> just<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.200> trim

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
usually this bottom cap is just a trim

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.039 
usually this bottom cap is just a trim
ring<00:00:10.800> but<00:00:11.730> you<00:00:11.880> might<00:00:12.059> want<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.360> support<00:00:12.840> the

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
ring but you might want to support the

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.720 
ring but you might want to support the
glass<00:00:13.290> with<00:00:13.530> one<00:00:13.679> hand<00:00:14.009> while<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.340> take<00:00:14.580> it

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
glass with one hand while you take it

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.519 
glass with one hand while you take it
off<00:00:14.880> because<00:00:15.030> sometimes<00:00:15.660> it's<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.020> actual

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
off because sometimes it's the actual

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.450 
off because sometimes it's the actual
support<00:00:18.140> whereas<00:00:19.140> on<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:19.710> particular<00:00:20.070> one

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
support whereas on this particular one

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.730 
support whereas on this particular one
that<00:00:20.520> nut<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.240> see<00:00:21.539> right<00:00:21.750> there<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:22.289> actually

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
that nut you see right there is actually

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.540 
that nut you see right there is actually
holding<00:00:23.039> up<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.340> glass<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:23.910> at<00:00:24.060> this<00:00:24.269> point

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
holding up the glass so at this point

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.790 
holding up the glass so at this point
and<00:00:26.550> I'm<00:00:26.670> showing<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.090> with<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.300> flashlight

commotion at the rest of the way by hand

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.990 
commotion at the rest of the way by hand
that's<00:00:43.110> gonna<00:00:43.590> be<00:00:43.829> how<00:00:44.010> we<00:00:44.070> get<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.520> big<00:00:44.730> glass

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
that's gonna be how we get to big glass

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.290 
that's gonna be how we get to big glass
off<00:00:45.710> then<00:00:46.710> once<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.129> get<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.489> off<00:00:47.700> did<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.000> see

stuff you're gonna want to clean the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.740 
stuff you're gonna want to clean the
inside<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.030> glass<00:00:56.149> before<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.390> put<00:00:57.660> it

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
inside of that glass before you put it

inside of that glass before you put it
back<00:00:57.899> on<00:00:59.629> alright<00:01:00.629> whatever<00:01:00.989> brought<00:01:01.410> down

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
back on alright whatever brought down

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.229 
back on alright whatever brought down
light<00:01:01.920> bulbs<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.430> course<00:01:02.699> you're<00:01:02.910> gonna<00:01:03.000> want

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
light bulbs of course you're gonna want

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.820 
light bulbs of course you're gonna want
to<00:01:03.329> change<00:01:03.629> but<00:01:03.870> as<00:01:03.989> long<00:01:04.140> as<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.439> got<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
to change but as long as you got the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.070 
to change but as long as you got the
glass<00:01:05.100> off<00:01:05.369> at<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.700> point<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.479> might<00:01:06.810> make

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
glass off at this point it might make

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.770 
glass off at this point it might make
sense<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.560> replace<00:01:07.890> all<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:09.210> light<00:01:09.360> bulbs<00:01:09.689> in

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
sense to replace all the light bulbs in

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.240 
sense to replace all the light bulbs in
there<00:01:09.990> even<00:01:10.200> though<00:01:10.470> some<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.799> them<00:01:10.920> still

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
there even though some of them still

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.100 
there even though some of them still
work<00:01:11.280> just<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.479> don't<00:01:12.689> have<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.900> get<00:01:13.020> up

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
work just so you don't have to get up

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.289 
work just so you don't have to get up
there<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.380> do<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.650> again<00:01:13.890> but<00:01:14.820> then<00:01:15.000> again<00:01:15.030> I

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
there and do it again but then again I

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.289 
there and do it again but then again I
can't<00:01:15.720> tell<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:16.200> how<00:01:16.439> many<00:01:16.500> lately<00:01:17.159> brand<00:01:18.090> new

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
can't tell you how many lately brand new

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.719 
can't tell you how many lately brand new
light<00:01:18.540> bulbs<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.409> box<00:01:19.680> don't<00:01:20.460> even

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
light bulbs and that in a box don't even

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.240 
light bulbs and that in a box don't even
work<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.420> if<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.380> got<00:01:22.530> one<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.890> works<00:01:23.009> you

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
work so if you got one that works you

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.590 
work so if you got one that works you
might<00:01:23.430> just<00:01:23.610> want<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.909> leave<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.420> there

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
might just want to leave it in there

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.280 
might just want to leave it in there
just<00:01:24.900> for<00:01:25.110> argument's<00:01:25.740> sake<00:01:26.450> and<00:01:27.450> what<00:01:28.170> I'm

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
just for argument's sake and what I'm

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.170 
just for argument's sake and what I'm
pointing<00:01:28.770> out<00:01:28.860> here<00:01:29.280> are<00:01:29.430> these<00:01:29.579> two<00:01:29.640> little

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
pointing out here are these two little

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.340 
pointing out here are these two little
lugs<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:33.390> metal<00:01:33.840> that's<00:01:34.049> around

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
lugs on this on the metal that's around

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.469 
lugs on this on the metal that's around
this<00:01:34.590> glass<00:01:34.920> although<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.549> metal<00:01:35.939> does<00:01:36.119> come

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
this glass although the metal does come

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.780 
this glass although the metal does come
off<00:01:36.509> but<00:01:37.140> there<00:01:37.350> are<00:01:37.439> those<00:01:37.530> two<00:01:37.860> lugs<00:01:38.189> and

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
off but there are those two lugs and

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.810 
off but there are those two lugs and
they<00:01:39.090> actually<00:01:39.270> fit<00:01:39.900> up<00:01:40.140> into<00:01:40.439> index<00:01:41.159> halls<00:01:41.490> up

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
they actually fit up into index halls up

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.230 
they actually fit up into index halls up
in<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> fixture<00:01:43.250> so<00:01:44.250> when<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.460> reassemble<00:01:44.759> it

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
in the fixture so when you reassemble it

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.399 
in the fixture so when you reassemble it
you're<00:01:45.390> going<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.600> want<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.780> make<00:01:45.960> sure<00:01:46.200> that

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
you're going to want to make sure that

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.390 
you're going to want to make sure that
those<00:01:46.619> uh<00:01:47.720> those<00:01:48.720> lugs<00:01:49.170> are<00:01:49.409> indexed<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.189> here

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
those uh those lugs are indexed in here

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.520 
those uh those lugs are indexed in here
okay<00:01:52.360> so<00:01:52.420> we<00:01:52.780> took<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.380> glass<00:01:53.740> out<00:01:54.130> of<00:01:54.190> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
okay so we took the glass out of the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.560 
okay so we took the glass out of the
decorative<00:01:56.530> huh

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
decorative huh

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.520
