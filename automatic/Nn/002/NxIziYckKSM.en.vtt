00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.800 
made this is ridiculous I mean it's just
like<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.620> combination<00:01:31.280> of<00:01:31.490> bad<00:01:32.000> programming<00:01:32.540> in

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
like a combination of bad programming in

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.840 
like a combination of bad programming in
a<00:01:33.110> combination<00:01:33.620> of<00:01:33.740> deliberately<00:01:34.280> difficult

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
a combination of deliberately difficult

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:35.680 
a combination of deliberately difficult
programming<00:01:35.270> it's<00:01:35.360> like<00:01:35.450> if<00:01:35.540> this<00:01:35.630> was

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
programming it's like if this was

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.510 
programming it's like if this was
deliberately<00:01:36.290> difficult<00:01:36.830> but<00:01:37.340> it<00:01:37.430> was

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
deliberately difficult but it was

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.680 
deliberately difficult but it was
programmed<00:01:37.760> in<00:01:38.000> a<00:01:38.090> way<00:01:38.210> that<00:01:38.420> was<00:01:38.510> actually

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
programmed in a way that was actually

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.810 
programmed in a way that was actually
fair<00:01:39.050> when<00:01:39.260> you<00:01:39.350> jumped<00:01:39.650> on<00:01:39.710> shit<00:01:40.040> or<00:01:40.250> it<00:01:40.610> did

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
fair when you jumped on shit or it did

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
anything else in the game really and you

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
anything else in the game really and you
didn't<00:01:42.260> have<00:01:42.350> these<00:01:42.500> coming<00:01:42.860> after<00:01:43.040> you

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
didn't have these coming after you

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:36.469 
you go up against the wall the only way

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:37.390 
you go up against the wall the only way
to<00:02:36.530> really<00:02:36.680> do<00:02:36.829> this<00:02:36.890> is<00:02:37.040> like<00:02:37.129> you<00:02:37.219> have<00:02:37.340> to

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
to really do this is like you have to

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.649 
to really do this is like you have to
grind<00:02:37.609> yourself<00:02:37.969> against<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.299> wall<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:38.629> that

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:54.499 
time so you basically have to have pixel
