what it is and having something tribute

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.020 
what it is and having something tribute

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.180 
wise though there would have been two
things<00:04:58.060> I<00:04:58.690> reckon<00:04:59.140> two<00:04:59.380> things<00:04:59.590> if<00:04:59.830> they<00:04:59.890> had

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
things I reckon two things if they had

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.610 
things I reckon two things if they had
gone<00:05:00.340> from<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:00.790> super<00:05:01.300> Megaforce<00:05:02.020> footage

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
and cut out die range if I just

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.240 
and cut out die range if I just
completely<00:05:05.440> there<00:05:05.980> would<00:05:06.100> have<00:05:06.130> been
