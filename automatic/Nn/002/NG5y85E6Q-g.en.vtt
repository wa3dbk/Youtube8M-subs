00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 and I'm going to teach how to make a speaker 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.359
 with spotlights leds autitos rhythmic 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.359
 materials are these 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:22.350
 a speaker connected to an amplifier 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:26.840
 of any power 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.840
 here I have no computers 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.060
 few led 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:38.489
 mine are green they have to see where 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.489
 it's the positive side and the negative side 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.000
 one of these here from those who are 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.540
 looking under the arrows so you do not 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.540
 burn 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:59.190
 a screwdriver 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.190
 star or king or plane of any 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.979
 of which you need to connect 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:13.020
 this here so you do not burn the 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:13.020
 focus led on the positive pole to the leds 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.320
 first we disarm the speaker 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.900
 the speaker has to be fine 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.760
 connected without any failure 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:32.890
 because after the focus will not work 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.260
 that connects you to others who work and 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.260
 then and it worked, let's see 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.899
 we have the speaker unarmed 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.330
 now we communicate the town 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.000
 exposition of the focus to the positive people 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:56.009
 of the speaker connected to the amplifier 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.009
 the negative pole itself 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.130
 and we put him in the positive pole in 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.130
 the respective and the negative also 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.319
 and place where you want and ready 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:16.330
 you already have your speaker with led to a 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:21.600
 rhythmic audit subscribe please no 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.600
 insult is enough of bullying 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.040

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.040
