00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
I was able to produce the very first

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.920 
I was able to produce the very first
snow<00:02:35.780> blonde<00:02:36.709> trans-pecos<00:02:37.580> which<00:02:38.420> I<00:02:38.660> only<00:02:38.780> had

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
snow blonde trans-pecos which I only had

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.720 
snow blonde trans-pecos which I only had
one<00:02:38.959> out<00:02:39.290> of<00:02:39.440> sixty<00:02:39.769> four<00:02:39.950> chances<00:02:40.370> of<00:02:40.519> doing

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
one out of sixty four chances of doing

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.060 
one out of sixty four chances of doing
that<00:02:40.850> so<00:02:40.910> that<00:02:41.269> was<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.650> accumulation<00:02:42.650> of

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
that so that was the accumulation of

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.000 
that so that was the accumulation of
seven<00:02:43.519> years<00:02:43.730> of<00:02:44.090> work<00:02:44.330> it<00:02:44.780> looks<00:02:45.769> different

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
seven years of work it looks different

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.250 
seven years of work it looks different
to<00:02:46.370> they're<00:02:46.580> just<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:47.150> regular

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
to they're just a regular

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.520 
to they're just a regular
it's<00:02:48.950> no<00:02:49.159> blonde<00:02:49.720> has<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:50.989> yellow<00:02:51.140> blotches

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
it's no blonde has the yellow blotches

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.160 
it's no blonde has the yellow blotches
but<00:02:51.920> it<00:02:52.040> doesn't<00:02:52.370> have<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.640> h's<00:02:53.090> they're<00:02:53.959> just

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
but it doesn't have the h's they're just

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.199 
but it doesn't have the h's they're just
a<00:02:54.260> little<00:02:54.500> round<00:02:54.709> blotches<00:02:55.220> it's<00:02:55.670> essentially

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
a little round blotches it's essentially

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.789 
a little round blotches it's essentially
almost<00:02:56.360> a<00:02:56.599> solid<00:02:56.959> white<00:02:57.170> snake

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
almost a solid white snake

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.580 
almost a solid white snake
so<00:02:58.310> trip<00:02:58.549> recessive<00:02:59.540> if<00:02:59.959> it's<00:03:00.110> a<00:03:00.200> triple

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
so trip recessive if it's a triple

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.149 
so trip recessive if it's a triple
