the<00:00:50.490> really<00:00:50.910> difficult<00:00:51.360> part<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.870> my<00:00:52.050> hair

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
the really difficult part of my hair

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.750 
the really difficult part of my hair
which<00:00:52.380> is<00:00:52.410> like<00:00:53.130> there's<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.370> middle<00:00:53.550> section

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
which is like there's a middle section

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.510 
which is like there's a middle section
right<00:00:54.060> here<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:55.020> if<00:00:55.260> your<00:00:55.410> natural<00:00:55.890> maybe<00:00:56.130> you

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
right here and if your natural maybe you

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.010 
right here and if your natural maybe you
have<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.790> same<00:00:56.970> issue<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.540> just<00:00:57.570> gets<00:00:57.870> me

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
have the same issue it just gets me

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.960 
have the same issue it just gets me
really<00:00:58.230> mad<00:00:58.650> at<00:00:58.860> towards<00:00:59.220> the<00:00:59.370> middle<00:00:59.670> for<00:00:59.880> me

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
really mad at towards the middle for me

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.450 
really mad at towards the middle for me
so<00:01:00.810> that's<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.110> only<00:01:01.200> place<00:01:01.470> I<00:01:01.620> use<00:01:01.860> the<00:01:02.160> steam

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
so that's the only place I use the steam

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.189 
so that's the only place I use the steam
but<00:01:03.180> everything<00:01:03.450> else<00:01:03.630> I<00:01:03.720> didn't<00:01:03.989> use<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
but everything else I didn't use the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.569 
but everything else I didn't use the
steam<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.769> had<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.009> on<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.159> setting<00:01:05.460> of

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:05.579 
steam and I had it on the setting of

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:10.820 
steam and I had it on the setting of
maybe<00:01:06.320> six<00:01:08.030> six<00:01:09.030> for<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.360> most<00:01:09.570> part<00:01:09.990> here<00:01:10.620> and

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
maybe six six for the most part here and

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.100 
maybe six six for the most part here and
like<00:01:11.670> through<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.909> bag<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.300> in<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:12.720> middle

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
like through the bag and in the middle

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.149 
like through the bag and in the middle
part<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.440> I<00:01:13.500> was<00:01:13.620> talking<00:01:13.890> about<00:01:13.920> it's

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
part that I was talking about it's

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:14.870 
part that I was talking about it's
really<00:01:14.220> difficult

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
really difficult

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.750 
really difficult
I<00:01:14.940> had<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.330> 7<00:01:15.890> but<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.310> said<00:01:17.550> I<00:01:17.580> don't

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
I had it on a 7 but like I said I don't

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.120 
I had it on a 7 but like I said I don't
want<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.360> bump<00:01:18.690> straight<00:01:18.960> thing<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.620> can<00:01:19.920> go

flat<00:02:39.040> iron<00:02:39.220> so<00:02:39.910> I<00:02:39.940> think<00:02:40.150> it's<00:02:40.540> I<00:02:40.959> don't<00:02:41.440> know

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
flat iron so I think it's I don't know

flat iron so I think it's I don't know
what<00:02:42.519> I<00:02:42.670> Rachel<00:02:43.150> multi-purpose<00:02:44.110> it<00:02:44.950> doesn't

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
what I Rachel multi-purpose it doesn't

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.550 
what I Rachel multi-purpose it doesn't
have<00:02:45.489> any<00:02:45.640> bias<00:02:45.940> it's<00:02:46.540> just<00:02:46.720> just<00:02:47.290> a<00:02:47.410> great

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560
