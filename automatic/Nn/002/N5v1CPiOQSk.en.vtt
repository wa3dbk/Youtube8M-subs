00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello in this video I show you 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 you just feel yourself 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.059
 can tinker pearl earrings 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:13.559
 For this you need a thin pliers 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.509
 a scissors, of course, then two pearls 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.690
 do you need the two wheel pieces 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.960
 at least ten centimeters long each 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.140
 then you need two earring hooks 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.550
 and four crimp beads at the purchase of the 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.130
 lock must be careful 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.130
 that your wire will naturally fit through it 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:36.360
 In the first step 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.129
 you take a earring hook and a 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.440
 piece of wire and now you will find the 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.239
 wire through the loop of the earring 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.340
 Hook so now you need a squeeze 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:54.480
 pearl and thread it on one side 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:56.940
 by rat are you taking that now 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.820
 other end of the wire on the other 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:07.020
 side and thread is through the squeeze 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:09.830
 throat and if you then once 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.479
 by since pulling her squish pearl 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:20.540
 down to the bend amouren hook down 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.540
 and print it with the pliers 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.850
 next you put on your pearl 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.150
 so 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:40.380
 and now another squeeze is coming 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:43.690

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.729
 pay attention that they are very close 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.530
 the ball sits that the ball no 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.160
 more space to wiggle back and forth 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:54.240
 has and at the end of still the 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:59.340
 excess wire is cut off 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.240
 and then your first ring is done 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.550

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.550
