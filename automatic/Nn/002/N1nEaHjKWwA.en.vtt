00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.080 
so you're going to be playing cards

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.050 
so you're going to be playing cards
adding<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.770> your<00:00:46.800> creatures<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.580> then<00:00:47.940> you'll

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
adding to your creatures and then you'll

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.730 
adding to your creatures and then you'll
have<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.360> feed<00:00:48.600> them<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.020> then<00:00:49.320> at<00:00:49.380> the<00:00:49.470> end<00:00:49.500> of

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
the game whoever is the most surviving

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.420 
the game whoever is the most surviving
creatures<00:00:51.300> will<00:00:51.720> win<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.890> now<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.310> I've

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
creatures will win so now that I've

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.100 
creatures will win so now that I've
given<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.850> brief<00:00:54.150> overview<00:00:54.660> let's<00:00:54.900> take

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
given you that brief overview let's take

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.800 
given you that brief overview let's take
a<00:00:55.140> look<00:00:55.410> at<00:00:55.680> how<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.250> theme<00:00:56.700> plays<00:00:57.090> into<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
a look at how the theme plays into the

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.050 
a look at how the theme plays into the
game<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.320> then<00:00:58.890> what<00:00:59.100> my<00:00:59.250> thoughts<00:00:59.520> are<00:00:59.730> on<00:00:59.790> it

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 
game and then what my thoughts are on it

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.229 
game and then what my thoughts are on it
so<00:01:01.050> here<00:01:01.380> you<00:01:01.530> see<00:01:01.670> everything<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.820> comes<00:01:03.060> in

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
so here you see everything that comes in

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.119 
so here you see everything that comes in
the<00:01:03.329> box<00:01:03.540> for<00:01:03.840> evolution<00:01:04.350> Origin<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.859> Species

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
the box for evolution Origin of Species

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.309 
the box for evolution Origin of Species
so<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.609> is<00:01:05.759> a<00:01:05.789> card<00:01:06.210> game<00:01:06.299> quite<00:01:06.840> obviously

00:01:07.309 --> 00:01:07.319 
so this is a card game quite obviously

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:10.029 
so this is a card game quite obviously
as<00:01:07.829> indicated<00:01:08.429> by<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.609> huge<00:01:09.090> deck<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.569> cards

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
as indicated by the huge deck of cards

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:12.109 
as indicated by the huge deck of cards
apparently<00:01:11.039> some<00:01:11.249> of<00:01:11.369> which<00:01:11.520> are<00:01:11.700> flipped<00:01:11.969> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
apparently some of which are flipped the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.289 
apparently some of which are flipped the
wrong<00:01:12.270> direction<00:01:13.100> but<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.819> doesn't<00:01:15.179> matter

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
wrong direction but that doesn't matter

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.629 
wrong direction but that doesn't matter
also<00:01:16.109> you<00:01:16.170> get<00:01:16.380> some<00:01:16.679> tokens<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.340> can<00:01:17.490> see

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:17.639 
also you get some tokens you can see

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:19.160 
also you get some tokens you can see
these<00:01:17.789> tokens<00:01:18.060> here<00:01:18.389> they're<00:01:18.539> actually<00:01:18.810> flat

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
these tokens here they're actually flat

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.069 
these tokens here they're actually flat
little<00:01:19.409> plastic<00:01:19.950> pieces<00:01:20.569> not<00:01:21.569> the<00:01:21.840> best

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
little plastic pieces not the best

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:25.010 
little plastic pieces not the best
pieces<00:01:22.439> but<00:01:22.740> not<00:01:22.979> terribly<00:01:23.819> bad<00:01:23.999> they<00:01:24.659> come<00:01:24.869> in

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
pieces but not terribly bad they come in

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.129

being fat you're also going to get a

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.239 
being fat you're also going to get a
pair<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.299> dice<00:01:33.659> which<00:01:34.350> are<00:01:34.619> available<00:01:34.770> for

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.790 
the first phase of each round is called
the<00:02:02.490> development<00:02:03.330> phase<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.290> development

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
the development phase and a development

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.650 
the development phase and a development
phase<00:02:05.040> players<00:02:05.460> are<00:02:05.640> going<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.910> be<00:02:06.030> making<00:02:06.270> new

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
phase players are going to be making new

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.290 
phase players are going to be making new
animals<00:02:07.170> by<00:02:07.380> playing<00:02:07.650> their<00:02:07.920> cards<00:02:08.090> so<00:02:09.090> let's

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
animals by playing their cards so let's

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.300 
animals by playing their cards so let's
say<00:02:09.450> for<00:02:09.600> example<00:02:09.960> I<00:02:10.050> had<00:02:10.289> these<00:02:10.470> six<00:02:10.740> cards<00:02:11.160> I

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
say for example I had these six cards I

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.390 
say for example I had these six cards I
would<00:02:11.910> be<00:02:12.030> able<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.390> play<00:02:12.570> one<00:02:13.020> card<00:02:13.350> per<00:02:13.620> turn

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
would be able to play one card per turn

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.490 
would be able to play one card per turn
in<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.910> phase<00:02:15.180> in<00:02:15.540> order<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.140> make<00:02:16.320> new

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
in the phase in order to make new

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.320 
in the phase in order to make new
animals<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.160> cards<00:02:17.700> can<00:02:17.850> be<00:02:17.880> played<00:02:18.120> in<00:02:18.240> two

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
animals and cards can be played in two

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.690 
animals and cards can be played in two
ways<00:02:18.630> first<00:02:19.590> they<00:02:19.920> can<00:02:19.980> be<00:02:20.160> played<00:02:20.370> facedown

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
ways first they can be played facedown

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.940 
ways first they can be played facedown
which<00:02:21.390> will<00:02:21.510> be<00:02:21.600> creating<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.200> new<00:02:22.230> animal<00:02:22.800> and

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
which will be creating a new animal and

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.020 
which will be creating a new animal and
you're<00:02:23.040> allowed<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.370> have<00:02:23.490> as<00:02:23.610> many<00:02:23.730> animals

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
you're allowed to have as many animals

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.920 
you're allowed to have as many animals
as<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.450> like

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
as you like

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.050 
as you like
but<00:02:25.170> you're<00:02:25.290> gonna<00:02:25.380> have<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.650> feed<00:02:25.890> them<00:02:26.130> the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
but you're gonna have to feed them the

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.360 
but you're gonna have to feed them the
other<00:02:27.209> way<00:02:27.390> cards<00:02:27.750> can<00:02:27.930> be<00:02:27.959> played<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.410> face<00:02:29.160> up

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
other way cards can be played is face up

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.820 
other way cards can be played is face up
as<00:02:29.790> traits<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.600> so<00:02:31.020> for<00:02:31.140> example<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.530> can<00:02:31.650> see

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
as traits and so for example you can see

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.920 
as traits and so for example you can see
here<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.220> this<00:02:32.400> card<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:32.820> called<00:02:33.360> running

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
here that this card is called running

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.080 
here that this card is called running
and<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:34.920> says<00:02:35.100> whenever<00:02:35.400> your<00:02:35.610> animal<00:02:35.970> with

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
and it says whenever your animal with

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.229 
and it says whenever your animal with
this<00:02:36.240> trait<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:36.630> attacked<00:02:37.320> by<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.590> carnivore

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
this trait is attacked by a carnivore

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.660 
this trait is attacked by a carnivore
roll<00:02:39.239> a<00:02:39.270> die<00:02:39.630> if<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.410> die<00:02:40.560> roll<00:02:40.830> is<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:40.980> 4<00:02:41.250> 5<00:02:41.459> or<00:02:41.640> 6

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
roll a die if the die roll is a 4 5 or 6

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.180 
roll a die if the die roll is a 4 5 or 6
survive<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:43.380> attacking<00:02:43.709> carnivorous

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
survive the attacking carnivorous

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.550 
survive the attacking carnivorous
antonov<00:02:44.880> tac<00:02:45.270> another<00:02:45.600> turn<00:02:46.020> another<00:02:46.170> animal

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
antonov tac another turn another animal

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.430 
antonov tac another turn another animal
during<00:02:46.770> this<00:02:46.890> turn<00:02:47.130> so<00:02:47.390> basically<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:49.290> could

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
during this turn so basically you could

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.930 
during this turn so basically you could
play<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:49.739> on<00:02:49.860> your<00:02:50.010> animal<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.370> now<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.820> is

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
play this on your animal and now it is

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.000 
play this on your animal and now it is
better<00:02:51.180> able<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.510> escape<00:02:52.170> from<00:02:52.380> carnivores

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
better able to escape from carnivores

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.770 
better able to escape from carnivores
potentially<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:53.910> so<00:02:54.360> you're<00:02:54.510> going<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.690> be

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
potentially and so you're going to be

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.960 
potentially and so you're going to be
building<00:02:54.930> animals<00:02:55.530> by<00:02:55.650> adding<00:02:55.980> traits<00:02:56.280> and

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
building animals by adding traits and

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.820 
building animals by adding traits and
making<00:02:57.450> them<00:02:57.600> better<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:57.989> more<00:02:58.170> survivable

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
making them better and more survivable

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.710 
making them better and more survivable
so<00:02:59.040> for<00:02:59.280> example<00:02:59.610> this<00:02:59.700> one<00:02:59.940> gives<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.510> animal

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
so for example this one gives the animal

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.750 
so for example this one gives the animal
fat<00:03:01.110> tissue<00:03:01.380> he<00:03:01.650> can<00:03:01.800> need<00:03:01.920> extra<00:03:02.280> food<00:03:02.520> and

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
fat tissue he can need extra food and

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.460 
fat tissue he can need extra food and
he'll<00:03:03.209> actually<00:03:03.450> be<00:03:03.690> able<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.870> store<00:03:04.110> up<00:03:04.320> food

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
he'll actually be able to store up food

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.530 
he'll actually be able to store up food
come<00:03:04.739> turn<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:05.010> turn<00:03:05.160> or<00:03:05.610> you<00:03:06.030> can<00:03:06.180> flip<00:03:06.360> this

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
come turn to turn or you can flip this

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.690 
come turn to turn or you can flip this
card<00:03:06.810> over<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.260> make<00:03:07.709> him<00:03:07.890> high<00:03:08.070> body<00:03:08.400> weight

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
card over and make him high body weight

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.520 
card over and make him high body weight
which<00:03:09.120> is<00:03:09.150> going<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.510> make<00:03:09.630> him<00:03:09.810> require<00:03:10.200> more

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
which is going to make him require more

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.560 
which is going to make him require more
food<00:03:10.890> meaning<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:11.670> he'll<00:03:11.820> need<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.269> food

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
food meaning that he'll need to food

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.810 
food meaning that he'll need to food
each<00:03:12.720> round<00:03:12.989> but<00:03:13.769> he<00:03:13.980> can<00:03:14.130> only<00:03:14.280> be<00:03:14.400> attacked

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
each round but he can only be attacked

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.570 
each round but he can only be attacked
by<00:03:15.120> other<00:03:15.360> high<00:03:16.320> body<00:03:16.650> weight<00:03:16.920> carnivorous

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
by other high body weight carnivorous

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.970 
by other high body weight carnivorous
animals<00:03:18.360> so<00:03:19.080> this<00:03:19.200> would<00:03:19.350> go<00:03:19.440> underneath<00:03:19.709> this

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
animals so this would go underneath this

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.039 
animals so this would go underneath this
animal<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.549> now<00:03:20.880> he<00:03:20.940> needs<00:03:21.239> to<00:03:21.330> food<00:03:21.720> but<00:03:21.900> he's

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
animal and now he needs to food but he's

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.690 
animal and now he needs to food but he's
also<00:03:22.380> worth<00:03:22.530> after<00:03:22.739> victory<00:03:23.220> points<00:03:23.519> at<00:03:23.610> the

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
also worth after victory points at the

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.900 
also worth after victory points at the
end<00:03:23.820> of<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.030> game<00:03:25.160> carnivore<00:03:26.160> is<00:03:26.340> going<00:03:26.820> to

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
end of the game carnivore is going to

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.940 
end of the game carnivore is going to
make<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.180> able<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.630> attack<00:03:27.930> other<00:03:28.200> animals<00:03:28.739> on

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
make you able to attack other animals on

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.100 
make you able to attack other animals on
your<00:03:29.010> opponent's<00:03:29.790> side<00:03:29.970> so<00:03:30.510> we're<00:03:30.959> just

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
your opponent's side so we're just

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.570 
your opponent's side so we're just
showing<00:03:31.320> one<00:03:31.530> player<00:03:31.769> side<00:03:32.070> here<00:03:32.280> but<00:03:32.430> each

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
showing one player side here but each

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.699 
showing one player side here but each
player<00:03:32.880> would<00:03:33.420> have<00:03:33.600> their<00:03:33.840> own<00:03:34.049> tableau<00:03:34.560> of

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
player would have their own tableau of

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.530 
player would have their own tableau of
animals<00:03:35.160> and<00:03:35.489> you<00:03:35.850> would<00:03:35.970> be<00:03:36.060> able<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.330> place

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
animals and you would be able to place

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.940 
animals and you would be able to place
these<00:03:36.780> cards<00:03:37.170> out<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.320> let's<00:03:37.680> say<00:03:37.799> for

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
these cards out and let's say for

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.590 
these cards out and let's say for
example<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.310> made<00:03:38.519> my<00:03:38.700> running<00:03:39.090> animal<00:03:39.450> a

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
example I made my running animal a

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.470 
example I made my running animal a
carnivore<00:03:40.410> so<00:03:41.130> now<00:03:41.250> he<00:03:41.310> needs<00:03:41.700> more<00:03:41.940> food<00:03:42.269> but

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
carnivore so now he needs more food but

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.740 
carnivore so now he needs more food but
he's<00:03:42.630> also<00:03:42.810> able<00:03:43.140> to<00:03:43.260> eat<00:03:43.500> other<00:03:43.680> animals<00:03:44.750> when

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
he's also able to eat other animals when

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.479 
he's also able to eat other animals when
a<00:03:45.810> carnivore<00:03:46.350> eats<00:03:46.380> other<00:03:46.739> animals<00:03:47.190> which<00:03:47.340> it

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
a carnivore eats other animals which it

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.190 
a carnivore eats other animals which it
may<00:03:47.610> only<00:03:47.790> be<00:03:48.060> able<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.299> eat<00:03:48.480> based<00:03:48.780> on<00:03:49.019> other

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
may only be able to eat based on other

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.320 
may only be able to eat based on other
traits<00:03:49.590> that<00:03:49.739> are<00:03:49.799> happening<00:03:49.980> so<00:03:50.580> you<00:03:51.000> know<00:03:51.090> it

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
traits that are happening so you know it

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.460 
traits that are happening so you know it
may<00:03:51.450> not<00:03:51.480> be<00:03:51.720> able<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:51.900> eat<00:03:52.019> the<00:03:52.170> running

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
may not be able to eat the running

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.020 
may not be able to eat the running
animal<00:03:52.860> or<00:03:52.980> if<00:03:53.070> it's<00:03:53.160> not<00:03:53.310> a<00:03:53.340> high<00:03:53.519> body<00:03:53.760> weight

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
animal or if it's not a high body weight

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.370 
animal or if it's not a high body weight
it<00:03:54.180> may<00:03:54.269> not<00:03:54.420> be<00:03:54.600> able<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:54.840> eat<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:54.959> high<00:03:55.110> body

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
it may not be able to eat a high body

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.819 
it may not be able to eat a high body
weight<00:03:55.620> animal<00:03:56.070> but<00:03:56.820> carnivorous<00:03:57.829> animals

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
weight animal but carnivorous animals

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.020 
weight animal but carnivorous animals
can<00:03:58.950> eat<00:03:59.070> all<00:03:59.220> either<00:03:59.370> your<00:03:59.579> opponent's

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
can eat all either your opponent's

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.270 
can eat all either your opponent's
animals<00:04:00.420> or<00:04:00.570> your<00:04:00.870> own<00:04:01.019> animals<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:01.709> in<00:04:02.100> doing

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
animals or your own animals and in doing

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.560 
animals or your own animals and in doing
so<00:04:02.400> they'll<00:04:02.730> actually<00:04:02.880> get<00:04:03.150> some<00:04:03.329> of<00:04:03.360> this

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
so they'll actually get some of this

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.960 
so they'll actually get some of this
extra<00:04:04.110> food<00:04:04.350> from<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:05.040> side<00:04:05.250> here<00:04:05.579> and<00:04:05.730> this

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
extra food from the side here and this

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.490 
extra food from the side here and this
would<00:04:06.120> go<00:04:06.269> on<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.690> animal

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
would go on the animal

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.350 
would go on the animal
and<00:04:08.500> essentially<00:04:09.460> that<00:04:09.580> animal<00:04:09.940> would<00:04:10.030> be<00:04:10.150> fed

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
and essentially that animal would be fed

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.300 
and essentially that animal would be fed
but<00:04:10.630> that's<00:04:10.810> part<00:04:11.050> of<00:04:11.110> the<00:04:11.230> feeding<00:04:11.590> phase<00:04:11.830> so

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
but that's part of the feeding phase so

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.490 
but that's part of the feeding phase so
let's<00:04:12.520> hold<00:04:12.730> that<00:04:12.820> for<00:04:13.240> now<00:04:13.330> but<00:04:13.960> essentially

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
let's hold that for now but essentially

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.930 
let's hold that for now but essentially
each<00:04:14.740> round<00:04:15.070> in<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.490> development<00:04:15.850> phase

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
each round in the development phase

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.340 
each round in the development phase
players<00:04:16.420> will<00:04:16.540> be<00:04:16.600> playing<00:04:16.630> cards<00:04:17.140> either

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
players will be playing cards either

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.620 
players will be playing cards either
face<00:04:17.620> down<00:04:17.859> or<00:04:17.890> face<00:04:18.190> up<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.850> add<00:04:18.970> traits<00:04:19.420> or

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
face down or face up to add traits or

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.870 
face down or face up to add traits or
add<00:04:19.870> animals<00:04:20.410> to<00:04:20.530> their<00:04:20.620> tableau<00:04:21.070> in<00:04:21.549> order<00:04:21.790> to

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
add animals to their tableau in order to

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.660 
add animals to their tableau in order to
try<00:04:22.090> and<00:04:22.210> score<00:04:22.390> victory<00:04:22.750> points<00:04:23.110> later<00:04:23.670> after

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
try and score victory points later after

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.070 
try and score victory points later after
everybody<00:04:25.060> has<00:04:25.150> done<00:04:25.330> feeding<00:04:25.630> you're<00:04:25.900> going

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
everybody has done feeding you're going

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.450 
everybody has done feeding you're going
to<00:04:26.140> look<00:04:26.290> and<00:04:26.410> see<00:04:26.590> if<00:04:26.680> any<00:04:26.830> of<00:04:26.890> these<00:04:27.040> animals

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
to look and see if any of these animals

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.890 
to look and see if any of these animals
need<00:04:27.640> more<00:04:27.820> food<00:04:28.030> tokens<00:04:28.480> and<00:04:28.600> if<00:04:28.690> they<00:04:28.840> do

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
need more food tokens and if they do

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.450 
need more food tokens and if they do
they're<00:04:29.440> going<00:04:29.650> to<00:04:29.770> be<00:04:29.890> removed<00:04:30.190> from<00:04:30.340> the

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
they're going to be removed from the

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.860 
they're going to be removed from the
board<00:04:30.610> so<00:04:30.820> let's<00:04:30.850> say<00:04:31.150> for<00:04:31.180> example<00:04:31.780> our

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
board so let's say for example our

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.200 
board so let's say for example our
carnivore<00:04:32.440> wasn't<00:04:32.830> able<00:04:32.980> to<00:04:33.130> eat<00:04:33.400> any<00:04:33.670> animals

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
carnivore wasn't able to eat any animals

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.240 
carnivore wasn't able to eat any animals
on<00:04:34.360> his<00:04:34.480> turn<00:04:34.720> and<00:04:34.990> he's<00:04:35.440> going<00:04:35.650> to<00:04:35.800> die<00:04:35.980> off

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
on his turn and he's going to die off

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.760 
on his turn and he's going to die off
all<00:04:37.240> of<00:04:37.510> these<00:04:37.690> cards<00:04:38.140> would<00:04:38.230> be<00:04:38.290> added<00:04:38.650> to<00:04:38.740> a

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
all of these cards would be added to a

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.860 
all of these cards would be added to a
discard<00:04:39.310> pile<00:04:39.520> which<00:04:40.180> would<00:04:40.330> be<00:04:40.450> next<00:04:40.660> to<00:04:40.780> the

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
discard pile which would be next to the

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.980 
discard pile which would be next to the
deck<00:04:41.760> after<00:04:42.760> the<00:04:42.850> extinction<00:04:43.240> phase<00:04:43.630> players

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
deck after the extinction phase players

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.840 
deck after the extinction phase players
are<00:04:44.230> going<00:04:44.380> to<00:04:44.500> draw<00:04:44.770> cards<00:04:45.250> based<00:04:45.520> on<00:04:45.669> how

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
are going to draw cards based on how

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.330 
are going to draw cards based on how
many<00:04:45.910> surviving<00:04:46.510> animals<00:04:46.660> they<00:04:47.020> have<00:04:47.340> for

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
many surviving animals they have for

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.090 
many surviving animals they have for
example<00:04:48.370> if<00:04:49.330> a<00:04:49.510> player<00:04:49.750> has<00:04:49.990> one<00:04:50.530> surviving

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
example if a player has one surviving

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.380 
example if a player has one surviving
animal<00:04:51.430> they're<00:04:51.580> going<00:04:51.760> to<00:04:51.850> draw<00:04:52.060> one<00:04:52.360> card

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
animal they're going to draw one card

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.900 
animal they're going to draw one card
plus<00:04:53.200> one<00:04:53.500> for<00:04:53.800> their<00:04:53.890> one<00:04:54.070> surviving<00:04:54.580> animal

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
plus one for their one surviving animal

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.130 
plus one for their one surviving animal
so<00:04:55.030> essentially<00:04:55.419> you're<00:04:55.540> going<00:04:55.690> to<00:04:55.750> draw<00:04:55.900> one

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
so essentially you're going to draw one

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.870 
so essentially you're going to draw one
extra<00:04:56.470> card<00:04:56.680> for<00:04:56.890> each<00:04:56.950> dividing<00:04:57.460> animal<00:04:57.790> you

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
extra card for each dividing animal you

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.760 
extra card for each dividing animal you
have<00:04:58.090> so<00:04:59.050> if<00:04:59.140> you<00:04:59.200> were<00:04:59.290> to<00:04:59.380> have<00:04:59.470> four

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
have so if you were to have four

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.380 
have so if you were to have four
surviving<00:05:00.250> animals<00:05:00.370> you<00:05:00.700> would<00:05:00.820> draw<00:05:01.030> five

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
surviving animals you would draw five

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.810 
surviving animals you would draw five
cards<00:05:01.419> adding<00:05:02.230> them<00:05:02.350> to<00:05:02.500> your<00:05:02.530> hand<00:05:02.830> the<00:05:03.610> game

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
cards adding them to your hand the game

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.850 
cards adding them to your hand the game
will<00:05:04.030> end<00:05:04.150> when<00:05:04.540> the<00:05:04.750> deck<00:05:04.960> is<00:05:04.990> depleted<00:05:05.710> and

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
will end when the deck is depleted and

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.980 
will end when the deck is depleted and
then<00:05:06.250> you'll<00:05:06.370> go<00:05:06.550> through<00:05:06.580> one<00:05:07.120> more<00:05:07.419> turn<00:05:07.690> at

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
then you'll go through one more turn at

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.840

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
points for each animal you have that

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.600 
points for each animal you have that
survives<00:05:13.479> and<00:05:13.780> one<00:05:14.350> point<00:05:14.650> for<00:05:14.890> each<00:05:14.979> trait<00:05:15.370> on

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.540 
survives and one point for each trait on
is<00:05:15.790> surviving<00:05:16.300> animal<00:05:16.950> you<00:05:17.950> may<00:05:18.100> also<00:05:18.310> get

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
is surviving animal you may also get

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.730 
is surviving animal you may also get
additional<00:05:18.820> points<00:05:19.360> for<00:05:19.810> extra<00:05:20.260> cards<00:05:20.650> which

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
additional points for extra cards which

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.590 
additional points for extra cards which
would<00:05:20.890> give<00:05:21.010> you<00:05:21.160> plus<00:05:21.940> two<00:05:22.000> your<00:05:22.360> food

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
would give you plus two your food

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.090 
would give you plus two your food
requirements<00:05:22.990> so<00:05:23.200> for<00:05:23.350> example<00:05:23.650> high<00:05:23.800> body

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
requirements so for example high body

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.790 
requirements so for example high body
weight<00:05:24.370> would<00:05:24.790> be<00:05:24.940> worth<00:05:25.120> one<00:05:25.479> extra<00:05:25.930> point<00:05:26.140> at

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
weight would be worth one extra point at

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.140 
weight would be worth one extra point at
the<00:05:26.979> end<00:05:27.070> of<00:05:27.160> the<00:05:27.220> game<00:05:27.400> whoever<00:05:27.580> has<00:05:27.880> the<00:05:28.000> most

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
the end of the game whoever has the most

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.790 
the end of the game whoever has the most
points<00:05:28.360> on<00:05:28.600> the<00:05:28.690> board<00:05:28.810> is<00:05:29.050> going<00:05:29.290> to<00:05:29.410> be<00:05:29.530> the

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
points on the board is going to be the

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.390 
points on the board is going to be the
winner<00:05:30.600> so<00:05:31.600> that's<00:05:31.810> how<00:05:32.050> evolution<00:05:32.800> origin<00:05:33.310> of

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
winner so that's how evolution origin of

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.300 
winner so that's how evolution origin of
species<00:05:33.790> plays<00:05:34.060> out<00:05:34.360> and<00:05:34.890> despite<00:05:35.890> my<00:05:36.160> initial

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
species plays out and despite my initial

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.909 
species plays out and despite my initial
excitement<00:05:37.090> about<00:05:37.240> the<00:05:37.360> theme<00:05:37.600> I<00:05:37.870> have<00:05:38.560> to<00:05:38.740> say

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
excitement about the theme I have to say

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.980 
excitement about the theme I have to say
that<00:05:39.130> I<00:05:39.160> was<00:05:39.340> a<00:05:39.370> little<00:05:39.820> bit<00:05:40.000> disappointed<00:05:40.900> in

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
that I was a little bit disappointed in

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.110 
that I was a little bit disappointed in
the<00:05:41.110> gameplay<00:05:41.350> now<00:05:41.800> I<00:05:42.100> wouldn't<00:05:42.700> call<00:05:42.910> it<00:05:43.060> a

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
the gameplay now I wouldn't call it a

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.540 
the gameplay now I wouldn't call it a
bad<00:05:43.360> game<00:05:43.750> I<00:05:44.110> would<00:05:44.560> just<00:05:44.740> say<00:05:44.979> that<00:05:45.190> it<00:05:45.280> might

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
bad game I would just say that it might

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.580 
bad game I would just say that it might
have<00:05:45.850> a<00:05:45.880> little<00:05:46.060> bit<00:05:46.180> of<00:05:46.330> a<00:05:46.390> tendency<00:05:46.630> for<00:05:47.560> a

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
have a little bit of a tendency for a

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.700 
have a little bit of a tendency for a
runaway<00:05:48.190> leader<00:05:48.760> type<00:05:49.150> of<00:05:49.360> scenario<00:05:49.930> and<00:05:50.200> the

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
runaway leader type of scenario and the

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.909 
runaway leader type of scenario and the
reasoning<00:05:51.220> is<00:05:51.430> as<00:05:51.910> follows<00:05:52.540> when<00:05:53.410> you<00:05:53.590> draw

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
reasoning is as follows when you draw

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.250 
reasoning is as follows when you draw
cards<00:05:54.430> at<00:05:54.550> the<00:05:54.669> end<00:05:54.850> of<00:05:55.060> the<00:05:55.210> phase<00:05:55.479> you<00:05:55.810> get

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
cards at the end of the phase you get

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.650 
cards at the end of the phase you get
more<00:05:56.650> cards<00:05:57.010> for<00:05:57.490> having<00:05:57.820> more<00:05:58.060> surviving

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
more cards for having more surviving

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.960 
more cards for having more surviving
animals<00:05:58.840> so<00:05:59.680> if<00:05:59.950> you<00:06:00.070> managed<00:06:00.430> to<00:06:00.460> keep<00:06:00.700> all<00:06:00.910> of

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
animals so if you managed to keep all of

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.400 
animals so if you managed to keep all of
your<00:06:01.090> guys<00:06:01.210> alive<00:06:01.540> which<00:06:01.750> is<00:06:01.870> already<00:06:02.080> putting

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
your guys alive which is already putting

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.920 
your guys alive which is already putting
you<00:06:02.500> into<00:06:02.650> a<00:06:02.830> beneficial<00:06:03.520> situation<00:06:03.750> you<00:06:04.750> end

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
you into a beneficial situation you end

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.020 
you into a beneficial situation you end
up<00:06:05.050> getting<00:06:05.320> more<00:06:05.530> cards<00:06:06.010> to<00:06:06.100> further<00:06:06.460> benefit

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
up getting more cards to further benefit

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.279 
up getting more cards to further benefit
you

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
you

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.139 
you
beneficial<00:06:07.680> situation<00:06:08.369> give<00:06:08.759> you<00:06:08.909> more

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:09.149 
beneficial situation give you more

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:11.089 
beneficial situation give you more
choices<00:06:09.419> to<00:06:09.659> choose<00:06:09.899> from<00:06:09.960> for<00:06:10.289> traits<00:06:10.529> more

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:11.099 
choices to choose from for traits more

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:13.459 
choices to choose from for traits more
cards<00:06:11.490> to<00:06:11.669> use<00:06:11.879> for<00:06:12.180> animals<00:06:12.569> and<00:06:12.749> just

00:06:13.459 --> 00:06:13.469 
cards to use for animals and just

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:15.260 
cards to use for animals and just
generally<00:06:13.979> giving<00:06:14.309> you<00:06:14.399> a<00:06:14.430> better<00:06:14.759> chance<00:06:15.089> at

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
generally giving you a better chance at

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.839 
generally giving you a better chance at
winning<00:06:15.710> so<00:06:16.710> perhaps<00:06:17.009> to<00:06:17.249> throw<00:06:17.490> some<00:06:17.699> type<00:06:17.819> of

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:17.849 
winning so perhaps to throw some type of

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:20.450 
winning so perhaps to throw some type of
compensatory<00:06:18.689> mechanism<00:06:19.499> to<00:06:19.619> make<00:06:19.770> the<00:06:20.219> loser

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
compensatory mechanism to make the loser

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.889 
compensatory mechanism to make the loser
perform<00:06:20.969> a<00:06:21.029> little<00:06:21.149> bit<00:06:21.270> better<00:06:21.419> I<00:06:21.539> think<00:06:21.659> that

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:21.899 
perform a little bit better I think that

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:24.920 
perform a little bit better I think that
the<00:06:21.990> game<00:06:22.199> might<00:06:22.469> shine<00:06:23.069> a<00:06:23.099> little<00:06:23.490> more<00:06:23.729> now<00:06:24.629> I

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
the game might shine a little more now I

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.049 
the game might shine a little more now I
think<00:06:25.319> the<00:06:25.589> game<00:06:25.740> will<00:06:25.860> also<00:06:26.249> shine<00:06:26.550> more<00:06:26.849> with

00:06:27.049 --> 00:06:27.059 
think the game will also shine more with

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:29.299 
think the game will also shine more with
more<00:06:27.270> players<00:06:27.599> with<00:06:28.589> fewer<00:06:28.830> players<00:06:29.009> you're

00:06:29.299 --> 00:06:29.309 
more players with fewer players you're

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:31.820 
more players with fewer players you're
going<00:06:29.460> to<00:06:29.520> see<00:06:29.669> a<00:06:29.699> little<00:06:29.969> bit<00:06:30.180> more<00:06:30.419> of<00:06:31.289> a<00:06:31.439> just

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
going to see a little bit more of a just

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.859 
going to see a little bit more of a just

with more players you're going to try

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.779 
with more players you're going to try

and see more balancing across the board

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:40.760 
and see more balancing across the board
rather<00:06:39.360> than<00:06:39.629> just<00:06:39.809> the<00:06:39.930> direct<00:06:40.259> attacking

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
rather than just the direct attacking

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.070 
rather than just the direct attacking
that<00:06:41.069> you<00:06:41.249> get<00:06:41.399> from<00:06:41.580> two<00:06:41.759> people<00:06:42.119> so<00:06:42.779> if

time<00:06:52.949> I'd<00:06:53.339> say<00:06:53.669> evolution<00:06:54.119> of<00:06:54.180> origin

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:54.509 
time I'd say evolution of origin

time I'd say evolution of origin
evolution<00:06:54.779> origin<00:06:55.559> of<00:06:55.649> species<00:06:56.039> is<00:06:56.249> an

evolution origin of species is an

evolution origin of species is an

00:06:58.879 --> 00:06:58.889 
interesting game I just don't think it's

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:01.659 
interesting game I just don't think it's
