00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.440 
run across the thing from right to left
so<00:02:41.860> i'm<00:02:41.950> going<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.130> play<00:02:44.250> but<00:02:45.250> if<00:02:45.489> i<00:02:45.819> was<00:02:46.090> for

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
example trying to create a scene where

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.050 
example trying to create a scene where
the<00:02:48.489> Scout<00:02:48.819> got<00:02:49.180> hit<00:02:49.599> by<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.049> medic<00:02:50.640> as<00:02:51.640> he<00:02:51.940> was

the Scout got hit by the medic as he was
crossing<00:02:52.239> it<00:02:52.630> as<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:52.930> can<00:02:53.140> see<00:02:53.349> that<00:02:53.380> doesn't

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
crossing it as you can see that doesn't

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.759 
crossing it as you can see that doesn't
happen<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.459> Scout<00:02:54.760> is<00:02:55.170> across<00:02:56.170> there<00:02:56.440> before

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
happen the Scout is across there before

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.559 
happen the Scout is across there before
that<00:02:56.920> so<00:02:57.099> how<00:02:57.280> do<00:02:57.340> I<00:02:57.459> make<00:02:57.640> that<00:02:57.819> happen<00:02:58.000> well<00:02:58.540> I

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
that so how do I make that happen well I

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.479 
that so how do I make that happen well I
could<00:02:58.989> try<00:02:59.110> retaking<00:02:59.799> it<00:02:59.860> until<00:03:00.130> I<00:03:00.160> got<00:03:00.400> the

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
could try retaking it until I got the

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.360 
could try retaking it until I got the
timing<00:03:00.760> just<00:03:00.910> right<00:03:01.209> or<00:03:01.599> I<00:03:01.630> could<00:03:01.900> do<00:03:02.019> this

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
timing just right or I could do this

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.170 
timing just right or I could do this
simply<00:03:03.370> double-click<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:05.470> shot<00:03:05.769> and<00:03:06.370> it<00:03:07.060> will

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
simply double-click the shot and it will

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.870 
simply double-click the shot and it will
expand<00:03:07.660> down<00:03:07.930> into<00:03:08.560> this<00:03:09.099> you<00:03:09.340> will<00:03:09.489> see<00:03:09.700> the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
expand down into this you will see the

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.380 
expand down into this you will see the
channel<00:03:10.390> track<00:03:10.750> group<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:12.120> some<00:03:13.120> other<00:03:13.299> stuff

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
channel track group and some other stuff

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.030 
channel track group and some other stuff
here<00:03:13.780> down<00:03:13.959> here<00:03:13.989> take<00:03:14.380> one<00:03:14.410> is<00:03:14.739> what<00:03:14.890> we're

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
here down here take one is what we're

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.970 
here down here take one is what we're
specifically<00:03:15.609> interested<00:03:15.940> in<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:16.829> in<00:03:17.829> this

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
specifically interested in and in this

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.160 
specifically interested in and in this
case<00:03:18.160> I'm<00:03:18.280> going<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.489> expand<00:03:18.819> take<00:03:19.150> one<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:19.870> as

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
case I'm going to expand take one and as

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.140 
case I'm going to expand take one and as
we<00:03:20.290> can<00:03:20.410> see<00:03:20.470> we've<00:03:20.709> got<00:03:20.739> cameras<00:03:21.489> these<00:03:21.940> are

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
we can see we've got cameras these are

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.120 
we can see we've got cameras these are
all<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.540> elements<00:03:22.900> that<00:03:23.109> make<00:03:23.410> up<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.859> shot

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
all the elements that make up the shot

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.740 
all the elements that make up the shot
and<00:03:24.400> I<00:03:24.489> think<00:03:24.700> you<00:03:24.790> can<00:03:24.970> probably<00:03:25.150> guess<00:03:25.389> by

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
and I think you can probably guess by

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.840 
and I think you can probably guess by
now<00:03:25.780> where<00:03:26.109> I'm<00:03:26.230> going<00:03:26.590> with<00:03:26.709> this<00:03:26.769> I'm<00:03:27.700> going

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
now where I'm going with this I'm going

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.059 
now where I'm going with this I'm going
to<00:03:27.940> go<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.420> world<00:03:28.660> models<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.950> the

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
to go to the world models and to the

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.940 
to go to the world models and to the
game<00:03:30.400> sounds<00:03:31.359> because<00:03:32.319> they<00:03:32.620> are<00:03:32.769> all

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
game sounds because they are all

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.789 
game sounds because they are all
synchronized<00:03:33.760> and<00:03:34.060> as<00:03:34.720> we<00:03:34.900> can<00:03:35.079> see<00:03:35.139> we've<00:03:35.769> got

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
synchronized and as we can see we've got

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.250 
synchronized and as we can see we've got
the<00:03:36.190> Scout<00:03:36.670> channel<00:03:37.150> clip<00:03:37.420> in<00:03:37.569> the<00:03:37.660> scattergun

channel clip I have to move them

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:40.680 
channel clip I have to move them
together<00:03:39.819> because<00:03:40.180> otherwise<00:03:40.389> the

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.620 
going to have to kind of play with it a
little<00:04:27.470> bit<00:04:27.770> but<00:04:29.530> ok<00:04:30.530> that's<00:04:30.890> pretty<00:04:31.630> close

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
little bit but ok that's pretty close

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.050 
little bit but ok that's pretty close
I'd<00:04:32.990> say<00:04:33.470> and<00:04:33.830> now<00:04:34.010> if<00:04:34.160> I<00:04:34.280> go<00:04:34.310> to<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:34.760> top<00:04:35.000> of

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
I'd say and now if I go to the top of

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.400 
I'd say and now if I go to the top of
the<00:04:35.360> shot<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:37.430> Scout<00:04:37.700> runs<00:04:37.940> across<00:04:38.200> he<00:04:39.200> gets

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
the shot the Scout runs across he gets

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.680 
the shot the Scout runs across he gets
stabbed<00:04:39.800> or<00:04:40.310> he<00:04:40.610> would<00:04:40.850> if<00:04:41.090> I<00:04:41.240> was<00:04:41.390> doing<00:04:41.540> this

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
stabbed or he would if I was doing this

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.410 
stabbed or he would if I was doing this
the<00:04:42.020> right<00:04:42.050> way<00:04:42.400> so<00:04:43.400> that<00:04:43.430> gives<00:04:43.910> you<00:04:44.120> an<00:04:44.300> idea

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
the right way so that gives you an idea

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.660 
the right way so that gives you an idea
of<00:04:44.720> how<00:04:45.290> you<00:04:45.350> can<00:04:45.650> adjust<00:04:45.770> individual

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
of how you can adjust individual

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.700 
of how you can adjust individual
elements<00:04:47.120> you<00:04:47.270> can<00:04:47.300> actually<00:04:48.050> adjust<00:04:48.170> any

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
elements you can actually adjust any

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.970 
elements you can actually adjust any
element<00:04:49.340> within<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:50.390> entire<00:04:50.990> shot<00:04:51.500> all<00:04:51.740> of

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
element within the entire shot all of

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.490 
element within the entire shot all of
the<00:04:52.100> cameras<00:04:52.780> anything<00:04:53.780> that<00:04:54.110> has<00:04:54.290> an

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
the cameras anything that has an

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.110 
the cameras anything that has an
animation<00:04:54.830> set<00:04:55.160> or<00:04:55.340> does<00:04:55.520> not<00:04:55.700> have<00:04:56.000> an

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
animation set and if I create an

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.710 
animation set and if I create an

animation set for the Scout it will add

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.930 
animation set for the Scout it will add
it<00:04:59.750> to<00:05:00.140> the<00:05:00.260> list<00:05:00.290> although<00:05:00.830> it<00:05:01.400> will<00:05:01.550> appear

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
here at that point it will appear in the

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.350 
here at that point it will appear in the
channel<00:05:03.950> track<00:05:04.190> group<00:05:04.520> instead<00:05:04.850> of<00:05:04.970> undertake

get into this interface and decide you

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.530 
get into this interface and decide you
know<00:05:10.340> you<00:05:10.400> want<00:05:10.640> to<00:05:10.700> go<00:05:10.790> back<00:05:10.970> to<00:05:11.180> the<00:05:11.210> main

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
channels part of that the main track

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.970 
channels part of that the main track
timing<00:05:14.390> was<00:05:14.570> just<00:05:14.600> hit<00:05:14.960> the<00:05:15.080> UP<00:05:15.230> button<00:05:15.260> here

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
this with view models also if you're

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.580 
this with view models also if you're
doing<00:05:32.480> anything<00:05:32.720> from<00:05:32.990> a<00:05:33.140> first-person

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
doing anything from a first-person

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.890 
doing anything from a first-person
perspective<00:05:34.160> so<00:05:35.000> that<00:05:35.030> the<00:05:35.390> view<00:05:35.570> models

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
perspective so that the view models

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.120 
perspective so that the view models
aren't<00:05:36.050> ending<00:05:36.320> up<00:05:36.410> floating<00:05:36.620> around<00:05:36.860> on

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
aren't ending up floating around on

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.150 
aren't ending up floating around on
their<00:05:37.310> own<00:05:37.460> but<00:05:38.450> for<00:05:39.110> our<00:05:39.140> purposes<00:05:39.830> we<00:05:40.040> only

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
their own but for our purposes we only

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.240 
their own but for our purposes we only
needed<00:05:40.430> to<00:05:40.580> do<00:05:40.700> the<00:05:40.820> world<00:05:41.060> models<00:05:41.600> but<00:05:42.250> so

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
needed to do the world models but so

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.340 
needed to do the world models but so
it's<00:05:44.000> not<00:05:44.210> trivial<00:05:44.510> because<00:05:44.780> you<00:05:44.990> got<00:05:45.140> to<00:05:45.230> make

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
it's not trivial because you got to make

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.810 
it's not trivial because you got to make
sure<00:05:45.380> you<00:05:45.590> move<00:05:45.740> all<00:05:45.919> the<00:05:46.040> right<00:05:46.190> elements<00:05:46.340> but

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
sure you move all the right elements but

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.790 
sure you move all the right elements but
it's<00:05:47.120> not<00:05:47.360> difficult<00:05:47.630> to<00:05:47.930> do<00:05:48.110> either<00:05:48.410> and

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
it's not difficult to do either and

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.350 
it's not difficult to do either and
again<00:05:49.160> once<00:05:49.370> you're<00:05:49.520> done<00:05:49.640> you<00:05:49.820> just<00:05:49.850> go<00:05:50.150> and

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
again once you're done you just go and

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.880 
again once you're done you just go and
hit<00:05:50.510> the<00:05:50.720> UP<00:05:50.930> button<00:05:51.140> and<00:05:51.440> you'll<00:05:51.530> be<00:05:51.710> back<00:05:51.860> in

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
hit the UP button and you'll be back in

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.670 
hit the UP button and you'll be back in
your<00:05:52.070> normal<00:05:52.820> familiar<00:05:53.510> timeline<00:05:54.050> overview

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
your normal familiar timeline overview

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.550 
your normal familiar timeline overview
interface<00:05:55.340> so<00:05:55.940> that's<00:05:56.870> how<00:05:57.140> you<00:05:57.200> can<00:05:57.440> adjust

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
interface so that's how you can adjust

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.560
