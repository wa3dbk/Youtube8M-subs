00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
all you have to do now is put in the

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:32.029 
all you have to do now is put in the
capsule

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
capsule

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.760 
capsule
it'll<00:01:33.039> just<00:01:33.450> click<00:01:34.450> right<00:01:34.690> on<00:01:34.869> if<00:01:35.349> you<00:01:35.470> put<00:01:35.649> it

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
it'll just click right on if you put it

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.910 
it'll just click right on if you put it

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.650 

now<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:41.979> next<00:01:42.399> step<00:01:42.610> I'm<00:01:42.819> not<00:01:43.119> quite<00:01:43.360> sure<00:01:43.390> the

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
now the next step I'm not quite sure the

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.779 
now the next step I'm not quite sure the
terminology<00:01:44.619> but<00:01:44.860> let's<00:01:45.220> just<00:01:45.399> call<00:01:45.580> this<00:01:45.729> the

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
terminology but let's just call this the

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.700 
terminology but let's just call this the
belt

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.970 

so<00:01:49.710> we'll<00:01:49.920> just<00:01:50.220> loop<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.700> around<00:01:50.910> the<00:01:51.240> back

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
so we'll just loop that around the back

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.010 
so we'll just loop that around the back
again<00:01:52.980> there's<00:01:53.460> clips<00:01:53.700> on<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.030> back<00:01:54.180> three<00:01:54.930> of

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
again there's clips on the back three of

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.480 
again there's clips on the back three of
them<00:01:55.230> thread<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.650> through<00:01:55.800> properly

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
them thread it through properly

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.660 
them thread it through properly
and<00:01:57.200> you<00:01:58.200> should<00:01:58.410> click<00:01:58.710> your<00:01:58.980> capsule<00:01:59.520> back

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
and you should click your capsule back

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.340 
and you should click your capsule back
in<00:01:59.910> again<00:02:02.030> again<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.240> don't<00:02:03.360> know<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> proper

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
in again again I don't know the proper

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.380 
in again again I don't know the proper
terminology<00:02:04.620> but<00:02:05.490> there's<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.880> clip<00:02:06.120> on<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
terminology but there's a clip on the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.500 
terminology but there's a clip on the
back<00:02:06.570> which<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.110> should<00:02:07.350> fasten<00:02:08.000> to<00:02:09.000> your<00:02:09.240> car

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.610 
back which you should fasten to your car
somewhere<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.820> that's<00:02:11.820> it<00:02:12.330> now<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.110> just<00:02:13.350> pop

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
somewhere and that's it now you just pop

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.740 
somewhere and that's it now you just pop
the<00:02:13.800> handle<00:02:13.950> back<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:14.970> can<00:02:15.180> put<00:02:15.420> your<00:02:15.450> baby

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
in like I said earlier in the video this

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.440 
in like I said earlier in the video this

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
is where you have to learn from my

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.570 
is where you have to learn from my
mistake<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:22.140> actually<00:02:22.860> have<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.160> push<00:02:23.370> the
