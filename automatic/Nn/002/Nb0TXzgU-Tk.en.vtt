00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.630
 in front of the abdomen so the abdominals 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.070
 but also on the side and also the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.830
 back muscles for really they 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.300
 are solid and stable in progress ok on 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.160
 will start with the boards exercise 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.040
 frontal a classic exercise our 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.820
 place and especially claude kunz where the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.000
 shoulders then back x 2 places in 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.890
 Plank position well right 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.350
 looking at the elongated neck to Colombian 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.960
 right we do not want to see the buttocks too 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.890
 up or down it would be nice and at 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.510
 craft his life at age 65 and then in the 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.400
 cause it's too difficult can do the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.559
 same exercise but by filing 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.210
 knees on the floor like that he'll have to 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.260
 half board 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.150
 ok now to work the 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.600
 side muscles thirsty at the board 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.820
 lateral between placing on the side with 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.340
 the elbow on the shoulder 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.799
 legs well elongated and then you get up 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.409
 and you still hold true at age 65 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.539
 if it's too difficult to bend the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.820
 knee underneath and then our thirst at the 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.100
 half side boards now we're going 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.200
 work the back muscles in with 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.649
 the 2011 exercise that lay on the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.170
 back places feet hip width 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.929
 you raise the basin and you go down a 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.829
 vertebra at a time to unroll the 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.600
 spine 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.409
 and then after that the movement is repeated 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.820
 in which he remains only at 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.159
 finish by working 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.040
 the other side and so you can redo 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.170
 the exercise of side boards and if 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.600
 never is it easy what you can 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.940
 do is lift a leg and a 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.460
 arms and coming at the same time like that 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.520
 and there raises a leg and arm evening 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.300
 it's really hard and waking up 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.430
 and then we repeat we worked the front 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.720
 the side has it real side it's done 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.459
 really all around the abdomen 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.170
 with its meaning really supported in 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.570
 running if you want it to be little 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.550
 difficult you can even do twice 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.720
 the cycle three times four times you 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.670
 be really really felt 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.530
 not so the former working 3 years we 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.760
 do you can do it as well before 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.739
 training after training 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.340
 you do before training all done 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.440
 shorter time 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.209

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.810
 enumerators well well stable if you do 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.340
 after training the sculptor more 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.010
 long is really exhausted your 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.269
