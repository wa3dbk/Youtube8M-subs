 "Feelings and Intestines: Probiotics and Mental Health" 

00:00:06.743 --> 00:00:17.058
 Before thorazine was invented in 1950, mental illnesses were often treated operatively. 

00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:24.270
 In 1949 the inventors of the lobotomy were even awarded the Nobel Prize, 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:31.340
 but before tens of thousands of patients underwent lobotomy, colectomy was a hit. 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.660
 There was a theory that the cause of mental illness 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.915
 are bad intestinal bacteria and rot in the gut 

00:00:37.915 --> 00:00:43.335
 so the treatment was simply that the colon was surgically removed. 

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:45.654
 Yes, the operation killed about one in three people 

00:00:45.654 --> 00:00:49.835
 but when they didn't die, the surgeons boasted that, for example, 

00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:54.200
 if the intestine has been removed as a precautionary measure in school-age children, 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.080
 abnormal sexual practices such as masturbation have been stopped 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.540
 which was then considered a precursor of mental illness in later life. 

00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:09.496
 But there were other ways that required less drastic procedures. 

00:01:09.496 --> 00:01:11.960
 And these suggested that this intestinal rot could be treated instead 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.480
 by changing the intestinal flora. 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.820
 So, more than a century ago, there have been reports of successful treatment for psychiatric diseases, 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.923
 such as depression, using a probiotic-based diet. 

00:01:23.923 --> 00:01:28.648
 Doctors perceived the connection between depression and that of feces 

00:01:28.648 --> 00:01:33.370
 there was not enough, they did not have the right humidity and they smelled very sharply. 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.451
 And so they gave people probiotics, and not only did people feel better psychologically, 

00:01:37.451 --> 00:01:40.780
 but their feces were more, they were softer 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.130
 they had a more regular consistency "and a strong odor was alleviated". 

00:01:45.132 --> 00:01:51.900
 However, in parallel with probiotics, all patients ate vegetarian food, 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.000
 so it didn't have to be probiotics at all. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.620
 This area of ​​inquiry has remained unnoticed for about a hundred years 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.600
 but recently a new discipline, known as enteric - intestinal - neuroscience has emerged. 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.630
 Our enteric nervous system, a set of nerves in our intestine 

00:02:10.632 --> 00:02:16.760
 it is referred to as our "second brain, because of its size, complexity and similarity". 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.900
 We have the same amount of nerves in our bowels as there are in our spinal cord. 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.460
 And that makes quite sense. 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.770
 The size and complexity of our intestinal brain is not surprising when we take it 

00:02:27.773 --> 00:02:33.590
 the challenges they face as an interface with the largest surface in our body. 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.500
 With the outside world, we have a hundred times more intestinal contact 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.290
 than through skin. 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.300
 And we also have to count on 100 trillion of our little friends down there. 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.680
 It requires a lot of information processing capabilities. 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.320
 Now everyone who has ever experienced butterflies in the belly knows 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.850
 that our mental state can affect our intestines. 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.730
 In fact, they can affect the stressors of our intestinal flora every day. 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.720
 This innovative study focused on scraping faeces 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.900
 from used toilet paper during the test week. 

00:03:04.903 --> 00:03:09.370
 Here is how many bacteria the subjects had in their stools before examination, 

00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:16.500
 But look what happens on the day of the test and it took a whole week. 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:24.140
 So our mental state can affect our intestines, but our intestines can affect ours 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.940
 mental state? Until recently, we didn't know. 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.230
 For example, "many people suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome complain of intestinal dysfunction". 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.580
 So scientists tried to give people probiotics to see if they would be mental 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.600
 and the emotional state could improve; and it really seemed to help. 

00:03:39.603 --> 00:03:43.800
 But what about healthy people? 

00:03:43.802 --> 00:03:48.620
 This is a study that truly shook scientific institutions. 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.270
 Assessment of psychotropic properties of probiotics. 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.620
 It was found that after one month the use of probiotics decreased significantly 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.960
 symptoms of anxiety, depression, anger and hostility. 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.590
 How is it possible? 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.000
 There are a number of mechanisms that have been designed to 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.140
 so that intestinal bacteria can communicate with the brain. 

00:04:11.153 --> 00:04:16.640
 Before this study was published, "the idea that probiotic bacteria produced by the gut 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.160
 they may affect our brain, it looked almost unreal ". 

00:04:20.164 --> 00:04:24.450
 Just like science fiction. Science, yes, but fiction, no. 

00:04:24.453 --> 00:04:28.481
 "It is likely that organisms within us have a certain degree 

00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:31.100
 effect on mental well-being. " 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.500
 Thus, they may have people who suffer from all sorts of mental health problems 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.120
 benefit from stool transplantation 

00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:40.640
 from someone with much cooler bacteria? 

00:04:40.641 --> 00:04:46.010
 We do not know, but "this ability of probiotics to influence brain processes 

00:04:46.014 --> 00:04:54.340
 is perhaps one of the most interesting recent discoveries in probiotics research. "
