 using the microphone that I had before 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.469
 then it may be that the quality of 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.360
 sound and audio because it looks a bit 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.620

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.920
 cover page 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.920
 awaited game very much awaited 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.090
 Expected very much is little I 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.750
 I would even say a little bit about what 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.880
 details that wrap contained here 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.250
 is one of the most anticipated games of 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.090
 the console and this year without any 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.170
 doubt super smash bros for nintendo 3ds 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.750
 3190 cost me half markt here 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.210
 I'm doing it 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.210
 advertising to brands for free 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.860
 well the first thing we're going to do is not 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.830
 I'm going to roll up more than I'm a talker and 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.650
 a heavy thing is to remove the plastic 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.280
 plastic floor mosso museum as a 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.720
 bear and once the plastic was 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.640
 let's see if the ministry is fulfilled 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.060
 mysterious mission boxing that always 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.310
 I do this I dropped it again and 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.670
 you can live life in previous boxes 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.200
 it does not fail when I open this it always 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.120
 have to drop nintendo points 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.130
 we already know that inside the box includes 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.540
 the nintendo points let's see what 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.540
 more includes this preciousness 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.510
 the typical catalog that includes more 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.250
 games company to say 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.140
 is just spending money on a game 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.520
 it may be true do not believe you're going to 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.960
 be the last money that after adapting 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.910
 because here we have a few games 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.979
 more than you're going to like after another 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.390
 something else that includes that this 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.950
 it seems very interesting and that's why I want 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.160
 that you see it and if the camera little since then 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.700
 imagine the possibilities 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.590
 controls so that the autofocus 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.940
 my balls man I've had to focus 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.800
 to me manually good here you can 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.660
 see l grab shield dodge in ere x 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.090
 jump to attack special attack sees it 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.670
 the movements with the joystick and 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.160
 slide or slide fast well that what 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.640
 typical teasing with crosshead and pause 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.580
 start is very well very productive list 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.080
 old and here we have another to choose your 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.690
 wrestler a large number of characters 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.640
 are willing to accept the challenge and 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.830
 Here he shows us some very 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.069
 pretty of the fighters that for 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.620
 course you're not looking either 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.209
 but it's because I do not know a webcam 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.000
 better than if I do not swear you retired 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.040
 then an instruction manual like that 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.380
 great not but here are some pages 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.330
 disgusting of a malevolent drop-down and 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.650
 giant that nobody is going to deploy because 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.239
 if not then there are no eggs to go back to 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.730
 save it this yes that I have includes 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.959
 nintendo of these were a lot and 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.790
 if you have seen we are going to put it in 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.770
 practically all the games because what 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.110
 only one that you throw disgusting disgusting 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.880
 that we have important information 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.739
 if it is so important to inform 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.120
 vital information if you do not read it 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.640
 probably your whole family will end 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.850
 dying but of vejer within 80 90 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.690
 years and the crux of the matter 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:39.590
 the little cartridge so you can see it if my 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.590
 camera focus there 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.730
 to this super smash bros 3ds forgive me 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.120
 but I'm training satan 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.360
 so that the pulse weakens me every 0.3 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.550
 seconds 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.590
 what else does the box include absolutely 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.660
 nothing but the truth that a little bland me 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.460
 I expected that in these slots that 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.110
 they always use to put some 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.550
 cool image or whatever they would have 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.920
 got something since it's such a game 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.410
 great and long-awaited and in the part 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.380
 from behind we're going to give you one last look 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.600
