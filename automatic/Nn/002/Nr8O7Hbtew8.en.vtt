00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:45.090
The big event that excites figures fans, “Wonder Festival,” was held in Makuhari Messe in Chiba.

00:00:46.195 --> 00:00:50.800
A number of fans gathered for the largest figure festival in the world.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:01:00.005
At Wonder Festival, both pros and amateurs display and sell figures they made. 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.845
So to speak, it’s a divine place where it’s all about their modelling skills.

00:01:08.085 --> 00:01:11.365
There’s an expensive figure that costs about 50,000 yen among those.

00:01:11.365 --> 00:01:14.015
I wonder if it will sell.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.485
This? Well, yes it will sell.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.360
On that day, every booth was a great success!

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.985
Looking at this figure market data, I can see that it’s growing.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.330
So tonight, we’re going to look into the figure market that grasps fans’ heart.

00:01:38.415 --> 00:01:43.685
At first, we’re visiting Kaiyodo, which is sponsoring Wonder Festival.

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:48.425
Going in the entrance, the first thing you’ll see is an offertory box.

00:01:48.495 --> 00:01:54.800
Then looking up, what will come out from the huge curtain is...

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.845
a big devil that is probably 4 meters tall!

00:01:59.575 --> 00:02:03.930
The welcoming impact is terrific.

00:02:04.885 --> 00:02:18.130
Kaiyodo originally started as a plastic model shop, and after releasing “chocolate eggs” in 1999, they became known as a pro group of figure modelers.

00:02:18.395 --> 00:02:28.050
Egg-shaped chocolate with a toy inside became the catalyst of the candy toy boom, and sold 130 million items.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.180
It became a legendary product.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:40.930
We asked Shuichi Miyawaki, president of Kaiyodo and the person behind the legend that still leads the figure world, about the “current condition of figures.”

00:02:41.095 --> 00:02:47.470
It’s been only 30 years since figures were created and people recognized them as a business. 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:54.150
It’s still hard to spread figures in Japan.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:04.135
The figures of Iron Man and Evangelion we sold the most of were 30,000 at maximum.

00:03:04.575 --> 00:03:11.530
If we were in the US, we would make 300 thousand with no problem.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:27.370
Figures are like idol DVDs. Regular DVDs sell 6,000, and popular ones sell 30,000.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:34.465
In Japan’s figure market, we keep producing new products to stay in business.

00:03:35.255 --> 00:03:38.590
This year, 48 years will have passed since Kaiyodo was established.

00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:44.995
Kaiyodo has their own strategies to stay in business longer.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:04:01.740
If you want to do marketing on what kind of toys they want, you gather 100 kids and ask them to choose from a robot, Disney, Pokemon, Gundam, Kamen Rider, etc.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:08.720
If you include an ordinary monkey and stuff in the selection, nobody would choose it.

00:04:08.745 --> 00:04:15.420
We’re making figures of a tank and space rocket, but we can’t do marketing on these, either.

00:04:16.345 --> 00:04:21.120
I say this all the time: Marketing can’t produce a big hit.

00:04:22.245 --> 00:04:29.210
Not doing marketing is the way that Kaiyodo sticks to.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.365
For instance, “Water Line Figure” is from the idea that it doesn’t visualize the bottom body, and 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:44.690
“Panorama-style Vignette” is a collage of film scenes and characters with various sizes and angles.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:54.785
Furthermore, from the passion of creating a figure as a noted product or souvenir, we produced figures of things from a zoo, aquarium, museum, etc.

00:04:55.135 --> 00:05:03.320
Their reliable skills have reached overseas, and even the British Museum carries their figures!
