00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:07.169
 Oh everyone-it's a long time in the draft video 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.169
 Let's continue to cut Ri hard 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.410
 goo 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.369
 2 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:35.640
 So I really enjoy playing dry ice recently 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:39.020
 It is too Hiro It is video shooting after a long time this time, but I do not do things like rush properly 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.250
 It is a long time video shooting 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:47.110
 Do I not a no way do the decent Yada 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:50.380
 That's why the game has started It's divided into several groups in this game 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.559
 First iron mining engagement gold mining engagement 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:58.150
 Mid-related wood and coal miners 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:02.240
 And here is the important sky bridge construction and the collection of a certain item 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:05.360
 As of roughly the way we broke up in such a feeling I saw 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.740
 I'm trying to mine 5 and bring out a lucky pick. 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:12.479
 Then cut to some extent 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.009
 Because I will burn a lot of tetsuya money, I write only further, and further increase of Lee which wipes windows 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.680
 At once it's refined c 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:20.100
 A little bit of household defense c 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.100
 Totsuino 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:33.170
 I 've made the rails Some people already know what to do 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:36.500
 It will be almost time for the mid group to come back soon and let's start construction 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:41.330
 I received Skybridge from Blue Team 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.190
 So let's put a rail somewhere on this bridge and say it, and there are a lot of comments on the video. 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.490
 Are you sure you want to even something chat 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.370
 Really recently 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.350
 It's hot, isn't it? 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.979
 It's hot, isn't it? 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:56.060
 There was no really hot conversation recently 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:58.930
 Good morning, let's leave on the trolley and leave 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.930
 Good trip oo 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.590
 The momentum is not enough at all 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.930
 Come go Na Benjamin should be already perfect because you fix me with each other 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.890
 Huh 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:45.730
 Say why the line went crushed is do you do eh enemy has expired on the way 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.730
 Nante Let's repair down guy and for the time being Oh Aa 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.720
 Break two 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.200
 If you do something like this, the game is over 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:07.840
 I want to finish riding on the trolley at least before being returned to the lobby 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.840
 It's like I've done it, I'm going to the enemy base 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.600
 why 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:20.560
 No, unfortunately the game is over without going as it is 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:26.650
 Truck convex in the not say let's draw a line in the basement when you next do 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:29.340
 Parentheses laugh Thank you for your viewing than it was such a feeling Mashitaa the way here 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.340
