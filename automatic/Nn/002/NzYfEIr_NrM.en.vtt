it can take as long as it's in its

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.740 
it can take as long as it's in its
corresponding<00:05:13.729> movement<00:05:14.150> pattern<00:05:14.539> which

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
corresponding movement pattern which

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.050 
corresponding movement pattern which
would<00:05:14.900> be<00:05:15.050> the<00:05:15.169> L<00:05:15.289> shape<00:05:15.590> and<00:05:16.190> it<00:05:16.340> would<00:05:16.430> go<00:05:16.550> 1<00:05:16.820> 2

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
would be the L shape and it would go 1 2

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.730 
would be the L shape and it would go 1 2
3<00:05:17.090> and<00:05:17.780> then<00:05:17.870> one<00:05:18.169> up<00:05:18.349> you<00:05:18.919> can<00:05:19.070> take<00:05:19.250> that<00:05:19.400> pawn

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
3 and then one up you can take that pawn

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.469 
3 and then one up you can take that pawn

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
on the same color does not matter it can

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
take however far once as long as it's on

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.760 
take however far once as long as it's on
that<00:05:28.610> color<00:05:28.849> that<00:05:29.090> the<00:05:29.240> bishop<00:05:29.539> is<00:05:29.660> on<00:05:29.840> and

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
then the Queen again can take where

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.689 
then the Queen again can take where
however<00:05:33.260> it<00:05:33.409> can<00:05:33.560> move<00:05:33.710> however<00:05:34.220> and<00:05:34.340> once<00:05:34.520> so

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:34.699 
however it can move however and once so

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:35.649 
however it can move however and once so
as<00:05:34.820> long<00:05:34.940> as<00:05:35.000> there's<00:05:35.210> nothing<00:05:35.449> in<00:05:35.510> the<00:05:35.570> way

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 
as long as there's nothing in the way

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:38.290 
as long as there's nothing in the way
you<00:05:35.720> can<00:05:35.930> take<00:05:36.110> the<00:05:36.830> blacks<00:05:37.580> corresponding

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
you can take the blacks corresponding

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
piece in that in that vicinity that is

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.110 
piece in that in that vicinity that is
allowed<00:05:41.780> to<00:05:41.960> move<00:05:42.430> so<00:05:43.430> we're<00:05:43.580> just<00:05:43.610> gonna<00:05:43.760> play

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.659 
that's another thing when you check you
have<00:05:57.020> to<00:05:57.289> move<00:05:57.470> either<00:05:58.099> you<00:05:58.310> have<00:05:58.430> to<00:05:58.550> move

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669

have to move either you have to move
your<00:05:58.729> king<00:05:59.000> or<00:05:59.210> put<00:05:59.360> something<00:05:59.659> in<00:05:59.780> the<00:05:59.870> way<00:06:00.020> to

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
your king or put something in the way to

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.770 
your king or put something in the way to
stop<00:06:00.710> from<00:06:00.919> check<00:06:01.190> because<00:06:02.030> the<00:06:02.150> King<00:06:02.389> cannot

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
stop from check because the King cannot

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.300 
stop from check because the King cannot
be<00:06:02.990> in<00:06:03.110> check<00:06:03.349> in<00:06:03.560> that<00:06:03.680> case<00:06:03.860> you<00:06:04.039> would<00:06:04.130> put

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
be in check in that case you would put

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.790 
be in check in that case you would put
that<00:06:04.460> pawn<00:06:04.639> there<00:06:04.909> and<00:06:05.320> it<00:06:06.320> would<00:06:06.470> stop<00:06:06.680> it

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
that pawn there and it would stop it

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.469 
that pawn there and it would stop it
from<00:06:06.919> check<00:06:07.159> because<00:06:07.460> of<00:06:07.580> the<00:06:07.639> night<00:06:07.820> covering

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 
from check because of the night covering

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:09.969 
from check because of the night covering

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:09.979 
the pawn but we'll talk about theory

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:11.800 
the pawn but we'll talk about theory
later<00:06:10.159> on<00:06:10.400> we're<00:06:10.610> just<00:06:10.639> gonna<00:06:11.060> disperse<00:06:11.539> was
