like getting it um so yeah not a huge
step<00:02:13.440> up

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
step up

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.630 
step up
from<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.090> Galaxy<00:02:14.420> Note<00:02:14.450> 4<00:02:15.250> but<00:02:16.250> still

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
from the Galaxy Note 4 but still

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.369 
from the Galaxy Note 4 but still
obviously<00:02:17.000> I'll<00:02:17.120> get<00:02:17.299> one<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:17.870> take<00:02:18.109> a<00:02:18.170> look

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
obviously I'll get one and take a look

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.509 
obviously I'll get one and take a look
at<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:19.989> Galaxy<00:02:20.989> Note<00:02:21.019> edge<00:02:21.519> looks

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
at it the Galaxy Note edge looks

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.520 
at it the Galaxy Note edge looks
interesting<00:02:23.180> looks<00:02:23.359> weird<00:02:23.659> i<00:02:23.900> think<00:02:24.140> it<00:02:24.379> looks

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
interesting looks weird i think it looks

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.199 
interesting looks weird i think it looks
like<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:24.799> screen<00:02:25.069> is<00:02:25.219> too<00:02:25.370> thin<00:02:25.640> or<00:02:25.670> something

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
like the screen is too thin or something

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.970 
like the screen is too thin or something
because<00:02:26.390> they've<00:02:27.019> added<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:27.409> curve<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.950> it

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
because they've added the curve to it

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.309 
because they've added the curve to it
instead<00:02:28.579> of<00:02:28.819> making<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.269> the<00:02:29.659> same<00:02:29.900> width<00:02:30.170> and

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
instead of making it the same width and

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.780 
instead of making it the same width and
then<00:02:30.439> adding<00:02:30.769> that<00:02:30.859> extra<00:02:31.010> if<00:02:31.519> you<00:02:31.579> know<00:02:31.760> I

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
then adding that extra if you know I

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.410 
then adding that extra if you know I
mean<00:02:32.060> but<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:33.260> looks<00:02:33.409> interesting<00:02:33.980> um<00:02:34.189> I<00:02:34.760> think

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
mean but it looks interesting um I think

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.080 
mean but it looks interesting um I think
it's<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.810> gimmick<00:02:35.989> if<00:02:36.379> I'm<00:02:36.590> honest<00:02:36.950> but<00:02:37.790> you

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
it's a gimmick if I'm honest but you

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.399 
it's a gimmick if I'm honest but you
never<00:02:38.269> know<00:02:38.420> maybe<00:02:38.689> it<00:02:38.840> will<00:02:38.959> turn<00:02:39.049> out<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.319> be

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:39.409 
never know maybe it will turn out to be

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.530 
never know maybe it will turn out to be
revolutionary<00:02:40.099> a<00:02:40.280> pretty<00:02:41.060> much<00:02:41.150> guarantee

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
revolutionary a pretty much guarantee

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.110 
revolutionary a pretty much guarantee
you<00:02:41.599> won't<00:02:41.870> but<00:02:42.139> maybe<00:02:42.290> it<00:02:42.470> will<00:02:42.879> who<00:02:43.879> knows

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
you won't but maybe it will who knows

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.960 
you won't but maybe it will who knows
still<00:02:44.900> it's<00:02:45.319> kind<00:02:45.530> of<00:02:45.650> it's<00:02:46.549> a<00:02:46.609> little<00:02:46.700> bit<00:02:46.909> of

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
still it's kind of it's a little bit of

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.270 
still it's kind of it's a little bit of
benefit<00:02:47.329> 8<00:02:47.480> that<00:02:47.750> Jesus<00:02:48.470> Christ<00:02:48.620> it's<00:02:49.220> a

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
benefit 8 that Jesus Christ it's a

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.710 
benefit 8 that Jesus Christ it's a
little<00:02:49.459> bit<00:02:49.579> of<00:02:49.639> innovation<00:02:50.180> which<00:02:50.420> is<00:02:50.569> always

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
little bit of innovation which is always

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.640 
little bit of innovation which is always
nice<00:02:51.019> and<00:02:51.970> then<00:02:52.970> they<00:02:53.120> gave<00:02:53.299> some<00:02:54.200> details<00:02:54.560> of

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
nice and then they gave some details of

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.809 
nice and then they gave some details of
the<00:02:54.709> galaxy<00:02:55.099> gear<00:02:55.340> s<00:02:55.579> which<00:02:55.939> is<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.299> new<00:02:56.689> watch

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
the galaxy gear s which is the new watch

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.089 
the galaxy gear s which is the new watch
now<00:02:58.819> I<00:02:59.120> don't<00:02:59.389> understand<00:03:00.079> one<00:03:00.650> thing<00:03:00.680> about

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
now I don't understand one thing about

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:02.860 
now I don't understand one thing about
this<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.579> get<00:03:02.060> everything<00:03:02.389> apart<00:03:02.629> from<00:03:02.810> this

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
this I get everything apart from this

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.409 
this I get everything apart from this
one<00:03:03.079> thing<00:03:03.379> this<00:03:03.950> new<00:03:04.159> galaxy<00:03:04.549> gear<00:03:04.760> s<00:03:04.879> has<00:03:05.120> a

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:05.419 
one thing this new galaxy gear s has a

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.899 
one thing this new galaxy gear s has a
sim<00:03:05.810> card<00:03:05.840> in<00:03:06.200> it<00:03:06.319> and<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:07.069> idea<00:03:07.189> is<00:03:07.370> you<00:03:07.639> can

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:07.909 
sim card in it and the idea is you can

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:09.640 
sim card in it and the idea is you can
take<00:03:08.060> it<00:03:08.329> without<00:03:08.750> having<00:03:09.109> your<00:03:09.200> phone<00:03:09.439> and

take it without having your phone and

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:10.839 
take it without having your phone and
make<00:03:09.769> phone<00:03:10.040> calls<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:10.430> all<00:03:10.519> these<00:03:10.579> kind<00:03:10.790> of

make phone calls and all these kind of
other<00:03:11.000> stuff<00:03:11.239> but<00:03:11.810> that<00:03:12.169> means<00:03:12.200> you're<00:03:12.530> going

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
other stuff but that means you're going

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.270 
other stuff but that means you're going
to<00:03:12.739> have<00:03:12.799> to<00:03:12.980> have<00:03:13.340> two<00:03:13.930> sims<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:15.230> to<00:03:15.680> pay<00:03:15.950> plans

am<00:03:28.159> I<00:03:28.250> missing<00:03:28.310> a<00:03:28.669> piece<00:03:28.790> of<00:03:28.849> the<00:03:29.030> puzzle<00:03:29.419> and

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
am I missing a piece of the puzzle and

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.379 
am I missing a piece of the puzzle and
if<00:03:30.379> that<00:03:30.680> is<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:30.979> case<00:03:31.010> then<00:03:31.250> it's<00:03:31.819> absolutely

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
if that is the case then it's absolutely

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.020 
if that is the case then it's absolutely
pointless<00:03:32.569> and<00:03:33.470> if<00:03:34.370> it's<00:03:34.579> not<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:34.879> case

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
pointless and if it's not the case

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.189 
pointless and if it's not the case
and<00:03:35.180> they've<00:03:35.299> got<00:03:35.449> some<00:03:35.629> special<00:03:35.900> piece<00:03:36.169> of

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:36.199 
and they've got some special piece of

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.229 
and they've got some special piece of
technology<00:03:36.739> that<00:03:36.769> forwards<00:03:37.579> it<00:03:37.699> or<00:03:37.819> something

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
technology that forwards it or something

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.110 
technology that forwards it or something
then<00:03:38.870> that's<00:03:39.229> very<00:03:39.560> cool<00:03:39.769> I<00:03:40.040> love<00:03:40.729> the<00:03:40.879> look<00:03:41.000> of

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
then that's very cool I love the look of

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.430 
then that's very cool I love the look of
the<00:03:41.180> screen<00:03:41.510> and<00:03:41.540> I<00:03:41.720> think<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:41.989> screen<00:03:42.260> looks

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
the screen and I think the screen looks

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.580 
the screen and I think the screen looks
excellent<00:03:43.120> it's<00:03:44.120> too<00:03:44.329> big<00:03:44.510> though<00:03:44.690> far<00:03:45.409> too

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
excellent it's too big though far too

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.149 
excellent it's too big though far too
big<00:03:45.799> um<00:03:46.180> and<00:03:47.180> then<00:03:48.169> they<00:03:48.319> came<00:03:48.560> on<00:03:48.590> to<00:03:48.859> what<00:03:49.129> I

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:49.159 
big um and then they came on to what I

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:50.800 
big um and then they came on to what I
found<00:03:49.549> most<00:03:49.790> interesting<00:03:50.090> and<00:03:50.479> most<00:03:50.540> people

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
found most interesting and most people

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.449 
found most interesting and most people
would<00:03:51.019> probably<00:03:51.049> find<00:03:51.470> most<00:03:51.739> irrelevant<00:03:52.040> and

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
would probably find most irrelevant and

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.360 
would probably find most irrelevant and
that<00:03:52.849> was<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.030> galaxy<00:03:53.540> gear<00:03:53.959> VR<00:03:54.680> that<00:03:55.220> they've

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
that was the galaxy gear VR that they've

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.550 
that was the galaxy gear VR that they've
been<00:03:55.549> involved<00:03:55.940> with<00:03:56.000> him<00:03:56.239> oculus<00:03:56.750> now<00:03:57.260> I<00:03:57.290> like

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
been involved with him oculus now I like

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.990 
been involved with him oculus now I like
the<00:03:57.709> fact<00:03:57.859> they've<00:03:58.069> gone<00:03:58.220> out<00:03:58.370> and<00:03:58.519> spoken<00:03:58.970> to

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
the fact they've gone out and spoken to

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.280 
the fact they've gone out and spoken to
someone<00:03:59.269> who<00:03:59.449> actually<00:03:59.599> knows<00:03:59.810> what<00:04:00.199> they're

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
someone who actually knows what they're

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.780 
someone who actually knows what they're
talking<00:04:00.319> about<00:04:00.620> in<00:04:00.859> that<00:04:00.949> particular<00:04:01.189> market

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
talking about in that particular market

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.659 
talking about in that particular market
in<00:04:01.939> the<00:04:02.479> name<00:04:02.659> of<00:04:02.689> oculus<00:04:03.409> and<00:04:03.709> they've<00:04:04.430> gone

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:04.669 
in the name of oculus and they've gone

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.270 
in the name of oculus and they've gone
out<00:04:04.729> and<00:04:05.060> create<00:04:06.019> a<00:04:06.079> product<00:04:06.349> together<00:04:06.590> with

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
out and create a product together with

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.800 
out and create a product together with
their<00:04:07.519> input<00:04:07.909> rather<00:04:08.090> than<00:04:08.329> trying<00:04:08.540> to<00:04:08.629> kind

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
their input rather than trying to kind

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.599 
their input rather than trying to kind
of<00:04:08.840> make<00:04:09.049> something<00:04:09.470> themselves<00:04:09.650> that<00:04:10.519> they

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
of make something themselves that they

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.189 
of make something themselves that they
know<00:04:10.759> nothing<00:04:10.970> about<00:04:11.239> so<00:04:11.870> I<00:04:11.900> think<00:04:12.019> that's

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:12.199 
know nothing about so I think that's

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:14.530 
know nothing about so I think that's
great<00:04:12.560> it<00:04:12.859> looks<00:04:13.549> like<00:04:13.790> it<00:04:13.939> could<00:04:14.180> be<00:04:14.209> very

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
great it looks like it could be very

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.529 
great it looks like it could be very
cool<00:04:14.810> it's<00:04:15.560> more<00:04:15.949> of<00:04:16.009> a<00:04:16.159> case<00:04:16.370> as<00:04:16.669> to<00:04:16.729> how<00:04:17.479> the

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
cool it's more of a case as to how the

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.270 
cool it's more of a case as to how the
software<00:04:17.840> is<00:04:18.169> implemented<00:04:18.739> and<00:04:18.919> how<00:04:19.039> much

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
software is implemented and how much

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.830 
software is implemented and how much
software<00:04:19.789> there<00:04:19.970> is<00:04:20.090> to<00:04:20.269> use<00:04:20.509> I<00:04:20.810> think

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
software there is to use I think

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.589 
software there is to use I think
personally<00:04:21.620> I<00:04:22.010> imagine<00:04:22.700> the<00:04:22.880> screens<00:04:23.270> very

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
personally I imagine the screens very

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:24.580 
personally I imagine the screens very
good<00:04:23.810> I<00:04:23.930> imagine<00:04:24.169> it's<00:04:24.289> all<00:04:24.380> quite

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
good I imagine it's all quite

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.140 
good I imagine it's all quite
comfortable<00:04:25.039> and<00:04:25.159> everything<00:04:25.430> else<00:04:25.610> it's

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
comfortable and everything else it's

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.250 
comfortable and everything else it's
really<00:04:26.479> about<00:04:26.539> is

really about is

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.290 
really about is

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
going to be usable and whatnot we'd have

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.570 
going to be usable and whatnot we'd have
to<00:04:29.360> wait<00:04:29.630> and<00:04:29.900> see<00:04:30.170> and<00:04:30.650> see<00:04:31.010> how<00:04:31.160> that<00:04:31.220> kind<00:04:31.520> of
