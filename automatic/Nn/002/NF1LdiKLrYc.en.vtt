00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.629
 good guys and here I am back to sound 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.780
 gough frax and today I 'm here with you a 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.190
 his video is not in live as though 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.160
 you asked on the fan page of 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.230
 facebook to do it live and it's not live 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.630
 for the simple reason that today I go 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.070
 really very very in a hurry but 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.529
 in spite of this I bring you a 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.830
 I think the gameplay I think we say 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.870
 quite quite decent and not only 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.149
 but it is with my favorite class then 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.390
 this video will be called la 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:44.180
 best in class class of black ops 2 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.270
 and this best class on black ops 2 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.550
 the real I say right away and the best class 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.940
 as far as I'm concerned an opinion 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.199
 absolutely subjective in short that 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.300
 I hope I hope to give you short of 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:00.739
 do not take advice about it 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.199
 an obligation or the best class 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.480
 point and just on the black ops 2 no and the 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:09.470
 best class for me go frax play 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:12.979
 better with this class then passing 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:17.570
 in short, to other topics more than anything else 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:20.930
 let's talk about the class precisely ve 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.990
 I explain a moment is a ms mc between 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.450
 parentheses now cruise because that is 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.579
 just got back its own stuff 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.500
 of the kind of the coast cruises but you do 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.530
 pretend who hasn't said anything 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.369
 however it is a m s mc cruise with 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.280
 mimetic irrelevant because the class 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.810
 does not camouflage the grille of 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.920
 the dress does not make the monk and the camouflage 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.840
 does not 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.479
 the weapon as a weapon bonus is using 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.270
 silencer and no quick charger 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.030
 i think fm j silencer 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.439
 therefore silence mj that breaks you i 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.210
 pure or even with a 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.329
 silencer and quick charger 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.490
 in short, I use these words in short 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.430
 two new these two ways the secondary 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.399
 I do not have Mass because I preferred 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.530
 opted we say for a sanitary napkin and how 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.040
 precisely equipment is using one 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.489
 c4 very over power 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.799
 so it is a stunner for the note e 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:24.849
 finally the series of point killings 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:26.829
 in short, fundamental for per 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.469
 this class who are the ones with whom 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:34.390
 I find the web visa torbi better 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:37.000
 such is the medium from the classroom so the medium 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.540
 ba table that harasses your asses to 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.220
 congo babies 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.650
 this because because it is a means 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.430
 really strong then you will also see that 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.109
 as how it should be used less as I think it 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.629
 should be used the half taurus made that 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:55.689
 take the orbital discomfort begin to 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:58.510
 play sponky the area excuse the children 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:00.220
 always congo 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.439
 so then this is advised orbital 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.470
 really a spit is two pounds like 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:08.400
 you can see for the beatle it came to 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.659
 vidor really that you start it starts at 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.159
 have fun with this in this game 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:16.450
 because it really does make so many kills it is 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.889
 well in short 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.739
 so however passing to arguments 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:26.079
 serious kids tomorrow is the deadline 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.010
 deadline for the blog is not true 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.650
 what did I say 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.760
 as soon as the school is now semi 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.229
 followed for some time 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.419
 you know that when you round the school are 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:38.790
 dyslexic however is the deadline 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:42.040
 for the contest where you win nuketown 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.459
 2025 the few policemen arrived 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.099
 I have to tell the truth if you haven't arrived 34 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.319
 bg so I don't know I have yet to decide 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:53.000
 well if you really give all three prizes 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.520
 or give only nuketown 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.700
 I don't know, but we'll see later we'll see 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.640

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.470

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.760
 make a dg for those who don't know what it is 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:17.329
