00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 the safety of some manufactured cars 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.890
 and sold in latin america has a 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.870
 20-year lag in relation to the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.059
 produced in rich countries 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.309
 today the tests of 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.680
 collision of eight models 7 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.150
 commercialized in Brazil none reached 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.990
 full mark 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.820
 The Brazilian is in love with the car. 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.230
 but when choosing a new model 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.580
 he thinks more of the price and design already 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.460
 safety and is a car 100 items 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.399
 this transfer is not very 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.079
 trustworthy not because you do not 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.870
 Brazil is already the third in the ranking 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.840
 world of selling cars behind the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.329
 united states and china but the vehicles 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.700
 Brazilians are still far from the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.410
 the program is more secure. 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.320
 evaluating new cars in america 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.910
 Latino community in partnership with 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.530
 results of the third edition of 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.750
 revealed that there was a 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.699
 progress of the vehicles produced and 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.859
 sold in latin america on the other 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.840
 security levels have shown 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.020
 which popular cars rated 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.729
 produced here are 20 years out of date 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.189
 compared with those manufactured in the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.229
 first world eight models will go through 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.259
 frontal collision tests to a 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.869
 speed of 64 kilometers per hour 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.920
 against an obstacle that simulated another 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.200
 car 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.840
 none of the models got the maximum score 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.509
 five stars but five of them stayed 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.509
 with four stars because the allied 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.390
 resistance to air bags and 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.670
 seat belts the fox goes away 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.570
 is no longer sold in Brazil had three 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.630
 stars 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.450
 already the worst in the evaluation with only one 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.740
 star were renan sandro and the chinese 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.960
 jackie 3 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.390
 the tests identified structures 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.850
 in both bodies 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.610
 life of drivers and 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.250
 passengers and in the case of the sand 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.710
 lack of air becks weighed even more in the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.140
 the consumer has to have this 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.899
 awareness when choosing not 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.030
 think only of design but in all 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.870
 components that can preserve your life 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.869
 and occupants of the vehicle 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.750
 in the streets many drivers are already more 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.820
 aware that in addition to the other belt 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.020
 vehicle's safety features are 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:22.240
 essential 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:24.490
 ARB four abs safety systems and 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.720
 door locks still safely 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:31.150
 walks to jac motors brazil said it will 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.010
 send the test result to the array 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.970
 in China as soon as you receive the 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.460
 information 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.250
 already renan said that the bad result of the 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.950
 sandero is due to the lack of air bag in the 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.500
 tested model a counter resolution 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.440
 determines that any vehicle produced in the 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.810
 Brazil from 2014 should leave 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.130
 factory with air bag and brake system 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.130
 anti locking abs
