00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:07.379
 snapshot review today i'll show you this 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.859
 snapshot 13 w 06 and wish you so 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.859
 have fun 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.439
 yes this snapshot really includes 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.869
 very few renovations and that 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.400
 There are supposedly times again improved 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.350
 Of course I can tell you the light 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.960
 not accurate at this time 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.720
 say because my information is not to 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.969
 what is now exactly what 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.489
 was improved because you can see now 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.780
 Still looks packed when I am 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.550
 now yes the stairs are 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.500
 somehow transparent so let that 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.570
 lies in here I have one 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.340
 torch placed and the loads 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.980
 I do not know about it 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.680
 that was exactly what was planned or whether that 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.960
 in fact there is still a light back if 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.840
 I put it up for a moment 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.280
 set zero and go in here and 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.899
 also dismantle the torch 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.030
 then you can see the light shines here 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.829
 still like i said i can 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.890
 Do not tell you exactly if that's what you wanted 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.380
 or not that will now pull then 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.360
 probably answer later yes 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.740
 then there is simply there 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.170
 improved light 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.630
 like I said I can not 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.390
 really say exactly what 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.979
 everything was improved, yes, then there is 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.590
 At the end as always very many 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.540
 bugfixes which packs all this are the 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.909
