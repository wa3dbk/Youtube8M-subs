00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:15.140
 [Music] 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.250
 the host of a human are mostly 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.960
 very sensual and you push with them 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.689
 similar to your eyes 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.460
 different emotions from the 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.680
 moon consists of upper and lower lip 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.779
 with these two part and the mimic 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.820
 muscles we form the individual words 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.699
 with whom we communicate and who 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.170
 the lips convey our emotions 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.660
 so are not in a portrait too 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.280
 neglect and that's why 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.760
 you now like you realistic 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.980
 drawing we start with the outlines 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.899
 the two groups but you should 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.070
 first only very lightly because synonymous 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.020
 the lips actually only through the 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.980
 shadow inside and around 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.980
 To be defined 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.070
 He stroked between the upper and 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.309
 Lower lip is drawn more strongly 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.960
 that goes deep there 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.230
 synonymous with the lips you have to first 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.430
 again look where the light comes from and 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.450
 Sort accordingly and individual 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.790
 let brighten up 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.710
 so if it is like this example of 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.540
 you have to go upstairs in the women 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.970
 lower lip according to the lips 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.750
 volume a choice shaped something 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.750
 draw brighter 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.500
 continued to define the under lip 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.810
 including a dark shadow of this 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.729
 is formed because the lower lip one 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.250
 has slight curvature to the outside and thus 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.020
 the light obscured as already mentioned 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.430
 the place remains the furthest behind 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.430
 the outside is brighter 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.080
 depending on how your lips appear 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.180
 do you draw the vertical folds 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.700
 rush within the lips or you let 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.600
 They just go away leaving them completely smooth 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.600
 and just work 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.149
 it is with the upper lip 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.800
 Shading again something different there 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.180
 these are not just outside 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.180
 is arched as well as the lower lip 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.090
 around the lips now in the face 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.760
 incorporate you still draw the 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.290
 filter around that is the vault the the 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.290
 connection to the nose manufactures 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.130
 the two elevations above the 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.050
 Notching the upper lip, you have to do it 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.530
 brighter than the delivery can make 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.530
 around 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.060
 so now you are and standing lips completely 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.950
 easy to draw 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.989
