00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.270 

let's<00:00:00.840> talk<00:00:01.020> about<00:00:01.140> the<00:00:01.439> active<00:00:01.890> stage<00:00:02.129> of

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
let's talk about the active stage of

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.500 
let's talk about the active stage of
labour<00:00:02.340> now<00:00:02.669> the<00:00:02.730> active<00:00:03.120> stage<00:00:03.300> of<00:00:03.330> labour

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
labour now the active stage of labour

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.970 
labour now the active stage of labour
that's<00:00:03.959> when<00:00:04.140> things<00:00:04.259> are<00:00:04.470> really<00:00:04.710> starting

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
that's when things are really starting

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.010 
that's when things are really starting
to<00:00:05.310> kick<00:00:05.520> up<00:00:05.700> that's<00:00:06.420> when<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.779> pain<00:00:06.990> gets

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
to kick up that's when the pain gets

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.669 
to kick up that's when the pain gets
really<00:00:07.950> starts<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.490> peak<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.630> that's<00:00:10.230> you

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
really starts to peak and that's you

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:11.930 
really starts to peak and that's you
know<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:10.889> kind<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:11.160> thing<00:00:11.340> where<00:00:11.519> you<00:00:11.550> talk

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
know the kind of thing where you talk

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.520 
know the kind of thing where you talk
where<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.240> hear<00:00:12.389> about<00:00:12.570> women<00:00:12.929> just<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.410> know

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
where you hear about women just you know

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.379 
where you hear about women just you know
really<00:00:14.280> getting<00:00:14.580> out<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:14.700> control<00:00:14.849> with<00:00:15.179> pain

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
really getting out of control with pain

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.200 
really getting out of control with pain
and<00:00:15.949> inactive<00:00:16.949> stage<00:00:17.190> that's<00:00:17.640> basically<00:00:18.090> from

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
and inactive stage that's basically from

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.519 
and inactive stage that's basically from
four<00:00:18.480> centimeters<00:00:18.990> until<00:00:19.260> you're<00:00:19.380> completely

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
four centimeters until you're completely

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.910 
four centimeters until you're completely
dilated<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.490> at<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.180> point<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:22.020> dilatation

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
dilated and at that point the dilatation

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.740 
dilated and at that point the dilatation
should<00:00:23.340> happen<00:00:23.670> fairly<00:00:23.939> quickly<00:00:24.150> now<00:00:24.660> it

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
should happen fairly quickly now it

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.019 
should happen fairly quickly now it
still<00:00:24.990> sometimes<00:00:25.199> goes<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.099> ebbs<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.460> flows

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
still sometimes goes and ebbs and flows

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.880 
still sometimes goes and ebbs and flows
but<00:00:27.390> generally<00:00:27.900> we<00:00:28.050> expect<00:00:28.410> at<00:00:28.529> least<00:00:28.560> a

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
but generally we expect at least a

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.529 
but generally we expect at least a
centimeter<00:00:29.340> an<00:00:29.460> hour<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.880> usually<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> lot

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
centimeter an hour and usually a lot

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.600 
centimeter an hour and usually a lot
more<00:00:30.869> than<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.230> during<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.219> active<00:00:32.579> phase

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
more than that during the active phase

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.310 
more than that during the active phase
of<00:00:33.030> labour<00:00:33.360> your<00:00:33.570> contractions<00:00:34.050> will<00:00:34.200> be

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
of labour your contractions will be

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.690 
of labour your contractions will be
coming<00:00:34.559> closer<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:34.920> closer<00:00:35.100> together<00:00:35.399> they

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
coming closer and closer together they

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.160 
coming closer and closer together they
may<00:00:35.820> even<00:00:36.030> be<00:00:36.149> every<00:00:36.390> one<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.660> two<00:00:36.719> minutes

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
may even be every one to two minutes

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.020 
may even be every one to two minutes
apart<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.980> they're<00:00:38.190> not<00:00:38.309> very<00:00:38.370> getting<00:00:38.879> very

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
apart and they're not very getting very

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.150 
apart and they're not very getting very
much<00:00:39.210> break<00:00:39.450> between<00:00:39.870> them<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.649> contractions

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
much break between them the contractions

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.790 
much break between them the contractions
are<00:00:41.250> very<00:00:41.610> very<00:00:41.850> painful<00:00:42.110> and<00:00:43.110> they<00:00:43.260> last<00:00:43.500> oh

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
are very very painful and they last oh

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.549 
are very very painful and they last oh
roughly<00:00:44.579> 30<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.940> 45<00:00:45.329> seconds<00:00:45.780> each<00:00:45.989> when

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
roughly 30 to 45 seconds each when

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.569 
roughly 30 to 45 seconds each when
you're<00:00:46.680> having<00:00:46.980> them<00:00:47.100> you're<00:00:47.370> gonna<00:00:47.430> do

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
you're having them you're gonna do

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.979 
you're having them you're gonna do
everything<00:00:47.850> can<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.270> breathe<00:00:48.510> through<00:00:48.809> them

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
everything can to breathe through them

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.049 
everything can to breathe through them
if<00:00:49.289> you're<00:00:49.710> going<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.890> decide<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.550> do<00:00:50.850> things

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
if you're going to decide to do things

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.360 
if you're going to decide to do things
naturally<00:00:51.300> or<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.289> would<00:00:52.410> be<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.620> time<00:00:52.860> when

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
naturally or this would be the time when

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.350 
naturally or this would be the time when
you'd<00:00:53.520> really<00:00:53.730> want<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.969> think<00:00:54.059> about<00:00:54.210> getting

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
you'd really want to think about getting

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.560 
you'd really want to think about getting
your<00:00:54.539> pain<00:00:54.780> medicine<00:00:55.789> the<00:00:56.789> active<00:00:57.210> stage<00:00:57.420> of

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
your pain medicine the active stage of

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.029 
your pain medicine the active stage of
labour<00:00:57.629> we're<00:00:58.020> also<00:00:58.109> gonna<00:00:58.320> be<00:00:58.500> wanting<00:00:58.800> to

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
labour we're also gonna be wanting to

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.010 
labour we're also gonna be wanting to
monitor<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.460> baby<00:00:59.670> more<00:00:59.910> closely<00:01:00.420> because<00:01:00.600> as

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
monitor the baby more closely because as

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.750 
monitor the baby more closely because as
you're<00:01:01.530> contracting<00:01:02.039> harder<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:02.550> putting

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
you're contracting harder it's putting

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.670 
you're contracting harder it's putting
more<00:01:02.940> stress<00:01:03.210> on<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.390> baby<00:01:03.660> now<00:01:04.260> babies<00:01:04.559> are

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
more stress on the baby now babies are

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.440 
more stress on the baby now babies are
built<00:01:04.860> for<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.070> stress<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.670> most<00:01:06.060> babies<00:01:06.330> do

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
built for the stress and most babies do

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.960 
built for the stress and most babies do
absolutely<00:01:07.020> fine<00:01:07.670> occasionally<00:01:08.670> though<00:01:08.790> this

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
absolutely fine occasionally though this

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.940 
absolutely fine occasionally though this
is<00:01:09.150> when<00:01:09.330> babies<00:01:10.020> show<00:01:10.439> us<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.799> they're

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
is when babies show us that they're

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.440 
is when babies show us that they're
tiring<00:01:11.369> out<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:11.850> we're<00:01:11.939> gonna<00:01:12.030> want<00:01:12.330> to

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
tiring out and so we're gonna want to

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.480 
tiring out and so we're gonna want to
watch<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.810> baby<00:01:12.990> more<00:01:13.650> closely<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
watch the baby more closely on the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.719 
watch the baby more closely on the
monitor<00:01:15.380> also<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:17.009> often<00:01:17.400> when<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
monitor also this is often when the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.429 
monitor also this is often when the
water<00:01:17.939> will<00:01:18.150> break<00:01:18.390> or<00:01:18.659> when<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.110> water<00:01:19.290> will

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
water will break or when the water will

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.670 
water will break or when the water will
be<00:01:19.530> broken<00:01:19.770> for<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.750> you<00:01:21.750> may<00:01:21.869> see<00:01:21.930> some<00:01:22.290> blood

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
be broken for you you may see some blood

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.719 
be broken for you you may see some blood
and<00:01:22.710> that's<00:01:23.070> normal

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
and that's normal

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.760 
and that's normal
so<00:01:23.939> don't<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.240> worried<00:01:24.540> about<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.750> labor<00:01:25.530> is

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
so don't be worried about that labor is

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.440 
so don't be worried about that labor is
a<00:01:25.799> pretty<00:01:26.070> messy<00:01:26.400> business<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:26.970> there's<00:01:27.360> gonna

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
a pretty messy business so there's gonna

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.420 
a pretty messy business so there's gonna
be<00:01:27.630> fluid<00:01:27.930> coming<00:01:28.110> out<00:01:28.290> blood<00:01:28.799> mucus<00:01:29.280> all

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
be fluid coming out blood mucus all

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.580 
be fluid coming out blood mucus all
kinds<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.820> good<00:01:30.000> stuff<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.200> don't<00:01:31.350> worry

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
kinds of good stuff and so don't worry

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.260 
kinds of good stuff and so don't worry
about<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.920> we're<00:01:32.250> all<00:01:32.369> used<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.880> we

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
about that we're all used to it we
