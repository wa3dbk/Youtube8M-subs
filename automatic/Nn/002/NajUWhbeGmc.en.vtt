00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
house was going to become orthodox

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.120 
house was going to become orthodox
Anglicanism<00:01:08.869> then<00:01:09.110> which<00:01:09.410> case<00:01:09.649> I<00:01:09.890> would<00:01:09.920> be

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
Anglicanism then which case I would be

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.490 
Anglicanism then which case I would be
very<00:01:10.250> very<00:01:10.729> happy<00:01:10.970> but<00:01:11.600> yes<00:01:11.869> because<00:01:12.259> one

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
very very happy but yes because one

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.430 
very very happy but yes because one
thing<00:01:12.530> that<00:01:12.950> really<00:01:13.160> worked<00:01:13.580> in<00:01:13.789> the<00:01:13.910> special

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
thing that really worked in the special

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.770 
thing that really worked in the special
is<00:01:15.890> that<00:01:16.130> even<00:01:16.280> though<00:01:16.520> we<00:01:16.850> had<00:01:17.030> very<00:01:17.420> very

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
is that even though we had very very

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.560 
is that even though we had very very
wide<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:18.620> diverse<00:01:18.800> viewpoints<00:01:19.340> I<00:01:19.970> think<00:01:20.360> all

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
wide and diverse viewpoints I think all

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.290 
wide and diverse viewpoints I think all
of<00:01:20.600> us<00:01:20.870> respected<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.830> process<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:22.910> so<00:01:23.150> we

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
of us respected the process and so we

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.900 
of us respected the process and so we
had<00:01:23.450> an<00:01:23.600> environment<00:01:23.870> where<00:01:24.470> we<00:01:25.130> felt<00:01:25.460> free<00:01:25.880> to

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
had an environment where we felt free to

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.420 
had an environment where we felt free to
speak<00:01:26.270> our<00:01:26.480> minds<00:01:26.990> not<00:01:27.530> have<00:01:27.740> to<00:01:27.950> worry<00:01:28.160> about

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
speak our minds not have to worry about

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.970 
speak our minds not have to worry about
any<00:01:28.790> kind<00:01:29.120> of<00:01:29.390> retribution<00:01:29.810> or<00:01:30.410> personal
