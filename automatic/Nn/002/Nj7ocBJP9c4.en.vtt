well to of why they're going down for so
long<00:01:34.350> I'm<00:01:34.860> not<00:01:35.070> entirely<00:01:35.310> sure<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.520> be

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
long I'm not entirely sure to be

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.340 
long I'm not entirely sure to be
updating<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.420> current<00:01:36.720> gen<00:01:36.869> version<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
updating the current gen version of the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
last version of the game in any way with

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.819 
last version of the game in any way with
this<00:01:39.479> maintenance<00:01:39.869> period<00:01:40.350> but<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.500> guess<00:01:40.680> we

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
this maintenance period but I guess we

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.340 
this maintenance period but I guess we
will<00:01:40.979> have<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.280> wait<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:42.450> course<00:01:42.750> antsy<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.290> I

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
will have to wait of course antsy and I

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.780 
will have to wait of course antsy and I
wanted<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.619> keep<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.860> guys<00:01:43.979> updated<00:01:44.220> with

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
this information because another out

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.020 
this information because another out
that<00:01:46.320> would<00:01:46.409> probably<00:01:46.619> try<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.920> go<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.310> GTA<00:01:47.729> and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
that would probably try to go on GTA and

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.460 
that would probably try to go on GTA and
I<00:01:48.329> kind<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.630> think<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.899> yourselves<00:01:49.200> why<00:01:49.409> are

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
I kind of think to yourselves why are

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.719 
I kind of think to yourselves why are
the<00:01:49.590> server's<00:01:49.920> down<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.369> things<00:01:50.549> like<00:01:50.670> that

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
the server's down and things like that

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.010 
the server's down and things like that
so<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.000> wanted<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.240> keep<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.479> guys<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.840> loop

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
so I wanted to keep you guys in the loop

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.660
