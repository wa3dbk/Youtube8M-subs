00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.900 
ones okay now we're gonna set him aside
and<00:02:47.720> if<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.990> wanted<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.709> I<00:02:50.010> really<00:02:50.400> don't

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
and if you wanted to I really don't

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.449 
and if you wanted to I really don't
think<00:02:51.030> that<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.630> should<00:02:51.750> do<00:02:52.080> this<00:02:52.280> but<00:02:53.280> you

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
think that you should do this but you

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.780 
think that you should do this but you
could<00:02:53.970> at<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.510> lightsaber<00:02:55.020> and<00:02:55.470> this<00:02:56.400> one<00:02:56.610> would

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
could at a lightsaber and this one would

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.940 
could at a lightsaber and this one would
have<00:02:56.820> to<00:02:57.000> be<00:02:57.350> single-payer<00:02:58.350> because<00:02:58.830> his

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
have to be single-payer because his

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.830 
have to be single-payer because his
lightsaber<00:02:59.340> gets<00:02:59.610> cut<00:02:59.820> in<00:02:59.940> half<00:03:00.150> in<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.390> first

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
lightsaber gets cut in half in the first

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.830 
lightsaber gets cut in half in the first
movie<00:03:01.709> but<00:03:01.920> I<00:03:02.700> really<00:03:03.180> don't<00:03:03.300> think<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.720> you

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
movie but I really don't think that you

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.720 
movie but I really don't think that you
should<00:03:04.700> so<00:03:05.700> I'm<00:03:05.940> just<00:03:06.090> gonna<00:03:06.240> go<00:03:06.540> without<00:03:06.810> it

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
should so I'm just gonna go without it

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.210 
should so I'm just gonna go without it

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
steering wheel for me but yeah and then

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.290 
steering wheel for me but yeah and then
to<00:03:26.160> read<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:27.330> little<00:03:27.810> single<00:03:28.230> dot<00:03:28.380> pieces<00:03:29.300> I'm

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
to read a little single dot pieces I'm

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:37.660 
to read a little single dot pieces I'm
gonna<00:03:30.510> be<00:03:30.600> place<00:03:30.870> just<00:03:31.230> right<00:03:31.290> on<00:03:31.620> top<00:03:36.410> and

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
gonna be place just right on top and

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.150 
gonna be place just right on top and
this<00:03:38.670> piece<00:03:38.970> is<00:03:39.390> one<00:03:39.690> of<00:03:39.840> them<00:03:39.989> I<00:03:40.230> think<00:03:40.920> it<00:03:41.070> was

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
this piece is one of them I think it was

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.550 
this piece is one of them I think it was
right<00:03:41.370> there<00:03:41.670> this<00:03:42.450> one<00:03:42.660> needs<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.930> be<00:03:43.110> right

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
right there this one needs to be right

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.320 
right there this one needs to be right
there<00:03:43.769> because<00:03:44.070> it<00:03:44.400> won't<00:03:44.640> work<00:03:44.700> under<00:03:45.180> near

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
there because it won't work under near

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.170 
there because it won't work under near
the<00:03:45.510> others<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.530> save<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.459> back<00:03:47.640> piece<00:03:47.910> for

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
the others and save the back piece for

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.150 
the others and save the back piece for
later<00:03:48.410> so<00:03:49.410> we're<00:03:49.530> gonna<00:03:49.620> do<00:03:49.799> something<00:03:50.070> with

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
later so we're gonna do something with

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.870 
later so we're gonna do something with
that<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:51.780> his<00:03:52.320> legs<00:03:52.620> are<00:03:53.130> made<00:03:53.670> completely

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
that and his legs are made completely

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.690 
that and his legs are made completely
out<00:03:54.269> of<00:03:54.510> just<00:03:54.660> random<00:03:55.110> droid<00:03:55.410> parts<00:03:55.769> so<00:03:56.640> I

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
out of just random droid parts so I

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.280 
out of just random droid parts so I
tried<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.030> make<00:03:57.269> them<00:03:57.480> look<00:03:57.630> like<00:03:57.930> they<00:03:58.200> were

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
tried to make them look like they were

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.280 
tried to make them look like they were
just<00:03:58.380> randomly<00:03:59.250> made<00:03:59.549> and<00:03:59.850> put<00:04:00.450> together<00:04:00.630> and

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
just randomly made and put together and

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.590 
just randomly made and put together and

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
then you're just gonna take this piece

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.479 
then you're just gonna take this piece
and<00:04:03.959> this<00:04:04.830> piece<00:04:05.220> and<00:04:05.549> you<00:04:05.910> put<00:04:06.360> them<00:04:06.540> together

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
and this piece and you put them together

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.539 
and this piece and you put them together
or<00:04:08.489> one<00:04:08.670> of<00:04:08.760> his<00:04:08.850> legs<00:04:10.040> attached<00:04:11.040> that<00:04:11.250> one<00:04:11.430> in

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
or one of his legs attached that one in

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:12.920 
or one of his legs attached that one in
the<00:04:11.640> center<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:12.150> because<00:04:12.510> that's<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:12.840> only

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
the center to because that's the only

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.199 
the center to because that's the only
way<00:04:13.200> it<00:04:13.350> works

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:24.510 

and<00:04:17.209> then<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:20.049> to<00:04:21.049> these<00:04:21.880> pieces<00:04:23.140> but<00:04:24.140> together

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
and then a to these pieces but together

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.610 
and then a to these pieces but together
you<00:04:25.520> have<00:04:25.610> to<00:04:25.730> kind<00:04:25.940> of<00:04:25.970> make<00:04:26.120> them<00:04:26.330> vent<00:04:26.630> for

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
you have to kind of make them vent for

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.890 
you have to kind of make them vent for
them<00:04:27.800> to<00:04:27.920> work<00:04:28.100> right<00:04:28.130> and<00:04:29.090> then<00:04:29.600> put<00:04:29.780> them

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
them to work right and then put them

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.550 
them to work right and then put them
right<00:04:30.020> there<00:04:30.080> and<00:04:31.150> then<00:04:32.150> you<00:04:32.630> are<00:04:33.050> going<00:04:33.380> to

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
right there and then you are going to

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:42.880
