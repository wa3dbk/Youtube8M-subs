00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.480
 even strong but not too dangerous 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.000
 still a day but still a 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:33.050
 half years in the past not judging 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.240

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.670
 removing the plate we are at 4 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.690

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.690
 come to the source 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.190

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.470
 it lets out the cure 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:03:08.050
 then after that it's just the vinaigrette to 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:03:10.950

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.980
 like this is a floor with first 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.920
 before starting the poor had 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.080
 rejected the pieces the poor I hear 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.880
 some joints as we can see 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.180

 this is the point with what we have left at 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.750
 to do it's a pretty fast savate 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.680
 we're not really going to finish our 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:24.230
 proteins before you close it's going 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.960
 go faster on the handlebars but 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.850
 delivered to the crucial stage the pork
