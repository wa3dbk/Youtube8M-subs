00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.080
 lego 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.260
 the first set we are today 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.699
 we will consider the designer from a series 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.980
 lego city 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:28.289
 article 683 snow truck well 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.160
 that we will not be distracted and proceed to 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.160
 our review 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:37.170
 Here is our wonderful box on 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.660
 which depicts a truck cleaning 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.200
 snow after a big snowfall also 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.879
 employee housing directly driver 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.989
 this huge 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.600
 car on the other side adorn 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.280
 various variations what you can do 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.020
 with this set 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:02.300
 his chips are gadgets and so on let's 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.300
 open our box two valves 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:20.690
 and inside is such a big package 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:23.440
 stickers are still a smaller bag and 1 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.440
 instruction 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.550
 Now you can begin to build 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.990
 Well, dear friends, we have collected our 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.770
 wonderful set let's take a look 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.560
 him closer 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.200
 traditionally start with the main character 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.420
 Here is such a wonderful man in the very 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.600
 prime with a little beard in 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.269
 glasses and blue sponge print we only 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.060
 on the one hand on the other there is nothing and 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.239
 there is a wonderful cap on her head 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.040
 but in this set one figure is one 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.420
 here is the snow driver 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.250
 truck in principle, that's how it looks 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.070
 let's go to our car first 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.530
 so I want to watch it with us bucket 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.380
 Here is a huge snow bucket 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.130
 which can be detached and considered 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.709
 its close very bright colors here this 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.060
 the design can bend in different 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:52.720
 directions almost 180 gr 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.180
 and on the sides we have two lanterns 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.500
 spotlights to make it better in the dark 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:02.170
 visible but consider our truck 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.020
 the first element is of course the place 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.510
 If you wish, you can attach a lot here. 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.760
 what to attach if constructed 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:16.140
 suppose they are such a bucket 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:19.300
 and something else but in front of the headlight number and 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.120
 of course a big toned dark 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:26.530
 glass and also here are four lanterns 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:29.050
 spotlights note that this 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.360
 car huge wheels which 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.810
 will be held on almost all of the snow 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.930
 there are also two car seats 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.319
 huge tank because the truck 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.600
 consumes a lot of gasoline and diesel 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:46.269
 I donâ€™t know what the fuel is 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.000
 here we can find a shovel which 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.790
 enjoys our main character as well 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.360
 on the other hand, such a mop 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.360
 panicle 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.489
 Now consider what we have with 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.220
 the other side here too is such a sign 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:07.480
 and notice some mechanism when 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:13.110
 spinning wheels spinning 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:16.000
 here is this element and there is going to snow 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.739
 here we have it too 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.650
 whites 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:23.770
 let's refuse pieces of snow this element too 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:27.340
 we removed and here you can hoist 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.800
 something else that is so let's say a truck 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.479
 irrigation can fall both with this and 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:37.449
 without it on the other side of the headlamp number and 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:39.460
 2 also has an exhaust pipe elements 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:42.160
 when you truck clean up the snow and not 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.910
 glows putting people on what's coming 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.720
 cleaning 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:49.000
 he let's look at this cabin 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.229
 the element is removed and we can go there 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.870
 put there 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.490
 our little man will say even more here 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:05:00.789
 can sit 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:04.000
 two whole heroes 1 behind the wheel and 2 row. 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:07.930
 and here pay attention to the mug here 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.910
 small of which our hero drinks tea 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:15.990
 coffee or any other drinks 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:18.340
 so now try all the same 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:22.150
 fix our character 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.849
 Well, something like that and the door we also 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.930
 are opening up 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.930
 one and the other 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:34.569
 put our little man and he can 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.569
 go from each side is here such 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:42.580
 glass with which you can watch 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:46.840
 what's going on behind in general is 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:49.090
 almost all if rockets are on board 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.280
 Of course he has some flaws 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.409
 well this is from my position in this 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.659
 designer a lot of stickers 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:58.240
 Well, I just do not like to stick stickers 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:59.520
 so for me this is a minus because 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.159
 what is my childhood 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.289
 lego almost did prints everywhere 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:08.199
 and now we have to replace it here 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:13.479
 these kind of stickers prize sticker u 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:18.340
 us here here here in front here 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:21.879
 here here are three stickers and here 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:24.940
 two stickers of course it is possible that now 

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:26.860
 children like to stick stickers and many 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:31.830
 it is a pleasure but for me 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:34.960
 this is a small let's say disappointment 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:37.949
 Well, dear friends, we looked at us 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.840
