platform<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.710> haven't<00:00:14.009> really<00:00:14.250> even<00:00:14.370> tried

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
platform I haven't really even tried

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.910 
platform I haven't really even tried
this<00:00:14.910> before<00:00:15.089> until<00:00:15.540> somebody<00:00:15.870> asked<00:00:16.710> me<00:00:16.800> to

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
this before until somebody asked me to

this before until somebody asked me to
look<00:00:17.039> into<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.670> am<00:00:17.820> really<00:00:18.119> impressed

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
look into it and I am really impressed

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.330 
look into it and I am really impressed
with<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.020> let's<00:00:19.170> pull<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.500> up<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.800> you'll

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
with it so let's pull it up and you'll

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.529 
with it so let's pull it up and you'll
see<00:00:20.490> what<00:00:20.609> we've<00:00:20.699> got<00:00:20.730> going<00:00:20.910> on<00:00:21.240> here<00:00:21.420> now

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
see what we've got going on here now

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.630 
see what we've got going on here now
when<00:00:21.720> we<00:00:21.810> did<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.260> initial<00:00:22.769> test<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
when we did the initial test of the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.609 
when we did the initial test of the
bricks<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.119> ran<00:00:24.359> this<00:00:24.630> natively<00:00:25.080> on<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
bricks I ran this natively on the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.960 
bricks I ran this natively on the
hardware<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.189> was<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> little<00:00:26.490> bit<00:00:26.640> slow<00:00:26.939> so

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
hardware and it was a little bit slow so

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.089 
hardware and it was a little bit slow so
what<00:00:27.269> I'm<00:00:27.359> doing<00:00:27.390> now<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:28.109> streaming<00:00:28.980> this

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
what I'm doing now is streaming this

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.919 
what I'm doing now is streaming this
over<00:00:29.429> my<00:00:29.550> home<00:00:29.760> network<00:00:30.210> from<00:00:30.449> my<00:00:30.660> Mac

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
over my home network from my Mac

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.440 
over my home network from my Mac
upstairs<00:00:31.560> which<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:31.980> running<00:00:32.279> Windows<00:00:32.669> 8<00:00:32.910> so

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
upstairs which is running Windows 8 so

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.180 
upstairs which is running Windows 8 so
my<00:00:33.540> Mac<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.930> doing<00:00:34.170> all<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.559> rendering<00:00:34.800> and

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
my Mac is doing all the rendering and

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.950 
my Mac is doing all the rendering and
then<00:00:35.340> streaming<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.480> bricks<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.930> I

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
then streaming it to the bricks and I

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.650 
then streaming it to the bricks and I
have<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.320> at<00:00:37.890> 1920<00:00:38.640> by<00:00:38.730> 1080<00:00:39.120> right<00:00:39.360> now<00:00:39.510> we're

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
have it at 1920 by 1080 right now we're

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.049 
have it at 1920 by 1080 right now we're
pushing<00:00:39.899> about<00:00:40.110> 50<00:00:40.559> frames<00:00:40.770> per<00:00:40.950> second<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:42.000> is

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
pushing about 50 frames per second it is

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.299 
pushing about 50 frames per second it is
really<00:00:42.660> smooth<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.920> an<00:00:44.010> amazing

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
really smooth and this is an amazing

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.090 
really smooth and this is an amazing
platform<00:00:45.030> not<00:00:45.149> seeing<00:00:45.360> any<00:00:45.600> kind<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.070> you<00:00:47.070> know

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
platform not seeing any kind of you know

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.279 
platform not seeing any kind of you know
artifacts<00:00:47.910> from<00:00:48.120> compression<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.809> really

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
artifacts from compression it's really

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.510 
artifacts from compression it's really
really<00:00:49.620> nice<00:00:49.770> we're<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.190> go<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.399> just

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
really nice we're going to go and just

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.860 
really nice we're going to go and just
launch<00:00:50.700> our<00:00:50.850> little<00:00:51.090> rocket<00:00:51.390> here<00:00:51.510> real<00:00:51.660> quick

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
launch our little rocket here real quick

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.779 
launch our little rocket here real quick
I<00:00:52.050> have<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.410> few<00:00:52.590> other<00:00:52.739> things<00:00:53.039> I'll<00:00:53.520> show<00:00:53.730> you

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
I have a few other things I'll show you

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.540 
I have a few other things I'll show you
also<00:00:54.329> before<00:00:54.719> we're<00:00:55.469> done<00:00:55.680> -<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.309> can<00:00:56.430> get

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
also before we're done - so you can get

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.099 
also before we're done - so you can get
a<00:00:56.579> sense<00:00:56.820> as<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.090> maybe<00:00:57.690> how<00:00:57.899> some

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
a sense as to maybe how some

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.049 
a sense as to maybe how some
faster-moving<00:00:58.559> games<00:00:59.070> look<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.550> here<00:00:59.730> as<00:00:59.879> well

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
faster-moving games look on here as well

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.819 
faster-moving games look on here as well
but<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.420> impressive<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.260> really

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
but this is impressive this is a really

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.939 
but this is impressive this is a really
good<00:01:02.030> steam<00:01:03.030> in-home<00:01:03.690> streaming<00:01:03.899> platform<00:01:04.799> so

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
good steam in-home streaming platform so

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.800 
good steam in-home streaming platform so
we'll<00:01:05.070> just<00:01:05.220> launch<00:01:05.400> our<00:01:05.610> rocket<00:01:05.790> here<00:01:06.210> again

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
we'll just launch our rocket here again

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.690 
we'll just launch our rocket here again
we're<00:01:06.960> pushing<00:01:07.170> close<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.619> 60<00:01:08.070> about<00:01:08.490> 50

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
we're pushing close to 60 about 50

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.609 
we're pushing close to 60 about 50
frames<00:01:08.850> per<00:01:09.000> second<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.200> think<00:01:10.439> some<00:01:10.590> of

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
frames per second and I think some of

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.080 
frames per second and I think some of
this<00:01:10.740> might<00:01:10.920> just<00:01:10.950> be<00:01:11.159> rendering<00:01:11.580> delays<00:01:11.939> from

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
this might just be rendering delays from

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.490 
this might just be rendering delays from
my<00:01:12.270> Mac<00:01:12.479> upstairs<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.110> MacBook<00:01:13.470> Pro

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
my Mac upstairs it's a MacBook Pro

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.010 
my Mac upstairs it's a MacBook Pro
Retina<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.850> running<00:01:15.180> Windows<00:01:15.390> natively

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
Retina it is running Windows natively

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.670 
Retina it is running Windows natively
but<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.340> certainly<00:01:18.000> not<00:01:18.240> a

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
but it is certainly not a

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.780 
but it is certainly not a
high-performing<00:01:19.680> gaming<00:01:20.009> PC<00:01:20.369> but<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.670> can

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
high-performing gaming PC but you can

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.340 
high-performing gaming PC but you can
see<00:01:20.939> it's<00:01:21.119> really<00:01:21.450> playable<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.990> mean<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.200> is

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
see it's really playable I mean this is

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.260 
see it's really playable I mean this is
a<00:01:22.380> lot<00:01:22.619> more<00:01:22.799> playable<00:01:23.189> than<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.610> if<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.180> was

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
a lot more playable than it is if I was

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.140 
a lot more playable than it is if I was
just<00:01:24.390> running<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.220> Brix

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
just running it on the on the Brix

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.760 
just running it on the on the Brix
directly<00:01:27.750> which<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.990> saw<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.409> initial

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
directly which you saw in the initial

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.330 
directly which you saw in the initial
review<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.450> really<00:01:30.450> really<00:01:30.689> nice<00:01:30.960> way<00:01:31.229> to

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
review so really really nice way to

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.609 
review so really really nice way to
basically<00:01:32.340> get<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:33.000> little<00:01:33.720> gaming<00:01:34.110> pc<00:01:34.470> at

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619

then<00:01:43.590> we're<00:01:44.189> going<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.369> take<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> look<00:01:44.790> at<00:01:44.970> maybe

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
then we're going to take a look at maybe

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.780 
then we're going to take a look at maybe
a<00:01:45.509> few<00:01:45.840> other<00:01:46.079> things<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.100> run<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.610> steam

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
a few other things that run on the steam

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.910 
a few other things that run on the steam
platform<00:01:48.140> we're<00:01:49.140> gonna<00:01:49.259> check<00:01:49.409> out<00:01:49.500> an<00:01:49.619> older

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
platform we're gonna check out an older

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.170 
platform we're gonna check out an older
game<00:01:50.070> one<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.310> my<00:01:50.369> favorites<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.000> called

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
game one of my favorites this is called

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.359 
game one of my favorites this is called
flat<00:01:51.509> out<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.229> racing<00:01:52.860> game<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.310> this

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
flat out and it's a racing game and this

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.270 
flat out and it's a racing game and this
one<00:01:53.430> again<00:01:54.090> we're<00:01:54.240> pushing<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.689> at<00:01:55.159> 1920<00:01:56.159> by

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
one again we're pushing this at 1920 by

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.920 
one again we're pushing this at 1920 by
1080<00:01:56.759> from<00:01:56.969> upstairs<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.479> think<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.780> game

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
1080 from upstairs I think this game

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.899 
1080 from upstairs I think this game
actually<00:01:58.140> runs<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> lower<00:01:59.070> resolution<00:01:59.310> than

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
actually runs at a lower resolution than

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.600 
actually runs at a lower resolution than
that<00:02:00.119> but<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.469> actually<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> good<00:02:02.250> way<00:02:02.549> to

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
that but this actually is a good way to

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.249 
that but this actually is a good way to
see<00:02:02.880> like<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> high<00:02:03.270> frame<00:02:03.540> rate<00:02:03.780> game<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.110> see

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
see like a high frame rate game to see

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.600 
see like a high frame rate game to see
how<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.500> can<00:02:04.590> keep<00:02:04.710> up<00:02:04.920> with<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.399> again<00:02:05.579> I

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
how it can keep up with it and again I

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.029 
how it can keep up with it and again I
was<00:02:05.969> testing<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.390> earlier<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:07.469> was<00:02:07.619> really

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
was testing this earlier it was really

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.469 
was testing this earlier it was really
really<00:02:08.280> fast<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:08.879> we'll<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:09.119> do<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.270> quick

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
really fast so we'll just do a quick

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.210 
really fast so we'll just do a quick
start<00:02:10.110> here<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.379> one<00:02:10.530> might<00:02:10.649> actually<00:02:10.800> run

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
start here this one might actually run

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.830 
start here this one might actually run
nicely<00:02:11.670> natively<00:02:12.060> on<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.480> bricks<00:02:12.690> because

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
nicely natively on the bricks because

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
nicely natively on the bricks because
this<00:02:12.989> game<00:02:13.140> is<00:02:13.170> from<00:02:13.349> a<00:02:13.410> couple<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.709> you

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
this game is from a couple of you

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.890 
this game is from a couple of you
years<00:02:13.980> ago<00:02:14.070> but<00:02:14.460> you<00:02:14.940> can<00:02:15.060> just<00:02:15.210> see<00:02:15.300> how<00:02:15.390> fluid

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
years ago but you can just see how fluid

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.570 
years ago but you can just see how fluid
and<00:02:16.080> every<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.380> really<00:02:16.770> just<00:02:16.920> how<00:02:17.100> nice<00:02:17.370> is

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
and every and really just how nice is

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.250 
and every and really just how nice is
this<00:02:17.700> all<00:02:17.880> runs<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.510> didn't<00:02:18.900> want<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.080> talk<00:02:19.200> a

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
this all runs I didn't want to talk a

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.630 
this all runs I didn't want to talk a
little<00:02:19.470> bit<00:02:19.620> about<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.130> steam<00:02:20.370> in-home

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
little bit about the steam in-home

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.910 
little bit about the steam in-home
streaming<00:02:20.820> I<00:02:21.450> am<00:02:21.570> really<00:02:21.930> impressed<00:02:22.260> with<00:02:22.710> it

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
streaming I am really impressed with it

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.230 
streaming I am really impressed with it
I<00:02:23.010> hadn't<00:02:23.280> played<00:02:23.430> with<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.730> before<00:02:23.820> until

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
I hadn't played with it before until

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.060 
I hadn't played with it before until
people<00:02:24.420> asked<00:02:24.690> me<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.440> check<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.800> out<00:02:25.920> in

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
people asked me to check it out in

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.100 
people asked me to check it out in
relation<00:02:26.490> to<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.790> bricks<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.330> if<00:02:27.690> you're<00:02:27.900> on

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
relation to the bricks and if you're on

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.430 
relation to the bricks and if you're on
a<00:02:28.140> wired<00:02:28.590> gigabit<00:02:29.250> network<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.940> is

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
a wired gigabit network it is

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.840 
a wired gigabit network it is
unbelievably<00:02:31.440> fast<00:02:31.530> in<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.250> sense<00:02:32.490> that<00:02:32.610> you

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
unbelievably fast in the sense that you

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.030 
unbelievably fast in the sense that you
saw<00:02:33.030> how<00:02:33.120> well<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.450> games<00:02:33.720> ran<00:02:33.990> but<00:02:34.710> also

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
saw how well the games ran but also

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.500 
saw how well the games ran but also
there's<00:02:35.220> no<00:02:35.370> latency<00:02:35.820> it's<00:02:36.090> almost<00:02:36.300> like

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
there's no latency it's almost like

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.080 
there's no latency it's almost like
you're<00:02:36.660> actually<00:02:36.840> on<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.590> PC<00:02:38.010> playing<00:02:38.910> it

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
you're actually on the PC playing it

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.310 
you're actually on the PC playing it
even<00:02:39.330> though<00:02:39.390> you're<00:02:39.540> streaming<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:40.080> over

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
even though you're streaming it over

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.199 
even though you're streaming it over
your<00:02:40.440> local<00:02:40.740> network<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.850> bricks<00:02:42.060> right

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
your local network so the bricks right

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.570 
your local network so the bricks right
now<00:02:42.390> is<00:02:42.540> connected<00:02:42.990> to<00:02:43.020> my<00:02:43.200> Mac<00:02:43.740> upstairs<00:02:44.340> I'm

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
now is connected to my Mac upstairs I'm

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.800 
now is connected to my Mac upstairs I'm
all<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.880> way<00:02:44.970> down<00:02:45.150> in<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.360> basement<00:02:45.480> so

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
all the way down in the basement so

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.300 
all the way down in the basement so
we're<00:02:46.020> pretty<00:02:46.230> good<00:02:46.320> distance<00:02:46.770> away<00:02:46.920> from<00:02:47.190> it

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
we're pretty good distance away from it

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.980 
we're pretty good distance away from it
and<00:02:47.430> it's<00:02:47.610> feeling<00:02:47.910> like<00:02:47.940> it's<00:02:48.510> right<00:02:48.720> here<00:02:48.900> in

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
and it's feeling like it's right here in

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.100 
and it's feeling like it's right here in
the<00:02:49.080> room<00:02:49.200> with<00:02:49.380> me<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:49.800> but<00:02:50.370> no<00:02:50.550> trip<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.150> steam

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
the room with me so but no trip to steam

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.590 
the room with me so but no trip to steam
would<00:02:53.040> be<00:02:53.250> complete<00:02:53.640> without<00:02:53.850> streaming

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
would be complete without streaming

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.479 
would be complete without streaming
portal<00:02:55.230> 2<00:02:55.440> so<00:02:55.709> I'm<00:02:55.800> going<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:55.980> load<00:02:56.130> this<00:02:56.280> up

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
portal 2 so I'm going to load this up

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.590 
portal 2 so I'm going to load this up
real<00:02:56.670> quick<00:02:56.820> I<00:02:56.910> haven't<00:02:57.150> actually<00:02:57.270> played

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
real quick I haven't actually played

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.630

it's<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.269> initial<00:03:51.900> review<00:03:52.140> is<00:03:52.260> under<00:03:52.560> $200<00:03:53.250> if

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
it's the initial review is under $200 if

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.550 
it's the initial review is under $200 if
you<00:03:53.549> you<00:03:54.239> know<00:03:54.330> price<00:03:54.780> out<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.080> components

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
you you know price out the components

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.320 
you you know price out the components
effectively<00:03:56.100> and<00:03:56.310> I<00:03:56.670> think<00:03:57.060> this<00:03:57.180> is<00:03:57.299> a

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
effectively and I think this is a

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.120 
effectively and I think this is a
tremendous<00:03:57.930> value<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.320> it's<00:03:58.590> completely

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
tremendous value and it's completely

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.890 
tremendous value and it's completely
silent<00:03:59.400> so<00:03:59.760> it<00:03:59.850> can<00:03:59.970> really<00:04:00.150> become<00:04:00.450> like

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
silent so it can really become like

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.120 
silent so it can really become like
