00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.750
 parting you can make like 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.829
 straight so oblique so and zigzag i 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.010
 chose 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.770
 usually parting and starting to weave 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.770
 regular 3-strand braid 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:59.000
 chose the location of our spit not 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:06.560
 divided the hair into three strands and started 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.750
 weave can tighten our tension 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.530
 rows should be average that is our 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.230
 spit 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:16.090
 should and not really words and not too 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.090
 tight braid our pigtail 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.130
 that moment when we stayed small 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.930
 tail 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:29.850
 we take the tape fold it in half 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:34.670
 and one side should be a bit 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.670
 below and start with the recipe 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.740
 at the end of our braid we fasten the tape 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:52.740
 knot and tying that edge 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:58.000
 which is guinea and tying a knot 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:01.030
 one braid is ready go to the other of 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.220
 our two goats we can do different 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.770
 hairstyles options because our 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.560
 hair length models but if you have 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.400
 medium hair is what you can do 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.069
 you can make a basket 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:20.010
 respectively take one cashier and 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:20.010
 You stretch it to the base 2 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:28.999
 and tie a knot take the second phase 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.209
 you stretch it to the base of the braid 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:49.850
 and also tie a knot 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:52.820
 if the model has an average hair poured 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.320
 then our basket is much shorter and 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.320
 will look different 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.690
 accordingly the tapes themselves 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.690
 we need to fix 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:24.760
 and on the other hand we also fasten 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:31.530
 Try our parts to our 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.530
 ribbons up were identical tying 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.920
 and so we got one of the options 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:43.590
 laying our braids 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.900
 of our two goats we can make 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.610
 different hairstyles because u 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.610
 our model hair is long 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.130
 but if you have medium hair what are you 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.850

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:59.690
 have we take our card 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.690
 we stretch it at the base 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:11.459
 and wrap again accordingly 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:11.459
 the ribbon will also be fixed to the base 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:37.420
