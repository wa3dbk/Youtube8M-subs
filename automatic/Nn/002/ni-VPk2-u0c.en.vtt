00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 Y 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.060
 m 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.929
 to talk about the nightly fasting that 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.849
 I promote as much as one of the habits 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:19.669
 important to improve your quality of 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:22.250
 life and improve your health first 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:24.470
 the fast I talk about reading at night 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.779
 however fasting is a practice 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.790
 millennial is nothing new is a 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.570
 millenary practice that either for purposes 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:35.390
 spiritual and for purposes also of 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.440
 healing and prevention so it's not 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.510
 something new 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.380
 the now described fasting appears as 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.470
 a 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.940
 an alimentary energy when it says how 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.740
 there is an arch what happens is that if there 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.190
 a social being the metabolism the first 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.800
 point is that wanting to accelerate your 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.040
 metabolism does not really have a 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.840
 foundation more than eating others without going up 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.580
 of weight that really is the only thing that I 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.320
 I've noticed when someone says I want to 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.210
 accelerate my metabolism that's the 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.400
 purpose because otherwise there would be no other 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.190
 kind of purpose one wanted to accelerate 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.570
 the metabolism since accelerate is not seen 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.300
 like having your foot always in the 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.710
 accelerator of the car and obviously has 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.650
 all the gasoline that also that the 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.420
 engine and it burns everything then to me not 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.390
 I like the particular thing, to have my 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.310
 accelerated metabolism because because that 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.830
 it also means that I would take away 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.600
 my whole body is not just about the 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.670
 outside that would obviously be a 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.240
 side effect just do not me 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.240
 interest 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.470
 extremely accelerated nothing more have a 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.840
 metabolism according to what I should from 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.170
 consume what I have to burn for 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.080
 my activities 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:48.580
 then it is the first point of why 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.399
 I am not in favor of the argument of 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.490
 encourage metabolism 2 fasting that I 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.680
 I propose is 10 12 hours at night 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.090
 that is, of which it is assumed that 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.830
 we should sleep eight hours so I'm 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.930
 talking about two to four hours without 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.789
 foods which may have a juice 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.450
 of vegetables nothing else can donate strong 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:09.160
 put some nuts you can see then 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.440
 has many benefits this type of 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.630
 there is a night in fact there are several 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.590
 digital doctors are running and that 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.110
 they are putting it in a lot of books 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.700
 because really fasting is a way 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.709
 to give the system a break 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.500
 digestive which is one of the processes that 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.940
 more it steals energy from us in the body and not 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.530
 I speak of the energy they also desisted 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.690
 evidently tired after 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.880
 eat or have a super binge 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.370
 we feel very tired because 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.220
 obviously everything is trying to get 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.640
 this type of process that is the digestive 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.680
 A) Yes 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.319
 to what we do a fast to the precinct in 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.310
 get up with much more energy 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.840
 contrary to what is said what can 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.010
 obviously try to give it time that the 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.959
 body suits for after a 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.250
 week of fasting at night 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.010
 truth feels with a lot more 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.050
 energy the next day 12 they give him the 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.330
 rest to the digestive system 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.860
 3 obviously favors the elimination is 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.490
 saying in the morning is simpler than 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.850
 when you do not drink a glass of water 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.959
 carry out the evacuation and obviously 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.850
 elimination through urine 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.190
 others first thing in the morning 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.830
 then it is excellent also for that 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.150
 greatly favors the weight loss of 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.800
 true contrary to what I believe 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.810
 I think there's nothing like that 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.430
 experiment and can determine if yes or 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.230
 if not instead of listening to phrases 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.630
 common as you slow down your metabolism 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.970
 and all this and obviously apart 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.570
 increases our digestive capacity and 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.820
 improves the absorption and assimilation of 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.239
 food is also reducing in 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:40.540
 our constant appetite really this 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.430
 much more is being done 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.879
 mitigated then we can have higher 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.859
 control over it so that's the 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.230
 kind of nocturnal fasting that at night 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:53.260
 that is, having dinner early at 7 is dinner 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.439
 maximum at 8 but at 8 end and 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.760
 then now yes give way to that up 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.829
 the next day it will be consumed again 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.810
 food that I really recommend 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.579
 the habits of the morning because the 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.560
 body can continue with its same process 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:08.139
 of detoxification and natural cleansing 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.060
 that brings in the night and with this 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.920
 we greatly favor that the body 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.659
 can debug can be detoxified 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.120
 obviously help us lose fat already 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:17.829
 feel with a lot of energy to 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.079
 carry out our activities 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.849
 daily so I recommend them 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.770
 very much to really try the fast 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:25.780
 give you this trial period and that 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.789
 you alone are those who determine the 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.460
 results of this millennial practice 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:33.310
 with many benefits that on top of 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.070
 everything is going to make us kill them in 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.610
 very short period of time simply 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.610
 that we give him the opportunity
