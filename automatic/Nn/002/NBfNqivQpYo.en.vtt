 specific measures to implement the right 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.350
 child on the game first of all it 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.710
 creating a place and time to 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.659
 kids could play like that 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.930
 spaces are supposed to be created 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.790
 wherever there may be children that is 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.130
 this is an educational institution for children 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.860

 special place is given to programs 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.070
 development of the game on the street because 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.500
 modern children a huge amount 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.439

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.140
 leaves she comes either in training or 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.020
 into virtual space therefore 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.520
 according to the general comment any 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.380
 an initiative that promotes 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.830
 establishing a community between children and 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.740
 parents 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.960
 I must be supported by the state 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.580
 one more direction of realization of the right 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.310
 child on the game concerns children with 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.930
 limited capacity 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.930
 such children need 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.980
 specialized playgrounds for 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:29.100
 such children may need creation 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.900
 special gaming tools inside 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.390
 rooms for children with weakened 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.590
 sight or hearing are also required 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:42.930
 specialized 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:44.730
 gaming complexes or toys ost for 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.800
 ensure that this right is exercised 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.110
 need some kind of social 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.110
 program preparation program 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.660
 experts on the game on the Program 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.360
 teacher training and preschool and 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.160
 school by the way we are now a lot 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.040
 talking about the need to educate 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.510
 a healthy generation about the safety of a physicist and 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.620
 physical and mental health 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.590
 children so here the game just is 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.440
 the main condition for maintaining health and 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.230
 physical and mental and 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.250
 formation of self active 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.950
 initiative personality 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.030
 it is in it that the main ones are formed 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.880
 human qualities 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.190
 so now let's think not and not only 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.620
 talk about the rights of the child but really 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.620
 observe them in our life
