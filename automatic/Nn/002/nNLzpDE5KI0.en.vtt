00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.180
 Hello, you are watching the origami channel 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.529
 members and today we will do 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.750
 boat 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.750
 summer take a sheet of a4 paper and 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.710
 we fold it in half by connecting two 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:27.650
 opposite edges 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:27.650
 interconnect smooth 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:40.340
 then we fold this rectangle 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:42.860
 in half we hold the corners but 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.250
 iron only the top 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.250
 part 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:53.629
 the top two thirds must have passed 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.430
 Do we do not need this for 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.510
 landmark 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:01.640
 middle to but down. much longer what 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.739
 stronger in the center ie we get that here 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:14.080
 this side and center 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:14.080
 connect on one side and on the other 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.970
 then turn down the bottom 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.850
 on the one hand we turn the other 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.149
 side and do the same with the bottom 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:43.740
 part in this part 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:47.590
 We're getting lost 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.710
 intermediate figure in which we each 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.710
 from these corners which is a little bit 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:02:08.319
 exceeds 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:14.860
 we bend 1 2 sides caught up and now with 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:18.420
 this side we bend and we get 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:28.000
 such a triangle which we 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:30.599
 turn out why deployed got 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.599
 square 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:39.820
 we put his side drop to us 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:48.460
 and connect the two angles between 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:51.730
 a mean live we turn over and 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:56.970
 do the same from this side of it 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.970
 two opposite corners of each other 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:11.260
 iron then reveal it 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:14.530
 fold got square divided 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.110
 in half now take neatly for 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:26.590
 top and pull them into different 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:32.100
 The sides here we are correcting here by deploying 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.100
 our square is a pile of such a fishing rod 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:41.470
 straighten and 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:44.450
 and here's a nice pen turned us 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:50.840
 it's very hard for me to do together 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:54.700
 stitches well, very nice ones must be found 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.700
 finished all thanks
