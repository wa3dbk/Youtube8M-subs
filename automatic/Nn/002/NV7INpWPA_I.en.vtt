00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
be doing the same here in Britain so

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.900 
be doing the same here in Britain so
we're<00:00:49.440> getting<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.770> plan<00:00:50.010> together<00:00:50.219> by<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.730> end

the<00:01:41.220> question<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:41.640> what<00:01:41.850> type<00:01:42.060> of

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
the question is just what type of

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.090 
the question is just what type of
infrastructure<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.200> but<00:01:43.680> if<00:01:43.799> we<00:01:43.920> have<00:01:44.070> a

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
infrastructure it is but if we have a

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.039 
infrastructure it is but if we have a
credible<00:01:44.430> plan<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:45.119> place<00:01:45.390> over<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.899> next

four or five years there's no reason why
