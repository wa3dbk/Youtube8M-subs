Brian<00:00:09.059> shall<00:00:09.300> break<00:00:09.480> with<00:00:09.809> Caterpillar<00:00:10.380> and

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
Brian shall break with Caterpillar and

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.180 
Brian shall break with Caterpillar and
your<00:00:11.190> with<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.460> excavator<00:00:12.000> series<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.840> this

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
your with the excavator series and this

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.880 
your with the excavator series and this
336<00:00:14.190> F<00:00:14.429> got<00:00:15.420> so<00:00:15.630> many<00:00:15.780> features<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.440> can't<00:00:16.710> begin

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
336 F got so many features I can't begin

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.400 
336 F got so many features I can't begin
to<00:00:17.340> tell<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:17.760> where<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.000> start<00:00:18.270> where<00:00:19.199> do<00:00:19.289> we

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
to tell you where to start where do we

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.189 
to tell you where to start where do we
start<00:00:19.740> we<00:00:20.250> start<00:00:20.550> with<00:00:20.840> economics<00:00:21.840> do<00:00:22.080> we

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
start we start with economics do we

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.200 
start we start with economics do we
start<00:00:22.500> with<00:00:22.619> emissions<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.460> factory<00:00:23.910> steer

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
start with emissions the factory steer

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.500 
start with emissions the factory steer
for<00:00:24.650> what<00:00:25.650> do<00:00:25.740> we<00:00:25.830> start<00:00:26.070> well<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.760> think<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
for what do we start well I think the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.000 
for what do we start well I think the
place<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.990> we<00:00:28.109> start<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.619> we're<00:00:28.830> really

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
place that we start is we're really

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.400 
place that we start is we're really
building<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.880> success<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.420> our<00:00:31.109> Tier<00:00:31.380> four

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
building on the success of our Tier four

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.310 
building on the success of our Tier four
interim<00:00:32.130> solution<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.090> e<00:00:33.120> series<00:00:33.570> excavators

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
interim solution the e series excavators

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.459 
interim solution the e series excavators
so<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.579> 336<00:00:36.329> he<00:00:36.510> was<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.960> first<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
so the 336 he was the first to the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.160 
so the 336 he was the first to the
market<00:00:37.860> back<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.190> 2011<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.780> now<00:00:39.960> we're

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
market back in 2011 so now we're

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.410 
market back in 2011 so now we're
building<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.860> success<00:00:41.250> making<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
building on that success making the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.990 
building on that success making the
machine<00:00:42.809> even<00:00:43.230> better<00:00:43.469> we<00:00:43.950> focused<00:00:44.460> on<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> few

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
machine even better we focused on a few

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.510 
machine even better we focused on a few
key<00:00:45.239> areas<00:00:45.480> one<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.350> them<00:00:46.590> being<00:00:46.860> fuel

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
key areas one of them being fuel

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.819 
key areas one of them being fuel
efficiency<00:00:48.110> so<00:00:49.110> we<00:00:49.230> have<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.379> machine<00:00:49.620> that's

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
efficiency so we have a machine that's

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.189 
efficiency so we have a machine that's
still<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> 300<00:00:51.000> horsepower<00:00:51.270> machine<00:00:51.930> really

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
still a 300 horsepower machine really

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.110 
still a 300 horsepower machine really
leading<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.770> industry<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.460> size<00:00:53.730> class

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
leading the industry in that size class

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.660 
leading the industry in that size class
and<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.469> we<00:00:55.620> wanted<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.980> maintain<00:00:56.219> that

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
and so we wanted to maintain that

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.639 
and so we wanted to maintain that
performance<00:00:57.270> maintain<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.079> productivity

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
performance maintain that productivity

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.459 
performance maintain that productivity
that<00:00:59.489> we've<00:00:59.670> had<00:00:59.910> traditionally<00:01:00.719> but<00:01:01.230> also

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
that we've had traditionally but also

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.770 
that we've had traditionally but also
lower<00:01:01.980> operating<00:01:02.579> costs<00:01:03.000> for<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.239> customer

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
lower operating costs for that customer

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.320 
lower operating costs for that customer
we<00:01:04.260> know<00:01:04.439> fuel<00:01:04.799> bill<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.580> know<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.000> fuel

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
we know fuel bill is you know the fuel

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.030 
we know fuel bill is you know the fuel
is<00:01:06.630> one<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> largest<00:01:07.320> elements<00:01:07.920> of

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
is one of the largest elements of

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.550 
is one of the largest elements of
customers<00:01:08.520> operating<00:01:09.090> costs<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:10.170> we've<00:01:10.380> tried

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
customers operating costs so we've tried

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.890 
customers operating costs so we've tried
to<00:01:10.860> lower<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.850> fuel<00:01:12.090> consumption<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:12.689> this

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
to lower the fuel consumption on this

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.780 
to lower the fuel consumption on this
machine<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.530> really<00:01:13.920> help<00:01:14.130> with<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> customer

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
machine to really help with the customer

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.359 
machine to really help with the customer
economics<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.930> has<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.470> many<00:01:16.619> options

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
economics and it has so many options

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.340 
economics and it has so many options
available<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.479> operator<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
available to the operator and the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.760 
available to the operator and the
customer<00:01:19.890> like<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.930> really<00:01:22.290> set

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
customer like that you can really set

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.300 
customer like that you can really set
this<00:01:22.950> thing<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.280> an<00:01:23.610> eco<00:01:24.030> mode<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:25.159> have<00:01:26.159> it

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
this thing to an eco mode and have it

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.010 
this thing to an eco mode and have it
operate<00:01:26.850> almost

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
operate almost

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.980 
operate almost
well<00:01:29.500> super-efficient<00:01:30.430> yes<00:01:31.150> that<00:01:31.600> way<00:01:31.750> yeah

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
well super-efficient yes that way yeah

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.140 
well super-efficient yes that way yeah
absolutely<00:01:32.350> what<00:01:33.070> we've<00:01:33.220> done<00:01:33.430> even<00:01:33.850> in<00:01:33.970> its

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
absolutely what we've done even in its

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.530 
absolutely what we've done even in its
maximum<00:01:34.870> power<00:01:35.170> mode<00:01:35.760> we've<00:01:36.760> reduced<00:01:37.210> fuel

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
maximum power mode we've reduced fuel

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.230 
maximum power mode we've reduced fuel
consumption<00:01:38.080> quite<00:01:38.500> significantly<00:01:39.280> that

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
consumption quite significantly that

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.000 
consumption quite significantly that
doesn't<00:01:40.690> take<00:01:40.840> into<00:01:40.870> account<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.530> further

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
doesn't take into account the further

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.430 
doesn't take into account the further
reduction<00:01:42.670> in<00:01:42.760> fuel<00:01:43.060> that<00:01:43.390> you<00:01:43.540> can<00:01:43.750> get<00:01:44.020> by

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
reduction in fuel that you can get by

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.770 
reduction in fuel that you can get by
going<00:01:44.650> into<00:01:45.160> the<00:01:45.310> economy<00:01:45.910> mode<00:01:46.390> as<00:01:46.630> you

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
going into the economy mode as you

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.540 
going into the economy mode as you
mentioned<00:01:47.170> okay<00:01:47.530> so<00:01:47.710> that<00:01:47.860> allows<00:01:48.130> even

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
mentioned okay so that allows even

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.640 
mentioned okay so that allows even
further<00:01:48.850> fuel<00:01:49.300> savings<00:01:49.780> especially<00:01:50.260> in

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
further fuel savings especially in

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.710 
further fuel savings especially in
applications<00:01:51.369> that<00:01:51.670> may<00:01:51.940> be<00:01:51.970> lighter<00:01:52.450> to

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
applications that may be lighter to

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.260 
applications that may be lighter to

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
things that we have with this machine is

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.550 
things that we have with this machine is
available<00:03:06.220> cat<00:03:06.880> grade<00:03:07.239> control<00:03:07.750> and<00:03:08.049> what

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
available cat grade control and what

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.490 
available cat grade control and what
that<00:03:08.769> is<00:03:08.980> it's<00:03:09.190> it's<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:09.880> machine<00:03:10.500> guidance

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
that is it's it's a machine guidance

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.430 
that is it's it's a machine guidance
system<00:03:12.070> that<00:03:12.670> allows<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:13.299> operator<00:03:13.810> to<00:03:14.110> set

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
system that allows that operator to set

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.979 
system that allows that operator to set
a<00:03:14.470> certain<00:03:14.860> depth<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:15.610> slope<00:03:16.030> of<00:03:16.269> grade<00:03:16.630> and

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
a certain depth and slope of grade and

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.860 
a certain depth and slope of grade and
it<00:03:17.470> will<00:03:17.620> actually<00:03:18.010> guide<00:03:18.250> him<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.940> that<00:03:19.150> slope

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
it will actually guide him to that slope

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:20.770 
it will actually guide him to that slope
depth

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
depth

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.470 
depth
so<00:03:21.170> there's<00:03:21.410> a<00:03:21.470> series<00:03:21.770> of<00:03:21.950> in<00:03:22.820> the<00:03:23.060> monitor

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
so there's a series of in the monitor

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.900 
so there's a series of in the monitor
itself<00:03:23.810> integrated<00:03:24.560> into<00:03:24.830> the<00:03:24.950> machine<00:03:25.340> are<00:03:25.850> a

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
itself integrated into the machine are a

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.440 
itself integrated into the machine are a
series<00:03:26.630> of<00:03:26.660> light<00:03:26.990> bars<00:03:27.260> and<00:03:27.560> audible

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
series of light bars and audible

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.430 
series of light bars and audible
elements<00:03:29.450> to<00:03:29.660> where<00:03:29.840> it<00:03:29.960> will<00:03:30.050> let<00:03:30.230> him<00:03:30.410> know

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
elements to where it will let him know

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.640 
elements to where it will let him know
when<00:03:30.980> he's<00:03:31.340> digging<00:03:32.210> down<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.480> a<00:03:32.750> preset<00:03:33.320> grade

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
when he's digging down to a preset grade

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.500 
when he's digging down to a preset grade
so<00:03:34.400> it's<00:03:34.520> a<00:03:34.580> way<00:03:34.670> for<00:03:34.700> that<00:03:35.000> machine<00:03:35.150> to

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
so it's a way for that machine to

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.360 
so it's a way for that machine to
basically<00:03:35.840> he<00:03:36.080> could<00:03:36.260> set<00:03:36.440> a<00:03:36.470> grade<00:03:36.740> and<00:03:36.980> then

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
basically he could set a grade and then

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.770 
basically he could set a grade and then
you<00:03:37.459> can<00:03:37.610> start<00:03:37.820> to<00:03:37.970> dig<00:03:38.180> down<00:03:38.360> to<00:03:38.630> that

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
you can start to dig down to that

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.300 
you can start to dig down to that
setpoint<00:03:39.350> and<00:03:39.500> it<00:03:39.650> will<00:03:39.770> let<00:03:40.040> him<00:03:40.280> know

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
setpoint and it will let him know

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.030 
setpoint and it will let him know
automatically<00:03:41.090> all<00:03:41.480> set<00:03:41.840> for<00:03:41.870> parameters<00:03:42.830> of

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
automatically all set for parameters of

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.370 
automatically all set for parameters of
the<00:03:43.160> design<00:03:43.310> or<00:03:43.700> whatever<00:03:44.000> that<00:03:44.720> project<00:03:45.230> is

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
the design or whatever that project is

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.770 
the design or whatever that project is
he's<00:03:45.560> working<00:03:45.950> exactly<00:03:46.400> for<00:03:46.880> example<00:03:47.450> if<00:03:47.630> is

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
he's working exactly for example if is

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.540 
he's working exactly for example if is
in<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.020> sewer<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:48.380> water<00:03:48.440> application<00:03:49.340> wants

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
in the sewer and water application wants

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.540 
in the sewer and water application wants
to<00:03:49.700> set<00:03:50.000> a<00:03:50.030> ten-foot<00:03:50.720> cut<00:03:51.020> depth<00:03:51.709> he<00:03:52.220> can<00:03:52.370> go

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
to set a ten-foot cut depth he can go

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.790 
to set a ten-foot cut depth he can go
into<00:03:52.700> that<00:03:52.880> monitor<00:03:53.390> bench<00:03:54.140> at<00:03:54.380> a<00:03:54.410> certain

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
them to be the most productive so you

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:29.679 
them to be the most productive so you
have<00:05:28.189> independent<00:05:28.520> adjustment<00:05:29.270> of<00:05:29.539> the

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:30.529 
armrest

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:32.679 
armrest
we<00:05:31.069> have<00:05:31.279> adjustment<00:05:31.879> of<00:05:32.029> the<00:05:32.240> extra<00:05:32.539> the

00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:32.689 
we have adjustment of the extra the

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:35.290 
we have adjustment of the extra the
joysticks<00:05:33.289> up<00:05:33.499> and<00:05:33.800> down<00:05:33.979> relative<00:05:34.909> to<00:05:34.939> the

actually that's a little picture of a

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:57.909 
actually that's a little picture of a
fuel<00:05:55.610> gauge<00:05:55.849> and<00:05:56.180> what<00:05:56.659> that<00:05:56.870> is<00:05:57.080> it's<00:05:57.439> a<00:05:57.650> power

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
fuel gauge and what that is it's a power

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.399 
fuel gauge and what that is it's a power
mode<00:05:58.310> on<00:05:58.550> this<00:05:58.699> machine<00:05:58.909> and<00:05:59.360> that<00:05:59.810> allows<00:06:00.110> the

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:00.409 
mode on this machine and that allows the

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:04.300 
mode on this machine and that allows the
operator<00:06:00.979> to<00:06:01.129> match<00:06:01.610> the<00:06:01.999> work<00:06:02.529> to<00:06:03.529> the<00:06:03.919> actual

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
operator to match the work to the actual

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.010 
operator to match the work to the actual
output<00:06:04.550> power<00:06:04.879> of<00:06:05.029> the<00:06:05.180> engine<00:06:05.330> so<00:06:05.779> for

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
output power of the engine so for

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.929 
output power of the engine so for
example<00:06:06.529> in<00:06:06.710> light<00:06:06.979> to<00:06:07.219> moderate<00:06:07.580> duty

00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:07.939 
example in light to moderate duty

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:10.510 
example in light to moderate duty
applications<00:06:08.719> that<00:06:09.529> button<00:06:10.159> can<00:06:10.339> be<00:06:10.370> pressed

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
applications that button can be pressed

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.309 
applications that button can be pressed
and<00:06:11.120> the<00:06:11.210> machine<00:06:11.509> will<00:06:11.659> actually<00:06:11.810> go<00:06:12.139> into

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:12.319 
and the machine will actually go into

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:14.409 
and the machine will actually go into
economy<00:06:13.159> mode<00:06:13.370> and<00:06:13.610> what<00:06:13.729> it's<00:06:13.879> doing<00:06:14.089> its

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
economy mode and what it's doing its

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.800 
economy mode and what it's doing its
optimizing<00:06:15.289> the<00:06:15.379> machine<00:06:15.800> for<00:06:16.669> lighter<00:06:17.509> to

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
optimizing the machine for lighter to

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.170 
optimizing the machine for lighter to
moderate<00:06:18.289> duty<00:06:18.620> work<00:06:18.860> to<00:06:19.189> save<00:06:19.490> even<00:06:19.939> more

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
moderate duty work to save even more

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.409 
moderate duty work to save even more
