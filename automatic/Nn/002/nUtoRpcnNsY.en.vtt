00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.859 
somehow genetically modified them and
made<00:02:00.950> them<00:02:01.100> more<00:02:01.250> bushy<00:02:01.550> and<00:02:01.729> smaller<00:02:02.179> now

probably<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.670> stupid<00:02:42.060> idea<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.390> making<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.870> video

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989
