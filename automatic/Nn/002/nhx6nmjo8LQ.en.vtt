00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 We love welcome to the tour 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.980
 through the balcony cabin on the oasis of 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.440
 the seas very normal balcony cabin and 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.570
 Although assignable for up to four people 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.470
 yes, and let's have a look at it 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.900
 detail and we go back 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.939
 first the entrance area yes there 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.859
 actually little striking to say it 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.279
 you do not have to get your boarding pass or 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.189
 stuck so pure but you can just 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.679
 the master switch the master switch 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.170
 Press and then you have electricity here 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.960
 above, the temperature is regulated as 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.340
 By the way, that's when the balcony door 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.680
 open we will come later 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.329
 then the air conditioning remains however 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.489
 on 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.640
 Here I have a storage space can 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.050
 hang up jacket for example and here 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.850
 are the beds 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.309
 I can either now 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.809
 put together or me 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.340
 Let them disassemble quite like 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.620
 I want that when you have the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.210
 you have a single one standing together 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.629
 blanket that's not everybody's cup of tea 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.910
 Thing 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.860
 so now some standing here if luggage 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.380
 we just want to go away and 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.900
 Look, yes cabinet area really 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.600
 not big fans here 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:17.220
 fan compartments for free 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.770
 the safe and then a lot of ironing 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.060
 So bow there are really there's 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.630
 here really without end 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.110
 So who shirt or anywhere went there yes 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.060
 There is no shortage of that 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.420
 Decoration I would say relative 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.960
 simple here these branches or what should 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.250
 the existence 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.979
 I do not know anything floral 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.579
 is definitely so it looks like oh 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.770
 yes very interesting up here the 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:45.780
 fire alarm and here this sign see 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.850
 you that you please do not please 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.799
 do not hang up yes because it serien 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.009
 Slave this little tube there 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.270
 it will break then it will get wet 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.689
 I said fire alarm near is the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.250
 sprinkleranlage says that one and thinks 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.020
 the other so wrong 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.000
 the dessert with a phone so that 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.649
 We have somehow here all year 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.810
 sockets or something like that actually 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.970
 Nowadays it is important to be one 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.470
 We want to charge the smartphone 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.860
 Not 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.930
 Here is one here then one is 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.480
 sofa which can also be used 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.460
 as a sofa bed and up here then can 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.610
 pulled down a fourth bed 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.740
 so here is a table of 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.560
 trash can and now we come here 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.470
 this whole console and that is here 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.150
 the television among other things to use 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.390
 also with this keyboard 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.520
 There is water which is chargeable 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.900
 Of course, what that costs is written but 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.090
 I assume that it is very 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.760
 Expensive is here on the tv I can 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.250
 I can also restaurants or 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.120
 shows or so book and there is one 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.820
 minibar also logically extra 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.440
 Unfortunately, it is not possible to pay 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.820
 I probably have this price list 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.220
 in some folder or something like that 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.650
 have not seen you yes here you are 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.110
 again a movie that I can use 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.270
 and here you can see after five 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.670
 years, the furniture is already here 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.620
 so a bit off 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.270
 but that's just so higher so that's it 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.880
 the home actually there you know that 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.440
 yes synonymous sockets that's yes 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.660
 now what was actually in the caribbean 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.160
 is going on in the field is that one sees 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.390
 then here, too, so that's here 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.739
 First of all, our American 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.989
 sockets up here 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.260
 what is that then that a screw there 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.000
 fits almost nothing purely so the German 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.950
 You miss the outlet first 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.530
 you then go down here 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:41.600
 yes and that is really only one 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:44.150
 therefore have less whosoever would device 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.739
 He definitely should 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.510
 should definitely be there one 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.360
 multifunctional socket brings with it 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.709
 here also again bin and then 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.720
 Let's look at the balcony 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:58.040
 there is a sliding door no hinged door 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.690
 So I can leave it open like that and 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.400
 then come to the balcony not quite 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.980
 small it has to be said that's why there is 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.450
 also a relatively large table which yes 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.230
 very convenient is because you have room 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.400
 service has and is free and 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.709
 then you can eat here 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.090
 these are simple chairs here now 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.250
 I have no possibility to go back to 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.260
 adjust or something like that only relative 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.330
 to sit upright in it 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.190
 that's what the whole thing looks like 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.680
 we'll talk about that over the 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.880
 parapet so to speak over there and sees 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.250
 You're not much up here 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.620
 So here comes the sun also directly 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.790
 By the way , here are, by the way, are in the harbor 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.210
 from barcelona 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:39.140
 at the first run today the oasis of the 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.220
 seas so that was the balcony and now 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:47.390
 Let's go to the bathroom again 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:51.830
 that's missing here too 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:54.050
 behind saw what I noticed 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.170
 here that the sink is you can 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.810
 seeing that is very very deep so 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.370
 I'm here with my somehow now 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.290
 yes here is my my pocket and 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.510
 and extremely deep 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.770
 yes, if she injects a bit so 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.110
 if you wash your hands here 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.390
 or so right or so then the 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.710
 washstand relatively quickly sees wet yes 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.000
 not quite as nice as I am 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.920
 so it does not seem interesting 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.750
 automatically shampoo or conditioner 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.700
 or so delivered here but no 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.600
 problem you can say and then 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.320
 you do not get that we actually 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.820
 meaningful 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.290
 more meaningful than if somehow 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.890
 Much is not what many people are looking for 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.900
 need 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:33.560
 oh so I have toothbrush cups since the 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:36.260
 toilet down there still such a guy yes how 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.860
 hot like this you know what 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.900
 I mean 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.100
 here is again storage space for the 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:45.140
 toilets then, for example, and 1 0 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:48.260
 and then finally the view in the 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:51.260
 shower where there is such a shampoo 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:54.050
 or or or shower gel what you get then 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.910
 can use the whole thing with that 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.850
 just seen with a shower cabin 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:02.000
 well yes so if I am here now 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.530
 that is even possible so is still one 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.860
 bit space so I fit well 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:09.350
 that's not always the case since 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.710
 is there so yes that was so here 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:15.860
 our wet cell so that's what it was 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.300
 balcony cabin on the oasis of the seas 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.000
 if you liked it all then 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.440
 Give the whole a thumb up and 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.760
 if you say oh that was valuable for 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.590
 me , the cabin is now also like 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.120
 book then click the link in the video 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.530
 description and there are more 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.940
 otherwise I would say 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.940
 Goodbye until next time bye
