that's<00:01:21.090> default<00:01:21.450> but<00:01:21.689> when<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.200> set

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
that's default but when you set

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.350 
that's default but when you set
equipment<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.189> basically<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.970> armor

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
equipment this is basically the armor

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.580 
equipment this is basically the armor
and<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> equipment<00:01:25.049> he's<00:01:25.140> supposed<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.380> have

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
and the equipment he's supposed to have

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.230 
and the equipment he's supposed to have
and<00:01:25.770> as<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.920> can<00:01:26.009> see<00:01:26.189> that's<00:01:26.280> all<00:01:26.549> left<00:01:26.850> zero

so they do not have equipment unless you

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.450 
so they do not have equipment unless you
set<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.960> at<00:01:31.799> least<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.189> command
