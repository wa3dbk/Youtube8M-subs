want to go it the other way so we're
gonna<00:01:29.579> do<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.729> I'm<00:01:29.820> gonna<00:01:29.880> give<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.060> about<00:01:30.180> a

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
gonna do is I'm gonna give it about a

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.350 
gonna do is I'm gonna give it about a
quarter<00:01:30.960> throttle<00:01:31.640> and<00:01:32.640> during<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.090> quarter

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
quarter throttle and during that quarter

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.880 
quarter throttle and during that quarter
throttle<00:01:33.750> I'm<00:01:33.810> gonna<00:01:33.960> use<00:01:34.140> my<00:01:34.290> rudder<00:01:34.530> to

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
throttle I'm gonna use my rudder to

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.469 
throttle I'm gonna use my rudder to
straighten<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.820> up<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.119> make<00:01:36.210> sure<00:01:36.329> it's

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
straighten it up and make sure it's

straighten it up and make sure it's
going<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.320> correct<00:01:37.619> way<00:01:37.799> I'm<00:01:37.950> gonna<00:01:38.040> use<00:01:38.159> my

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
going the correct way I'm gonna use my

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.590 
going the correct way I'm gonna use my
mouse<00:01:38.430> make<00:01:38.670> sure<00:01:38.790> it's<00:01:38.939> going<00:01:39.150> down<00:01:39.420> this

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
mouse make sure it's going down this

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.359 
mouse make sure it's going down this
runway<00:01:39.780> straight<00:01:40.320> that's<00:01:40.680> why<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:40.920> choose<00:01:41.130> this

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
runway straight that's why I choose this

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.340 
runway straight that's why I choose this
map<00:01:41.579> as<00:01:41.790> well<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.060> show<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.299> kind<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.200> make

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
map as well to show you kind of make

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.990 
map as well to show you kind of make
sure<00:01:43.470> I'm<00:01:43.619> trying<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:43.950> stay<00:01:44.130> within<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.610> ok

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000

get about you know when I said about

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.100 
get about you know when I said about
quarter<00:01:50.460> half<00:01:50.700> throttle<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.329> I'm<00:01:51.780> gonna<00:01:51.869> try

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
quarter half throttle and I'm gonna try

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.109 
quarter half throttle and I'm gonna try
to<00:01:52.170> maintain<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.890> you're<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.700> direction

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
to maintain it you're in that direction

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.420 
to maintain it you're in that direction
and<00:01:54.799> this<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.829> little<00:01:55.860> bit<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.130> right<00:01:56.250> rudder

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
and this a little bit of right rudder

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.760 
and this a little bit of right rudder
and<00:01:56.700> then<00:01:57.420> now<00:01:57.540> we<00:01:57.600> have<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> half<00:01:58.049> throttle<00:01:58.469> and

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
and then now we have a half throttle and

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.499 
and then now we have a half throttle and
then<00:01:59.520> I'm<00:01:59.579> gonna<00:01:59.670> get<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.880> little<00:02:00.030> bit<00:02:00.119> more<00:02:00.270> and

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
then I'm gonna get a little bit more and

so just trying to keep her level and you
want<00:02:26.370> make<00:02:26.460> sure<00:02:26.520> you're<00:02:26.700> flying<00:02:26.910> pretty<00:02:27.150> high

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
want make sure you're flying pretty high

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.870 
want make sure you're flying pretty high
up<00:02:27.360> not<00:02:27.780> low<00:02:27.990> like<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:28.230> because<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:29.790> know

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
up not low like this because you know

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.930 
up not low like this because you know
the<00:02:30.090> main<00:02:30.270> key<00:02:30.510> is<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:31.220> your<00:02:32.220> if<00:02:32.460> you<00:02:32.610> do<00:02:32.730> make<00:02:32.910> a

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
the main key is is your if you do make a

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.490 
the main key is is your if you do make a
mistake<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.690> want<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.900> make<00:02:34.020> sure<00:02:34.050> that<00:02:34.350> you

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
mistake you want to make sure that you

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.010 
mistake you want to make sure that you

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
can fix that mistake so again we're just

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.870 
can fix that mistake so again we're just
doing<00:02:37.440> these<00:02:37.590> these<00:02:38.010> quick<00:02:38.280> circuits<00:02:38.730> right

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
doing these these quick circuits right

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.840 
doing these these quick circuits right
here<00:02:39.090> just<00:02:39.360> doing<00:02:39.540> big<00:02:39.720> circles<00:02:40.200> basically

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
here just doing big circles basically

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.820 
here just doing big circles basically
and<00:02:42.140> we're<00:02:43.140> just<00:02:43.200> gonna<00:02:43.320> give<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.710> little

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
and we're just gonna give it a little

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.140 
and we're just gonna give it a little
bit<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.340> these<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:44.610> can<00:02:44.730> see<00:02:44.820> I<00:02:44.850> don't<00:02:44.970> need

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
bit and these you can see I don't need

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.390 
bit and these you can see I don't need
to<00:02:45.240> hold<00:02:45.420> left<00:02:45.870> during<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.260> whole<00:02:46.410> turn<00:02:46.680> it'll

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
to hold left during the whole turn it'll

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.700 
to hold left during the whole turn it'll
stay<00:02:47.640> left<00:02:48.510> if<00:02:48.960> you<00:02:49.050> just<00:02:49.200> give<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.530> little

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
stay left if you just give it a little

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.320 
stay left if you just give it a little
bit<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:49.980> left<00:02:50.190> as<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.490> can<00:02:50.610> see<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.760> mean<00:02:50.970> all<00:02:51.270> my

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
bit of left as you can see I mean all my

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.150 
bit of left as you can see I mean all my
controls<00:02:51.810> here<00:02:52.050> because<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.620> have<00:02:52.770> dual<00:02:52.980> rates

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
controls here because I have dual rates

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.620 
controls here because I have dual rates
on<00:02:53.340> that's<00:02:53.850> why<00:02:54.000> you're<00:02:54.180> seeing<00:02:54.360> all<00:02:54.510> this

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
on that's why you're seeing all this

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.970 
on that's why you're seeing all this
movement<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.200> you're<00:02:55.440> seeing<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.710> plane<00:02:55.860> not

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
movement and you're seeing the plane not

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.560 
movement and you're seeing the plane not
do<00:02:56.160> hardly<00:02:56.400> anything<00:02:56.490> if<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.120> turn<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.390> dole

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
do hardly anything if I turn the dole

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.730 
do hardly anything if I turn the dole
rates<00:02:57.750> off<00:02:57.930> if<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.290> don't<00:02:58.470> have<00:02:58.620> an

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
rates off if you don't have an

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.670 
rates off if you don't have an
electronic<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.790> know<00:02:59.910> actual<00:03:00.750> as<00:03:01.560> you

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
electronic and you know actual as you

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.750 
electronic and you know actual as you
can<00:03:01.770> see<00:03:01.830> I'm<00:03:01.920> just<00:03:02.100> giving<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.370> little<00:03:02.550> bitty

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
can see I'm just giving a little bitty

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.670 
can see I'm just giving a little bitty
movements<00:03:03.210> on<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.840> sticks<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.290> look<00:03:04.410> at<00:03:04.560> its

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
movements on the sticks and look at its

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.650 
movements on the sticks and look at its
turning<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.310> then<00:03:05.790> I'm<00:03:05.910> not<00:03:06.060> holding<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:06.540> in

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
turning and then I'm not holding it in

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.240 
turning and then I'm not holding it in
that<00:03:06.780> corner<00:03:07.110> either<00:03:07.260> it's<00:03:07.530> it's<00:03:07.770> staying<00:03:08.070> in

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
that corner either it's it's staying in

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.420 
that corner either it's it's staying in
that<00:03:08.340> corner<00:03:08.700> all<00:03:08.850> by<00:03:09.000> itself<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:09.630> then<00:03:10.440> all

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
that corner all by itself and then all

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.620 
that corner all by itself and then all
I'm<00:03:11.580> gonna<00:03:11.670> do<00:03:11.850> is<00:03:11.880> just<00:03:12.210> straighten<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.600> back

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
I'm gonna do is just straighten it back

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.000 
I'm gonna do is just straighten it back
out<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:12.960> then<00:03:13.350> let<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.560> go

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
out and then let it go

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.950 
out and then let it go
and<00:03:14.100> I'm<00:03:14.610> gonna<00:03:14.790> use<00:03:14.850> that<00:03:14.940> elevator<00:03:15.480> again<00:03:15.660> to

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
and I'm gonna use that elevator again to

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.870 
and I'm gonna use that elevator again to
make<00:03:16.170> sure<00:03:16.200> it's<00:03:16.350> staying<00:03:16.800> up<00:03:17.040> someone<00:03:17.730> try<00:03:17.850> to

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
make sure it's staying up someone try to

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.920 
make sure it's staying up someone try to
straighten<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.270> out<00:03:18.330> a<00:03:18.450> little<00:03:18.540> bit<00:03:18.660> quit

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930

talking but okay so you know again like

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.780 
talking but okay so you know again like
your<00:03:22.680> main<00:03:22.830> key<00:03:23.040> is<00:03:23.070> here<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.400> get<00:03:23.520> it<00:03:23.610> up<00:03:23.700> in

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
your main key is here to get it up in

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.910 
your main key is here to get it up in
the<00:03:23.850> air<00:03:24.060> level<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:24.840> out<00:03:24.959> sometimes<00:03:25.500> as<00:03:25.770> you'll

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
the air level it out sometimes as you'll

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.710 
the air level it out sometimes as you'll
see<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.670> may<00:03:26.790> have<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.000> trim<00:03:27.180> it<00:03:27.300> out<00:03:27.390> so<00:03:27.600> if

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
see you may have to trim it out so if

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.810 
see you may have to trim it out so if
the<00:03:27.840> plane<00:03:28.050> is<00:03:28.080> constantly<00:03:28.709> doing<00:03:28.830> this<00:03:29.100> going

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
the plane is constantly doing this going

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.160 
the plane is constantly doing this going
left<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:30.239> you're<00:03:30.330> not<00:03:30.420> touching<00:03:30.720> anything<00:03:30.900> in

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
left and you're not touching anything in

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.380 
left and you're not touching anything in
a<00:03:31.260> sintered<00:03:31.590> stick<00:03:31.890> or<00:03:32.430> it's<00:03:32.700> going<00:03:32.850> right<00:03:33.090> or

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
a sintered stick or it's going right or

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.490 
a sintered stick or it's going right or
it's<00:03:33.510> going<00:03:33.660> up<00:03:33.810> or<00:03:34.020> down<00:03:34.050> or<00:03:34.260> something<00:03:34.380> like

it's going up or down or something like
that

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
that

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.590 
that
they'll<00:03:35.190> be<00:03:35.310> trim<00:03:35.580> tabs<00:03:35.820> on<00:03:36.060> your<00:03:36.270> actual

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
they'll be trim tabs on your actual

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.510 
they'll be trim tabs on your actual
transmitter<00:03:37.200> whether<00:03:37.800> they're<00:03:38.040> electronic

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
transmitter whether they're electronic

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.940 
transmitter whether they're electronic
or<00:03:38.940> you<00:03:39.360> know<00:03:39.450> manual<00:03:39.959> or<00:03:40.140> what<00:03:40.260> have<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.620> but

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
or you know manual or what have you but

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.530 
or you know manual or what have you but
you'll<00:03:41.100> adjust<00:03:41.220> those<00:03:41.550> the<00:03:41.700> best<00:03:41.850> you<00:03:41.970> can<00:03:42.209> and

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
you'll adjust those the best you can and

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.600 
you'll adjust those the best you can and
to<00:03:43.470> make<00:03:43.620> sure<00:03:43.650> it's<00:03:43.920> just<00:03:44.070> trying<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.430> fly

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
to make sure it's just trying to fly

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.280 
to make sure it's just trying to fly
straight<00:03:44.970> even<00:03:45.150> real<00:03:45.390> airplanes<00:03:45.810> have<00:03:46.050> that

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
straight even real airplanes have that

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.870 
straight even real airplanes have that
so<00:03:46.830> what<00:03:47.160> I'm<00:03:47.220> gonna<00:03:47.310> do<00:03:47.400> is<00:03:47.520> I'm<00:03:47.580> gonna<00:03:47.640> take

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.250 
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take
it<00:03:47.970> in<00:03:48.060> for<00:03:48.239> you<00:03:48.600> know<00:03:48.690> just<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.930> little<00:03:49.080> bit<00:03:49.170> of

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
it in for you know just a little bit of

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.830 
it in for you know just a little bit of
a<00:03:49.320> flyby<00:03:50.090> and<00:03:51.090> again<00:03:51.330> make<00:03:51.450> sure<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:51.660> stay<00:03:51.810> on

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
a flyby and again make sure you stay on

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.990 
a flyby and again make sure you stay on
that<00:03:51.900> elevator<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:53.160> pull<00:03:53.340> back<00:03:53.550> if<00:03:53.850> anything

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
that elevator to pull back if anything

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.720 
that elevator to pull back if anything
goes<00:03:54.330> wrong<00:03:54.440> pull<00:03:55.440> back<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.860> give<00:03:56.640> it

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
goes wrong pull back and give it

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.920 
goes wrong pull back and give it
throttle<00:03:56.880> okay<00:03:57.870> so<00:03:58.500> I<00:03:59.180> mean<00:04:00.180> this<00:04:00.570> is<00:04:00.750> a<00:04:00.780> great

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
throttle okay so I mean this is a great

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.810 
throttle okay so I mean this is a great
plane<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.350> actually<00:04:01.650> fly<00:04:01.890> on<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:02.520> learn<00:04:02.670> on

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
plane to actually fly on to learn on

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.750 
plane to actually fly on to learn on
it's<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.300> t28<00:04:04.040> it's<00:04:05.040> got<00:04:05.250> tricycle<00:04:05.730> landing

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
it's a t28 it's got tricycle landing

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.699 
it's a t28 it's got tricycle landing
gear<00:04:06.000> so<00:04:06.270> it's<00:04:06.390> actually<00:04:06.570> pretty<00:04:06.989> you<00:04:07.590> know

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
gear so it's actually pretty you know

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.320

it's<00:04:07.860> pretty<00:04:07.980> easy<00:04:08.100> to<00:04:08.340> land<00:04:08.610> it<00:04:08.910> says<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:09.209> can

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
it's pretty easy to land it says you can

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.580 
it's pretty easy to land it says you can
land<00:04:09.540> in<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.780> number<00:04:09.989> of<00:04:10.019> different<00:04:10.140> places<00:04:10.380> you

land in a number of different places you
can<00:04:10.769> even<00:04:10.890> take<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:11.160> landing<00:04:11.459> gear<00:04:11.610> off<00:04:11.640> and

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
can even take the landing gear off and

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.280 
can even take the landing gear off and
you<00:04:12.660> can<00:04:12.810> just<00:04:12.959> land<00:04:13.170> it<00:04:13.380> in<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.980> grass<00:04:15.290> one

maneuver your way around you want to use

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.320 
maneuver your way around you want to use
little<00:05:01.550> rudder<00:05:01.760> you<00:05:01.880> don't<00:05:02.030> want<00:05:02.150> to<00:05:02.210> use<00:05:02.300> a

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
little rudder you don't want to use a

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.370 
little rudder you don't want to use a
whole<00:05:02.570> lot<00:05:02.690> of<00:05:02.720> rudder<00:05:02.930> you<00:05:03.020> don't<00:05:03.170> wanna<00:05:03.290> be

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
whole lot of rudder you don't wanna be

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.430 
whole lot of rudder you don't wanna be
like<00:05:03.500> this<00:05:03.740> you<00:05:04.070> want<00:05:04.190> to<00:05:04.250> be<00:05:04.340> more<00:05:04.490> like<00:05:04.550> this

okay

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.070 
okay
and<00:05:07.910> it<00:05:08.030> doesn't<00:05:08.300> properly<00:05:08.720> show<00:05:08.870> it<00:05:08.960> really

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
and it doesn't properly show it really

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.810 
and it doesn't properly show it really
on<00:05:09.230> this<00:05:09.350> simulator<00:05:09.800> but<00:05:10.070> you<00:05:10.280> know<00:05:10.400> that's<00:05:10.700> a

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
on this simulator but you know that's a

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.580 
on this simulator but you know that's a
that's<00:05:11.180> why<00:05:11.300> I'm<00:05:11.390> showing<00:05:11.540> it<00:05:11.750> to<00:05:11.780> you<00:05:11.900> now<00:05:12.140> is

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
that's why I'm showing it to you now is

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.790 
that's why I'm showing it to you now is
because<00:05:13.160> it's<00:05:13.310> really<00:05:13.940> sensitive<00:05:14.150> so<00:05:14.800> let's

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
because it's really sensitive so let's

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.830 
because it's really sensitive so let's
take<00:05:16.010> off<00:05:16.190> do<00:05:16.430> one<00:05:16.640> more<00:05:16.760> circuit<00:05:17.210> and<00:05:17.360> see<00:05:17.750> if

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
take off do one more circuit and see if

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.010 
take off do one more circuit and see if
we<00:05:17.960> can<00:05:18.910> show<00:05:19.910> you<00:05:19.970> exactly<00:05:20.480> what<00:05:20.780> it<00:05:20.810> looks

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
we can show you exactly what it looks

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.990 
we can show you exactly what it looks
like<00:05:21.200> and<00:05:21.980> I'm<00:05:22.070> gonna<00:05:22.190> show<00:05:22.460> off<00:05:22.580> a<00:05:22.610> little<00:05:22.850> bit

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
like and I'm gonna show off a little bit

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.700 
like and I'm gonna show off a little bit
so<00:05:25.630> you<00:05:26.630> guys<00:05:26.780> can<00:05:26.960> actually<00:05:27.080> see<00:05:27.260> what<00:05:27.590> it's

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
so you guys can actually see what it's

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:37.500 
so you guys can actually see what it's
really<00:05:27.770> like<00:05:28.010> what<00:05:28.340> this<00:05:28.430> thing<00:05:28.610> can<00:05:28.730> do

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.300 

and<00:05:38.020> flying<00:05:38.230> airplanes<00:05:38.680> is<00:05:38.890> something<00:05:39.190> that

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
and flying airplanes is something that

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.000 
and flying airplanes is something that
you<00:05:39.430> can<00:05:39.640> teach<00:05:39.970> your<00:05:40.270> kids<00:05:40.600> you<00:05:41.500> know<00:05:41.620> old

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
fairly safe as long as not running or so

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.770 
fairly safe as long as not running or so
run<00:06:15.460> the<00:06:15.550> plane<00:06:15.700> into<00:06:15.910> yourself<00:06:16.270> like<00:06:16.480> I<00:06:16.510> was

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
run the plane into yourself like I was

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.790 
run the plane into yourself like I was
trying<00:06:16.930> to<00:06:17.050> do<00:06:17.970> and<00:06:19.410> you<00:06:20.410> know<00:06:20.500> you<00:06:20.590> can<00:06:20.710> always

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
trying to do and you know you can always

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.900 
trying to do and you know you can always
get<00:06:20.950> one<00:06:21.070> of<00:06:21.130> these<00:06:21.190> simulators<00:06:21.580> like<00:06:21.730> I'm

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
get one of these simulators like I'm

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.670 
get one of these simulators like I'm
playing<00:06:22.000> right<00:06:22.150> now<00:06:22.180> this<00:06:22.390> is<00:06:22.540> Phoenix<00:06:22.750> RC<00:06:23.410> 4

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
playing right now this is Phoenix RC 4

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.280 
playing right now this is Phoenix RC 4
and<00:06:23.970> this<00:06:24.970> right<00:06:25.150> here<00:06:25.300> is<00:06:25.360> I'm<00:06:25.780> playing<00:06:25.990> it<00:06:26.170> on

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.290 
and this right here is I'm playing it on

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.260 
and this right here is I'm playing it on
my<00:06:26.380> xbox<00:06:26.680> 360<00:06:27.400> controller<00:06:27.430> I<00:06:27.820> didn't<00:06:28.030> even<00:06:28.150> go

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
my xbox 360 controller I didn't even go

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.790 
my xbox 360 controller I didn't even go
out<00:06:28.390> and<00:06:28.510> buy<00:06:28.630> an<00:06:28.810> expensive<00:06:29.050> transmitter<00:06:29.710> or

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
out and buy an expensive transmitter or

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.340 
out and buy an expensive transmitter or
anything<00:06:29.980> but<00:06:30.520> I<00:06:30.550> think<00:06:30.640> you<00:06:30.880> can<00:06:31.030> pick<00:06:31.210> up<00:06:31.450> you

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.350 
anything but I think you can pick up you

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.680 
anything but I think you can pick up you
know<00:06:32.470> the<00:06:32.770> the<00:06:33.520> transmitter<00:06:34.060> that<00:06:34.480> you<00:06:34.570> can

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690 
know the the transmitter that you can

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.130 
know the the transmitter that you can
actually<00:06:34.810> use<00:06:35.050> on<00:06:35.170> a<00:06:35.200> real<00:06:35.380> plane<00:06:35.590> as<00:06:35.800> well<00:06:36.460> as

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140 
actually use on a real plane as well as

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.790 
actually use on a real plane as well as
the<00:06:38.140> the<00:06:38.800> simulator<00:06:39.220> itself<00:06:39.870> all<00:06:40.870> for<00:06:41.380> like<00:06:41.530> 50

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:41.800 
the the simulator itself all for like 50

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.320 
the the simulator itself all for like 50
or<00:06:41.890> 60<00:06:42.160> dollars<00:06:42.250> so<00:06:42.790> the<00:06:42.880> price<00:06:43.090> of<00:06:43.120> a

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
or 60 dollars so the price of a

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.450 
or 60 dollars so the price of a
videogame<00:06:43.770> basically<00:06:44.770> is<00:06:44.860> going<00:06:45.010> to<00:06:45.070> give<00:06:45.250> you

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
videogame basically is going to give you

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.790 
videogame basically is going to give you
a<00:06:45.700> simulator<00:06:46.450> a<00:06:46.690> transmitter<00:06:47.410> that<00:06:47.500> you<00:06:47.650> can

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 
a simulator a transmitter that you can

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.030 
a simulator a transmitter that you can
use<00:06:48.130> on<00:06:48.570> the<00:06:49.570> actual<00:06:50.050> airplanes<00:06:50.710> you<00:06:50.890> know<00:06:50.980> in

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:51.040 
use on the actual airplanes you know in

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.270 
use on the actual airplanes you know in
real<00:06:51.220> life<00:06:51.370> and<00:06:51.730> I<00:06:52.600> mean<00:06:53.410> it's<00:06:53.920> going<00:06:54.040> to<00:06:54.130> set

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.280 
real life and I mean it's going to set

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.980 
real life and I mean it's going to set
you<00:06:54.400> up<00:06:54.490> for<00:06:54.550> a<00:06:54.760> while<00:06:54.910> so<00:06:55.210> I<00:06:55.240> mean<00:06:55.420> the<00:06:55.810> most

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:55.990 
you up for a while so I mean the most

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.480 
you up for a while so I mean the most
expensive<00:06:56.260> thing<00:06:56.500> about<00:06:56.680> our<00:06:56.800> C<00:06:56.950> airplanes<00:06:57.250> is

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.490 
expensive thing about our C airplanes is

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.250 
expensive thing about our C airplanes is
the<00:06:57.730> actual<00:06:58.090> electronics<00:06:58.570> itself<00:06:58.930> everything

00:06:59.250 --> 00:06:59.260 
the actual electronics itself everything

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.130 
the actual electronics itself everything
else<00:06:59.560> is<00:06:59.770> just<00:06:59.800> foam<00:07:00.190> and<00:07:00.550> superglue<00:07:01.150> okay<00:07:01.660> so

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:02.140 
else is just foam and superglue okay so

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.740 
else is just foam and superglue okay so
easy<00:07:02.380> easy<00:07:02.620> stuff<00:07:03.090> and<00:07:04.090> if<00:07:04.270> you<00:07:04.360> crash<00:07:04.570> and

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:04.750 
easy easy stuff and if you crash and

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.750 
easy easy stuff and if you crash and
burn<00:07:04.840> a<00:07:04.900> plane<00:07:05.140> most<00:07:06.070> the<00:07:06.190> time<00:07:06.370> all<00:07:06.640> the

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:06.760 
burn a plane most the time all the

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.040 
burn a plane most the time all the
electronics<00:07:07.240> that<00:07:07.300> aren't<00:07:07.510> playing<00:07:07.570> you<00:07:07.900> can

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.050 
electronics that aren't playing you can

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.360 
electronics that aren't playing you can
typically<00:07:08.440> take<00:07:08.620> it<00:07:08.770> out<00:07:08.860> put<00:07:09.010> it<00:07:09.130> in<00:07:09.250> another

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:09.370 
typically take it out put it in another

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.510 
typically take it out put it in another
plane<00:07:09.730> so<00:07:10.330> really<00:07:11.110> really<00:07:11.350> easy<00:07:11.560> not<00:07:12.340> that

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520 
plane so really really easy not that

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.130 
plane so really really easy not that
expensive<00:07:12.820> so<00:07:13.210> anyways<00:07:13.570> I<00:07:13.660> just<00:07:13.840> want<00:07:13.960> to<00:07:14.020> show
