00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
get up to a certainly a weight then to

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.940 
get up to a certainly a weight then to
start<00:05:52.740> acting<00:05:52.860> up<00:05:53.130> I'm<00:05:53.700> not<00:05:54.030> quite<00:05:54.300> sure<00:05:54.330> but

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
start acting up I'm not quite sure but

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.290 
start acting up I'm not quite sure but
this<00:05:55.950> is<00:05:56.100> feeling<00:05:56.280> good<00:05:56.610> for<00:05:57.030> now<00:05:57.210> at<00:05:57.540> least<00:05:57.600> so

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
this is feeling good for now at least so

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
this is feeling good for now at least so
stick<00:06:00.300> with<00:06:00.330> it<00:06:00.479> I<00:06:00.630> guess<00:06:00.780> is<00:06:00.930> the<00:06:01.020> word<00:06:01.050> of<00:06:01.169> the

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
stick with it I guess is the word of the

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.080 
stick with it I guess is the word of the
day<00:06:01.440> and<00:06:01.680> if<00:06:02.070> anything<00:06:02.340> over<00:06:02.700> the<00:06:02.790> course<00:06:03.000> of

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
day and if anything over the course of

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.150 
day and if anything over the course of
the<00:06:03.180> next<00:06:03.300> few<00:06:03.510> weeks<00:06:03.750> overall<00:06:04.650> volume<00:06:04.800> will

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
the next few weeks overall volume will

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.629 
the next few weeks overall volume will
be<00:06:05.190> dropping<00:06:05.520> as<00:06:06.270> in

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 
be dropping as in

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:08.489 
be dropping as in
he<00:06:06.819> rises<00:06:07.060> so<00:06:07.449> it's<00:06:07.599> possible<00:06:07.810> then<00:06:08.229> I'll<00:06:08.319> be

00:06:08.489 --> 00:06:08.499 
he rises so it's possible then I'll be

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:11.339 
he rises so it's possible then I'll be
feeling<00:06:08.800> better<00:06:09.009> and<00:06:09.159> better<00:06:09.310> as<00:06:09.669> we<00:06:10.349> get

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:11.349 
feeling better and better as we get

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:14.550

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:26.700 
finishing up the last these polls I
think<00:06:24.759> it<00:06:24.819> was<00:06:24.879> 600<00:06:25.419> for<00:06:25.599> a<00:06:25.629> triple<00:06:26.139> for<00:06:26.319> me<00:06:26.469> and

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
think it was 600 for a triple for me and

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.059 
think it was 600 for a triple for me and
Joe<00:06:27.370> finishing<00:06:27.759> alber<00:06:27.999> just<00:06:28.150> a<00:06:28.240> single<00:06:28.479> of<00:06:29.069> 500

I<00:06:30.129> think<00:06:30.340> 495<00:06:31.150> now<00:06:32.139> I<00:06:32.169> think<00:06:32.319> we<00:06:32.469> made<00:06:32.650> an<00:06:32.740> even

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:32.860 
I think 495 now I think we made an even

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.140 
I think 495 now I think we made an even
