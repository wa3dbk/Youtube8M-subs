this<00:00:04.480> is<00:00:04.630> the<00:00:04.780> fast-forward<00:00:05.440> ride<00:00:06.870> it's<00:00:07.870> a

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:08.260 
this is the fast-forward ride it's a

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.080 
this is the fast-forward ride it's a
part<00:00:08.650> of<00:00:08.710> the<00:00:08.769> fast-forward<00:00:09.400> line<00:00:09.580> which<00:00:09.880> is

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.090 
part of the fast-forward line which is

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.900 
part of the fast-forward line which is
under<00:00:10.960> the<00:00:11.110> umbrella<00:00:11.260> of<00:00:11.680> Hiro<00:00:12.010> Eco<00:00:12.430> and<00:00:12.670> they

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:12.910 
under the umbrella of Hiro Eco and they

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.229 
under the umbrella of Hiro Eco and they
also<00:00:13.120> recently<00:00:13.690> acquired<00:00:14.650> a<00:00:15.070> to<00:00:15.429> be<00:00:15.969> an

00:00:16.229 --> 00:00:16.239 
also recently acquired a to be an

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.349 
also recently acquired a to be an
electric<00:00:16.720> bike<00:00:16.929> so<00:00:17.289> I<00:00:17.529> was<00:00:18.130> demoing<00:00:18.909> this<00:00:19.119> bike

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:19.359 
electric bike so I was demoing this bike

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.300 
electric bike so I was demoing this bike
had<00:00:20.050> a<00:00:20.079> chance<00:00:20.319> to<00:00:20.499> ride<00:00:20.650> it<00:00:20.769> around<00:00:20.859> and<00:00:21.220> look

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
had a chance to ride it around and look

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.559 
had a chance to ride it around and look
at<00:00:21.429> all<00:00:21.519> the<00:00:21.640> features<00:00:21.970> and<00:00:22.179> they're<00:00:22.329> really

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:22.569 
at all the features and they're really

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:25.109 
at all the features and they're really
quite<00:00:23.230> a<00:00:23.259> few<00:00:23.649> one<00:00:24.220> of<00:00:24.310> my<00:00:24.399> favorites<00:00:24.880> is

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
quite a few one of my favorites is

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.040 
quite a few one of my favorites is
actually<00:00:25.300> the<00:00:25.810> battery<00:00:26.140> pack<00:00:26.439> itself<00:00:27.149> so<00:00:28.149> this

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
actually the battery pack itself so this

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.060 
actually the battery pack itself so this
is<00:00:29.349> a<00:00:29.429> 36<00:00:30.429> volt<00:00:30.759> 9<00:00:31.659> amp<00:00:32.079> hour<00:00:32.230> pack<00:00:32.349> that's

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
is a 36 volt 9 amp hour pack that's

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.360 
is a 36 volt 9 amp hour pack that's
fairly<00:00:33.340> standard<00:00:33.850> but<00:00:34.630> it's<00:00:35.470> lithium-ion<00:00:36.040> and

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
fairly standard but it's lithium-ion and

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.570 
fairly standard but it's lithium-ion and
the<00:00:37.090> cool<00:00:37.480> thing<00:00:37.690> about<00:00:37.720> it<00:00:38.080> is<00:00:38.230> actually<00:00:38.580> the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
the cool thing about it is actually the

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.880 
the cool thing about it is actually the
way<00:00:39.730> that<00:00:40.000> it<00:00:40.180> mounts<00:00:41.050> to<00:00:41.200> the<00:00:41.230> frame<00:00:41.560> so<00:00:41.590> let

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
way that it mounts to the frame so let

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.940 
way that it mounts to the frame so let
me<00:00:41.950> grab<00:00:42.820> the<00:00:43.060> keys<00:00:43.300> here<00:00:43.660> real<00:00:43.900> quick<00:00:44.110> that's

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
me grab the keys here real quick that's

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.230 
me grab the keys here real quick that's
something<00:00:45.340> I<00:00:45.430> like<00:00:45.580> actually<00:00:45.820> you<00:00:46.030> don't<00:00:46.120> have

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:46.240 
something I like actually you don't have

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.760 
something I like actually you don't have
to<00:00:46.510> leave<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:46.780> keys<00:00:46.990> in<00:00:47.020> when<00:00:47.320> you<00:00:47.410> ride<00:00:47.590> this

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
to leave the keys in when you ride this

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.170 
to leave the keys in when you ride this
bike<00:00:47.950> so<00:00:48.880> put<00:00:49.150> the<00:00:49.270> key<00:00:49.510> in<00:00:50.040> twist<00:00:51.040> it<00:00:51.340> the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
bike so put the key in twist it the

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.480 
bike so put the key in twist it the
battery<00:00:52.390> pack<00:00:52.750> just<00:00:53.079> slides<00:00:53.770> out<00:00:54.070> sideways

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.490 
battery pack just slides out sideways

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
battery pack just slides out sideways
you<00:00:54.940> see<00:00:55.120> that<00:00:55.270> like<00:00:55.480> just<00:00:55.860> slides<00:00:56.860> out<00:00:57.510> that's

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
you see that like just slides out that's

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:07.889 
you see that like just slides out that's
so<00:00:58.780> cool<00:01:05.700> area<00:01:06.700> so<00:01:06.939> it<00:01:07.030> slides<00:01:07.359> back<00:01:07.509> in<00:01:07.780> as

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
so cool area so it slides back in as

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.760 
so cool area so it slides back in as
well<00:01:08.219> but<00:01:09.219> I<00:01:09.280> like<00:01:09.609> that<00:01:09.969> because<00:01:10.119> I<00:01:10.770> commute

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
well but I like that because I commute

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.760 
well but I like that because I commute
to<00:01:11.799> to<00:01:12.640> work<00:01:12.819> on<00:01:13.030> my<00:01:13.240> electric<00:01:13.990> bike<00:01:14.170> and<00:01:14.469> being

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
to to work on my electric bike and being

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.319 
to to work on my electric bike and being
able<00:01:14.859> to<00:01:15.009> pull<00:01:15.579> the<00:01:15.729> thing<00:01:15.939> off<00:01:16.060> pull<00:01:16.299> the

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
able to pull the thing off pull the

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.469 
able to pull the thing off pull the
battery<00:01:16.630> off<00:01:16.749> charge<00:01:17.530> it<00:01:17.770> up<00:01:18.159> at<00:01:18.429> the<00:01:18.639> up<00:01:19.329> at

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
battery off charge it up at the up at

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.569 
battery off charge it up at the up at
the<00:01:19.539> desk<00:01:19.780> is<00:01:19.990> cool<00:01:20.229> and<00:01:20.679> this<00:01:21.249> one<00:01:21.429> actually

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
the desk is cool and this one actually

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:24.419 
the desk is cool and this one actually
has<00:01:21.819> a<00:01:21.850> really<00:01:22.060> nice<00:01:22.560> cap<00:01:23.560> like<00:01:23.859> a<00:01:23.889> metal<00:01:24.219> cap

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:24.429 
has a really nice cap like a metal cap

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:26.309 
has a really nice cap like a metal cap
for<00:01:24.789> for<00:01:25.060> where<00:01:25.179> you<00:01:25.299> can<00:01:25.630> plug<00:01:25.840> it<00:01:25.990> in<00:01:26.079> so<00:01:26.259> you

00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:26.319 
for for where you can plug it in so you

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:27.809 
for for where you can plug it in so you
can<00:01:26.530> charge<00:01:26.679> it<00:01:26.859> on<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:26.979> bike<00:01:27.219> or<00:01:27.429> off<00:01:27.609> the

00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:27.819 
can charge it on the bike or off the

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:30.840 
can charge it on the bike or off the
bike<00:01:27.999> so<00:01:28.719> anyway<00:01:29.159> 36<00:01:30.159> volt<00:01:30.369> 9<00:01:30.549> amp<00:01:30.700> hour

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
bike so anyway 36 volt 9 amp hour

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.370 
bike so anyway 36 volt 9 amp hour
lithium<00:01:31.119> pack<00:01:31.479> right<00:01:31.899> in<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.079> middle<00:01:32.200> of<00:01:32.289> the

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
lithium pack right in the middle of the

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.730 
lithium pack right in the middle of the
bike

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
bike

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.410 
bike
I<00:01:32.770> like<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:33.459> positioning<00:01:34.149> that<00:01:34.240> they've

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
I like the positioning that they've

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.819 
I like the positioning that they've
chosen<00:01:34.569> here<00:01:34.899> because<00:01:35.049> it's<00:01:35.170> super<00:01:35.380> low<00:01:35.770> to

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
chosen here because it's super low to

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.319 
chosen here because it's super low to
the<00:01:35.950> ground<00:01:36.009> you<00:01:36.729> know<00:01:36.819> you<00:01:36.939> always<00:01:37.090> want<00:01:37.299> your

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
the ground you know you always want your

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.050 
the ground you know you always want your
center<00:01:37.630> of<00:01:37.659> gravity<00:01:37.780> like<00:01:38.289> low<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:38.829> it<00:01:39.729> sort

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
center of gravity like low and it sort

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.940 
center of gravity like low and it sort
of<00:01:40.119> distributes<00:01:40.719> the<00:01:40.899> weight<00:01:40.929> a<00:01:41.380> little<00:01:41.799> bit

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
of distributes the weight a little bit

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.319 
of distributes the weight a little bit
more<00:01:42.159> towards<00:01:42.459> the<00:01:42.579> front<00:01:42.819> so<00:01:42.909> you<00:01:43.029> don't<00:01:43.240> have

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
more towards the front so you don't have

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:45.899 
more towards the front so you don't have
like<00:01:43.389> a<00:01:43.779> pack<00:01:44.409> up<00:01:44.649> here<00:01:45.009> up<00:01:45.189> high<00:01:45.369> real<00:01:45.700> heavy

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
like a pack up here up high real heavy

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.849 
like a pack up here up high real heavy
and<00:01:46.810> that<00:01:46.899> just<00:01:47.200> tends<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.469> make<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.709> bike

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:47.859 
and that just tends to make the bike

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:50.219 
and that just tends to make the bike
more<00:01:48.039> stable<00:01:48.429> so<00:01:48.969> there's<00:01:49.179> the<00:01:49.450> motor<00:01:49.659> that's

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
more stable so there's the motor that's

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:56.459 
more stable so there's the motor that's
a<00:01:50.499> geared<00:01:52.709> 350<00:01:53.709> watt<00:01:54.810> hub<00:01:55.810> motor<00:01:55.990> right<00:01:56.289> there

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
a geared 350 watt hub motor right there

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:00.300 
a geared 350 watt hub motor right there
so<00:01:56.709> you<00:01:57.459> know<00:01:57.549> 36<00:01:57.909> volts<00:01:58.599> paired<00:01:59.380> with<00:01:59.560> 350

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
so you know 36 volts paired with 350

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.010 
so you know 36 volts paired with 350
watts<00:02:00.520> it's<00:02:01.329> kind<00:02:01.569> of<00:02:01.599> that's<00:02:01.749> kind<00:02:01.869> of

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
watts it's kind of that's kind of

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.419 
watts it's kind of that's kind of

to pedal you can just you do the twist

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.089 
to pedal you can just you do the twist
throttle<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:34.750> I'm<00:02:34.840> gonna<00:02:34.930> turn<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:35.709> on<00:02:35.769> here

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
throttle so I'm gonna turn it on here

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
switch right here and this this computer

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.650 
switch right here and this this computer
comes<00:02:44.019> on<00:02:44.200> in<00:02:44.349> there<00:02:44.530> three<00:02:45.519> levels<00:02:45.879> of<00:02:46.239> pedal

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
comes on in there three levels of pedal

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.140 
comes on in there three levels of pedal
assist<00:02:46.810> or<00:02:47.799> zero<00:02:48.579> which<00:02:48.790> is<00:02:48.910> just<00:02:49.090> like

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
assist or zero which is just like

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.750 
assist or zero which is just like
nothing<00:02:49.739> has<00:02:50.739> to<00:02:50.920> be<00:02:50.950> in<00:02:51.160> one<00:02:51.310> of<00:02:51.430> those<00:02:51.519> three

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
nothing has to be in one of those three

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.190 
nothing has to be in one of those three
modes<00:02:52.060> for<00:02:52.329> the<00:02:52.480> twist<00:02:52.690> throttle<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:53.079> work

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
modes for the twist throttle to work

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.009 
modes for the twist throttle to work
which<00:02:53.410> is<00:02:53.530> kind<00:02:53.739> of<00:02:53.769> interesting<00:02:54.810> but<00:02:55.810> it's

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
which is kind of interesting but it's

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.930 
which is kind of interesting but it's
it's<00:02:56.560> also<00:02:56.799> kind<00:02:57.129> of<00:02:57.160> a<00:02:57.250> neat<00:02:57.370> feature<00:02:57.549> because

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
it's also kind of a neat feature because

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.910 
it's also kind of a neat feature because
you<00:02:58.090> you<00:02:58.720> know<00:02:58.840> you're<00:02:58.989> using<00:02:59.230> pedal<00:02:59.680> assist

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
you you know you're using pedal assist

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.640 
you you know you're using pedal assist
you're<00:03:00.250> pedaling<00:03:00.609> along<00:03:01.019> get<00:03:02.019> to<00:03:02.140> a<00:03:02.170> stop<00:03:02.410> sign

you're pedaling along get to a stop sign
come<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:03.549> a<00:03:03.579> complete<00:03:03.910> stop<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.450> then<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:04.959> can

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
come to a complete stop and then you can

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:06.630 
come to a complete stop and then you can
use<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.379> twist<00:03:05.620> throttle<00:03:05.709> to<00:03:06.190> get<00:03:06.310> you<00:03:06.430> going

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
the start of the features that this bike

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.030 
the start of the features that this bike
offers<00:03:28.959> you<00:03:29.169> know<00:03:29.260> you<00:03:29.349> can<00:03:29.530> see<00:03:29.709> it's<00:03:29.859> got

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
offers you know you can see it's got

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.520 
offers you know you can see it's got
front<00:03:30.370> and<00:03:30.669> rear<00:03:30.910> fenders<00:03:31.690> they're<00:03:32.260> really

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
front and rear fenders they're really

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.819 
front and rear fenders they're really
nicely<00:03:32.739> integrated<00:03:33.780> 26<00:03:34.780> inch<00:03:34.959> wheels<00:03:35.049> and<00:03:35.650> so

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
nicely integrated 26 inch wheels and so

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.069 
nicely integrated 26 inch wheels and so
you<00:03:35.889> can<00:03:36.069> see<00:03:36.250> that<00:03:36.430> there's<00:03:36.609> space<00:03:36.910> between

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
you can see that there's space between

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.500 
you can see that there's space between
the<00:03:38.079> pedal<00:03:38.440> where<00:03:38.769> the<00:03:38.919> pedals<00:03:39.250> go<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:40.000> that

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
the pedal where the pedals go and that

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.020 
the pedal where the pedals go and that
that<00:03:41.319> fender<00:03:41.709> so<00:03:42.069> you're<00:03:42.430> less<00:03:42.639> likely<00:03:43.000> to

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
that fender so you're less likely to

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.599 
that fender so you're less likely to

can see here so it's not welded on and

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.690 
can see here so it's not welded on and
what<00:04:20.409> that<00:04:20.530> means<00:04:20.680> is<00:04:20.919> over<00:04:21.130> time<00:04:21.430> it<00:04:21.579> might

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
what that means is over time it might

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.670 
what that means is over time it might
get<00:04:21.880> a<00:04:21.909> little<00:04:22.080> rattling<00:04:23.080> or<00:04:23.200> loose<00:04:23.409> but

get a little rattling or loose but

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.730 
get a little rattling or loose but
that's<00:04:23.830> okay<00:04:24.070> you<00:04:24.130> can<00:04:24.219> just

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
that's okay you can just

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.309 
that's okay you can just
it<00:04:24.919> up<00:04:25.270> what<00:04:26.270> I<00:04:26.300> love<00:04:26.509> is<00:04:26.690> that<00:04:26.840> they<00:04:26.930> included

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:27.319 
it up what I love is that they included

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:30.670 
it up what I love is that they included
a<00:04:27.410> rear<00:04:27.620> and<00:04:27.979> a<00:04:28.160> front<00:04:28.430> light<00:04:29.120> the<00:04:30.080> downside<00:04:30.530> is

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
a rear and a front light the downside is

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.140 
a rear and a front light the downside is
that<00:04:30.710> you<00:04:31.130> actually<00:04:31.340> have<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:31.699> put<00:04:31.940> batteries

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
that you actually have to put batteries

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.420 
that you actually have to put batteries
in<00:04:32.479> these<00:04:32.569> they<00:04:32.810> aren't<00:04:33.139> connected<00:04:33.889> to<00:04:34.099> the

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
in these they aren't connected to the

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.520 
in these they aren't connected to the
main<00:04:34.639> battery<00:04:34.910> and<00:04:35.270> that<00:04:36.020> just<00:04:36.229> means<00:04:36.410> that

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
main battery and that just means that

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.230 
main battery and that just means that
you<00:04:36.979> know<00:04:37.069> whenever<00:04:37.370> you're<00:04:37.580> done<00:04:37.759> riding<00:04:38.000> you

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
you know whenever you're done riding you

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.460 
you know whenever you're done riding you
have<00:04:38.389> to<00:04:38.509> remember<00:04:38.720> to<00:04:38.930> turn<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.259> light<00:04:39.440> off

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
have to remember to turn the light off

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.770 
have to remember to turn the light off
or<00:04:40.069> you'll<00:04:40.460> wear<00:04:40.669> the<00:04:40.819> batteries<00:04:41.180> out<00:04:41.330> so<00:04:41.599> it's

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
or you'll wear the batteries out so it's

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.279 
or you'll wear the batteries out so it's
you<00:04:42.229> know<00:04:42.490> this<00:04:43.490> is<00:04:43.639> kind<00:04:43.849> of<00:04:43.970> more<00:04:44.509> of<00:04:44.539> a<00:04:44.810> an

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
you know this is kind of more of a an

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.460 
you know this is kind of more of a an
entry<00:04:46.220> level<00:04:46.370> and<00:04:47.000> a<00:04:47.090> mid-level<00:04:47.470> electric

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
entry level and a mid-level electric

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.900 
entry level and a mid-level electric
bike<00:04:48.650> considering<00:04:49.400> that<00:04:49.490> some<00:04:49.759> of<00:04:49.849> the

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
bike considering that some of the

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.450 
bike considering that some of the
features<00:04:50.210> aren't<00:04:50.389> fully<00:04:50.630> integrated<00:04:51.370> but<00:04:52.370> the

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
features aren't fully integrated but the

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.400 
features aren't fully integrated but the
quality<00:04:52.849> is<00:04:52.880> there<00:04:53.180> and<00:04:53.449> again<00:04:53.810> it's<00:04:53.990> a<00:04:54.080> decent

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
quality is there and again it's a decent

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.620 
quality is there and again it's a decent
price<00:04:54.440> point<00:04:54.889> and<00:04:55.130> I<00:04:55.759> like<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.389> way<00:04:56.479> they

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
price point and I like the way they

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.719 
price point and I like the way they
distributed<00:04:57.169> the<00:04:57.319> components<00:04:57.889> so<00:04:58.069> let's<00:04:58.610> go

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
distributed the components so let's go

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:00.969 
distributed the components so let's go
out<00:04:58.849> and<00:04:59.000> take<00:04:59.120> a<00:04:59.150> test<00:04:59.360> ride<00:04:59.630> it's<00:05:00.590> also<00:05:00.740> worth

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
out and take a test ride it's also worth

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:02.980 
out and take a test ride it's also worth
noting<00:05:01.159> here<00:05:01.490> that<00:05:01.550> they've<00:05:02.150> got<00:05:02.389> an

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
noting here that they've got an

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.480 
noting here that they've got an
adjustable<00:05:03.409> neck<00:05:03.710> so<00:05:03.889> you<00:05:03.949> can<00:05:04.099> kind<00:05:04.280> of<00:05:04.340> raise

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
adjustable neck so you can kind of raise

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.490 
adjustable neck so you can kind of raise
it<00:05:04.789> and<00:05:04.909> generally<00:05:05.720> speaking<00:05:05.960> this<00:05:06.139> is<00:05:06.319> kind

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
it and generally speaking this is kind

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.230 
it and generally speaking this is kind
of<00:05:06.530> more<00:05:06.740> of<00:05:06.770> an<00:05:06.889> upright<00:05:07.280> City<00:05:07.699> style<00:05:08.030> bike

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
of more of an upright City style bike

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.909 
of more of an upright City style bike
and<00:05:08.509> this<00:05:08.990> is<00:05:09.110> the<00:05:09.229> step-through<00:05:09.620> version

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
and this is the step-through version

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.469 
and this is the step-through version
which<00:05:10.039> is<00:05:10.190> it<00:05:10.430> just<00:05:10.610> makes<00:05:10.759> it<00:05:10.819> really<00:05:11.060> easy<00:05:11.180> to

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
which is it just makes it really easy to

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.159 
which is it just makes it really easy to
get<00:05:11.720> on<00:05:13.000> not<00:05:14.000> a<00:05:14.030> huge<00:05:14.300> fan<00:05:14.330> of<00:05:14.509> pedals<00:05:14.930> they're

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
get on not a huge fan of pedals they're

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.070 
get on not a huge fan of pedals they're
just<00:05:15.319> kind<00:05:15.500> of<00:05:15.530> plasticky<00:05:16.569> so<00:05:17.569> if<00:05:17.690> it's<00:05:17.810> rainy

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
just kind of plasticky so if it's rainy

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.870 
just kind of plasticky so if it's rainy
or<00:05:18.199> wet<00:05:18.440> you<00:05:18.620> just<00:05:18.800> want<00:05:19.159> to<00:05:19.220> be<00:05:19.310> careful<00:05:19.699> or
