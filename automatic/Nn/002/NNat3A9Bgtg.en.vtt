00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.389 
super tiny USB wires or I don't remember
what<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.409> was<00:01:55.560> but<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.770> did<00:01:55.950> something<00:01:56.219> that

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
what it was but I did something that

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.520 
what it was but I did something that
shorted<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.090> out<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.750> caused<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.380> have

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
shorted it out and it caused it to have

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.440 
shorted it out and it caused it to have
this<00:01:58.740> constant<00:01:59.159> weird<00:01:59.610> little<00:01:59.880> problem<00:02:00.299> where

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
this constant weird little problem where

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.810 
this constant weird little problem where
it<00:02:00.600> would<00:02:00.719> just<00:02:02.240> randomly<00:02:03.240> turn<00:02:03.930> off<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.820> do

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
it would just randomly turn off and do

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.020 
it would just randomly turn off and do
other<00:02:05.969> fun<00:02:06.210> little<00:02:06.360> things<00:02:06.630> like<00:02:06.890> smoke<00:02:08.030> so

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
other fun little things like smoke so

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.900 
other fun little things like smoke so
eventually<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:10.050> gave<00:02:10.530> up<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.039> put<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.730> out<00:02:11.849> of

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
eventually I gave up and I put it out of

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.320 
eventually I gave up and I put it out of
its<00:02:12.090> misery<00:02:12.150> and

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
its misery and

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.880 
its misery and
didn't<00:02:13.600> have<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.750> money<00:02:14.020> nor<00:02:14.410> did<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:14.650> have<00:02:14.680> the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
didn't have the money nor did I have the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.820 
didn't have the money nor did I have the
time<00:02:15.100> to<00:02:15.400> go<00:02:15.430> out<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:15.940> buy<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.720> proper<00:02:17.230> desktop

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
else despite the fact that it sounds

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.030 
else despite the fact that it sounds
like<00:03:13.090> I'm<00:03:13.240> just<00:03:13.420> being<00:03:13.570> lazy<00:03:13.630> which<00:03:14.380> might

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
like I'm just being lazy which might

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.370 
like I'm just being lazy which might
have<00:03:15.190> something<00:03:15.580> to<00:03:15.610> do<00:03:15.790> with<00:03:15.820> it<00:03:15.940> I<00:03:16.840> do<00:03:17.050> also

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
have something to do with it I do also

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.509 
have something to do with it I do also
think<00:03:17.709> it's<00:03:17.860> you<00:03:18.070> know<00:03:18.190> it's<00:03:18.220> worth

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
think it's you know it's worth

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.190 
think it's you know it's worth
experiencing<00:03:19.269> so<00:03:19.450> I<00:03:19.480> can<00:03:19.870> have<00:03:20.050> that

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
experiencing so I can have that

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.930 
experiencing so I can have that
experience<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:20.890> see<00:03:21.340> what<00:03:21.489> it's<00:03:21.640> like<00:03:21.760> and

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
experience and see what it's like and

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.960 
experience and see what it's like and
see<00:03:22.120> how<00:03:22.269> it<00:03:22.450> compares<00:03:22.660> to<00:03:23.260> building<00:03:23.680> my<00:03:23.800> own

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
see how it compares to building my own

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.920 
see how it compares to building my own
