00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
to right there is no going back so that

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.109 
to right there is no going back so that
makes<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.890> really<00:01:05.309> challenging<00:01:05.939> actually

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
blueprint 3d this one is a very unique

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.620 
blueprint 3d this one is a very unique
game<00:03:17.400> you're<00:03:18.400> not<00:03:18.459> gonna<00:03:18.640> find<00:03:18.880> anything<00:03:19.270> more

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
unique to this basically you're taking a

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.500 
unique to this basically you're taking a
blown-up<00:03:22.590> blueprint<00:03:23.590> of<00:03:24.090> various<00:03:25.090> structures

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
blown-up blueprint of various structures

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.530

and other things that the developers
included<00:03:28.990> here<00:03:29.170> but<00:03:29.350> this<00:03:29.620> one's<00:03:29.860> all<00:03:30.010> about

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
included here but this one's all about

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.430 
included here but this one's all about
architecture<00:03:30.880> right<00:03:31.090> here<00:03:31.330> so<00:03:31.750> you're<00:03:32.260> taking

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
architecture right here so you're taking

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.890 
architecture right here so you're taking
blown-up<00:03:33.330> blueprints<00:03:34.330> and<00:03:34.450> then<00:03:34.600> trying<00:03:34.840> to

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
blown-up blueprints and then trying to

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.310 
blown-up blueprints and then trying to
put<00:03:35.080> them<00:03:35.260> back<00:03:35.350> together<00:03:35.560> in<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:37.720> way<00:03:38.290> that

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
put them back together in a way that
