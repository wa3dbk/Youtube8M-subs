00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
just riding along on those carbon wheels

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.930 
just riding along on those carbon wheels
whoa<00:00:04.500> Carbon<00:00:05.130> wheels

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940

whoa Carbon wheels
how<00:00:06.150> much<00:00:06.299> does<00:00:06.420> your<00:00:06.660> bike<00:00:06.870> way<00:00:07.080> you've

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
how much does your bike way you've

how much does your bike way you've
surrounded<00:00:08.130> bearings<00:00:08.519> can<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:08.820> put<00:00:08.970> this<00:00:09.030> on<00:00:09.150> a

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
surrounded bearings can I put this on a

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.530 
surrounded bearings can I put this on a
scale<00:00:10.250> they<00:00:11.250> have<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.429> best<00:00:11.700> espresso<00:00:12.090> here

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540

these<00:00:12.870> carbon<00:00:13.290> wheels<00:00:13.530> make<00:00:13.860> such<00:00:14.130> a

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
these carbon wheels make such a

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.919 
these carbon wheels make such a
difference<00:00:14.670> how<00:00:15.120> much<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.360> this<00:00:15.509> way

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
difference how much is this way

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.660 
difference how much is this way
how<00:00:16.020> much<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.260> your<00:00:16.379> bike<00:00:16.560> way<00:00:16.770> do<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.279> need<00:00:17.310> one

of<00:00:17.699> these<00:00:17.910> these<00:00:18.300> ceramic<00:00:18.750> bearings<00:00:18.960> roll<00:00:19.439> so

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
of these these ceramic bearings roll so

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.099 
of these these ceramic bearings roll so
much<00:00:20.039> faster<00:00:20.490> do<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:20.910> get<00:00:21.000> this<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.270> carbon<00:00:21.660> is

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
much faster do you get this in carbon is

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.779 
much faster do you get this in carbon is
that<00:00:22.289> carbon<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.310> lightest<00:00:23.609> Bell

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789
