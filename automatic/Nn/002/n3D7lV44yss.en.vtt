 My name is Leandro, which includes 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.160

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.429
 the opportunity soaked walked giving a 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:19.230
 Look at youtube and you can not see 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.000
 an installation and a vehicle is 1.0 than 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.279
 generation 5 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 I did this installation yesterday on the river. 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.650
 of January through the invest gas 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.599
 I'll're demonstrating here as it was 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.120
 installed and if this kit is here in my 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.660
 vehicle collided with take a look 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:44.760
 now a finish that has been made 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:46.910
 I really liked the installation of a zoom and 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:53.370
 closer 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:55.920
 This is the treatment here, people are me 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.520
 I really liked this kit 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.629
 the vehicle is a searched personnel there 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.600
 said that there was a loss of power 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:11.360
 really has power loss 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:15.960
 It's not much, I'm under it. 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.580
 more or less the 10% loss of 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.590
 engine power 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.610
 this joÃ£o vehicle already has an engine one 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.380
 little weak but it's a well tolerated thing 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.350
 can you walk easy with this 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.610
 vehicle or have not yet 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.810

 What happens to this model of gas 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.440
 it does not automatically pass it 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.790
 you need to wait for a 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.430
 vehicle 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.290
