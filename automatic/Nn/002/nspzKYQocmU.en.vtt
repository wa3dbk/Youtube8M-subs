00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
makes a saltwater tank kind of scary

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.550 
makes a saltwater tank kind of scary
when<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.840> watch<00:00:30.990> some<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.380> bigger

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
when you watch some of the bigger

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.270 
when you watch some of the bigger
systems<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.340> everything<00:00:33.000> they<00:00:33.120> get<00:00:33.239> into<00:00:34.280> you

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
systems and everything they get into you

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.150 
systems and everything they get into you
don't<00:00:35.460> need<00:00:35.640> all<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.500> really<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.739> start<00:00:38.010> out

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
don't need all that really to start out

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.940 
don't need all that really to start out
with<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.370> simple<00:00:38.879> system<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.510> need<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> tank

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
with a simple system I need is a tank

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.920 
with a simple system I need is a tank
and<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.820> lot<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.270> some<00:00:42.480> water<00:00:44.300> some<00:00:45.300> say<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.719> in

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
and a lot and some water some say and in

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.060 
and a lot and some water some say and in
the<00:00:46.079> cycle<00:00:46.500> process<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:47.930> have<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> 14-game<00:00:49.800> bio

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the cycle process I have a 14-game bio

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.700 
the cycle process I have a 14-game bio
cube<00:00:50.460> that's<00:00:50.670> been<00:00:51.230> successful<00:00:52.230> for<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.590> last

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
cube that's been successful for the last

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.490 
cube that's been successful for the last
six<00:00:53.010> months<00:00:53.309> or<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.660> thought<00:00:54.840> I'd<00:00:54.989> step

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
six months or so so I thought I'd step

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.520 
six months or so so I thought I'd step
up<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:56.360> 5555<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.809> what<00:00:57.930> they<00:00:58.020> recommend<00:00:58.469> to

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
up to 5555 is what they recommend to

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.760 
up to 5555 is what they recommend to
start<00:00:58.770> with<00:00:59.420> when<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.510> enter<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.590> salt

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
start with when you enter the salt

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.850 
start with when you enter the salt
waters<00:01:02.510> tanks<00:01:05.900> things<00:01:06.900> don't<00:01:07.170> happen<00:01:07.439> as

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
waters tanks things don't happen as

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.190 
waters tanks things don't happen as
quickly<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:09.299> large<00:01:09.540> tank<00:01:09.869> because<00:01:10.049> there's

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
quickly in a large tank because there's

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.160 
quickly in a large tank because there's
a<00:01:10.260> bigger<00:01:10.530> volume<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:11.130> water<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.170> spikes

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
a bigger volume of water so the spikes

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.429 
a bigger volume of water so the spikes
of<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:14.729> nutrients<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.689> corals<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
of the nutrients that the corals and the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.160 
of the nutrients that the corals and the
fish<00:01:16.650> need<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:18.000> bad<00:01:18.180> spikes<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.810> happen

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
fish need and the bad spikes that happen

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.190 
fish need and the bad spikes that happen
to<00:01:19.850> having<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.909> lot<00:01:21.060> slower<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.689> large<00:01:21.930> system

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
to having a lot slower in a large system

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.990 
to having a lot slower in a large system
versus<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> nano<00:01:23.040> system<00:01:24.979> but<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.220> series

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
versus a nano system but in this series

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.060 
versus a nano system but in this series
I'm<00:01:27.180> going<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.390> start<00:01:27.659> off<00:01:27.750> real<00:01:28.110> simple<00:01:28.650> right

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
I'm going to start off real simple right

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.600 
I'm going to start off real simple right
now<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.280> just<00:01:29.579> have<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.909> water<00:01:31.369> some<00:01:32.369> dry

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
now we just have the water some dry

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.700 
now we just have the water some dry
Reagan<00:01:33.060> I'd<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.360> little<00:01:33.689> bit<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.869> dry<00:01:34.079> rock<00:01:34.350> and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
Reagan I'd a little bit of dry rock and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.060 
Reagan I'd a little bit of dry rock and
some<00:01:35.460> cure<00:01:35.759> live<00:01:36.119> rock<00:01:36.450> cured<00:01:37.350> live<00:01:37.530> rock<00:01:37.770> came

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
some cure live rock cured live rock came

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.980 
some cure live rock cured live rock came
from<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.490> take<00:01:39.439> cure<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:40.710> means<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.990> from

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
from I take cure just means that it from

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.800 
from I take cure just means that it from
what<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.140> understand<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.799> means<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.220> it's

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
what I understand that means that it's

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.569 
what I understand that means that it's
been<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.110> system<00:01:46.619> for<00:01:47.040> more<00:01:47.189> than<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> month

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
been in a system for more than a month

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.030 
been in a system for more than a month
it<00:01:47.939> hasn't<00:01:48.420> had<00:01:48.540> any<00:01:48.570> die<00:01:48.960> off<00:01:49.170> transferring

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
it hasn't had any die off transferring

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.359 
it hasn't had any die off transferring
systems<00:01:50.520> like<00:01:50.820> if<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.409> were<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.530> order<00:01:52.680> live

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
systems like if you were to order live

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.069 
systems like if you were to order live
rock<00:01:53.670> from<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:53.970> internet<00:01:54.500> you<00:01:55.500> would<00:01:55.680> have

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
rock from the internet you would have

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.340 
rock from the internet you would have
uncured<00:01:58.079> rock<00:01:58.880> because<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.090> had<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> day<00:02:01.079> that

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
uncured rock because it had a day that

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.889 
uncured rock because it had a day that
everything<00:02:02.009> are<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.490> lot<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.729> bacteria<00:02:03.450> and

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
everything are a lot of bacteria and

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.609 
everything are a lot of bacteria and
algae<00:02:04.770> 's<00:02:05.040> have<00:02:05.369> died<00:02:05.610> off<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.409> during<00:02:07.409> and

algae 's have died off in it during and

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.360 
algae 's have died off in it during and
shipping<00:02:09.170> so<00:02:10.170> cured<00:02:10.470> rock<00:02:10.709> will<00:02:10.979> be<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.220> rock

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
shipping so cured rock will be the rock

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.070 
shipping so cured rock will be the rock
that<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.670> get<00:02:11.819> from<00:02:12.000> your<00:02:12.120> local<00:02:12.420> fish<00:02:12.569> store

will be the filtering the live rock and

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.330 
will be the filtering the live rock and
they<00:03:21.840> Reaganite<00:03:22.290> will<00:03:22.590> be<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.769> filtering<00:03:23.130> and
