hi<00:00:00.989> I'm<00:00:01.050> Jason<00:00:01.319> Mac<00:00:01.589> Genius<00:00:01.650> and<00:00:02.129> today<00:00:02.280> we're

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
hi I'm Jason Mac Genius and today we're

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.100 
hi I'm Jason Mac Genius and today we're
going<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:02.850> look<00:00:03.000> at<00:00:03.149> chucking<00:00:03.540> up<00:00:03.629> a<00:00:03.780> shared

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
going to look at chucking up a shared

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.430 
going to look at chucking up a shared
drive<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.980> our<00:00:05.130> system<00:00:05.640> to<00:00:05.819> our<00:00:05.910> network<00:00:06.350> so<00:00:07.350> we

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
drive to our system to our network so we

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.450 
drive to our system to our network so we
have<00:00:07.589> right<00:00:07.859> here<00:00:07.890> our<00:00:08.280> wireless<00:00:08.790> router<00:00:09.090> then

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
have right here our wireless router then

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.390 
have right here our wireless router then
so<00:00:11.460> our<00:00:11.580> MacBook<00:00:11.969> is<00:00:12.120> again<00:00:12.450> connected<00:00:13.400> this

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
so our MacBook is again connected this

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.790 
so our MacBook is again connected this
goes<00:00:14.670> right<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.910> our<00:00:15.059> wireless<00:00:15.330> router<00:00:15.800> this

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
goes right to our wireless router this

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.109 
goes right to our wireless router this
is<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.039> power<00:00:17.250> switch<00:00:19.220> and<00:00:20.220> then<00:00:20.400> we<00:00:20.520> have<00:00:20.730> a

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
is the power switch and then we have a

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.330 
is the power switch and then we have a
network<00:00:21.750> drive<00:00:22.140> here<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.160> how<00:00:23.279> you

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
network drive here and this is how you

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.580 
network drive here and this is how you
hook<00:00:23.580> up<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.820> network<00:00:24.600> drive<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.320> got<00:00:25.470> an

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
hook up the network drive it's got an

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.109 
hook up the network drive it's got an
Ethernet<00:00:25.710> port<00:00:26.010> on<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.460> most<00:00:26.670> drives<00:00:27.000> just

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
Ethernet port on it most drives just

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.179 
Ethernet port on it most drives just
have<00:00:27.420> firewire<00:00:27.869> or<00:00:27.930> USB<00:00:28.080> but<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.830> has<00:00:28.920> got<00:00:29.070> an

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
have firewire or USB but this has got an

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.160 
have firewire or USB but this has got an
Ethernet<00:00:29.480> port<00:00:30.480> on<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.599> which<00:00:30.779> makes<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.080> a

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
Ethernet port on it which makes it a

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.040 
Ethernet port on it which makes it a
network<00:00:31.500> drive<00:00:32.090> so<00:00:33.090> we've<00:00:33.239> got<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.719> hooked

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
network drive so we've got that hooked

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.830 
network drive so we've got that hooked
directly<00:00:34.260> into<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.829> router<00:00:35.010> as<00:00:35.219> well<00:00:35.840> right

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
directly into the router as well right

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.590 
directly into the router as well right
here<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:38.840> most<00:00:39.840> network<00:00:40.230> drives<00:00:40.620> have<00:00:41.010> a

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
here and most network drives have a

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.869 
here and most network drives have a
utility<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.440> use<00:00:43.879> software

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
utility that you have to use software

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.450 
utility that you have to use software
wise<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:46.020> directs<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.739> mounts<00:00:47.309> and

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
wise that directs that mounts and

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.549 
wise that directs that mounts and
unmount<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> drives<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.600> things<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:49.320> that

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
unmount the drives and things like that

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.279 
unmount the drives and things like that
and<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.430> particular<00:00:50.969> Drive<00:00:51.510> uses<00:00:52.020> an

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
and so this particular Drive uses an

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.119 
and so this particular Drive uses an
desk<00:00:52.590> utility<00:00:53.239> so<00:00:54.239> I'm<00:00:54.629> going<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.110> select<00:00:55.770> end

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
desk utility so I'm going to select end

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.740 
desk utility so I'm going to select end
s<00:00:56.280> utility<00:00:57.680> and<00:00:58.680> I'm<00:00:59.160> going<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.460> choose<00:00:59.850> mount

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
s utility and I'm going to choose mount

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.679 
s utility and I'm going to choose mount
with<00:01:01.050> readwrite<00:01:04.700> and<00:01:05.700> we<00:01:06.299> should<00:01:06.479> see<00:01:06.659> that

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
with readwrite and we should see that

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.020 
with readwrite and we should see that
there<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.380> mounted<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.130> desk<00:01:08.400> top<00:01:08.580> and

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
there it is mounted on the desk top and

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.440 
there it is mounted on the desk top and
at<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.720> point<00:01:10.110> we've<00:01:10.350> got<00:01:10.760> access<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:12.090> read

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
at this point we've got access to read

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.570 
at this point we've got access to read
and<00:01:12.600> write<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.900> drive<00:01:13.229> just<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.159> make<00:01:14.369> sure

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
and write this drive just to make sure

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.310 
and write this drive just to make sure
that<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> sur<00:01:15.299> shared<00:01:15.840> drive<00:01:16.110> though

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
that this is a sur shared drive though

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.399 
that this is a sur shared drive though
I'm<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.920> open<00:01:17.900> again<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.229> make

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
I'm going to open again just to make

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.880 
I'm going to open again just to make
sure<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> shared<00:01:20.700> drive<00:01:21.000> I'm<00:01:21.330> going<00:01:21.630> to

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
sure this is a shared drive I'm going to

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.140 
sure this is a shared drive I'm going to
get<00:01:22.890> info<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.150> drive<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:25.790> go<00:01:26.790> down<00:01:26.970> into

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
get info on the drive and go down into

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.890 
get info on the drive and go down into
sharing<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.720> permissions<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:29.630> we<00:01:30.630> want<00:01:30.840> to

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
sharing and permissions and we want to

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.940 
sharing and permissions and we want to
change<00:01:31.200> everyone<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:32.040> read<00:01:33.320> from<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:34.799> want

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
change everyone to read from it we want

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.499 
change everyone to read from it we want
to<00:01:35.009> change<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.369> permissions<00:01:35.790> for<00:01:35.939> everyone<00:01:36.299> -

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
to change the permissions for everyone -

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.929 
to change the permissions for everyone -
from<00:01:36.840> read-only<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.470> read<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.799> write<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.880> I'm

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
from read-only to read and write so I'm

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.830 
from read-only to read and write so I'm
gonna<00:01:39.060> type<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.450> my<00:01:39.570> admin<00:01:39.930> password<00:01:40.470> and

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
gonna type in my admin password and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.679 
gonna type in my admin password and
change<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.409> read<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.159> write<00:01:44.390> and<00:01:45.390> now

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
change this to read and write and now

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.330 
change this to read and write and now
that's<00:01:45.899> technically<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.439> shared<00:01:46.770> drive<00:01:47.100> so

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
that's technically a shared drive so

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.020 
that's technically a shared drive so
other<00:01:47.520> systems<00:01:48.270> can<00:01:48.479> Network<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:49.430> and<00:01:50.430> then

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
other systems can Network this and then

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.539 
other systems can Network this and then
getting<00:01:51.360> rid<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.950> also<00:01:52.950> again<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.280> want

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
getting rid of this also again you want

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.389 
getting rid of this also again you want
to<00:01:53.640> use<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.880> same<00:01:54.119> software<00:01:54.509> utility<00:01:55.219> this<00:01:56.219> is

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
to use the same software utility this is

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.520 
to use the same software utility this is
called<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.670> end<00:01:56.820> s<00:01:57.000> utility<00:01:57.479> up<00:01:57.570> here<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.110> we

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
called the end s utility up here and we

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.400 
called the end s utility up here and we
are<00:01:58.560> going<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.979> unmount<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.969> drive

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.020 

I'm<00:02:04.410> gonna<00:02:04.560> take<00:02:04.800> our<00:02:04.950> firewire<00:02:05.460> drive<00:02:05.670> here

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
I'm gonna take our firewire drive here

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.790 
I'm gonna take our firewire drive here
just<00:02:06.300> an<00:02:06.450> external<00:02:06.720> firewire<00:02:07.170> bus<00:02:07.440> powered

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
just an external firewire bus powered

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.890 
just an external firewire bus powered
drive<00:02:08.040> and<00:02:08.369> I'm<00:02:08.970> gonna<00:02:09.119> hook<00:02:09.240> that<00:02:09.479> right<00:02:09.750> into

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:09.900 
drive and I'm gonna hook that right into

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.040 
drive and I'm gonna hook that right into
the<00:02:10.050> firewire<00:02:10.440> port<00:02:10.740> on<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.920> computer<00:02:11.030> and

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
the firewire port on the computer and

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.390 
the firewire port on the computer and
again<00:02:13.050> every<00:02:13.470> one<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.740> set<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.070> read<00:02:14.250> only

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
again every one is set to read only

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.580 
again every one is set to read only
we're<00:02:14.760> going<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.210> take<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.960> click<00:02:16.440> on<00:02:16.530> the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
we're going to take the click on the

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.850 
we're going to take the click on the
lock<00:02:16.830> there<00:02:17.160> but<00:02:17.880> in<00:02:17.970> our<00:02:18.120> admin<00:02:18.450> password<00:02:18.990> and

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
lock there but in our admin password and

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.820 
lock there but in our admin password and
then<00:02:20.310> changed<00:02:20.880> everyone<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.900> read<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.620> write

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
and now that is basically a network

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.740 
and now that is basically a network
