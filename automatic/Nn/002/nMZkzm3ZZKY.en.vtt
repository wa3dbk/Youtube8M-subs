00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540 

I<00:00:00.179> have<00:00:00.630> to<00:00:00.780> say<00:00:00.960> the<00:00:01.110> condition<00:00:01.589> sir<00:00:02.010> wasn't

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
I have to say the condition sir wasn't

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.820 
I have to say the condition sir wasn't
really<00:00:02.879> easy<00:00:03.090> for<00:00:03.270> me<00:00:03.659> I<00:00:03.689> think<00:00:03.840> was<00:00:04.319> quite

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
really easy for me I think was quite

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.650 
really easy for me I think was quite
cold<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.640> balls<00:00:05.879> are<00:00:06.060> really<00:00:06.270> heavy<00:00:06.480> and

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
cold and the balls are really heavy and

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.070 
cold and the balls are really heavy and
they<00:00:07.200> didn't<00:00:07.680> really<00:00:07.740> fly<00:00:08.250> so<00:00:08.750> for<00:00:09.750> me<00:00:09.870> was

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
they didn't really fly so for me was

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.930 
they didn't really fly so for me was
really<00:00:10.349> difficult<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:11.070> know<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.250> go<00:00:11.580> for<00:00:11.849> the

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
really difficult you know to go for the

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.900 
really difficult you know to go for the
shot<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:13.349> was<00:00:13.500> tough<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.519> make<00:00:14.730> any

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
shot and it was tough to make any

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.120 
shot and it was tough to make any
winners<00:00:15.210> or<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:16.020> know<00:00:16.139> ice<00:00:16.379> from<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.770> server

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
winners or you know ice from the server

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.160 
winners or you know ice from the server
or<00:00:17.400> something<00:00:17.580> like<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.990> was<00:00:19.140> very

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
or something like that so it was very

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.880 
or something like that so it was very
difficult<00:00:19.619> today<00:00:20.039> I'm<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:21.090> was<00:00:21.990> quite<00:00:22.680> long

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
difficult today I'm I was quite long

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.060

couldn't<00:00:26.490> win<00:00:26.670> myself<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.480> was<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.660> little

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
couldn't win myself so it was a little

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.620 
couldn't win myself so it was a little
bit<00:00:28.050> difficult<00:00:28.289> but<00:00:28.880> there's<00:00:29.880> how<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.420> is

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
bit difficult but there's how it is is

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.930 
bit difficult but there's how it is is
the<00:00:30.869> first<00:00:31.140> down<00:00:31.320> some<00:00:31.560> two<00:00:31.740> grand<00:00:32.399> slams<00:00:32.489> and

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.479 
the first down some two grand slams and
I'm<00:00:33.660> just<00:00:34.050> glad<00:00:34.170> I'm<00:00:34.380> still<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.160> still

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
I'm just glad I'm still in and still

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.530 
I'm just glad I'm still in and still
playing<00:00:37.940> Petra<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.300> third<00:00:39.510> time

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
playing Petra this is the third time

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.990 
playing Petra this is the third time
your<00:00:40.110> encounter<00:00:40.710> between<00:00:41.010> her<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.640> going<00:00:41.910> to

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
your encounter between her is going to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.479 
your encounter between her is going to
a3d<00:00:42.300> sets<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:43.110> happened<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.620> hardcore<00:00:44.129> grass

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
a3d sets it happened on hardcore grass

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.639 
a3d sets it happened on hardcore grass
and<00:00:44.789> as<00:00:44.910> well<00:00:45.059> as<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.300> clay<00:00:45.510> now<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.320> how<00:00:46.440> do<00:00:46.500> you

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
and as well as on clay now so how do you

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.200 
and as well as on clay now so how do you
see<00:00:46.829> her<00:00:47.010> different<00:00:47.430> from<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:48.000> other

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
see her different from the other

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.470 
see her different from the other
opponents<00:00:49.010> well<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.039> think<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.520> she<00:00:50.789> she<00:00:51.329> can

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
opponents well I think that she she can

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.069 
opponents well I think that she she can
really<00:00:51.690> hit<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> ball<00:00:52.649> well<00:00:53.390> she<00:00:54.390> can<00:00:54.539> really

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
really hit a ball well she can really

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.090 
really hit a ball well she can really
change<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.039> rhythm<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:57.629> not<00:00:58.320> easy<00:00:58.710> with

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
change the rhythm and it's not easy with

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.029 
change the rhythm and it's not easy with
her<00:00:59.460> slice<00:00:59.879> with<00:01:00.180> Italy<00:01:00.960> clothes<00:01:01.649> under<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
her slice with Italy clothes under the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.609 
her slice with Italy clothes under the
mat<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.730> really<00:01:03.449> have<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.629> be<00:01:04.019> ready<00:01:04.500> for

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
mat so you really have to be ready for

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.010 
mat so you really have to be ready for
every<00:01:05.129> shows<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.489> what<00:01:05.610> she's<00:01:05.820> playing<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.600> I

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
every shows to what she's playing and I

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.410 
every shows to what she's playing and I
think<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.920> she<00:01:08.070> didn't<00:01:08.340> miss<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:09.180> much

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
think that she didn't miss so much

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.280 
think that she didn't miss so much
always<00:01:10.100> some<00:01:11.100> good<00:01:11.520> trolleys<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.080> it<00:01:13.080> was<00:01:13.260> a

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
always some good trolleys and it was a

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.980 
always some good trolleys and it was a
really<00:01:13.560> difficult<00:01:13.770> she<00:01:14.460> she's<00:01:15.119> really<00:01:15.360> smart

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
really difficult she she's really smart

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.490 
really difficult she she's really smart
player<00:01:16.590> with<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:16.950> good<00:01:17.220> tech<00:01:17.490> touch<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.500> um

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
player with the good tech touch so um

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.620 
player with the good tech touch so um
yeah<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.369> knew<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:20.880> going<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.180> be<00:01:21.330> in

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
yeah I knew it's going to be in

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.440 
yeah I knew it's going to be in
difficult<00:01:22.259> we<00:01:22.409> played<00:01:22.680> her<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.610> played<00:01:24.240> her

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
difficult we played her I played her

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.800

but anyway it's every much is different
so<00:01:30.750> I'm<00:01:31.170> just<00:01:31.650> glad<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.130> want<00:01:33.020> not<00:01:34.020> sure
