 this way after lining 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:29.539
 will be cutting it needs to get up ironed 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.050
 if a 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:34.970
 lining you silk fabric and loose

 spill your socks and then process 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.889
 when your products are completely sewn with 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:03.560
 collars 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:07.320
 with sleeves and sheathed will not pull out 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:10.620
 stitching the second second product from 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.900
 laying also also at all seams only 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:17.690
 then you will connect 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:23.660
 from treasure with products ranging from the center 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:26.760
 center backrests on products and center on 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.340
 lining on lining you will 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.950
 shear podkladochka to 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.500
 everywhere you have coincided reasons the seams you have 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:38.010
 must also coincide with shoulder seams 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.780
 on the product and you continue it all 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:44.150
 do it to the bottom. 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.150
