 half a memory fake because 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.870
 determine the real memory i'm looking here 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.270

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.150
 so we made our flash card 

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:05.290
 set it real 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:08.680
 volume is 5 gigabytes but we made a little 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:10.510
 a little less you can check this one 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:15.040
 flash card on other devices 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:18.010
 put even in the phone through the cable here 

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:21.520
 the same procedure with recovery 

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:23.290
 real memory can be done with 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.680
 micro sd flags 

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:29.050
 but such other accumulative 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.800
 Kidd that exists except for flash cards 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:34.600
 also with external hard drives 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:38.200
 you can change their memory to make 

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.550
 less more thanks everyone yes watched 

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.970
