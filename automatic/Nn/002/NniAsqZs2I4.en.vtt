00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
don't know t12 is in bug fixing right

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.080 
don't know t12 is in bug fixing right
now<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.340> means<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.670> they're<00:01:02.910> just

now so this means that they're just
working<00:01:03.270> out<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.510> kinks<00:01:03.660> then<00:01:04.229> after<00:01:04.559> that

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
working out the kinks then after that

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.750

they're<00:01:04.860> gonna<00:01:04.949> be<00:01:05.129> sending<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.610> into

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
they're gonna be sending it into

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.990 
they're gonna be sending it into
microsoft<00:01:06.689> certification<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.830> if<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.760> passes

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
microsoft certification and if it passes

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.990 
microsoft certification and if it passes
certification<00:01:09.960> now<00:01:10.080> certification<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.549> i

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
certification now certification is a i

don't know the minimum amount of days
for<00:01:14.760> certification<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.080> maximum<00:01:16.560> out<00:01:16.710> is

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
for certification but the maximum out is

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.830 
for certification but the maximum out is
10<00:01:17.280> days<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.790> if<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.330> doesn't<00:01:18.689> pass

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.370 
fails and 4j Studios has to go back to
bug<00:01:23.580> fixing<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.240> send<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.600> Microsoft<00:01:25.170> for

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
hope that it passes certification now

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.670 
hope that it passes certification now
honestly<00:01:31.680> since<00:01:32.369> 4j<00:01:32.820> Studios<00:01:33.329> has<00:01:33.570> like<00:01:34.439> been

goes<00:01:41.549> into<00:01:41.790> certification<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.930> sounds<00:01:43.229> like

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
goes into certification it sounds like

is gonna be really soon now there are
three<00:01:49.340> possible<00:01:50.340> days<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:50.909> believe<00:01:51.299> now

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
three possible days that I believe now

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.609 
three possible days that I believe now
since<00:01:53.030> DLC<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.060> title<00:01:54.810> updates<00:01:55.110> come<00:01:55.350> out<00:01:55.470> on

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
since DLC and title updates come out on

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.200 
since DLC and title updates come out on
Tuesdays<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.219> don't<00:01:56.399> know<00:01:56.520> if<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.729> guys<00:01:56.880> knew

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
Tuesdays I don't know if you guys knew

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.270 
Tuesdays I don't know if you guys knew
that<00:01:57.479> but<00:01:57.719> title<00:01:58.229> updates<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.860> dl<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.219> you

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
that but title updates and dl so you

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.639 
that but title updates and dl so you
always<00:01:59.460> come<00:01:59.790> out<00:01:59.909> on<00:01:59.969> tuesday<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.630> there<00:02:01.409> are

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
always come out on tuesday so there are

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.830 
always come out on tuesday so there are
three<00:02:01.950> possible<00:02:02.369> dates<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:03.000> i<00:02:03.180> think<00:02:03.299> we're

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
three possible dates that i think we're

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.109 
three possible dates that i think we're
going<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.409> see<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.890> 12<00:02:05.219> drop<00:02:05.520> now

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
going to see to you 12 drop now

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.600 
going to see to you 12 drop now
obviously<00:02:06.540> july<00:02:07.320> twenty<00:02:07.740> third<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.129> too<00:02:08.369> soon

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
obviously july twenty third is too soon

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.930 
obviously july twenty third is too soon
because<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.239> hasn't<00:02:09.420> gone<00:02:09.810> into

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
because it hasn't gone into

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.440 
because it hasn't gone into
certification<00:02:11.940> test<00:02:12.180> testing<00:02:13.050> Jesse

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
certification test testing Jesse

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.380 
certification test testing Jesse
but<00:02:13.780> um<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.890> date<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.459> think<00:02:15.790> is<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.120> most

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
but um the date that I think is the most

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.589 
but um the date that I think is the most
likely<00:02:16.930> likely<00:02:17.590> like<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.099> could<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.400> can<00:02:18.670> see<00:02:18.910> 4j

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
likely likely like I could I can see 4j

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.420 
likely likely like I could I can see 4j

weekend<00:02:21.849> and<00:02:22.120> sending<00:02:22.599> it<00:02:22.720> into

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
weekend and sending it into

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.259 
weekend and sending it into
certification<00:02:23.980> on<00:02:24.190> Monday<00:02:24.670> or<00:02:24.879> something

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
certification on Monday or something

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.240 
certification on Monday or something
like<00:02:25.390> that<00:02:25.450> but<00:02:26.170> pretty<00:02:26.410> much<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.830> day<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.190> I

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
like that but pretty much the day that I

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.809 
like that but pretty much the day that I
think<00:02:27.640> is<00:02:27.790> most<00:02:28.209> likely<00:02:28.599> is<00:02:29.370> July<00:02:30.370> thirtieth

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
think is most likely is July thirtieth

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.880 
think is most likely is July thirtieth
in<00:02:31.090> that's<00:02:31.390> because<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:32.470> know<00:02:32.590> it's<00:02:32.800> a

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
in that's because you know it's a

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.640 
in that's because you know it's a

Tuesday it's about 10 or so days away
you<00:02:35.800> know<00:02:36.099> it's<00:02:36.790> being<00:02:37.120> highly<00:02:37.510> optimistic

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
you know it's being highly optimistic

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.650 
you know it's being highly optimistic

but August fifth now August width is

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.330 
but August fifth now August width is
definitely<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.250> possibility<00:03:21.959> but<00:03:22.959> um<00:03:23.739> you<00:03:24.190> know

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
definitely a possibility but um you know

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.250 
definitely a possibility but um you know
if<00:03:24.579> August<00:03:25.030> fifth<00:03:25.269> doesn't<00:03:25.720> work<00:03:25.870> out<00:03:26.079> you

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
and you know if it passes certification

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.569 
and you know if it passes certification
or<00:03:43.480> doesn't<00:03:43.870> pass<00:03:43.959> certification<00:03:44.319> because<00:03:44.859> if

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
or doesn't pass certification because if

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.400

it<00:03:45.730> doesn't<00:03:46.060> pass<00:03:46.180> certification<00:03:46.510> then<00:03:47.109> I<00:03:47.200> can

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
it doesn't pass certification then I can

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.830 
it doesn't pass certification then I can
see<00:03:47.590> it<00:03:47.769> coming<00:03:48.010> out<00:03:48.220> August<00:03:48.639> twelfth<00:03:48.850> or<00:03:49.480> even

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
August nineteenth but I really do think

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.210 
August nineteenth but I really do think
it's<00:03:52.630> going<00:03:52.750> to<00:03:52.840> pass<00:03:52.989> certification<00:03:53.350> so<00:03:53.950> I'm

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
it's going to pass certification so I'm

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.059 
it's going to pass certification so I'm
banking<00:03:54.790> on<00:03:54.970> July<00:03:55.540> thirtieth<00:03:56.019> or<00:03:56.349> August
