be three meals or refeeds and a free
meal<00:02:55.320> which<00:02:55.710> I<00:02:55.860> defined<00:02:56.550> in<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.730> article<00:02:57.120> is

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
meal which I defined in the article is

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.720 
meal which I defined in the article is
really<00:02:57.600> a<00:02:57.780> planned<00:02:58.410> over<00:02:58.950> feeding<00:02:59.220> where<00:02:59.520> you

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
really a planned over feeding where you

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.660 
really a planned over feeding where you
go<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.710> have<00:03:01.710> something<00:03:01.950> off<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.220> your<00:03:02.430> diet

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
go and have something off of your diet

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.010 
go and have something off of your diet
and<00:03:03.830> don't<00:03:04.830> account<00:03:05.130> for<00:03:05.310> your<00:03:05.370> macros<00:03:05.940> so<00:03:06.300> you

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
and don't account for your macros so you

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.560 
and don't account for your macros so you
know<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.170> don't<00:03:07.380> try<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.560> fit<00:03:07.860> in<00:03:08.010> other<00:03:08.190> foods

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
know you don't try to fit in other foods

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.000 
know you don't try to fit in other foods
because<00:03:09.570> it's<00:03:10.050> really<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.650> psychological

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
because it's really a psychological

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.340 
because it's really a psychological
break<00:03:11.610> from<00:03:11.790> dieting<00:03:12.270> and<00:03:12.450> there<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.320> a

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
break from dieting and there is a

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.370 
break from dieting and there is a
benefit<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:13.950> that<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:15.630> I<00:03:15.690> feel<00:03:16.050> like<00:03:16.200> there's

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
benefit to that and I feel like there's

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.140 
benefit to that and I feel like there's
more<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.680> a<00:03:16.770> psychological<00:03:17.220> benefit<00:03:17.970> for

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
more of a psychological benefit for

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.699 
more of a psychological benefit for
having<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.480> free<00:03:18.750> meal<00:03:18.959> than<00:03:19.290> any

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
having a free meal than any

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.449 
having a free meal than any
physiological<00:03:20.400> benefit<00:03:21.270> to<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:22.020> I<00:03:22.950> like

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
physiological benefit to it and I like

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.540 
physiological benefit to it and I like
incorporating<00:03:23.880> them<00:03:24.390> really<00:03:25.380> just<00:03:25.650> through

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
incorporating them really just through

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.940

to make progress so there's no reason to
start<00:04:29.280> off<00:04:29.490> with<00:04:29.669> a<00:04:29.760> stricter<00:04:30.150> diet<00:04:30.389> and<00:04:30.690> do

start off with a stricter diet and do
refeeds<00:04:32.190> when<00:04:32.520> you<00:04:33.060> know<00:04:33.180> just<00:04:33.389> taking<00:04:33.720> a

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
refeeds when you know just taking a

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.390 
refeeds when you know just taking a
little<00:04:34.110> bit<00:04:34.260> of<00:04:34.320> a<00:04:34.440> deficit<00:04:34.889> it's<00:04:35.039> gonna<00:04:35.190> go<00:04:35.370> a

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
little bit of a deficit it's gonna go a

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.200 
little bit of a deficit it's gonna go a
long<00:04:35.610> way<00:04:35.850> so<00:04:36.780> a<00:04:37.139> refeed<00:04:37.620> where<00:04:38.430> you<00:04:39.120> know

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
long way so a refeed where you know

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.390 
long way so a refeed where you know
maybe<00:04:39.389> so<00:04:39.780> I'll<00:04:39.930> have<00:04:40.050> someone<00:04:40.229> a<00:04:40.740> diet<00:04:41.100> where

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
maybe so I'll have someone a diet where

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.820 
maybe so I'll have someone a diet where
and<00:04:42.030> maybe<00:04:42.240> only<00:04:42.510> getting<00:04:42.750> 150<00:04:43.530> grams<00:04:43.710> of

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
and maybe only getting 150 grams of

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.680 
and maybe only getting 150 grams of
carbs<00:04:44.130> a<00:04:44.220> day<00:04:44.250> or<00:04:44.639> something<00:04:44.850> like<00:04:45.000> that<00:04:45.120> and

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
carbs a day or something like that and

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.560 
carbs a day or something like that and
maybe<00:04:46.440> once<00:04:46.710> or<00:04:46.800> twice<00:04:46.860> a<00:04:47.070> week<00:04:47.190> I'll<00:04:47.669> drop<00:04:48.360> the

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
maybe once or twice a week I'll drop the

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.000 
maybe once or twice a week I'll drop the
fats<00:04:48.810> a<00:04:48.960> little<00:04:49.139> bit<00:04:49.289> maybe<00:04:49.500> even<00:04:49.710> drop<00:04:49.889> the

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
fats a little bit maybe even drop the

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.350 
fats a little bit maybe even drop the
proteins<00:04:50.460> a<00:04:50.550> little<00:04:51.090> bit<00:04:51.240> because

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
proteins a little bit because

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.270 
proteins a little bit because
carbohydrates<00:04:52.080> are<00:04:52.199> protein<00:04:52.560> sparing<00:04:52.800> and

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
carbohydrates are protein sparing and

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.730 
carbohydrates are protein sparing and
then<00:04:53.460> jump<00:04:53.849> carbs<00:04:54.330> up<00:04:54.479> to<00:04:54.599> you<00:04:54.780> know<00:04:54.870> 20<00:04:55.169> 50<00:04:55.380> 300

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
then jump carbs up to you know 20 50 300

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.250 
then jump carbs up to you know 20 50 300
grams<00:04:55.949> or<00:04:56.160> something<00:04:56.430> like<00:04:56.520> that<00:04:56.580> so<00:04:57.419> you<00:04:58.169> know

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
grams or something like that so you know

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.900 
grams or something like that so you know
and<00:04:58.349> it<00:04:58.440> gives<00:04:58.590> people<00:04:58.650> a<00:04:58.860> lot<00:04:59.010> of<00:04:59.099> more<00:04:59.340> you

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
and it gives people a lot of more you

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.270 
and it gives people a lot of more you
know<00:05:00.000> flexibility<00:05:00.750> whereas<00:05:01.710> when<00:05:02.190> you're

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
know flexibility whereas when you're

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.460 
know flexibility whereas when you're
only<00:05:02.400> getting<00:05:02.810> 150<00:05:03.810> grams<00:05:04.020> of<00:05:04.110> carbs<00:05:04.349> a<00:05:04.440> day

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
only getting 150 grams of carbs a day

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.870 
only getting 150 grams of carbs a day
you're<00:05:04.800> not<00:05:04.979> really<00:05:05.250> you're<00:05:05.610> gonna<00:05:05.729> be

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
you're not really you're gonna be

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.330 
you're not really you're gonna be
sticking<00:05:06.210> to<00:05:06.240> mostly<00:05:06.870> clean<00:05:07.590> sources<00:05:08.010> you're

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
sticking to mostly clean sources you're

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.370 
sticking to mostly clean sources you're
mean<00:05:08.490> you<00:05:09.120> know<00:05:09.240> you're<00:05:09.990> not<00:05:10.050> gonna<00:05:10.199> build<00:05:10.320> a

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
mean you know you're not gonna build a

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.050 
mean you know you're not gonna build a
fit<00:05:10.560> align<00:05:10.770> them<00:05:10.919> to<00:05:10.949> that<00:05:11.160> but<00:05:11.340> then<00:05:11.460> a<00:05:11.490> refeed

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
fit align them to that but then a refeed

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.640 
fit align them to that but then a refeed
when<00:05:12.270> you<00:05:12.330> have<00:05:12.449> 300<00:05:12.900> grams<00:05:13.110> there's<00:05:13.440> a<00:05:13.470> lot

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
when you have 300 grams there's a lot

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.540 
when you have 300 grams there's a lot
you<00:05:13.800> can<00:05:13.919> do<00:05:14.070> with<00:05:14.160> that

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
you can do with that

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.850 
you can do with that
so<00:05:14.990> refeeds<00:05:15.990> controlled<00:05:16.560> structure

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
so refeeds controlled structure

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.980 
so refeeds controlled structure
definitely<00:05:17.460> take<00:05:17.639> a<00:05:17.669> look<00:05:17.849> at<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.510> article<00:05:18.930> I
