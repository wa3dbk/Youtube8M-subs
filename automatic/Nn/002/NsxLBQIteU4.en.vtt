00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
like water glitch wonderful hundred

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.390 
like water glitch wonderful hundred
codes<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.990> know<00:00:22.109> it's<00:00:22.590> that's<00:00:23.010> how<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.310> got

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
codes you know it's that's how it got

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.950 
codes you know it's that's how it got
the<00:00:23.580> foggy<00:00:23.760> effect<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.300> all<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.510> stuff<00:00:24.689> and

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
the foggy effect and all that stuff and

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.810 
the foggy effect and all that stuff and
it's<00:00:25.619> basically<00:00:25.890> just<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.160> bunch<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.369> trees<00:00:26.580> and

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
it's basically just a bunch of trees and

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.460 
it's basically just a bunch of trees and
bunch<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.119> rocks<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.840> think<00:00:28.080> it's<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.410> think

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
bunch of rocks and I think it's I think

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.929 
bunch of rocks and I think it's I think
it's<00:00:28.650> modded<00:00:28.980> because<00:00:29.130> there's<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.400> bunch<00:00:29.609> and

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
it's modded because there's a bunch and

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.849 
it's modded because there's a bunch and
this<00:00:30.240> map<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.420> huge<00:00:30.960> but<00:00:31.380> it's<00:00:31.560> like<00:00:31.710> it's

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
this map is huge but it's like it's

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.590 
this map is huge but it's like it's
super<00:00:32.130> suspenseful<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.239> know<00:00:33.360> it's

basically the same as any other

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.459 
basically the same as any other
Slenderman<00:00:35.579> map<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.510> there<00:00:36.690> were<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.840> ton<00:00:37.200> once

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
Slenderman map and there were a ton once

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.290 
Slenderman map and there were a ton once
we<00:00:37.620> did<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.040> underwater<00:00:38.370> map<00:00:38.670> everyone<00:00:39.120> knew

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
we did this underwater map everyone knew

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.729 
we did this underwater map everyone knew
they<00:00:39.540> were<00:00:39.600> gonna<00:00:39.719> be<00:00:39.809> slender<00:00:40.110> maps<00:00:40.440> coming

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
they were gonna be slender maps coming

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.440 
they were gonna be slender maps coming
out<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.100> course<00:00:41.129> there<00:00:41.520> were<00:00:41.670> but<00:00:42.300> there

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450
