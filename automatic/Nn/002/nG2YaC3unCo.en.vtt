00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
a database so let's go ahead and make

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.550 
a database so let's go ahead and make
that<00:02:42.610> database<00:02:43.000> first<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.660> also<00:02:44.080> we<00:02:44.350> need<00:02:44.500> to

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
that database first and also we need to

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.560 
that database first and also we need to
make<00:02:44.770> a<00:02:44.800> user<00:02:45.160> that<00:02:45.820> can<00:02:45.970> access<00:02:46.180> that

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
make a user that can access that

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.500 
make a user that can access that

to generate a random password copy I've

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.290 
to generate a random password copy I've
copied<00:04:00.180> this<00:04:00.450> in<00:04:00.600> a<00:04:00.690> safe<00:04:00.870> place<00:04:01.080> use<00:04:01.680> password

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.969 
tutorial and that's my config file and
this<00:05:48.690> is<00:05:48.900> basically<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:49.410> file<00:05:49.740> that

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
this is basically the file that

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:51.439 
this is basically the file that
establishes<00:05:50.700> a<00:05:50.729> connect

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449 
establishes a connect

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.619 
establishes a connect
in<00:05:51.569> to<00:05:52.229> the<00:05:52.529> database<00:05:53.009> so<00:05:53.669> this<00:05:54.029> is<00:05:54.330> how<00:05:54.569> you

00:05:54.619 --> 00:05:54.629 
in to the database so this is how you

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:59.390 
in to the database so this is how you
make<00:05:54.870> that<00:05:56.240> of<00:05:57.240> course<00:05:57.719> it's<00:05:57.900> a<00:05:57.990> PHP<00:05:58.289> file<00:05:58.740> and

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
make that of course it's a PHP file and

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.709 
make that of course it's a PHP file and
you<00:05:59.460> guys<00:05:59.610> probably<00:05:59.879> have<00:06:00.029> done<00:06:00.300> this<00:06:00.449> up

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:00.719 
you guys probably have done this up

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:03.409 
you guys probably have done this up
plenty<00:06:01.080> of<00:06:01.259> times<00:06:01.319> before<00:06:01.620> but<00:06:02.069> you<00:06:02.550> know<00:06:02.669> for

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
plenty of times before but you know for

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:06.170 
plenty of times before but you know for
anyone<00:06:03.719> who<00:06:04.009> this<00:06:05.009> is<00:06:05.189> how<00:06:05.339> you<00:06:05.400> properly<00:06:05.729> set

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
anyone who this is how you properly set

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.820 
anyone who this is how you properly set
it<00:06:06.300> up<00:06:06.419> even<00:06:06.719> if<00:06:06.839> you've<00:06:06.990> done<00:06:07.169> it<00:06:07.319> before<00:06:07.439> then

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
it up even if you've done it before then

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.049 
it up even if you've done it before then
it's<00:06:08.309> good<00:06:08.460> to<00:06:08.550> watch<00:06:10.550> so<00:06:11.550> the<00:06:11.699> first<00:06:11.879> thing

00:06:12.049 --> 00:06:12.059 
it's good to watch so the first thing

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:15.379 
it's good to watch so the first thing
you<00:06:12.150> want<00:06:12.330> to<00:06:12.389> do<00:06:12.569> is<00:06:12.839> define<00:06:13.379> a<00:06:14.240> couple<00:06:15.240> things

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:15.389 
you want to do is define a couple things

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:20.839 
you want to do is define a couple things
actually<00:06:15.689> the<00:06:16.439> first<00:06:16.710> thing<00:06:16.919> is<00:06:19.279> DB<00:06:20.279> host<00:06:20.550> and

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:20.849 
actually the first thing is DB host and

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:24.529 
actually the first thing is DB host and
this<00:06:21.120> is<00:06:21.300> just<00:06:21.569> a<00:06:21.689> local<00:06:22.050> host<00:06:22.229> and<00:06:23.539> anytime

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 
this is just a local host and anytime

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:26.629 
this is just a local host and anytime
you<00:06:25.259> have<00:06:25.439> a<00:06:25.469> script<00:06:25.919> and<00:06:26.069> it's<00:06:26.219> just<00:06:26.400> running

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 
you have a script and it's just running

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:30.050 
you have a script and it's just running
locally<00:06:27.389> on<00:06:27.509> the<00:06:27.839> server<00:06:28.080> because<00:06:28.499> this<00:06:29.069> PHP

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
locally on the server because this PHP

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.429 
locally on the server because this PHP
file<00:06:30.419> it's<00:06:30.689> not<00:06:30.870> going<00:06:31.020> to<00:06:31.080> run<00:06:31.259> on<00:06:31.409> your

00:06:31.429 --> 00:06:31.439 
file it's not going to run on your

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:33.110 
file it's not going to run on your
computer<00:06:31.650> it's<00:06:32.219> going<00:06:32.339> to<00:06:32.400> run<00:06:32.550> on<00:06:32.759> the<00:06:32.879> server

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
computer it's going to run on the server

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.390 
computer it's going to run on the server
and<00:06:33.659> of<00:06:33.810> course<00:06:34.020> our<00:06:34.229> database<00:06:34.710> is<00:06:34.919> also<00:06:35.129> on

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
and of course our database is also on

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.579 
and of course our database is also on
that<00:06:35.430> server<00:06:35.789> so<00:06:36.360> that's<00:06:36.569> why<00:06:36.810> you<00:06:36.870> can<00:06:37.289> type

00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:37.589 
that server so that's why you can type

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:40.159 
that server so that's why you can type
localhost<00:06:37.949> and<00:06:38.490> set<00:06:38.999> up<00:06:39.120> specifying<00:06:39.719> you<00:06:40.080> know

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:40.169 
localhost and set up specifying you know

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:42.920 
localhost and set up specifying you know
the<00:06:40.319> IP<00:06:40.499> address<00:06:41.069> of<00:06:41.219> the<00:06:41.370> server<00:06:41.599> so<00:06:42.599> we're

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930 
the IP address of the server so we're

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.300 
the IP address of the server so we're
actually<00:06:43.050> going<00:06:43.319> to<00:06:43.379> wanted<00:06:43.649> to<00:06:43.710> define<00:06:43.979> three

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.310 
actually going to wanted to define three

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.019 
actually going to wanted to define three
more<00:06:44.490> things<00:06:44.699> 1<00:06:45.479> 2<00:06:46.080> 3<00:06:46.770> so<00:06:47.430> we<00:06:47.550> have<00:06:47.580> the<00:06:47.819> host

00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:48.029 
more things 1 2 3 so we have the host

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:50.239 
more things 1 2 3 so we have the host
which<00:06:48.539> pretty<00:06:48.810> much<00:06:48.899> says<00:06:49.229> what<00:06:49.710> server<00:06:50.009> do

00:06:50.239 --> 00:06:50.249 
which pretty much says what server do

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:51.619 
which pretty much says what server do
you<00:06:50.339> want<00:06:50.490> to<00:06:50.550> connect<00:06:50.819> to<00:06:50.849> well<00:06:51.210> the<00:06:51.419> same

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:51.629 
you want to connect to well the same

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:54.350 
you want to connect to well the same
server<00:06:51.870> that<00:06:52.199> our<00:06:52.379> PHP<00:06:52.979> files<00:06:53.219> on<00:06:53.490> and<00:06:53.759> the

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
server that our PHP files on and the

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.790 
server that our PHP files on and the
next<00:06:54.479> thing<00:06:54.719> that<00:06:54.749> you<00:06:55.020> want<00:06:55.199> to<00:06:55.319> do<00:06:55.409> is<00:06:55.620> you

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
next thing that you want to do is you

next thing that you want to do is you
want<00:06:55.979> to<00:06:56.039> define<00:06:56.460> a<00:06:56.759> user<00:06:57.210> and<00:06:57.770> that's<00:06:58.770> just

00:06:58.999 --> 00:06:59.009 
want to define a user and that's just

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:35.459 
our config file is set up the only other

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:38.059 
our config file is set up the only other
thing<00:07:35.759> that<00:07:35.789> we<00:07:36.029> have<00:07:36.060> to<00:07:36.240> do<00:07:36.509> is<00:07:36.740> we<00:07:37.740> need<00:07:38.009> to

00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:38.069 
thing that we have to do is we need to

00:07:38.069 --> 00:07:41.629 
thing that we have to do is we need to
make<00:07:38.520> a<00:07:38.729> table<00:07:39.089> in<00:07:39.539> the<00:07:39.779> database<00:07:39.930> so<00:07:40.919> that<00:07:40.949> you

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 
make a table in the database so that you

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:44.409 
make a table in the database so that you
know<00:07:41.729> whenever<00:07:41.939> we're<00:07:42.270> typing<00:07:42.449> messages<00:07:43.110> of

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:44.419 
know whenever we're typing messages of

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:46.969 
know whenever we're typing messages of
course<00:07:45.419> these<00:07:45.719> have<00:07:46.080> to<00:07:46.199> be<00:07:46.229> stored<00:07:46.589> in<00:07:46.830> the

00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:46.979 
course these have to be stored in the

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:49.699 
course these have to be stored in the
table<00:07:47.189> inside<00:07:47.999> your<00:07:48.389> database<00:07:48.870> so<00:07:49.499> that's

00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:49.709 
table inside your database so that's

00:07:49.709 --> 00:07:51.019 
table inside your database so that's
where<00:07:49.919> we're<00:07:50.039> going<00:07:50.069> to<00:07:50.219> be<00:07:50.370> doing<00:07:50.580> in<00:07:50.879> the

00:07:51.019 --> 00:07:51.029 
where we're going to be doing in the
