00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
what is this this oh this is the spawner

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.050 
what is this this oh this is the spawner
retriever<00:00:23.029> 9000<00:00:24.529> yeah<00:00:25.529> uh<00:00:25.890> now<00:00:26.760> that's<00:00:26.939> to

retriever 9000 yeah uh now that's to

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.689 
retriever 9000 yeah uh now that's to
play<00:00:27.180> che<00:00:27.390> 38<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> half<00:00:28.369> okay<00:00:29.369> we<00:00:29.490> haven't

actually made this yet um its purchase

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.549 
actually made this yet um its purchase
let's<00:00:34.860> start<00:00:34.920> down<00:00:35.160> here<00:00:35.190> anyway<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.030> yeah<00:00:36.180> and

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
let's start down here anyway so yeah and

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.200 
let's start down here anyway so yeah and
we<00:00:37.559> probably<00:00:37.770> hear<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.100> rest<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.489> can<00:00:38.879> do

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
we probably hear the rest of it can do

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.840 
we probably hear the rest of it can do
hold<00:00:39.629> on<00:00:40.070> makeup<00:00:41.070> stop<00:00:41.480> and<00:00:42.480> stop<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.590> okay<00:00:43.850> go

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
hold on makeup stop and stop it okay go

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.760 
hold on makeup stop and stop it okay go
back<00:00:44.969> up<00:00:46.190> there<00:00:47.190> goes<00:00:47.399> all<00:00:47.940> right<00:00:48.000> here<00:00:48.899> shoot

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
back up there goes all right here shoot

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.740 
back up there goes all right here shoot
aha<00:00:54.350> so<00:00:55.350> basically<00:00:55.969> what<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.090> do<00:00:57.239> with<00:00:57.510> this

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
aha so basically what you do with this

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.450 
aha so basically what you do with this
is<00:00:58.079> whenever<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.710> find<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.100> spawner<00:01:00.350> you<00:01:01.430> dig<00:01:02.430> a

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
is whenever you find a spawner you dig a

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.340 
is whenever you find a spawner you dig a
hole<00:01:02.699> straight<00:01:03.120> up<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> surface<00:01:03.750> right

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
hole straight up to the surface right

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:12.109 
hole straight up to the surface right
above<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.890> spawner<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:09.840> then<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.640> fly<00:01:12.060> this

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
above the spawner and then you fly this

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.359 
above the spawner and then you fly this
mechanism<00:01:12.720> over<00:01:13.110> or<00:01:13.260> I'm<00:01:13.740> playing<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.100> getting

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
mechanism over or I'm playing on getting

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.270 
mechanism over or I'm playing on getting
it<00:01:14.490> right<00:01:14.790> now<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.659> bunch<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.470> this

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
it right now it's just a bunch of this

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.539 
it right now it's just a bunch of this
stuff<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.720> point<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.170> we're<00:01:20.130> pulling<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.400> going

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
stuff but point is we're pulling I going

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.800 
stuff but point is we're pulling I going
to<00:01:20.610> get<00:01:20.700> computer<00:01:21.090> control<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.600> point

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
to get computer control to the point

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.660 
to get computer control to the point
where<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.380> enter<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.860> coordinates<00:01:23.520> of

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
where I can enter in the coordinates of

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.730 
where I can enter in the coordinates of
a<00:01:23.880> spawner<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.750> will<00:01:24.869> just<00:01:25.049> go<00:01:25.229> fetch<00:01:25.560> it

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
a spawner and it will just go fetch it

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.080 
a spawner and it will just go fetch it
assuming<00:01:26.100> we've<00:01:26.189> already<00:01:26.280> dug<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.939> hole

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
assuming we've already dug the hole

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.600 
assuming we've already dug the hole
straight<00:01:27.390> down<00:01:27.680> and<00:01:28.680> assuming<00:01:29.490> you're

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
straight down and assuming you're

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.130 
straight down and assuming you're
starting<00:01:29.939> from<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.240> sky<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.479> no<00:01:30.780> there's<00:01:31.020> not

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
starting from the sky and no there's not

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.620 
starting from the sky and no there's not
any<00:01:31.350> major<00:01:31.950> obstacles<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.759> path<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:33.210> mean

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
any major obstacles in the path I mean

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.219 
any major obstacles in the path I mean
it<00:01:33.689> won't<00:01:33.840> break<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.470> but<00:01:35.040> yeah<00:01:35.880> yeah<00:01:36.630> you

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
it won't break it but yeah yeah you

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.600 
it won't break it but yeah yeah you
should<00:01:37.380> also<00:01:37.500> probably<00:01:37.799> include<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.310> counter

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
should also probably include a counter

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.090 
should also probably include a counter
to<00:01:38.640> make<00:01:38.850> sure<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.720> arm<00:01:40.140> here<00:01:40.740> doesn't

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
to make sure that the arm here doesn't

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.160 
to make sure that the arm here doesn't
break<00:01:41.640> yeah<00:01:42.000> again<00:01:42.210> that's<00:01:42.420> that's<00:01:42.960> going<00:01:43.110> to

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
break yeah again that's that's going to

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.539 
break yeah again that's that's going to
be<00:01:43.229> part<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> programming<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.310> I'm

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
be part of the programming that I'm

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.149 
be part of the programming that I'm
going<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.700> make<00:01:44.880> for<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.210> thing<00:01:45.450> but<00:01:45.630> uh

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
going to make for this thing but uh

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.590 
going to make for this thing but uh

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
replication and put it back down so easy

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.690 
replication and put it back down so easy
well<00:02:30.840> not<00:02:31.020> really<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.500> mean<00:02:31.650> once<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.370> want<00:02:32.580> to

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
well not really I mean once you want to

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.580 
well not really I mean once you want to
actually<00:02:32.910> drop<00:02:33.390> this<00:02:33.630> bond<00:02:33.870> or<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.230> kind<00:02:34.500> of

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
actually drop this bond or you kind of

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.400 
actually drop this bond or you kind of
have<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.830> like<00:02:35.720> have<00:02:36.720> your<00:02:36.900> own<00:02:37.050> separate

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
have to like have your own separate

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.510 
have to like have your own separate
mechanism<00:02:37.980> for<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:39.260> much<00:02:40.260> like<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:41.010> panic

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
mechanism for it much like this panic

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.540 
mechanism for it much like this panic
you'd<00:02:42.360> have<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.600> break<00:02:42.990> some<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.590> these<00:02:43.710> or<00:02:44.370> you

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
you'd have to break some of these or you

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.510 
you'd have to break some of these or you
would<00:02:44.670> have<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.970> have<00:02:45.000> another<00:02:45.330> frame<00:02:45.750> pull<00:02:46.260> it

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
would have to have another frame pull it

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.390 
would have to have another frame pull it
yet<00:02:47.520> so<00:02:48.110> probably<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.500> best<00:02:49.830> way<00:02:50.100> would<00:02:50.250> be<00:02:50.310> to

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
yet so probably the best way would be to

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.990 
yet so probably the best way would be to
break<00:02:50.820> this<00:02:51.030> fat<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:54.110> yeah<00:02:55.520> it's<00:02:56.520> not<00:02:56.700> really

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
break this fat and yeah it's not really

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.390 
break this fat and yeah it's not really
a<00:02:57.030> big<00:02:57.090> house<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.870> those<00:02:58.110> expect<00:02:59.540> well<00:03:00.540> then

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
a big house of those expect well then

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.980 
a big house of those expect well then
we're<00:03:02.400> done<00:03:02.520> here<00:03:02.730> we're<00:03:03.090> good<00:03:03.360> at<00:03:03.510> redstone

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
aren't we guys might want to stop that

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.760
