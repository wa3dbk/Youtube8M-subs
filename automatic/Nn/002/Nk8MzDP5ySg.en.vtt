00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
these right now so this engineered mesh

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.429 
these right now so this engineered mesh
is<00:01:30.210> kind<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.479> interesting<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.930> has<00:01:31.049> kind<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.320> a

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
is kind of interesting it has kind of a

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.920 
is kind of interesting it has kind of a
cool<00:01:31.619> little<00:01:32.369> design<00:01:32.610> kind<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.360> interesting

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
cool little design kind of interesting

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.249 
cool little design kind of interesting
but<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:35.100> like<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:36.000> don't<00:01:36.689> know<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:37.049> not

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
but just like I don't know it's not

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.569 
but just like I don't know it's not
something<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.799> would<00:01:37.950> have<00:01:37.979> ever<00:01:38.159> done<00:01:38.369> like

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
something I would have ever done like

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.039 
something I would have ever done like
hey<00:01:38.880> that's<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.180> really<00:01:39.360> cool<00:01:39.509> design<00:01:39.720> or<00:01:40.020> a

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
hey that's a really cool design or a

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.710 
hey that's a really cool design or a
really<00:01:40.320> cool<00:01:40.530> upper<00:01:41.189> but<00:01:41.759> for<00:01:42.150> some<00:01:42.329> reason<00:01:42.630> it

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
really cool upper but for some reason it

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.300 
really cool upper but for some reason it
just<00:01:42.750> works<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.439> can<00:01:43.590> see<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.829> very<00:01:44.130> gates

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
just works and you can see it very gates

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.789 
just works and you can see it very gates
from<00:01:44.490> white<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.970> then<00:01:45.390> goes<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.840> back<00:01:46.530> of

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
from white and then goes to the back of

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.429 
from white and then goes to the back of
the<00:01:46.979> shoe<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.399> actually<00:01:47.720> goes<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:49.170> fades

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
the shoe and it actually goes in fades

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.920 
the shoe and it actually goes in fades
to<00:01:49.619> blue<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.270> there's<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.329> bunch<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.630> just

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
to blue and there's a bunch of just

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.260 
to blue and there's a bunch of just
patterns<00:01:52.350> across<00:01:52.619> get<00:01:53.430> gold<00:01:53.670> accents<00:01:54.119> with<00:01:54.240> a

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
patterns across get gold accents with a

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.230 
patterns across get gold accents with a
Nike<00:01:54.509> swoosh<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:56.130> Kobe<00:01:56.640> logo<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.149> the

with a kobe logo again and then you have
kind<00:02:19.530> of<00:02:19.560> like<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.740> it's<00:02:20.370> not

I<00:02:20.820> don't<00:02:21.060> want<00:02:21.180> see<00:02:21.300> it's<00:02:21.420> leather<00:02:21.600> but<00:02:21.870> it's

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
I don't want see it's leather but it's

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.670 
I don't want see it's leather but it's
like<00:02:22.490> soft<00:02:23.720> maybe<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.870> is<00:02:24.960> leather<00:02:25.140> on<00:02:25.530> the

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
like soft maybe it is leather on the

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.620 
like soft maybe it is leather on the
back<00:02:25.860> tab<00:02:26.520> area<00:02:26.970> right<00:02:27.150> there<00:02:27.300> it's<00:02:27.480> pretty

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
back tab area right there it's pretty

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.680 
back tab area right there it's pretty
nice<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:29.760> tongue<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:29.970> made<00:02:30.270> of<00:02:30.390> kind<00:02:30.660> of

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
nice and the tongue is made of kind of

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.440 
nice and the tongue is made of kind of
the<00:02:30.780> same<00:02:30.960> type<00:02:31.800> of<00:02:31.830> synthetic<00:02:32.730> materials<00:02:33.210> I'm

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
the same type of synthetic materials I'm

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.510 
the same type of synthetic materials I'm
pretty<00:02:33.930> sure<00:02:34.050> it's<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.230> synthetic<00:02:34.500> mesh<00:02:35.250> tongue

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
pretty sure it's a synthetic mesh tongue

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.820 
pretty sure it's a synthetic mesh tongue
underneath<00:02:35.910> here<00:02:36.270> and<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:37.230> engineered<00:02:37.650> mesh

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
underneath here and the engineered mesh

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.220 
underneath here and the engineered mesh
across<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.280> entire<00:02:38.520> upper<00:02:38.850> so<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.840> Kobe<00:02:40.080> nine

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
across the entire upper so the Kobe nine

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.900 
across the entire upper so the Kobe nine
was<00:02:40.380> is<00:02:40.650> an<00:02:40.800> interesting<00:02:41.040> model<00:02:41.430> because<00:02:41.580> you

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
was is an interesting model because you

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.880 
was is an interesting model because you
had<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.210> engineered<00:02:42.600> mesh<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.140> then<00:02:43.770> you

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
had the engineered mesh and then you

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.750 
had the engineered mesh and then you
have<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.430> via<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:46.320> other<00:02:46.500> ones<00:02:46.740> with<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.100> fly

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
have the via the other ones with the fly

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.670 
have the via the other ones with the fly
wire<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.240> whatnot<00:02:48.690> for<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.990> elites<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.560> then

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
wire and whatnot for the elites and then

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.130 
wire and whatnot for the elites and then
the<00:02:49.770> elite<00:02:50.130> lows<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:51.510> there's<00:02:51.750> just<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.050> much

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
the elite lows and there's just so much

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.620 
the elite lows and there's just so much
variation<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.860> it<00:02:52.980> but<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:54.210> Kobe<00:02:54.450> nines

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
variation to it but the the Kobe nines

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.840 
variation to it but the the Kobe nines
are<00:02:54.750> extremely<00:02:55.110> comfortable<00:02:55.490> if<00:02:56.490> you<00:02:56.640> haven't

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
are extremely comfortable if you haven't

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.100 
are extremely comfortable if you haven't
tried<00:02:56.940> ammonia<00:02:57.360> need<00:02:57.570> to<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.780> mean<00:02:57.900> they're

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
tried ammonia need to I mean they're

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.840 
tried ammonia need to I mean they're
really<00:02:58.260> quite<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:58.950> comfortable<00:02:59.220> shoe<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.580> don't

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
really quite a comfortable shoe I don't

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.520 
really quite a comfortable shoe I don't
have<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.000> period<00:03:00.180> of<00:03:00.300> elites<00:03:00.630> yet<00:03:00.840> what<00:03:00.990> I<00:03:01.020> do<00:03:01.110> I

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
have a period of elites yet what I do I

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.290 
have a period of elites yet what I do I
will<00:03:02.130> do<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.460> comparison<00:03:02.820> video<00:03:03.060> because<00:03:03.210> they

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
will do a comparison video because they

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.730 
will do a comparison video because they
are<00:03:03.420> different<00:03:03.660> actually<00:03:03.990> the<00:03:04.080> back<00:03:04.230> tab<00:03:04.440> here

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
are different actually the back tab here

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.990 
are different actually the back tab here
is<00:03:04.860> actually<00:03:05.130> different<00:03:05.280> on<00:03:05.490> the<00:03:05.580> elites<00:03:05.820> than

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
is actually different on the elites than

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.490 
is actually different on the elites than
it<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.180> on<00:03:06.210> the<00:03:06.420> regulars<00:03:06.750> which<00:03:07.170> I<00:03:07.260> didn't

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
it is on the regulars which I didn't
