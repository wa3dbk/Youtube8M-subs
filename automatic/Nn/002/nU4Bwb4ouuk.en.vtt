 do not forget to activate the 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.470
 function to men because the textbooks

 indicates that ozone serves to neutralize 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.120
 bacteria on the leather 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.370
 haired 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.050
 which will avoid inconveniences such as 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.050
 film on the scalp 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.860
 put your circle for a lot 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.930
 do you install those helmets and 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.390
 sealed fear gently massage 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.770
 your scalp 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.300
 Well, it may seem that it was 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.000
 already time to taste then I have 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.710
 chose to eat it my little meal and 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.380
 after streaking on the phone 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:42.910
 rest of the time after a few 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.040
 minutes I realize that water 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.450
 begins to dribble from my forehead and 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.050
 it's all because I forgot to 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.050
 put a headband 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.459
 after about ten minutes I 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.780
 realize that my hair 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.819
 backs are not enough 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.220
 moisturize and so I'm looking for a 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.360
 best position to be able to 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.250
 achieve dynamic hair 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.170
 well you have to be very careful because 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.580
 that the helmet is not stable especially 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:14.650
 to not get burned after several 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.600
 uses I will share with you my 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.979
 feelings about this device the 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.200
 big positive point it's still who 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.780
 allows to do a deep care in 20 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.060
 minutes top chrono 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.040
 and then that really steam because 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.419
 I believe in the power of the 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.100
 steam it can lift the 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.940
 cuticles for by a deep care 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.680
 now still the negative point 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.720
 it is that the device is not adjustable 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.150
 in height so you really have to find 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.120
 its position before lighting it of course 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.910
 to avoid getting burned and second point 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.580
 negative the hair that's so am on 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.330
 the neck really have a hard time being 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.729
 reached by steam 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.090
 so that's really the downside of this 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.090
 apparatus 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.790
 find all the information under the video 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.280

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:04.310
 can you get this helmet I hope
