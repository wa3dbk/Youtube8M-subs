00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 frost of the sun no visibility limited 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.220
 it would seem necessary to be doubly 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.280
 attentive especially on rail 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.280
 move 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:17.559
 but in these conditions some drivers 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.559
 manage to slip on red 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.990
 that i broke moved on prohibiting 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.470
 traffic signal through the train moving 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:31.180
 have seen that the red light does not light up 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:34.700
 noticed how are you so careless 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.830
 moved we drop work is full and 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.809
 trapping thousands of people at work 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.239
 everybody is late with the idea but it's not 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.020
 expose your and others' lives 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.020
 danger 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.660
 another violator admit his guilt 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.910
 this driver refuses 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.700
 accordingly, realizing that behind me 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.920
 moving vehicle and not 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.750
 I need to temporarily stop me 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.010
 I realized that I do not have time to do 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.620
 i'm becoming anyway on the barriers and 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.520
 accordingly you must rewrite before 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.710
 accordingly it was decided 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.150
 move on, the time has come 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.690
 video analysis 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.730
 have rams talking about and here's our axis barrier 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.340
 how many meters there are hunger barrier 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.729
 well again how many despite 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.640
 violation obviously means or fine 1000 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.820
 rubles or deprivation of rights from 3 to 6 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.820
 months 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:48.380
 I have no words to say 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.600
 I agree neither lupus before me that 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.550
 want to do next then he is somewhat 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.130
 changing but I did not see either red 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.260
 barrier furniture and because the car 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.680
 stream that's how they got before it 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.690
 everything is close you understand well and who do you 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.400
 it interferes with this direct duty 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.440
 the driver watch the signs and 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.520
 traffic lights and distance between 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.819
 by cars 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.549
 especially on 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.590
 at a road crossing remember brake 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.590
 the track is almost 800 meters
