00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
this is just a nice kind of light but

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.460 
this is just a nice kind of light but
moisturizing<00:05:08.160> to<00:05:09.160> an<00:05:09.250> extent<00:05:09.730> body<00:05:10.210> lotion<00:05:10.780> so

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
moisturizing to an extent body lotion so

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.320 
moisturizing to an extent body lotion so
and<00:05:11.830> I<00:05:11.890> love<00:05:12.070> the<00:05:12.190> packaging<00:05:12.370> and<00:05:12.760> it's<00:05:12.880> purple

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
and I love the packaging and it's purple

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.230 
and I love the packaging and it's purple
and<00:05:14.040> then<00:05:15.040> I<00:05:15.310> brought<00:05:15.490> this<00:05:15.760> out<00:05:15.970> as<00:05:16.210> a

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
and then I brought this out as a

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.410 
and then I brought this out as a
purplish<00:05:16.900> too<00:05:17.350> and<00:05:17.710> it's<00:05:18.070> taffetas<00:05:18.640> rose<00:05:19.030> I

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
purplish too and it's taffetas rose I

purplish too and it's taffetas rose I
guess<00:05:20.080> this<00:05:20.290> could<00:05:20.500> go<00:05:20.680> in<00:05:20.830> between<00:05:21.010> the<00:05:21.460> Reds

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
guess this could go in between the Reds

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.110 
guess this could go in between the Reds
and<00:05:21.970> the<00:05:22.120> pinks<00:05:23.460> it's<00:05:24.460> not<00:05:24.670> really<00:05:24.850> in<00:05:25.090> the

purple<00:05:25.510> category<00:05:25.960> at<00:05:26.080> all<00:05:26.290> but<00:05:27.220> here<00:05:28.180> it<00:05:28.270> is
