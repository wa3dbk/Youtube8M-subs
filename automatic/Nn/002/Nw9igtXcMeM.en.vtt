00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hello you love and be warm 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.440
 welcome here I am again 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.300
 Amnesty 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.340
 I'm 95 percent healthy you hear 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.360
 only now it has my vocal cords 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.910
 incurred 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.590
 I have to be incredibly exhausting 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.180
 to be able to talk anyway 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.580
 sometimes if I have a high pitch now 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.590
 or so wants to meet then in 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.490
 Germany sometimes also sets the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.820
 I totally agree 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.109
 what had I ever had 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.210
 dizziness i had a fever i 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.219
 It was all about it now 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.879
 Luckily over now my voice is 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.410
 my neck and so easily snuff so 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.260
 I hope that everything will be back soon 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.379
 Tipptopp is so otherwise I wanted 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.539
 give you the weekly planning now 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.629
 about what I intend this week 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.030
 and unfortunately I have to disappoint how 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.559
 I can not vote for this today 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.449
 bring another video there is now 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.800
 this intro video but no gameplay 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.270
 so look again 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.480
 Gameplays on the surfaces not seen 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.580
 then I play on monday 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.159
 By the way, at a tournament with the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.140
 German youtube together with the super 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.750
 need and the whole will even 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.600
 not streamed from me because I yes 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.920
 but play by a lot of maxim 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.900
 of you know him at twitch 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.430
 getting better in a row means I will 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.970
 In any case, the link below in 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.720

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.540
 The tournament will be over at 5 pm 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.770
 The stream starts already quarter ago 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.110
 there you can then the one higher 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.509
 Get hold of information and let's see if you 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.210
 you can switch on early then you can 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.790
 also play me among others 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.619
 see 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.079
 on tuesday thursday and thursday 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.170
 Friday , I think it's nothing 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.270
 special about any novelties 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.490
 on the pda or whatever give of 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.469
 That's why I will definitely be there every day 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.310
 again two gameplays we bring it ja 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.360
 are used to 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.560
 you can definitely 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.520
 rejoice u but so I know what I am 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.710
 should play at all 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.989
 you have to down in the comments 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.430
 write 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.810
 which champion do you want to see I am 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.459
 yes last week already received it 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.830
 That was very well for many 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.720
 happy and if your champion already there 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.569
 is use I list again 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.130
 but just tends the comment and 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.380
 the comment with the camping was am 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.150
 Most likes we have you 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.700
 of course, also the will play on 2 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.190
 then most likes would otherwise happen 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.250
 I still care if you like the whole thing 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:40.080
 would rather see in 5 vs. 5 mode 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.000
 or in the six against six, say 55 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.950
 classic or witch kill 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.450
 I have to know that because you are looking 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.709
 yes finally the videos and i want to 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.630
 agree on you and then you can 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.930
 whole course so many have 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.459
 I also asked when do you stream again 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.930
 I also have an incredible time 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.940
 again the trio without fun 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.860
 it went well I would be as close as you 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.810
 you never could at the same time 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.280
 playing music and playing at the same time 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.920
 then played with music then you were 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.930
 itself much more relaxed on it but the 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.239
 pc crashes are simply still 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.380
 that's why it's now unfortunately 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.380
 first put back 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:23.130
 What else is there for weeks? 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.989
 Talked to a girl and he has 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.329
 This voice said that was still a lot 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.970
 sounds like a kilo for kilo 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:33.060
 again pedophile child molester 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.239
 So I can not vote now 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.700
 too much burden I hope you switched 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:42.560
 still in the stream of maxim today 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.850
 There you can see me about the game 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.680
 and I have to get well fast 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.329
 if we think of something I'm doing 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.819
 just a new info video maybe 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:52.920
 another two sentences to waalkes I can 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.010
 no exactly what's in there when 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.220
 comes out but I know exactly when 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.690
 he comes out 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.510
 then I'll get me then I buy 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.300
 In any case because me has world 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.360
 personally a lot of fun one 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.160
 all the very last to avert this 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.950
 I'm just a bit of a kid 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.580
 consider what a loan I call 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.560
 should 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.750
 I have now been in these three 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.500
 Actually only played in the middle and in 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.570
 season 2 i was the main supporter and 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.470
 somehow I miss the times as 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.850
 So supporter with me I stand with 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.380
 my feelings a bit on the 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.330
 Can I even if I'm in the middle 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.620
 want to stay or continue 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.420
 supporter should play 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.850
 jungle and top I have excluded 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:40.600
 Now I'm still snooping in the 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:43.240
 adc role purely but that only briefly too 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.220
 my wood stood by my voice 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.470
 As I said I really hope that 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.830
 a giant gets better quickly 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.690
 thank you and a big heart for you 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.450
 that you still stick with it minister 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.570
 magic will be back for you soon 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.760
 do not forget the stream of maxxim it 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.540
 is so beautiful and that then a lot 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.540
 fun in the week
