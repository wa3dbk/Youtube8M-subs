you know we basically had a two-part
story<00:01:37.530> i<00:01:37.740> think<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.070> was<00:01:38.189> where<00:01:38.460> we<00:01:39.030> find<00:01:39.240> out

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
story i think it was where we find out

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.780 
story i think it was where we find out
exactly<00:01:39.810> why<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.229> Klingons<00:01:40.799> foreheads<00:01:41.400> went

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
exactly why the Klingons foreheads went

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.300 
exactly why the Klingons foreheads went
so<00:01:42.360> soft<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.170> was<00:01:43.259> down<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.619> virus<00:01:44.159> and

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
so soft and it was down to a virus and

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.100 
so soft and it was down to a virus and

so I mean this was just a really awesome
show<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:49.530> me<00:01:49.799> every<00:01:50.070> week<00:01:50.280> week<00:01:50.939> after<00:01:51.149> week<00:01:51.540> I

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
show for me every week week after week I

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.420 
show for me every week week after week I
only<00:01:51.899> missed<00:01:52.200> two<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.799> first<00:01:53.009> herring

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
only missed two of the first herring

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.730 
only missed two of the first herring
episodes<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.030> thankfully<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.720> local<00:01:55.350> station

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
episodes and thankfully a local station

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.380 
episodes and thankfully a local station
would<00:01:55.890> play<00:01:56.040> them<00:01:56.189> again<00:01:56.399> on<00:01:56.610> Saturday<00:01:57.240> night

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
would play them again on Saturday night

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.780 
would play them again on Saturday night
so<00:01:57.420> I'd<00:01:57.689> catch<00:01:57.930> them<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.219> miss<00:01:59.430> them<00:01:59.610> and

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
so I'd catch them if I miss them and

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.010 
so I'd catch them if I miss them and
sometimes<00:01:59.939> I'd<00:02:00.240> watch<00:02:00.450> them<00:02:00.659> again<00:02:00.750> because

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
sometimes I'd watch them again because

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.200 
sometimes I'd watch them again because
they<00:02:01.200> were<00:02:01.290> just<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.710> good<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.820> looking

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
they were just that good and so looking

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.969 
they were just that good and so looking

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
stream and everything like that well we

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.560 
stream and everything like that well we
have<00:04:54.710> that<00:04:54.919> again<00:04:55.190> but<00:04:55.370> this<00:04:55.700> time<00:04:55.760> one<00:04:56.419> is

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
have that again but this time one is

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.300
