00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
the game it's just a little frustrating

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.950 
the game it's just a little frustrating
you<00:06:00.060> know<00:06:00.090> this<00:06:00.330> game<00:06:00.450> would<00:06:00.600> be<00:06:00.720> a<00:06:00.750> lot<00:06:00.930> better

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
you know this game would be a lot better

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.870

if<00:06:01.350> people<00:06:01.590> just<00:06:01.770> play<00:06:02.100> it<00:06:02.130> the<00:06:02.460> way<00:06:02.490> that<00:06:02.610> it

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
if people just play it the way that it

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.750 
if people just play it the way that it
was<00:06:02.970> intended<00:06:03.180> but<00:06:03.690> I<00:06:04.070> guess<00:06:05.070> that's<00:06:05.310> an

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
was intended but I guess that's an

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.460 
was intended but I guess that's an
age-old<00:06:06.210> argument<00:06:06.450> that<00:06:06.870> we've<00:06:06.990> been<00:06:07.110> having

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
for all these call of duty's I guess but

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.330 
for all these call of duty's I guess but
