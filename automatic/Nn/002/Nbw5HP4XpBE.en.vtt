00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.250

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.960
 created by god 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:12.340
 in six literal days of 24 hours 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:16.570
 and this same creator god rested in the 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:19.930
 Seventh day we also learned that there is a 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.039
 logical and intelligent sequence in the week 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.820
 of creation 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:29.530
 we discover that nature reveals god the 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.580
 creator who is extremely skilled in 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.530
 nature 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.950
 we can see some things 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:41.740
 important about god 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:46.119

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.890
 invisible attributes 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:54.130
 we also learn that the apocalypse 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:58.960
 invites to worship the creator god who made the 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:02.770
 heavens and earth the sea and the fountains of the waters 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:06.180
 in today's world we are led and 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:10.540
 induced to worship in any way 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:13.420
 all the inhabitants of the planet love 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:18.160
 someone or something 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:23.110
 My question is what you are. 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:26.530
 worshiping or who you are worshiping 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.799
 you are worshiping God the creator of the 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.920
 maintainer and savior or are worshiping 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:36.480
 a false god who is no more than 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.669
 imagination and human making 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.550
 I want to talk a little bit to your 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:44.910
 heart 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:48.780
 the true God who created all 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:52.020
 things including our creator is today 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.530
 knocking at the door of your heart 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:59.400
 Jesus himself states in the apocalypse 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.520
 behold, I stand at the door and knock the 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.319
 battle of life seems to be 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.640
 survival is not really 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:13.680
 but it is not the great battle of life revolves 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:16.410
 around the worship of God or the 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:22.320
 anything else that occupy the place 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:25.350
 of God who is occupying your heart 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:30.090
 no one can serve two masters 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:32.970
 Jesus said why would Jesus want to 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.239
 take a seat in your heart 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.420
 Have you stopped to think about it? 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:43.709

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:47.790

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.120

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.359

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.750
 when I drank again with their in 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:25.400

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:30.020

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.789

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.570
 I was worshiping other gods was not 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:46.310
 God who was occupying the heart of 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:49.030
 people finish the king worshiped baal and jezebel 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.860
 his wife ruled a religion 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:55.910
 an idolater who worshiped Baal and 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:05:00.259
 God's post-title did not send rain during 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:04.070
 three and a half years while the people 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:06.770
 abandoned god idolatry did not answer 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.560
 your prayers for it to rain 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:13.190
 but when they reformed and 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:17.300
 accepted to worship the true god 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:21.080
 the rain came and the other blessings came 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:24.160

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:47.710
 these are the desires of your heart and 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:51.110
 allow Jesus to dwell in you 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:56.449
