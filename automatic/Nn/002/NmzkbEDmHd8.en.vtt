00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:12.069
 hello party friends my name is hector hawthorn 

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:13.609
 He taught inacap 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:17.339
 I invite you to know a little more about the engine cooling system 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.230
 since a month ago 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.870
 one of the older ones or to keep the engine 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.870
 the normal operating temperature 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.670
 to 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.250
 that this engine was not treated efficiently can not be overheated and 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.040
 that's why we need a system that allows 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.040
 that the temperature of that power work efficiently 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.680
 It is made up of several pieces inside 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.489
 the bomb 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.510
 baa formally within the distribution system 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.940
 this pump drives the water 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:11.880
 7 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.600
 the template motor has a quantity 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.600
 Send the radiator 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.780
 from when they were accounted for all over the world and the sixth part in which 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.100
 worked initially 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.600
 when the engine is already reaching its normal temperature is that above 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.720
 Observe 90 degrees Celsius 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.720
 then nobody take out what is called the thermostat 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.720
 pt thermostat then a valve 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.420
 yemen chad of the engine this low temperature recirculates the water to the 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.640
 engine interior 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.929
 but already when it is over temperature 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.479
 working a damper the passage of liquid for Sierra Leone 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.680
 and to descend internally 1 channel refrigerant vice 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.680
 and in that instant the whole electro is also activated 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.869
 and in the low area 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.849
 again we have another bustamante exit was 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.999
 And come back 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.909
 in this case we have it for this payment 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.989
 the coolant returns the engine but with it 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.989
 settled at a lower temperature 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.089
 as another component in the radiator 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:34.289
 we have the afternoon 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:37.649
 the lid fulfills a super important double function 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:42.580
 where I wrote when there is a lot of temperature then data track 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.539
 there would be one of your valves 

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.539
 and lets liquid pass to this compensation tank 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.359
 when the engine has cooled 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:56.269
 the cap again works with another valve to suck fluid from this 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.989
 compensation deposit 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.359
 and return it to your motorcycle 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.459
 there are things that can be done at home tyson 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:05.280
 this level 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.330
 we do not hide 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.509
 with the coolant more 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:10.849
 compensation deposit 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.879
 this pull level myself that day of the child 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.909
 a brand that is in the lowest area of ​​the warehouse 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:19.559
 and the maximum level that is in the low zone 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:22.539
 therefore those levels are what they were 

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:23.370
 constantly 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.349
 the holy prosecutor we should not put liquid beyond the level 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:33.249
 maximum that is specified 7 hopefully find those levels and not exceed 

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:36.249
 that exile 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.259
 caution mode 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:51.719
 the driver is going to have on the instrument panel 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:55.099
 controlling the temperature level of your engine 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:56.269
 ponce there 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.120
 the power and kánter certainly testifies to what level is going to be the normal 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:05.599
 site to be different if that vehicle is moving cities and roads 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.799
 a high temperature in the engine 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.079
 it can cause 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.829
 the fujita gtc 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.809
 wants to melt it means that finally this engine 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:19.469
 in their moving parts they go to frank heron was going to stop working 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:27.469
 I hope you have used the program that 

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:29.469
 we have done for health 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:32.599
 if we leave you cordially invited for a few days
