00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.240
 very good guys today I 'm going 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.580
 to teach the new clash cast hack 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:12.530
 in which you can do 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.599
 expeditions and again the hp hack 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.320
 m nothing else that is already updated to the 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.630
 last version 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.660
 well the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.160
 will go to my files we will download 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.160
 the file where we have 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.850
 what are these three that you see here 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:37.570
 well this is from the expeditions from 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:41.000
 where the waves are and there are monsters 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:45.079
 and this is the original, well, what 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.470
 let's do first is locate this 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:53.440
 folder here where it says with point 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:56.370
 and point keys we give you to copy 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:01.130
 we copy it and paste it in the folder 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.980
 where we have installed the applications 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.250
 in my case it is a galaxy to exhibit then 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.110
 the phone does not save applications in the 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.710
 cd memory then they are all in the 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.750
 internal memory 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.110
 therefore we go then to the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.869
 Android folder and then we search or bb and 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.590
 we're going to hit it here after it 's 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.369
 stop 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.950
 what we will do is install the 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.780
 application that we are going to occupy obviously 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.610
 we have to uninstall the first the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.740
 that we have the original if you like 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.170
 can they make a back up of the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.350
 original application with the data or bb 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.090
 of the so that when they are going to play 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.860
 Well do not have any problem 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.930
 because in fact sometimes there is not but 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.540
 you may give them to you 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.210
 then after that we leave again 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.660
 to the folder where they are connected 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.660
 records 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.670
 we enter here and now what we do is 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:03.530
 locate one in this case I locate the 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.530
 expeditions well let's go here 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.969
 and install 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.790
 when the application installs us 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.660
 normally we are going to open it and we are going to 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.950
 look for expeditions 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.950
 well open 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.819
 this is the application here so can 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.829
 watch 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.609
 it will also come out to you but not 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.609
 they have no problem 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.989
 I think it is very high when flying 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.170
 once the application already loads 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.870
 we are in the game normally 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.600
 and we are going to locate where is this 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.940
 part of here and in expeditions well 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.270
 as you can see here all the 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.270
 Completed 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:03.670
 but right now I do not have combats then 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.670
 let's see what I can do 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.110
 let's go in here so they can see how 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.450
 close and well 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.770
 we enter we look as you can see this 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.319
 it's an account that I just did not 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:25.299
 I have nothing 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:28.409
 and let's go directly to where 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.409
 is that I got lost 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.740
 I think I have not bought it here is the 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.750
 sand 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.230
 in the sand is where all the 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.790
 expeditions and therefore where 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.160
 we will work to see it 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.360
 all right 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.360
 while it is 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.800
 very good now that we were already where 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.990
 we enter here we select r 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.250
 these are heroes that I have to wake up 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.250
 the mind came out all the cot 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.650
 we will start it if you look closely here 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:16.629
 yesterday of level 20 because they are not the great 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.629
 thing but look carefully how is the heart 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:28.090
 and they attack and destroy everything 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:30.800
 rarely rarely lose an ere but 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.639
 compared to the damage they do from here 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.660
 have the first then follow this 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:40.580
 normally if with the heroes 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.580
 now we do the same 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.470
 well we follow 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.610
 this guy about l reason but with this 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.970
 hack and I tell them no matter the level that 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.099
 have can have a level 120 130 no 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.410
 matter even if you have the 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:07.540
 from level 1 they will always be able to 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.930
 defeat him 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:14.910
 then basically the tile of the 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.910
 expedition here has a level 60 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:22.240
 this I think it would be all a little bit more 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.760
 He clarified that this site will not you 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.689
 selling 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.879
 I get it now I'll wait for you 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:30.849
 this time the previous one will be different 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:35.139
 video that I already had 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:37.689
 I hack action where you 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:40.629
 he said he needed them to subscribe 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:42.159
 Well, that will always be one of 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:47.439
 the requirements so that they can have the 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:49.820
 hack the other thing will be that I ask you to 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:52.169
 join me spear 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.449
 I'm going to throw 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:06:00.159
 it's called 100 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:01.840
 apocalypse gt well educating well or 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:06.879
 rather, recruiting users with 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:09.849
 pumpkins and that at least have 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:11.229
 10,000 of power onwards well if you 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:15.069

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:20.050
 always the description of my facebook 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:22.509
 to send messages and make clear 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.449
 I'm not charging you for the hack 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:28.180
 about I ask of those two things 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:31.210
 whoever wants it please please 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:33.689
 warn the genie I will give it only 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:37.930
 when they are already installed in the alliance 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:40.120
 and I think that would be all that power to see 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.300
 video I hope you liked to 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.300
