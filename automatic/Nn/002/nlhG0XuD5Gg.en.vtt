 hello everyone welcome to my kitchen today 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.010
 let's make some potatoes au gratin 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.380
 with mushrooms if you do not want to lose or 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.940
 none of my videos subscribe to 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.940
 channel we start 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.690
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.720
 They are 3 fat potatoes cut in 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.240
 cuadraditos some thyme a little 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.920
 of finely chopped parsley 8 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.680
 mushrooms the smallest thing that 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.739
 you find two eggs an onion 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.280
 cut into thin slices some leaves 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.680
 salvia a little salt olive oil and 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.260
 black pepper the first thing we will do is 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.770
 fry the potatoes but before we go to 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.680
 Salar we will put a pan on fire 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.990
 strong we throw a big glass of oil 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.470
 and we wait for it to warm up for 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.470
 fry them 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.500
 once the potatoes are golden brown 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.720
 we will remove them to a source now in the 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.660
 same pan let a little bit of 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.850
 oil and let's sauté to create the 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:16.170
 onion when we see that you have taken a 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:18.659
 little color and is soft we take it out 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.240
 then we add a little bit of 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.850
 more oil to sauté the mushrooms 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.400
 we put the fire to the limit and when 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.860
 We warm the mushrooms 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.740
 As you can see in this recipe, we will leave them 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.870
 integers but we have removed the trunk 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.200
 now we are going to add a little bit of 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.200
 Salt 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.980
 and they're ready and we put out the fire in 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.310
 this point we preheat the oven to 200 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.920
 degrees and we're going to throw all the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.390
 ingredients in a baking dish 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.120
 let's take half of the onion in 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.310
 the bottom of the fountain and the other the 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.440
 we will throw with the potatoes the other half 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.440
 now we will throw our pinions 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:07.260
 and we will move them with the potatoes so that 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.980
 everything is mixed and we will throw everything 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.980
 the oven source 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.610
 we are distributing it well for all 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.290
 sides and now let's spice it 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.290
 let's put a little bit of thyme 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.930
 a little black pepper 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.540
 we put a little parsley 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.540
 minced 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.400
 we put a few leaves of sage that 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.920
 this gives it a very special flavor 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.920
 and finally we will lay eggs 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.940
 we will add a little salt 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.590
 and you're ready to put it in the oven 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.660
 we will put them in the oven with the graph 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.730
 maximum power and when the egg is 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.680
 curdled because we already have the will draw 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.020
 ready our delicious potatoes 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.360
