00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.120 
see big difference see it looks like
it's<00:07:27.430> gold<00:07:27.940> but<00:07:28.450> it's<00:07:28.599> not<00:07:28.810> it's<00:07:29.169> uh<00:07:29.289> it<00:07:29.979> was

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:30.130 
it's gold but it's not it's uh it was

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:31.650 
it's gold but it's not it's uh it was
red

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:31.660 
red

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:38.220 
red
and<00:07:31.750> this<00:07:32.710> is<00:07:32.830> what<00:07:33.010> happens<00:07:33.600> when<00:07:37.110> where<00:07:38.110> your

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:38.230 
and this is what happens when where your

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.850 
and this is what happens when where your
coil<00:07:38.470> gets<00:07:38.620> loose<00:07:38.920> and<00:07:39.570> it<00:07:40.570> starts<00:07:41.050> touching

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:41.860 
coil gets loose and it starts touching

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.780 
coil gets loose and it starts touching
the<00:07:42.070> flywheel<00:07:43.500> to<00:07:44.500> create<00:07:44.740> too<00:07:44.920> much<00:07:45.040> bark<00:07:45.460> and

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:45.790 
the flywheel to create too much bark and

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:47.940 
the flywheel to create too much bark and
your<00:07:45.910> motor<00:07:46.120> run<00:07:46.270> to<00:07:46.480> hot<00:07:46.660> and<00:07:47.050> start<00:07:47.830> over

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:47.950 
your motor run to hot and start over

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.680 
your motor run to hot and start over
heating<00:07:48.280> actually<00:07:48.670> I<00:07:48.700> mean<00:07:48.970> this<00:07:49.090> is<00:07:49.300> the

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:49.690 
heating actually I mean this is the

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.510 
heating actually I mean this is the
results<00:07:50.110> right<00:07:50.320> there<00:07:50.500> good<00:07:50.680> this<00:07:51.100> is<00:07:51.310> what

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520 
results right there good this is what

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:58.380 
results right there good this is what
happens<00:07:54.390> so<00:07:55.390> make<00:07:55.570> sure<00:07:55.600> you<00:07:55.750> put<00:07:55.900> a<00:07:55.960> lot<00:07:56.110> tight
