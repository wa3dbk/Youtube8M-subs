00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
two buttons on this full of device and

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:41.100 
two buttons on this full of device and
device<00:00:39.790> here<00:00:40.030> only<00:00:40.269> weighed<00:00:40.450> six<00:00:40.809> points

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
device here only weighed six points

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.799 
device here only weighed six points
seven<00:00:41.170> ounces<00:00:41.800> it's<00:00:42.430> fairly<00:00:42.640> late<00:00:43.059> it's<00:00:43.540> easy

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
seven ounces it's fairly late it's easy

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.850 
seven ounces it's fairly late it's easy
to<00:00:43.989> use<00:00:44.170> it<00:00:44.500> only<00:00:44.739> takes<00:00:45.040> four<00:00:45.780> triple-a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
to use it only takes four triple-a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.830 
to use it only takes four triple-a
batteries<00:00:47.860> so<00:00:48.460> this<00:00:48.940> is<00:00:49.059> basically<00:00:49.480> a

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
batteries so this is basically a

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.229 
batteries so this is basically a
plug-and-play<00:00:50.620> device<00:00:51.100> so<00:00:51.850> what<00:00:52.059> I'm<00:00:52.149> going

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
plug-and-play device so what I'm going

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.939

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
would tell me where the light source is

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:08.949 
would tell me where the light source is
coming<00:02:07.100> from<00:02:07.369> so<00:02:08.300> this<00:02:08.420> is<00:02:08.569> a<00:02:08.600> great<00:02:08.780> device

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959
