 monet one of the main big killers of our country 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.810
 let's take stock of the treatment of this disease with processors

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.449
 livorno civil hospital 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.240
 professor cap how patients with lung cancer are treated 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.449
 47 framework public housing 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.620
 echo treated differently logically depending on the state of 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.620
 disease 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.830
 let's say that in the forms 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.940
 preparatory courses 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.160

 reference before surgery 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.090
 followed by udah radiotherapy, a chemotherapy treatment 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.600
 . precautionary water 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.900
 in the most advanced forms from where the surgeon 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.760
 woman succeeds 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.270
 2 intervene 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.270
 where the disease has not yet metastasized 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.110
 reference act 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.080
 civil opinions and treatment 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.110
 we ask for concomitant quadratic. Association 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.430
 at the same time as bedtime chemotherapy 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.260
 in the more advanced vice versa forms 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
 giorgia unfortunately are present in the metastases and where 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.170
 cul. the purpose of the processing 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.870
 consists mainly 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:17.900
 extend them 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.210
 patient safety is possible 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.240
 reference 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.509
 and the medical treatment is today fortunately especially 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:26.560
 in the other carcinoma 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.450
 who can be of new drugs biological sites 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.460
 can molecular target that 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.860
 they allow to 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.710
 the results definitely 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.850
 and higher than chemotherapy not only with regard to the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.090
 expectations 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.430
 of life of the patient 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.939
 and also with regard to quality 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.470
 of the patient's own life when it is possible to use these biological drugs 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.000
 Biological drugs cannot be used 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.500
 all patients indiscriminate manner is definitely needed to make one 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.360
 patient selection because 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.240
 and we know that patients present the target 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.350
 of the drug are those that open to me 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.480
 from clinical benefit 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.700
 and while patients who do not present the target have a definite benefit 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.599
 most modest 1 year absolutely 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.209
 what kind of prestige 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.969
 and therefore what we do currently we select we analyze 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:19.709
 soul to soul tumor 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.279
 those markers 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:25.379
 stones tell a specific drug's sensitivity so let's go to 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:26.889
 evaluate if they exist 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:28.739
 of molecular anomalies 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.419
 and on the basis of this on the basis of the molecular profile we also choose that 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.169
 point the drug to use 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:39.559
 which investigations have been identified up to you what percentage of patients 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.559
 marbling that have been identified 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:46.409
 in the last few years it really is 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.399
 have been identified 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:52.169
 I can't stand it is amantea soccer thief soccer-fashion tank 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.409
 because even the squamous carcinoma of the lung today we know that there are 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.739
 genetic abnormalities for 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.629
 hey let's say that if we have to focus on what the anomalies are then 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:03.700
 they translate 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.339
 origins 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:06.329
 nothing 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.519
 different therapeutic choice for the patient 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.819
 in fact, the most important molecular events are 2 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.989
 that is the mutation of the iron gene 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.699
 gene that codes for a particular membrane preceptor that 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:24.009
 in fact then a tumor proliferation is made 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.419
 it is for this type of anomaly posillipo of imitation 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.339
 which is present in approx 

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:31.349
 Fillea 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.150
 six 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.149
 10% of cases 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:35.679
 we have to do it 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:37.519
 very precise targeted 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.650
 and another event present in about 4 5% of patients is the translocation 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.619
 of genealogy 

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:48.119
 and this is also an important event because we have all seen that 

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:50.410
 and two the events of which is the translocation at 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.249
 yes to the pussy 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:54.479
 lg grabs are those pierre events really 

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.750
 i drive ebay i am a 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.599
 in tumor proliferation 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.369
 pendragon really to block them 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:04.239
 we have a great benefit for the patient with a dramatic deduction 

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:08.799
 what drugs we have available for these mutations 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.099
 presentation we have fortunately today several drugs 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.730
 we would say a wide choice regarding 96 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.469
 ferrara law where 

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:19.939
 two yahoo drugs already exist on the market 

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:22.809
 reads the other to the free wheel 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:24.710
 and the rest will come 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.199
 and also commercialized a product rate for the active 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:32.340
 with regard to the white and lilac translocation drug currently at 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.990
 arrangement is already available the edition these are the disc drugs 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.300
 add medication costs compared is dictionary 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.710
 these drugs compared to traditional therapy 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.050
 surely they have an important impact on the previous one 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.050
 disease is definitely more effective than 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.990
 there are absolutely no more doubts 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.580
 on the fact that they are there 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.080
 rectify a classic treatment 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.460
 chemotherapy type 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.650
 and let me promise you a big savings 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.729
 patient toxicity 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:08.099
 besides burning more favorable impact on the quality of life guarantor of 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.939
 station of cisamente piajet 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:13.729
 matchmaker May 30 hours 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.279
 and therefore almost all the cartons most forced to have to go to the hospital for 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:20.229
 do 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.529
 in addition to these drugs are other study molecules 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:26.249
 photo was the drugs there are 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:28.580
 many 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.520
 ddd there are many other molecules 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.569
 whether it is in the same sector 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:36.590
 that is, in patients switching d &amp; g and iron translocation other because 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.740
 Unfortunately 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.740
 although patients respond 

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:43.749
 excellent these types of drugs 

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:45.710
 we all fail to heal 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.199
 completely a patient with lung cancer that's it that's that 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:51.089
 cannot be obtained 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:55.969
 and therefore the question arises today how to treat those patients afterwards 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:59.259
 who responded so brilliantly to the previous treatment 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:00.360
 beat 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.530
 with drugs that before 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:02.460
 linked 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.410
 stefano little in progression so there are the new lines of development of the 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.409
 research is precisely in identifying new molecules 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:13.009
 in patients who have developed resistance to cosenza visit 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:16.430
 these drugs or of course all those other drugs 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.900
 towards others 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.369
 molecular anomalies that 

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:23.490
 not mentioned before because we simply have no drug available one of the 

00:06:23.489 --> 00:06:27.150
 more frequent in lung cancer, for example in particular or the other 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.889
 carcinoma 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.589
 pest research 

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:32.349
 and for which today 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:33.719
 we unfortunately do not have 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:34.600
 of drugs 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.600
 really specific to be able to offer the patient but they exist 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:41.059
 ancient sistri are currently in progress 

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:43.310
 in the light of all these new drugs as is the 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.520
 ectiva of life of a patient with lung cancer today 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.509
 the expected return 

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:50.930
 the patient with lung cancer is certainly superior to some 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:51.830
 year 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.059
 if we have to give some numbers 

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:57.059
 and we can say that today the median 

00:06:58.059 --> 00:07:01.339
 tfr meditation reaches two years 

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:03.110
 what was before in the south 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.169
 20 unthinkable a few years ago 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:06.770
 simon lung tumor 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.029
 on average 

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:11.799
 and then after a few months there was a change that mentholated 

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:13.940
 patient life is almost at 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.430
 that trip licata 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.479
 I am perfectly aware of it 

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:22.509
 these numbers obviously cannot be judged satisfactory 

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:25.330
 crazy list 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.550
