00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.500
 since the cs6 version the company adobe 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.629
 who is the creator of photoshop I include 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.610
 an auto - save option to be able 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.130
 recover changes that we have made 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.990
 previously in our documents this 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.540
 It is useful when there are problems with the 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.090
 program to be working and cause 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.310
 of it we did not have time to save the 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.680
 changes made happen normally 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.719
 when the operating system shows a 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.360
 error for some reason and it makes 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.820
 photoshop stop working for example 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.579
 in windows surely many have seen 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.739
 the famous message of the program has 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.960
 stopped working and closes 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.390
 suddenly a message that all 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.850
 we hate without doubt another possible cause is 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.219
 when there is some power cut 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.620
 electrical something that is not in our 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.109
 hands unless we have a device 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.449
 those known as know break would not happen 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.969
 to older but otherwise if 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.220
 we'll be hard for luck for that 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.350
 serves the option of automatic saving 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.570
 that has photoshop what it will do is 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.550
 save the changes made in the 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.650
 documents every so often while 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.280
 we are working no matter if 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.970
 we 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.010
 We save them manually or not 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.159
 time is set in minutes and 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.500
 we can choose from 5 minutes to one 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.570
 hour of duration I'll show you what 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.090
 does the auto-save option I'm going to 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.040
 simulate that photoshop stopped working 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.149
 but first we have to configure this 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.540
 option to work properly 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.460
 right enter the menu edition and in 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.390
 preferences in administration of 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.250
 records 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.409
 we see an option that says save 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.810
 recovery information 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.539
 automatically every this is what you 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.240
 said we can select from 5 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:54.289
 minutes up to an hour going through these 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.729
 three quantities 10 15 and 30 minutes in 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.700
 this moment I have not configured 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.159
 like 5 minutes once you set the 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.740
 press time ok what time 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.259
 is indicating is that every five minutes 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.209
 in this case because I select that 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.550
 amount will save so 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.670
 automatic changes that we have made 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.280
 in our document it is important that 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.769
 Take into account that you do not keep them 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.510
 normal way does it temporarily 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.580
 for example if we 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.530
 working normally probably 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.640
 we made some change that we do not want 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.200
 save photoshop maybe save it but 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.720
 it will not do it directly in the file 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.900
 original but in a temporary one which 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.540
 use only if we 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.569
 let's want to simulate then that 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.489
 photoshop has been closed by mistake this 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.549
 document I have not saved it yet you can 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.950
 see as it says without title is forced to 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:52.220
 that is closing photoshop now I'm going to 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.440
 open we see that by opening it so 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.780
 automatic also opens the last 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.000
 document that we had and in which 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.799
 we made some changes in my case myself 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.560
 just add this text that says 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.170
 that top title 1 note now that the 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.010
 Document title bar says 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.859
 recovered at 100% and is showing the 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.569
 layer that I added later and this 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.849
 change do not keep it however 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.920
 photoshop yes he did let's suppose that 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:22.879
 we already saved this document 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.370
 in some location logically without this 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.139
 layer because we do not save the changes if 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.980
 I'm not interested in this change that says 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.440
 simply ignore 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.739
 the window is pressing the X 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.900
 to close it or if we are interested 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.390
 select the save option as 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.299
 we can give you a name this is the 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.569
 new option that the programs have 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:48.019
 adobe cs6 for some may be useful 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.819
 for others, not so much we can configure 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.830
 the time the number of minutes that 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.830
 we believe they are convenient
