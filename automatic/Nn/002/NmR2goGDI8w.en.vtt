starting on the back I clip up the top
two<00:00:29.380> sections<00:00:31.770> separating<00:00:32.770> the<00:00:32.890> twist<00:00:33.160> gives

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:33.490 
two sections separating the twist gives

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.460 
two sections separating the twist gives
me<00:00:33.640> two<00:00:33.820> smaller<00:00:34.210> sections<00:00:34.780> and<00:00:34.930> each<00:00:35.140> one<00:00:35.350> of

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
me two smaller sections and each one of

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.930 
me two smaller sections and each one of
these<00:00:35.620> sections<00:00:36.130> is<00:00:36.250> going<00:00:36.400> to<00:00:36.460> become<00:00:36.760> the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
these sections is going to become the

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.940 
these sections is going to become the

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.860 

now<00:00:51.370> I<00:00:51.400> take<00:00:51.760> that<00:00:51.970> piece<00:00:52.210> and<00:00:52.450> divide<00:00:52.690> it<00:00:52.810> into

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
now I take that piece and divide it into

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.210 
now I take that piece and divide it into
two<00:00:53.200> sections<00:00:53.470> and<00:00:53.980> I<00:00:54.400> begin<00:00:54.610> to<00:00:54.670> twist<00:00:56.220> now

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
two sections and I begin to twist now

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.770 
two sections and I begin to twist now
some<00:00:57.430> of<00:00:57.460> you<00:00:57.670> might<00:00:57.820> be<00:00:57.880> wondering<00:00:58.120> why<00:00:58.600> I'm

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
some of you might be wondering why I'm

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.690 
some of you might be wondering why I'm
not<00:00:58.960> doing<00:00:59.230> a<00:00:59.320> flat<00:00:59.590> choice<00:00:59.920> in<00:01:00.130> the<00:01:00.250> back<00:01:00.400> and

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
not doing a flat choice in the back and

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.460 
not doing a flat choice in the back and
that's<00:01:00.910> because<00:01:01.239> I<00:01:01.360> want<00:01:01.390> my<00:01:01.690> twist<00:01:02.020> out<00:01:02.230> as

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
that's because I want my twist out as

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.770 
that's because I want my twist out as
stretched<00:01:02.860> as<00:01:03.100> possible<00:01:03.580> and<00:01:03.790> flat<00:01:04.330> twisting

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
stretched as possible and flat twisting

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.570 
stretched as possible and flat twisting
it<00:01:04.900> just<00:01:05.110> creates<00:01:05.440> a<00:01:05.590> bend<00:01:05.830> at<00:01:06.010> the<00:01:06.070> root<00:01:06.340> of<00:01:06.400> my

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
it just creates a bend at the root of my

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.700 
it just creates a bend at the root of my
hair<00:01:06.610> where<00:01:07.000> I<00:01:07.030> don't<00:01:07.180> need<00:01:07.570> it<00:01:07.720> since<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:08.500> top

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
hair where I don't need it since the top

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.140 
hair where I don't need it since the top
half<00:01:08.950> of<00:01:09.100> my<00:01:09.160> hair<00:01:09.460> will<00:01:09.640> be<00:01:09.729> covering<00:01:10.120> that

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
half of my hair will be covering that

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.320 
half of my hair will be covering that
anyway<00:01:11.010> when<00:01:12.010> I<00:01:12.040> get<00:01:12.220> to<00:01:12.370> the<00:01:12.460> bottom<00:01:12.610> I<00:01:12.910> twirl

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
anyway when I get to the bottom I twirl

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.969 
anyway when I get to the bottom I twirl
the<00:01:13.510> end<00:01:13.660> of<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:13.870> twist<00:01:14.140> with<00:01:14.290> my<00:01:14.440> finger<00:01:14.770> to

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
the end of the twist with my finger to

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.499 
the end of the twist with my finger to
keep<00:01:15.130> it<00:01:15.310> from<00:01:15.460> unraveling

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.870 

all<00:01:20.509> right<00:01:20.840> one<00:01:21.320> down<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:21.890> about<00:01:22.100> nine<00:01:22.670> to<00:01:22.909> go

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
all right one down and about nine to go

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.399 
all right one down and about nine to go
then<00:01:25.880> I<00:01:25.909> repeat<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:26.509> same<00:01:26.540> steps<00:01:27.049> on<00:01:27.259> the

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
then I repeat the same steps on the

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:55.620 
then I repeat the same steps on the
second<00:01:27.770> half<00:01:27.920> of<00:01:28.100> that<00:01:28.130> section

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.020 

you

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.450 

now<00:01:58.990> I<00:01:59.020> repeat<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.620> process<00:01:59.830> on<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:00.340> other

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
now I repeat the process on the other

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:23.200 
now I repeat the process on the other
side

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.820 

when<00:02:24.210> I<00:02:24.240> get<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.690> top<00:02:24.900> half<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.260> my<00:02:25.320> hair<00:02:25.650> I

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
when I get to the top half of my hair I

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.240 
when I get to the top half of my hair I
twist<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.430> differently<00:02:27.620> instead<00:02:28.620> of<00:02:28.860> doing<00:02:29.130> a

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
twist it differently instead of doing a

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.250 
twist it differently instead of doing a
regular<00:02:29.280> two<00:02:29.940> strand<00:02:30.270> twist<00:02:30.540> I'm<00:02:30.750> going<00:02:31.140> to

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
regular two strand twist I'm going to

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.470 
regular two strand twist I'm going to
flat<00:02:31.530> twist<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.950> section<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:35.209> since<00:02:36.209> I<00:02:36.330> have

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
flat twist the section and since I have

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.270 
flat twist the section and since I have
more<00:02:36.750> hair<00:02:36.959> in<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.230> top<00:02:37.410> two<00:02:37.620> sections<00:02:38.070> I

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
more hair in the top two sections I

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:46.020 
more hair in the top two sections I
separated<00:02:38.850> them<00:02:39.030> into<00:02:39.090> three<00:02:39.630> separate<00:02:40.020> parts

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.330 

to<00:02:46.660> make<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.840> flat<00:02:47.140> twist<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:47.650> divide<00:02:48.100> the

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
to make a flat twist I divide the

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.980 
to make a flat twist I divide the
portion<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:48.790> hair<00:02:49.000> I'm<00:02:49.120> going<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.480> be<00:02:49.569> twisting

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
portion of hair I'm going to be twisting

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.820 
portion of hair I'm going to be twisting
into<00:02:50.200> two<00:02:50.590> parts<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:52.750> now<00:02:52.930> we've<00:02:53.140> got<00:02:53.350> a<00:02:53.560> top

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
into two parts so now we've got a top

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.430 
into two parts so now we've got a top
half<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.520> bottom<00:02:54.819> half<00:02:55.000> with<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.930> top<00:02:56.140> half

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
half and a bottom half with the top half

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.040 
half and a bottom half with the top half
I<00:02:56.680> divide<00:02:57.520> that<00:02:57.700> into<00:02:57.940> two<00:02:58.060> parts<00:02:58.569> as<00:02:58.720> if<00:02:58.900> I'm

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
I divide that into two parts as if I'm

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.710 
I divide that into two parts as if I'm
going<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.380> make<00:02:59.500> a<00:02:59.530> twist<00:02:59.860> and<00:03:00.450> then<00:03:01.450> I'm<00:03:01.569> going

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
going to make a twist and then I'm going

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.330 
going to make a twist and then I'm going
to<00:03:01.780> begin<00:03:01.959> to<00:03:02.319> twist<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.860> two<00:03:03.069> pieces

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
to begin to twist the two pieces

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.640 
to begin to twist the two pieces
together<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:04.180> as<00:03:04.780> I<00:03:05.080> twist

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
together and as I twist

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.070 
together and as I twist
I'm<00:03:05.709> grabbing<00:03:06.190> hair<00:03:06.730> from<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.569> section<00:03:07.959> below

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
I'm grabbing hair from the section below

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.720 
I'm grabbing hair from the section below
it's<00:03:11.080> just<00:03:11.500> like<00:03:11.650> making<00:03:11.860> a<00:03:12.100> French<00:03:12.400> braid<00:03:12.700> but

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
it's just like making a French braid but

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.350 
it's just like making a French braid but
instead<00:03:13.360> it's<00:03:13.690> a<00:03:13.780> flat<00:03:14.020> twist<00:03:14.230> I<00:03:15.239> continue<00:03:16.239> to

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
instead it's a flat twist I continue to

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.600 
instead it's a flat twist I continue to
twist<00:03:16.600> like<00:03:16.840> this<00:03:16.900> grabbing<00:03:17.830> hair<00:03:18.070> as<00:03:18.250> I<00:03:18.400> go

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
twist like this grabbing hair as I go

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.790 
twist like this grabbing hair as I go
further<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.180> further<00:03:19.239> down<00:03:19.720> until<00:03:20.590> there's

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
further and further down until there's

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.250 
further and further down until there's
no<00:03:21.010> more<00:03:21.040> hair<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:21.550> grab<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:22.239> once<00:03:22.959> I<00:03:23.080> get<00:03:23.230> to

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
no more hair to grab and once I get to

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.440 
no more hair to grab and once I get to
that<00:03:23.410> point<00:03:23.890> I<00:03:24.130> finish<00:03:24.760> it<00:03:24.970> with<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.120> two

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
that point I finish it with the two

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.360 
that point I finish it with the two
strand<00:03:25.810> twist<00:03:26.080> all<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.680> way<00:03:26.830> to<00:03:26.890> the<00:03:27.160> end<00:03:27.310> of

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
strand twist all the way to the end of

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:43.839 
strand twist all the way to the end of
the<00:03:27.519> hair

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:04:00.580 

and<00:03:45.530> that's<00:03:46.530> how<00:03:46.709> you<00:03:46.769> make<00:03:47.010> watch<00:03:47.340> with

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.620 

if<00:04:01.590> you<00:04:02.310> notice<00:04:02.640> I'm<00:04:02.880> sectioning<00:04:03.480> my<00:04:03.510> hair

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
if you notice I'm sectioning my hair

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.839 
if you notice I'm sectioning my hair
with<00:04:04.140> my<00:04:04.170> finger<00:04:04.770> instead<00:04:05.250> of<00:04:05.370> with<00:04:05.520> the<00:04:05.610> comb

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
with my finger instead of with the comb

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.729 
with my finger instead of with the comb
and<00:04:06.090> that's<00:04:06.390> because<00:04:06.750> when<00:04:06.989> I<00:04:07.020> take<00:04:07.260> my<00:04:07.319> twists

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
and that's because when I take my twists

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.199 
and that's because when I take my twists
out<00:04:07.950> I<00:04:08.160> want<00:04:08.400> it<00:04:08.459> to<00:04:08.550> look<00:04:08.670> as<00:04:08.790> natural<00:04:08.940> as

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
out I want it to look as natural as

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.720 
out I want it to look as natural as
possible<00:04:09.720> without<00:04:10.349> straight<00:04:10.980> lines<00:04:11.280> going

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
possible without straight lines going

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.479 
possible without straight lines going
throughout<00:04:11.970> my<00:04:12.150> head<00:04:12.620> however<00:04:13.620> I<00:04:13.890> did<00:04:14.250> use<00:04:14.459> a

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
throughout my head however I did use a

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.280 
throughout my head however I did use a
comb<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:14.819> make<00:04:15.209> my<00:04:15.360> center<00:04:15.720> part<00:04:15.959> because

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
comb to make my center part because

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.690
