00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:39.329

 Blood could not stare Oh, just in case the mind 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:57.780
 I tried to do a repulsive test. 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.780
 As soon as the sound comes, I will immediately respond. 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.920
 Even the damage to the blowing damage 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.170
 So that about 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.750
 It's just a loud voice in Delhi . 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:22.830
 The result is the same 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:26.790
 Have you not be the case with a water bottle over the ear avoid looking urgently wanted 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.979
 If you have a problem with your ear, 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:35.600
 I do not know what it was related to 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.600
 What about the state? I looked into the rain in my sleep. 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.140
 Not 2 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:45.210
 The original entrance 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:48.000
 I have to write a dog before I go to Goma. 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.590
 The entrance is very narrow . 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.160
 p Show signs of witness structure Young spiritual factors from birth 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.370
 You have 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:02.990
 Leaving Guevara 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:07.820
 I can not hear the sound of ì­Œ 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:12.590
 Oh, seriously, three of them are much weaker or more specific. 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:16.890
 In fact, things fall or do not recognize the heart of the sound 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:21.060
 Could be more severe Cain behavior 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.459
 In the case of hearing-impaired dogs, there is no fear of sound, 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:29.910
 To do more 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:32.370
 So I've been thinking about dancing all the time . 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:38.060
 Mr. Hyun Ju 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.060
 Because I'm originally a Caddo geureongeo Korea with one kind of children do 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.650
 we 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.989
 In the meantime, I did not know, but now I know the cause of the fundamental solution 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.569
 When you find 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:56.489
 The first shipment of the methods found good news 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:59.060
 These three have seen an incredible story to introduce dog Bo wormwood subject of still life director 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.060
 That 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:08.099
 It's true that I actually found a hearing aid manufacturer. 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:12.030
 First of all, it is a cheap thing to check from availability. 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:16.650
 Adaptation does not suffer so much damage, so it remains. 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:19.860
 So that's why we make amplification through supplementation 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:26.209
 There is no sound. 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.209
 I mean, once we check to see if the real thing is a minute hand. 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.530
 Slightly uneasy apps 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.140
 This time the ears definitely moved. 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.140
 Ah 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:48.270
 Every time I heard a sound, I could see a slight tremble . 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.270
 Now coming 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:56.459
 It's unstable . Give me some. Yeah. 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.819
 The whole hearing is living a little bit. 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:04.849
 I am glad of Brandon. 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.849
 It also looks for rising because hovering sounds anxious look 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:14.970
 I think I hear it a little bit. 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:18.419
 The sound response is that the sound is coming from the end of the road , 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:23.070
 Okju Billy Jean keeps shaking. 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:26.400
 As a result of the test , I was able to walk the hope of hearing aid 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.760
 Ah too deep is the current c 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.270
 Fortunately, cheaper results are due to crossing 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.270
 what 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:41.960
 5 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:49.070
 Now it is only a matter of making the hearing aids for the first ear shape 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:52.900
 Typical for a few hours after sending customized to fit your ears 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.900
 The hearing aid is finally complete 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:05:00.670
 Can he listen to the world through this hearing aid ?
