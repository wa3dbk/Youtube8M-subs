00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.000 
is the actual touchdown he does get
either<00:02:03.300> way<00:02:03.630> Stewart<00:02:04.170> getting<00:02:04.560> his<00:02:04.800> third

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
either way Stewart getting his third

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.610 
either way Stewart getting his third
touchdown<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.640> game<00:02:06.140> maybe<00:02:07.140> his<00:02:07.320> fourth

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
touchdown on the game maybe his fourth

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.109 
touchdown on the game maybe his fourth
technically<00:02:08.160> since<00:02:08.369> he<00:02:08.490> got<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.729> first<00:02:08.910> one

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
technically since he got the first one

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.760 
technically since he got the first one
is<00:02:09.179> most<00:02:09.420> likely<00:02:09.690> switching<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.619> right

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
is most likely switching to the right

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.050 
is most likely switching to the right
side<00:02:10.950> he<00:02:11.070> could<00:02:11.190> see<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.340> run<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.700> right<00:02:11.820> no

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060

score I think that's pretty much the the

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.690 
score I think that's pretty much the the
dagger<00:02:33.959> right<00:02:34.380> there<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.920> don't<00:02:35.430> know<00:02:35.580> if

there's much that a Hillsdale can do

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.610 
there's much that a Hillsdale can do
