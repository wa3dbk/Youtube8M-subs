had no lab access at all to this

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.520 
had no lab access at all to this
equipment<00:00:33.809> just<00:00:34.760> catalogs<00:00:35.760> pictures<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:37.470> you

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
equipment just catalogs pictures but you

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.300 
equipment just catalogs pictures but you
couldn't<00:00:37.950> see<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.600> and<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.750> wanted<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.170> view<00:00:41.130> the

that I thought maybe there might be a
market<00:00:47.130> for<00:00:47.399> selling<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> items<00:00:48.510> too<00:00:48.809> so

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
market for selling the items too so

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.080 
market for selling the items too so
right<00:00:50.489> now<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.690> most<00:00:53.090> equipped

open maybe show some some of these

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:44.370 
open maybe show some some of these
things<00:01:32.149> are<00:01:32.560> why<00:01:33.560> people<00:01:33.590> buy<00:01:34.009> them

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.959 

it's<00:01:45.380> kind<00:01:45.649> of<00:01:45.710> like<00:01:45.829> two<00:01:46.100> different<00:01:46.250> fields

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
it's kind of like two different fields

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.840 
it's kind of like two different fields
are<00:01:47.180> both<00:01:47.420> involved<00:01:47.990> in<00:01:48.140> in<00:01:48.520> prospecting<00:01:49.520> that

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
are both involved in in prospecting that

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.990 
are both involved in in prospecting that
mental<00:01:50.840> locating<00:01:51.530> is<00:01:51.740> used<00:01:52.039> for<00:01:52.280> coins<00:01:52.640> and

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
mental locating is used for coins and

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.810 
mental locating is used for coins and
prospecting<00:01:53.930> these<00:01:54.170> dredges<00:01:54.530> dry<00:01:55.220> washers

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
prospecting these dredges dry washers

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.080 
prospecting these dredges dry washers
sluice<00:01:56.329> box<00:01:56.719> of<00:01:57.049> gold<00:01:57.380> pounds<00:01:58.009> are<00:01:58.579> all<00:01:58.820> made

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
sluice box of gold pounds are all made

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.249 
sluice box of gold pounds are all made
for<00:01:59.299> direct<00:01:59.659> gold<00:01:59.960> recovery<00:02:00.409> native<00:02:01.310> gold<00:02:02.259> but

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
for direct gold recovery native gold but

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.160 
for direct gold recovery native gold but
you<00:02:03.289> can<00:02:03.619> combine<00:02:04.100> them<00:02:04.280> all<00:02:04.929> dredges<00:02:05.929> like

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
you can combine them all dredges like

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.790 
you can combine them all dredges like
these<00:02:06.500> are<00:02:06.799> for<00:02:07.640> wet<00:02:08.000> systems<00:02:08.660> and<00:02:08.959> they're

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
these are for wet systems and they're

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.479 
these are for wet systems and they're
primarily<00:02:10.399> just<00:02:10.700> like<00:02:10.970> an<00:02:11.209> underwater<00:02:11.959> vacuum

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
primarily just like an underwater vacuum

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.250 
primarily just like an underwater vacuum
they<00:02:13.489> pull<00:02:13.760> up<00:02:13.940> all<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.299> rocks<00:02:14.569> and<00:02:14.870> or<00:02:15.080> and

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
they pull up all the rocks and or and

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.110 
they pull up all the rocks and or and
concentrate<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.130> heavy<00:02:16.340> metals<00:02:16.880> and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
concentrate the heavy metals and

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.650 
concentrate the heavy metals and
gemstones<00:02:18.069> if<00:02:19.069> there's<00:02:19.400> no<00:02:19.610> water<00:02:19.880> available

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
gemstones if there's no water available

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.589 
gemstones if there's no water available
then<00:02:20.959> you<00:02:20.989> go<00:02:21.290> with<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.560> dry<00:02:21.830> washers<00:02:22.599> they're

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
then you go with the dry washers they're

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.530 
then you go with the dry washers they're
the<00:02:24.260> same<00:02:24.670> principle<00:02:25.670> their<00:02:25.910> gravity

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
the same principle their gravity

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.710 
the same principle their gravity
recovery<00:02:27.230> systems<00:02:27.890> but<00:02:28.730> they<00:02:28.940> have<00:02:29.330> air

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
recovery systems but they have air
