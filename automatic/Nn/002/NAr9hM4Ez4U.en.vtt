here's a review of the carbon-fiber hood

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.360 
here's a review of the carbon-fiber hood
from<00:00:04.350> racing<00:00:05.009> Raven<00:00:05.570> got<00:00:06.570> it<00:00:06.660> from<00:00:06.779> eBay<00:00:07.370> looks

from racing Raven got it from eBay looks
good<00:00:08.639> from<00:00:08.820> afar<00:00:08.999> but<00:00:09.809> there's<00:00:10.259> some<00:00:10.889> issues

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:12.589

you can see on the sides you can see in
the<00:00:17.519> video<00:00:17.789> but<00:00:18.179> hangs<00:00:19.140> out<00:00:19.470> over<00:00:19.880> clearly<00:00:20.880> and

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
the video but hangs out over clearly and

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.970 
the video but hangs out over clearly and
you<00:00:21.449> can<00:00:21.570> see<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.779> molding<00:00:22.259> hanging<00:00:22.589> over<00:00:22.800> not

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
you can see the molding hanging over not

you can see the molding hanging over not
actually<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.550> carbon<00:00:23.789> fiber<00:00:24.320> and<00:00:25.320> there's<00:00:25.589> a

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
actually the carbon fiber and there's a

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.380 
actually the carbon fiber and there's a
pretty<00:00:25.859> good<00:00:26.099> sized<00:00:26.400> gap<00:00:28.789> along<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.089> top

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
pretty good sized gap along the top

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.810 
pretty good sized gap along the top
between<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.289> hood<00:00:31.589> bottom<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.580> hood<00:00:32.790> and

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
between the hood bottom of the hood and

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.640 
between the hood bottom of the hood and
the<00:00:33.120> top<00:00:33.330> of<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.540> grill<00:00:33.810> pretty<00:00:34.380> good<00:00:34.500> sized

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
the top of the grill pretty good sized

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.610 
the top of the grill pretty good sized
gap<00:00:34.890> there<00:00:35.750> same<00:00:36.750> problem<00:00:37.170> with<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.350> side

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
gap there same problem with the side

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.740 
gap there same problem with the side
hanging<00:00:38.010> over<00:00:39.440> also<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:42.030> molds<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.420> little<00:00:42.660> bit

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
hanging over also the molds a little bit

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.490 
hanging over also the molds a little bit
too<00:00:42.930> big<00:00:43.200> at<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.470> bottom<00:00:43.970> so<00:00:44.990> the<00:00:45.990> hood

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
too big at the bottom so the hood

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.010 
too big at the bottom so the hood
doesn't<00:00:47.010> close<00:00:47.400> all<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.760> way<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.840> they

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
doesn't close all the way and they

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.050 
doesn't close all the way and they
didn't<00:00:49.290> account<00:00:49.530> for<00:00:49.710> when<00:00:50.310> you<00:00:50.430> pop<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.880> hood

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
can see in a video by how to cut in here

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.820 
can see in a video by how to cut in here
because<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:06.299> sticks<00:02:06.900> out<00:02:07.049> too<00:02:07.260> far<00:02:07.470> for<00:02:07.740> the

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
because this sticks out too far for the

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.630 
because this sticks out too far for the
hood<00:02:08.329> even<00:02:09.329> line<00:02:09.539> up

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
hood even line up

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.360 
hood even line up
so<00:02:11.300> I<00:02:11.330> cut<00:02:11.720> actually<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.410> hood<00:02:12.620> just<00:02:13.070> to<00:02:13.190> make

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
so I cut actually the hood just to make

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.340 
so I cut actually the hood just to make

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
this fit over here you can kind of see

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.550 
this fit over here you can kind of see
us<00:02:18.470> well<00:02:18.740> it's<00:02:19.540> cut<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:20.810> then<00:02:20.930> pull<00:02:21.140> it<00:02:21.290> over<00:02:21.380> a
