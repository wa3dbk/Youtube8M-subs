weights<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.689> use<00:01:54.899> right<00:01:55.560> from<00:01:55.829> there<00:01:56.100> get

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
weights you use right from there get

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.929 
weights you use right from there get
that<00:01:57.090> like<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:58.130> take<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.340> up<00:01:59.520> there<00:01:59.759> like

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
that like that take that up there like

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:00.880 
that like that take that up there like
that

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
that

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.610 
that
and<00:02:01.040> then<00:02:01.370> just<00:02:01.690> twist<00:02:02.690> that<00:02:02.870> around<00:02:03.080> there

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
and then just twist that around there

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.760 
and then just twist that around there
like<00:02:03.800> that<00:02:04.220> they<00:02:04.970> got<00:02:05.150> quite<00:02:05.300> firmed<00:02:05.900> and<00:02:06.380> then

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
like that they got quite firmed and then

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.400 
like that they got quite firmed and then
just<00:02:06.950> even<00:02:07.340> this<00:02:07.520> up<00:02:07.790> so<00:02:08.330> is<00:02:08.390> that<00:02:08.570> right<00:02:09.200> now

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
just even this up so is that right now

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.960 
just even this up so is that right now
you<00:02:09.470> need<00:02:09.649> to<00:02:09.710> just<00:02:09.950> make<00:02:10.190> sure<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:10.729> you've

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
you need to just make sure that you've

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.460 
you need to just make sure that you've
got<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.240> to<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.510> right<00:02:11.690> depth<00:02:11.960> because<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.290> want

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
got it to the right depth because I want

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.380 
got it to the right depth because I want
this<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:12.710> be<00:02:12.740> a<00:02:12.860> circle<00:02:13.340> again<00:02:13.430> always<00:02:13.820> I<00:02:14.030> like

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
this to be a circle again always I like

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.570 
this to be a circle again always I like
a<00:02:14.450> growth<00:02:14.780> circle<00:02:15.380> it's<00:02:16.310> like<00:02:16.460> the

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
a growth circle it's like the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.090 
a growth circle it's like the
completeness<00:02:17.000> of<00:02:17.180> life<00:02:17.570> is<00:02:17.780> in<00:02:17.930> myself<00:02:18.170> right

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
completeness of life is in myself right

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.520 
completeness of life is in myself right
that<00:02:19.310> goes<00:02:19.490> into<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:20.000> air<00:02:20.180> like<00:02:20.690> that<00:02:20.720> being

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
that goes into the air like that being

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.900 
that goes into the air like that being
careful<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:21.980> you<00:02:22.130> don't<00:02:22.250> get<00:02:22.430> around<00:02:22.700> those

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
careful that you don't get around those

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.650 
careful that you don't get around those
roots<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.690> then<00:02:24.290> it's<00:02:24.740> just<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.250> matter<00:02:25.490> of

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
roots and then it's just a matter of

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.540 
roots and then it's just a matter of
gently<00:02:26.660> because<00:02:27.290> they<00:02:27.440> are<00:02:27.560> quite<00:02:27.860> fragile<00:02:28.220> at

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
gently because they are quite fragile at

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.060 
gently because they are quite fragile at
this<00:02:28.700> stage<00:02:29.000> just<00:02:29.410> winding<00:02:30.410> that<00:02:30.590> around

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
this stage just winding that around

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.530 
this stage just winding that around
there<00:02:31.310> like<00:02:31.520> that<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.209> then<00:02:32.860> repeating<00:02:33.860> on

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
there like that and then repeating on

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.000 
there like that and then repeating on
this<00:02:35.540> side<00:02:36.350> like<00:02:37.280> so<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:39.110> make<00:02:39.709> sure<00:02:39.890> that

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
this side like so and make sure that

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.260 
this side like so and make sure that
when<00:02:40.160> you're<00:02:40.280> doing<00:02:40.430> your<00:02:40.580> little<00:02:40.910> circle

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
when you're doing your little circle

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.360 
when you're doing your little circle
that<00:02:41.390> you<00:02:41.450> don't<00:02:41.690> get<00:02:41.810> them<00:02:41.959> too<00:02:42.140> big<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:43.010> also

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
that you don't get them too big and also

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.190 
that you don't get them too big and also
just<00:02:43.610> make<00:02:43.880> sure<00:02:44.300> that<00:02:44.330> they're<00:02:44.690> going<00:02:44.900> the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
just make sure that they're going the

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.860 
just make sure that they're going the
right<00:02:45.470> way<00:02:45.530> and<00:02:46.250> just<00:02:46.820> keep<00:02:46.940> twisting<00:02:47.720> that

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
right way and just keep twisting that

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.840 
right way and just keep twisting that
around<00:02:48.140> there<00:02:48.350> or<00:02:48.560> if<00:02:48.980> you've<00:02:49.220> got<00:02:49.400> big<00:02:49.580> long

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
around there or if you've got big long

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.000 
around there or if you've got big long
ones<00:02:50.090> you<00:02:50.209> could<00:02:50.360> actually<00:02:50.510> even<00:02:50.870> plate<00:02:51.800> those

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
ones you could actually even plate those

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.979 
ones you could actually even plate those
around<00:02:52.220> so<00:02:52.340> just<00:02:52.459> V<00:02:52.760> now<00:02:53.450> this<00:02:53.600> is<00:02:53.720> going<00:02:53.870> to

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
around so just V now this is going to

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.580 
around so just V now this is going to
take<00:02:54.200> time<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:55.190> I<00:02:55.760> like<00:02:56.330> that<00:02:56.540> I'm<00:02:57.020> using<00:02:57.260> razor

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
take time it I like that I'm using razor

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.590 
take time it I like that I'm using razor
it's<00:02:57.860> gonna<00:02:57.980> take<00:02:58.160> time<00:02:58.430> huh<00:02:58.670> really<00:02:59.360> funny

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
it's gonna take time huh really funny

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.320 
it's gonna take time huh really funny
right<00:03:00.080> just<00:03:00.530> that<00:03:00.650> as<00:03:00.830> this<00:03:01.310> grows<00:03:01.700> just<00:03:02.090> keep

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
right just that as this grows just keep

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.390 
right just that as this grows just keep
twisting<00:03:02.870> that<00:03:03.050> around<00:03:03.380> until<00:03:03.680> it<00:03:04.010> gets<00:03:04.220> to

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
twisting that around until it gets to

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.370 
twisting that around until it gets to
the<00:03:04.520> other<00:03:04.640> side<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.209> I<00:03:05.570> wouldn't<00:03:05.900> tie<00:03:06.140> it<00:03:06.200> off

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
the other side and I wouldn't tie it off

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.780 
the other side and I wouldn't tie it off
I<00:03:06.590> just<00:03:06.650> leave<00:03:07.160> it<00:03:07.310> like<00:03:07.459> that

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
I just leave it like that

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.759 
I just leave it like that
and<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:08.090> think<00:03:08.150> that<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.480> series<00:03:08.900> of<00:03:08.930> those<00:03:09.230> all

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
and I think that a series of those all

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.830 
and I think that a series of those all
along<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:10.370> bench<00:03:10.580> in<00:03:10.910> your<00:03:11.060> kitchen<00:03:11.450> or<00:03:11.660> on<00:03:11.690> a

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
along the bench in your kitchen or on a

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.900 
along the bench in your kitchen or on a
table<00:03:12.140> could<00:03:12.440> look<00:03:12.590> really<00:03:12.739> nice<00:03:12.980> even<00:03:13.760> if

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
table could look really nice even if

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.670 
table could look really nice even if
you're<00:03:14.060> having<00:03:14.330> a<00:03:14.390> dinner<00:03:14.600> party<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:15.290> it's

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
you're having a dinner party and it's

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.830 
you're having a dinner party and it's

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
and lamb these running along a table

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.880 
and lamb these running along a table
