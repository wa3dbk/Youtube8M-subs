00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
a few stages but I thought I raced my

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.120

struggling<00:00:12.000> quite<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.450> bit<00:00:12.630> especially<00:00:12.719> with

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
struggling quite a bit especially with

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.450

the<00:00:13.139> beginning<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.530> my<00:00:13.679> matches<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.250> today<00:00:14.429> I

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
the beginning of my matches and today I

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.029 
the beginning of my matches and today I
came<00:00:14.580> out<00:00:14.849> there<00:00:15.059> very<00:00:15.870> well<00:00:16.020> focus<00:00:16.500> didn't

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
came out there very well focus didn't

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.230 
came out there very well focus didn't
really<00:00:17.190> make<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.369> lot<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.580> unforced<00:00:18.029> errors

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
really make a lot of unforced errors

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.700 
really make a lot of unforced errors
like<00:00:18.390> I've<00:00:18.480> done<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:19.109> other<00:00:19.230> matches<00:00:19.439> before

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
nervous action before the match but when

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.030 
nervous action before the match but when
I<00:00:39.390> went<00:00:39.600> out<00:00:39.719> there<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:40.230> was<00:00:40.379> pretty<00:00:40.590> relaxed

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
I went out there I was pretty relaxed

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.799 
I went out there I was pretty relaxed
and<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.399> felt<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.000> was<00:00:42.149> really<00:00:42.360> going<00:00:42.540> for

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
and and felt that was really going for

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.690 
and and felt that was really going for
my<00:00:42.930> serves<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.829> having<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.280> think<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.550> really

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
my serves and having I think a really

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.279 
my serves and having I think a really
high<00:00:44.879> percentage<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.360> service<00:00:45.660> just<00:00:45.930> take<00:00:46.230> it

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
high percentage of service just take it

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.479 
high percentage of service just take it
like<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.440> championship<00:00:46.860> point<00:00:47.160> once<00:00:47.370> again

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
like a championship point once again

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.540 
like a championship point once again

think that I would be able to pull

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.370 
think that I would be able to pull
through<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.479> play<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.750> kind<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.020> tennis
