00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.840
 bwh 8 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.090
 The first time for the first time has been appeared in this series 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.670
 indeed 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:23.510
 To then advanced helpful? If so like 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:25.600
 I saw it hard and my shoulder was not tired, but I was tired and Nakahata ran over the bridge 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.810
 But it this way was no longer tired 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:35.690
 3 years ago in one of the checked at the time 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:41.090
 The amount of practice , for example, the amount of humidity , the frequency with which you enter the tournament 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:44.579
 It feels like you're really crying, so it's Jerky that's why not now now 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.670
 The last check site is my best regards 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.600
 There Han 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.600
 Well then let's let the house check the form of Mr. Nagai again 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.670
 It is a dynamic running form that fully uses Hanshin 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:10.790
 However, I was not aware of the panoramic view of the upper body 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.790
 I'm trying to run by relying on the power of my feet, so it 's a bad way of running the law 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.430
 Next, let's check from the front and the back 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.690
 Hey there is a considerable difference between right and left to the arm swing 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.320
 I can hardly play my right elbow 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.570
 Therefore I can not be aware of the body axis 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:34.720
 Upper body seems to be shaking violently 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.720
 But you can fix it with a barker 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.690
 The power of the hands and shoulders comes off so much a 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:49.180
 I was I a, but after all this foot I still 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:52.360
 It's too much movement, and there are places where the spine school is twisted a little 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.860
 Toka place that is not able to properly the foreground too much moving the feet 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.500
 It is the after 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:01.750
 The arm swing is a little different at the right time, but the right shoulder shell has not moved either, so one by one 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:07.290
 It's hard to beat anything else 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.290
 Arm swing of the enemy running in at Kanechotto situ Let's look back at the tag 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.050
 It was possible this time 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.740
 It's a little pervert but is it time to do it 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.740
 operation 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:27.050
 It will on Yomi was wearing probably easier tried out actor 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:29.080
 Because it softened the upper part of the wear with this, it spreads so well 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.280
 Is not 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.280
 Please first bridge 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.620

 Next stop 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.709
 I will start running, I will not go through a long time 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:52.889
 I'll fall for the first time without a foot 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:57.840
 If it falls down , energy will be attached to your feet later 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:59.410
 Go ahead jazz date born to walk mice put with a foot after the hem of energy 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.230

 It was better with Oh this era or better foot 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.510
 Click 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:19.569

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.909

 This person 3 seems so 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:29.939
 I do not have much 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.939

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.920
 It is a good benefit 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.690
 With that 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.319
 This is a stretch for capture numbers 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.610
 Red Tyne 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.740

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.920
 Healing 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.040

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.220
 Stretch out 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.220
 Hakata straight 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.049
 I just wake up straight 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.750
 You're a little tired 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.750
 House 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.829
 voodoo 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:21.400
 In this becomes soft and N pelvis 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:24.570
 It's not Japan that moves in the pelvis or something like this 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.660
 In what is easily than foreground gold and is this 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:32.390
 It will be decided to defeat 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:35.720
 Yeah feet only keep up with traces please with after you have been picking Tsu or footprints's prohibited 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:39.440
 Likely to please say a president positions 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.810
 Legs only go forward with only is tilted forward will follow 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.370
 Bone 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.610
 I could do it 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:53.979
 Well then let's twist and pop layers can't do it 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:53.979
 This still remains made the self is ok Agozai underneath rather than the day-to-day issue 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:00.850
 Curran that deviates Te foot Haa white 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.160
 Conduct of business by simply rotating But to improve a little 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.780
 Ahead yes 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.070
 Remains of the arm swing arm only main Te day 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.070
 Moth 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:18.229
 ok ig yes 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:23.520
 After all, when is it to move this kind of is behavior that I'm 73 probably Andake feet What this running 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:28.979
 I kinda I think I know image say this when running 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:33.530
 Enter from go forward only to be conscious even before without using the falling even before before teamed up before before 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.530
 That's right to say yes 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:41.050
 Hmm 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:41.050
 Check the modified form from the side 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:49.310
 It can now be tilted forward aware of the state 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.430
 You can also be aware of the correct jack points 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.140
 Ah 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.140
 It is very natural weight shift 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:13.790
 Next check from front and back 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:19.270
 I was able to swing the arm in a balanced manner on the left and right, so the blur of the state was suppressed 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:19.270
 I was there to smooth also linked the upper body and the can half-length 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:32.780
 What if you compare it with the pre-modification screen and the revision agreement screen 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:36.170
 It it is understood well the movement of the correction before and compared leg was greater in the song is suppressed 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:39.550
 In addition, as we can be aware of cooperation well 

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.550
 Muse is weight transfer 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:51.480
 Next let's look from the front and the back 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:55.590
 Before correction, it was an unbalanced form that left and right the state, but after correction it is less swaying 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:58.710
 Sense of stability 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.660
 It has been running for 5 years and has a long running history 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:06.830
 Mr. Nagai who has a running ability 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:06.830
 Please enjoy running from now on aiming at the stability of the form further
