00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
to record on so the legs on the tripod

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.670 
to record on so the legs on the tripod
are<00:01:17.430> flexible<00:01:17.970> like<00:01:18.180> i<00:01:18.360> said<00:01:18.720> i'm<00:01:18.960> as<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.560> can

tell from the video i'm rotating the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.850 
tell from the video i'm rotating the
legs<00:01:21.420> left<00:01:21.780> right<00:01:22.049> up<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.380> down<00:01:22.470> whichever

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
legs left right up and down whichever

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.109 
legs left right up and down whichever
way<00:01:23.040> i<00:01:23.070> want<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.340> take<00:01:23.520> them<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.820> they<00:01:23.909> will

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
way i want to take them and they will

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.640 
way i want to take them and they will
rotate<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.750> direction<00:01:25.080> which<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.470> really

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
rotate that direction which is really

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.370 
rotate that direction which is really
nice<00:01:25.830> they're<00:01:26.369> flexible<00:01:26.759> but<00:01:27.150> they<00:01:27.630> aren't<00:01:28.170> so

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
nice they're flexible but they aren't so

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.960 
nice they're flexible but they aren't so
easily<00:01:28.590> flex<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.220> once<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.549> wrap<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.790> around

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
easily flex that once you wrap it around

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.370 
easily flex that once you wrap it around
something<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.570> they're<00:01:30.750> going<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> come<00:01:31.140> on

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
something that they're going to come on

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.530 
something that they're going to come on
flex<00:01:31.740> or<00:01:31.920> anything<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.329> that's

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
flex or anything like that so that's

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.580 
flex or anything like that so that's
really<00:01:33.659> nice<00:01:33.900> because<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.320> means<00:01:34.470> that

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
really nice because it means that

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.960 
really nice because it means that
whenever<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:35.040> wrap<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.250> around<00:01:35.460> it's<00:01:35.790> going

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
whenever you wrap it around it's going

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.370 
whenever you wrap it around it's going
to<00:01:36.030> stay<00:01:36.240> wrapped<00:01:36.509> around<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.869> until<00:01:37.350> you

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
to stay wrapped around that until you

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.260 
to stay wrapped around that until you
want<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> take<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.100> off<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.909> your<00:01:39.030> video

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
want to take it off so that your video

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.789 
want to take it off so that your video
is<00:01:39.479> nice<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.840> sturdy<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.350> there's<00:01:40.500> not<00:01:40.619> any

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
is nice and sturdy and there's not any

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.990 
is nice and sturdy and there's not any
shaking<00:01:41.159> or<00:01:41.220> anything<00:01:41.460> like<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:41.880> not

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
shaking or anything like that it's not

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.310 
shaking or anything like that it's not
going<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.210> fall<00:01:42.390> off<00:01:42.600> which<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.840> really<00:01:43.140> nice

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
going to fall off which is really nice

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.440 
going to fall off which is really nice
alright<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.579> head<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.850> tripod<00:01:45.240> is

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
alright so the head of the tripod is

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.240 
alright so the head of the tripod is
ball<00:01:45.720> mounted<00:01:46.079> on<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.770> legs<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
ball mounted on to the legs of the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.740 
ball mounted on to the legs of the
tripod<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.030> means<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.509> will<00:01:48.720> be

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
tripod so this means that you will be

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.690 
tripod so this means that you will be
able<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.290> rotate<00:01:49.649> your<00:01:50.040> phone<00:01:50.280> or<00:01:50.520> whatever

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
able to rotate your phone or whatever

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.850 
able to rotate your phone or whatever
device<00:01:51.060> you're<00:01:51.240> recording<00:01:51.479> with<00:01:51.659> 360<00:01:52.590> degrees

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
device you're recording with 360 degrees

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.950 
device you're recording with 360 degrees
no<00:01:53.159> problem<00:01:53.790> because<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.420> does<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.780> ball

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
no problem because it does have the ball

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.480 
no problem because it does have the ball
mount<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.409> will<00:01:55.530> be<00:01:55.649> able<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.860> rotate<00:01:56.159> it

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
mount so you will be able to rotate it

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.789 
mount so you will be able to rotate it
and<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.759> all<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:56.909> also<00:01:57.360> tilt<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.409> little<00:01:58.439> bit

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
and you all can also tilt a little bit

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.770 
and you all can also tilt a little bit
because<00:01:58.920> there<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.430> indent<00:02:00.149> in<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.509> ball

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
because there is a indent in the ball

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.959 
because there is a indent in the ball
mount<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.649> will<00:02:01.710> allow<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.219> tilt<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.790> so

mount that will allow you to tilt it so

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.010 
mount that will allow you to tilt it so
that<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.180> can<00:02:03.329> go<00:02:03.420> from<00:02:03.600> portrait<00:02:03.930> to

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
that you can go from portrait to

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.780 
that you can go from portrait to
landscape<00:02:04.320> mode<00:02:04.619> no<00:02:04.950> problem<00:02:05.340> whichever<00:02:05.640> way

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
landscape mode no problem whichever way

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.399

you<00:02:05.850> want<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.719> get<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.869> best<00:02:07.049> angle<00:02:07.380> for

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
you want to to get the best angle for

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.960 
you want to to get the best angle for
your<00:02:07.619> video<00:02:07.890> but<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.399> like<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.580> ball<00:02:08.819> mount

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
your video but I like the ball mount

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.070 
your video but I like the ball mount

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
because it just means that you'll be

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.050 
because it just means that you'll be
able<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.410> rotate<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:10.920> 360<00:02:11.670> degrees<00:02:11.910> without

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
able to rotate this 360 degrees without

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.910 
able to rotate this 360 degrees without
actually<00:02:12.540> taking<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.989> tripod<00:02:13.379> off<00:02:13.530> what<00:02:13.739> you
