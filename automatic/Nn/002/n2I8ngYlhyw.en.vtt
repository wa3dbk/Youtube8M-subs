00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
nice basic drawing and then we get into

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.570 
nice basic drawing and then we get into
the<00:01:18.869> actual<00:01:19.320> adding<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.979> colors<00:01:20.369> or

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580

the actual adding of the colors or
things<00:01:20.790> like<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.900> i'm<00:01:22.229> adding<00:01:22.799> this

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
things like that so i'm adding this

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
things like that so i'm adding this
black<00:01:23.220> onto<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.790> nude<00:01:24.150> color<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.670> for<00:01:26.670> this

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
black onto the nude color and for this

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.510 
black onto the nude color and for this
one<00:01:27.150> we're<00:01:27.420> going<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.780> do<00:01:28.130> horizontal<00:01:29.130> stripes

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
one we're going to do horizontal stripes

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.800 
one we're going to do horizontal stripes
because<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.990> other<00:01:31.290> ones<00:01:31.650> i<00:01:31.920> did<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.810> vertical

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
because the other ones i did a vertical

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.859 
because the other ones i did a vertical
stripe<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.670> diagonal<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:36.240> one<00:01:36.509> here<00:01:36.750> we're

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
stripe a diagonal this one here we're

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.960 
stripe a diagonal this one here we're
doing<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.229> horizontal<00:01:37.619> stripe<00:01:38.340> line<00:01:38.610> and

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
doing that horizontal stripe line and

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.450 
doing that horizontal stripe line and
then<00:01:39.540> as<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.350> see<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.619> nice<00:01:40.799> ones<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.130> stripe

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
then as you see the nice ones a stripe

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.730 
then as you see the nice ones a stripe
so<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.119> pattern<00:01:42.600> when<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.439> do

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
so you can do that pattern when you do

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.210 
so you can do that pattern when you do
the<00:01:44.130> stripes<00:01:44.430> it's<00:01:44.850> much<00:01:45.420> easier<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:46.530> move

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
the stripes it's much easier to move

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.530 
the stripes it's much easier to move
your<00:01:47.549> nail<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.450> let<00:01:49.350> your<00:01:49.590> hands<00:01:50.399> slide<00:01:50.880> as

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
your nail and let your hands slide as

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.710 
your nail and let your hands slide as
you<00:01:51.780> see<00:01:52.020> across<00:01:52.970> versus<00:01:53.970> trying<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.540> make<00:01:54.689> a

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
you see across versus trying to make a

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.450 
you see across versus trying to make a
straight<00:01:55.020> line<00:01:55.200> with<00:01:55.409> just<00:01:55.590> your<00:01:55.710> hand<00:01:55.950> you'll

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
straight line with just your hand you'll

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.680 
straight line with just your hand you'll
make<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> nice

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
make a nice

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.190 
make a nice
even<00:01:58.020> light<00:01:58.580> so<00:01:59.580> i<00:01:59.640> just<00:01:59.880> see<00:02:00.060> i<00:02:00.090> put<00:02:00.480> those<00:02:00.750> two

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
even light so i just see i put those two

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.160 
even light so i just see i put those two

of it it's for lux of course and i'm
going<00:04:31.820> to<00:04:31.880> use<00:04:32.120> this<00:04:32.420> color<00:04:33.200> to<00:04:33.710> create<00:04:34.100> a

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
going to use this color to create a

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.000 
going to use this color to create a
contrast<00:04:34.910> between<00:04:35.150> that<00:04:35.990> white<00:04:36.380> stripe<00:04:36.800> and

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
contrast between that white stripe and

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.820 
contrast between that white stripe and
that<00:04:37.130> blue<00:04:37.400> stripe<00:04:37.760> there<00:04:38.060> so<00:04:38.780> what's<00:04:39.470> really

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
that blue stripe there so what's really

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.000 
that blue stripe there so what's really
good<00:04:40.100> is<00:04:40.130> to<00:04:40.610> use<00:04:40.880> colors<00:04:41.870> that<00:04:41.900> are<00:04:42.440> light<00:04:42.800> and

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
good is to use colors that are light and

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.340 
good is to use colors that are light and
dark<00:04:43.400> right<00:04:43.970> next<00:04:44.330> to<00:04:44.390> each<00:04:44.420> other<00:04:44.630> so<00:04:44.930> pop<00:04:45.320> a

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
dark right next to each other so pop a

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.230 
dark right next to each other so pop a
little<00:04:45.590> bit<00:04:45.770> more<00:04:45.980> so<00:04:46.430> that<00:04:46.460> makes<00:04:46.850> the<00:04:47.030> white

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
little bit more so that makes the white

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.870 
little bit more so that makes the white
line<00:04:47.450> pop<00:04:47.780> there<00:04:48.110> more<00:04:48.410> and<00:04:48.710> then<00:04:49.550> because

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
line pop there more and then because

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.090 
line pop there more and then because
it's<00:04:50.120> also<00:04:50.330> darker<00:04:51.020> than<00:04:51.170> that<00:04:51.380> baby<00:04:51.680> blue

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
it's also darker than that baby blue

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.580 
it's also darker than that baby blue
it'll<00:04:52.730> look<00:04:52.880> great<00:04:53.140> standing<00:04:54.140> right<00:04:54.290> next<00:04:54.440> to

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
it'll look great standing right next to

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.230 
it'll look great standing right next to
the<00:04:54.710> baby<00:04:54.920> blue<00:04:55.130> so<00:04:55.340> keep<00:04:55.580> that<00:04:55.610> in<00:04:55.790> mind<00:04:55.880> with

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
the baby blue so keep that in mind with

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.660 
the baby blue so keep that in mind with
picking<00:04:56.600> what<00:04:56.750> colors<00:04:57.170> to<00:04:57.470> put<00:04:58.100> next<00:04:58.310> to<00:04:58.490> each

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
picking what colors to put next to each

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.230 
picking what colors to put next to each
other<00:04:59.170> so<00:05:00.170> I<00:05:00.470> chose<00:05:00.860> to<00:05:01.040> do<00:05:01.190> a<00:05:01.220> yellow<00:05:01.790> as<00:05:02.000> my

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
there's little codes it's all about just

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.409

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
contrast so next it's a good idea to

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.110 
contrast so next it's a good idea to
take<00:05:30.200> a<00:05:30.230> look<00:05:30.530> at<00:05:30.740> your<00:05:30.890> nail<00:05:31.190> and<00:05:31.460> kind<00:05:31.790> of<00:05:31.880> see

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
if you need to clean up a little bit or

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.550 
if you need to clean up a little bit or
if<00:05:34.820> you<00:05:35.150> feel<00:05:35.390> like<00:05:35.600> there's<00:05:35.870> a<00:05:35.930> color<00:05:36.290> that

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
if you feel like there's a color that

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.260 
if you feel like there's a color that
should<00:05:36.830> be<00:05:36.980> somewhere<00:05:37.430> or<00:05:37.760> a<00:05:37.790> color<00:05:38.180> that's

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
should be somewhere or a color that's

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.360 
should be somewhere or a color that's
missing<00:05:38.960> so<00:05:39.440> that's<00:05:39.590> basically<00:05:39.740> what<00:05:40.250> I'm

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
missing so that's basically what I'm

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.520 
missing so that's basically what I'm
doing<00:05:40.400> that<00:05:40.880> I<00:05:40.940> decided<00:05:41.600> to<00:05:41.840> add<00:05:41.990> a<00:05:42.020> little<00:05:42.140> bit

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
doing that I decided to add a little bit

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.400 
doing that I decided to add a little bit
more<00:05:43.220> of<00:05:43.550> black<00:05:44.240> in<00:05:44.600> there<00:05:44.750> so<00:05:44.990> I<00:05:45.050> added<00:05:45.230> some

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
more of black in there so I added some

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.740 
more of black in there so I added some
black<00:05:45.770> dots<00:05:46.160> to<00:05:46.490> kind<00:05:46.790> of<00:05:46.820> even<00:05:47.000> it<00:05:47.180> out<00:05:47.300> just

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
going to do whatever you feel would make

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.040 
going to do whatever you feel would make
the<00:05:49.880> pattern<00:05:50.240> pop<00:05:50.780> more<00:05:51.200> and<00:05:51.790> then<00:05:52.790> I<00:05:53.300> use<00:05:53.750> like

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050
