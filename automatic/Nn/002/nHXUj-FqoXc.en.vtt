three two by twos thick ones on top of

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.400 
three two by twos thick ones on top of
that<00:01:08.200> doesn't<00:01:09.200> matter<00:01:09.290> what<00:01:09.500> color<00:01:11.260> so<00:01:12.260> it's

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
that doesn't matter what color so it's

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.160 
that doesn't matter what color so it's
just<00:01:12.650> like<00:01:12.890> that<00:01:13.540> makes<00:01:14.540> you<00:01:14.690> flip<00:01:14.960> it<00:01:15.080> around

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
just like that makes you flip it around

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.500 
just like that makes you flip it around
to<00:01:15.440> this<00:01:15.710> side<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:16.420> take<00:01:17.420> a<00:01:17.480> 2<00:01:17.750> by<00:01:17.930> 6<00:01:19.300> push<00:01:20.300> that

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
to this side you take a 2 by 6 push that

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.320 
to this side you take a 2 by 6 push that
right<00:01:20.720> here<00:01:22.930> then<00:01:23.930> you<00:01:24.050> take<00:01:25.090> two<00:01:26.090> of<00:01:26.120> these

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
right here then you take two of these

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.510 
right here then you take two of these
like<00:01:26.570> window<00:01:27.050> pieces<00:01:27.590> put<00:01:27.890> them<00:01:28.010> on<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:28.250> side

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
like window pieces put them on the side

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.390 
like window pieces put them on the side
but<00:01:29.420> instead<00:01:29.780> of<00:01:30.140> using<00:01:30.409> a<00:01:30.620> window<00:01:30.950> piece<00:01:31.220> you

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
but instead of using a window piece you

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.170 
but instead of using a window piece you
can<00:01:31.550> just<00:01:31.730> use<00:01:32.380> 2<00:01:33.380> regular<00:01:33.980> to<00:01:34.310> buy<00:01:34.520> ones<00:01:34.790> on

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
can just use 2 regular to buy ones on

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.690 
can just use 2 regular to buy ones on
top<00:01:35.420> just<00:01:36.380> eight<00:01:36.650> kind<00:01:36.920> and<00:01:37.220> that'll<00:01:37.520> be

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
top just eight kind and that'll be

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.250 
top just eight kind and that'll be
that'll<00:01:38.180> work<00:01:38.390> this<00:01:38.630> is<00:01:38.810> fine

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
that'll work this is fine

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.940 
that'll work this is fine
I<00:01:40.000> guess<00:01:41.000> I<00:01:41.090> just<00:01:41.120> like<00:01:41.480> these<00:01:41.659> better<00:01:41.950> put

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
I guess I just like these better put

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.170 
I guess I just like these better put
those<00:01:43.100> like<00:01:43.310> that<00:01:44.350> then<00:01:45.350> you<00:01:45.500> put<00:01:45.740> two<00:01:46.340> two<00:01:46.970> by

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
those like that then you put two two by

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.530 
those like that then you put two two by
ones

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
ones

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:56.010 
ones
