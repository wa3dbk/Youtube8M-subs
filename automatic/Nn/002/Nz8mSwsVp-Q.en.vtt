these<00:01:23.920> are<00:01:24.130> quite<00:01:24.250> different<00:01:24.610> how<00:01:25.360> do<00:01:25.420> you

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
these are quite different how do you

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.840 
these are quite different how do you
find<00:01:25.810> them<00:01:26.050> they<00:01:26.500> are<00:01:26.950> quite<00:01:27.370> different<00:01:27.580> I

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
find them they are quite different I

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.220 
find them they are quite different I
think<00:01:27.880> different<00:01:28.600> to<00:01:28.690> what<00:01:28.780> I<00:01:28.810> would<00:01:29.080> usually

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
think different to what I would usually

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.890 
think different to what I would usually
wear<00:01:29.590> and<00:01:30.190> I<00:01:30.670> like<00:01:30.850> them<00:01:31.060> because<00:01:31.090> they<00:01:31.690> have

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
wear and I like them because they have

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.480 
wear and I like them because they have
the<00:01:32.110> two<00:01:32.290> sides<00:01:32.620> for<00:01:32.860> them<00:01:32.980> so<00:01:33.160> there's<00:01:33.340> two

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
the two sides for them so there's two

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.390 
the two sides for them so there's two
different<00:01:33.520> sides<00:01:34.000> Bush<00:01:34.360> this<00:01:35.320> opaque<00:01:35.890> is

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
different sides Bush this opaque is

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.190 
different sides Bush this opaque is
still<00:01:36.670> on<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:36.940> force<00:01:37.120> which<00:01:37.630> is<00:01:37.660> really<00:01:38.050> nice

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
still on the force which is really nice

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.720 
still on the force which is really nice
but<00:01:38.440> then<00:01:38.620> it<00:01:38.740> comes<00:01:38.920> off<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.190> side<00:01:39.370> and<00:01:39.400> it's

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
but then it comes off the side and it's

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:40.890 
but then it comes off the side and it's
slightly<00:01:39.910> different<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.540> I<00:01:40.600> think<00:01:40.810> they

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
slightly different and I think they

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:57.700 
slightly different and I think they
might<00:01:41.110> elongates<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:42.190> legs<00:01:42.460> and<00:01:42.580> make

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.770 

you
