00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
from what the research that I did it

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.520

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
looked like the server wasn't it was a

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.190 
looked like the server wasn't it was a
casual<00:01:44.040> RP<00:01:44.549> server<00:01:44.790> since<00:01:45.659> we're<00:01:45.840> definitely

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
casual RP server since we're definitely

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.920 
casual RP server since we're definitely
not<00:01:46.560> pro<00:01:47.040> our<00:01:47.250> peers<00:01:47.579> by<00:01:47.970> any<00:01:48.180> means<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.750> mean

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
not pro our peers by any means I mean

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.780 
not pro our peers by any means I mean
just<00:01:49.170> look<00:01:49.560> at<00:01:49.680> Nicola<00:01:50.070> right<00:01:50.189> now<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.640> this

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
just look at Nicola right now is this

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.200 
just look at Nicola right now is this
for<00:01:50.909> anybody<00:01:51.299> with<00:01:51.390> water<00:01:51.829> so<00:01:52.909> this<00:01:53.909> was<00:01:54.090> I

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
for anybody with water so this was I

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.460 
for anybody with water so this was I
think<00:01:54.270> it'll<00:01:54.600> be<00:01:54.720> an<00:01:54.780> interesting<00:01:54.899> server

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
think it'll be an interesting server

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.130 
think it'll be an interesting server
with<00:01:55.740> being<00:01:55.920> an<00:01:56.040> RP<00:01:56.460> PvP<00:01:57.030> who<00:01:57.329> knows<00:01:57.600> what<00:01:57.960> kind

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
with being an RP PvP who knows what kind

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.980 
with being an RP PvP who knows what kind
of<00:01:58.259> moments<00:01:58.710> will<00:01:58.829> run<00:01:59.009> into<00:01:59.479> fire

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
of moments will run into fire

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.800 
of moments will run into fire
okay<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:03.520> first<00:02:03.729> few<00:02:04.090> episodes<00:02:04.119> might<00:02:04.720> be

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
okay the first few episodes might be

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.590 
okay the first few episodes might be
kind<00:02:05.049> of<00:02:05.110> slow<00:02:05.380> but<00:02:05.619> hopefully<00:02:06.460> as<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:07.240> series

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
kind of slow but hopefully as the series

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.010 
kind of slow but hopefully as the series
goes<00:02:07.630> on<00:02:07.990> you<00:02:08.560> run<00:02:08.860> into<00:02:09.160> some<00:02:09.369> good<00:02:09.550> sleep

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020
