one<00:02:52.580> big<00:02:52.610> family<00:02:58.450> if<00:02:59.450> I<00:02:59.600> had<00:02:59.750> to<00:02:59.840> do<00:02:59.989> it<00:03:00.110> all

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230

over again I think I'd do the same thing
because<00:03:02.560> after<00:03:03.560> all<00:03:03.680> there<00:03:03.950> were<00:03:04.450> many<00:03:05.450> things

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750
