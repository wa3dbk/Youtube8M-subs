00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.129
 The 2015 e3 is already underway with all the 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.900
 Legion of developers ready to 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.600
 talk about the characteristics of their 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.400
 new games fifa 16 is one of the 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.680
 titles that are going to make their debut playable 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.840
 at the angelina fair but a few days ago 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.630
 it was already held at santiago bernabéu 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.369
 an anticipated presentation in it 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.619
 we could talk to sebastián enrique 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.990
 producer of the saga that with its lip 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.090
 Argentina told us some details of 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.770
 this new delivery how has been the 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.510
 change in the work process in and 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.039
 sports because of course there are three 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.129
 generations you started with ps2 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.530
 xbox and gamecube logo wine psc this 60 already 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.510
 you are with pc 4 xbox one as has been the 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.280
 change in the study changed a lot 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.979
 change at the structure level in exchange for 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.629
 level of number of people at the level of 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.629
 tools that one has development to 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.969
 support level for example are 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.010
 agreements when I was doing the 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:03.819
 demos in fifa is the 6 for playstation2 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.369
 that is, one went and made his own records 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:09.010
 all the time and to see how they came out 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.050
 well now a whole media team that 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.520
 prepare the discs are 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.979
 digital forms too 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.409
 it's at the level of a bit of technology but 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.689
 I change many teams with the years of 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.210
 structure because also what is everything 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.530
 the all that life support is a 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.390
 Once the game is not that one is 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.270
 forget that the game goes out on the street 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.979
 but there is a huge structure of 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.329
 people who are seeing the whole subject of what 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.450
 what is security 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.819
 which is the online servers all the 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.299
 subject of what is let's say the 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.590
 Ultimate team promotions everything 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.649
 is the team of the week all the 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.659
 updates week by week from the 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.479
 which are the suspensions from which 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.539
 are the injured or is it very much 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.369
 let's say the complexity of what is 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:58.549
 develop a triple game at that price 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.069
 very much but one one is adapting 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.530
 with the industry one is adapting 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.640
 from the need that the 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.649
 gamers 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.170
 and the game that one produces and one always 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.270
 wants to say 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.489
 push the limits push the limits 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.900
 for another side and good and that requires 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.050
 changes all the time pretty changes 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.180
 if one does not change to improve 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.190
 it is forgotten as the 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.950
 possibility of including football 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.170
 female in the fifa saga is posed as 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.670
 it also raises good that we're going to 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.290
 create the argentinian league we are going to add 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.260
 the Colombian league 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.239
 that the day we add this year with the 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.910
 complexity that is not is not nothing else 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:41.450
 than adding the league and adding the 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.190
 studs create the t-shirts but that 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.920
 you really have to do a lot 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.470
 I work on what the body is 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.069
 the model faces the physics of 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.170
 hair the gameplay in itself good 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.840
 to say good how are the 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.489
 attributes 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.560
 the sound is many things because 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.390
 We wanted to make it as authentic as possible 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.640
 we do it well or we do not do it one of 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.349
 the news in fifa 15 was 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.450
 supposedly artificial intelligence 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.800
 of the goalkeepers but then he gave 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.920
 many problems when the game is 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.450
 went out to the street what was the problem the 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.450
 last year and what have you done for 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.660
 improve it in fifa 16 good was a rival 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.620
 what we did from the keeper goal 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.170
 completely to be able to take it to the 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.230
 technology that was going to allow us 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.150
 will allow us to perform many 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.640
 improvements at the intelligence level of 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.500
 reach coverage 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.990
 and good last year 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.520
 when the game goes out on the street or is the 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.610
 people started to see some things that 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.340
 we did not see during the testing 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.090
 we improve some of those most of 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.770
 the main problems with bars 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.150
 but we still see that all the 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.530
 time we keep seeing which ones are which 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.270
 is the feedback what are the 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.310
 frustrations the problems that people 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.830
 has and good among the improvements that 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.870
 we wanted to do this year obviously 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.660
 we take what are the problems that the 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.140
 people were watching and they felt that the 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.480
 game was broken in that sense 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.920
 but good is all the time as much as 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.760
 with the opportunity as in others 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.920
 elements of the game there are situations that 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.139
 frustrate 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.480
 year after year we try to eliminate them and 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.400
 this year the exception is not 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.200
 making a revolution this year of what 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.470
 which is the goal but we are 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.800
 fixing or we put a lot of emphasis on 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.930
 trade in tries to add all those 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.810
 videos we saw on youtube by him 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.810
 example and good we put them in order of 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.900
 priority and even carlos on fifa 14 the 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.790
 rhythm of game was very slow in change 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.500
 in fifa 15 the opposite happened that 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.750
 it was too fast the parties were 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.419
 they turned into a correcalles that we can 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.370
 wait for fifa 16 will be very much 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.420
 more balanced fifa says to be much more 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.450
 balanced 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.800
 I do not know if in the previous year our 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.130
 mind was responsible for this year 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:07.340
 for us it was rocking more than anything 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.570
 because we did not realize that one can 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.580
 get to see what are the mechanics 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.580
 they are introducing can reach 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.080
 see the dynamics that are generated but 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.500
 once the game comes out the street that the 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.420
 start of people are watching it is that 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.640
 is when he really starts to see the 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:25.160
 final what are the stoppages or how 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.370
 whether people start playing or prefer 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.950
 play and what we did was that 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.310
 basically that the tri min hit 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:36.210
 responsive 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.490
 I really won 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.080
 that is, it is unbalanced in certain 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.990
 meaning with what the defense was 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.110
 then in the midfield I could not 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.430
 counteract with that training either 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.349
 it was generated was a transition zone 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.449
 then that generates that the party 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:54.750
 feels very fast that it was rivlin in 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:58.110
 attack transition zone from pass that 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.400
 intercepts us in the midfield then 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.020
 a game dynamic is generated a lot 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.319
 fastest of the new playable 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:07.169
 which would you highlight above the rest 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:09.780
 I do not think that is the Tribilín touches 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:11.160
 new mechanics to make ribbons 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.880
 having possession of the ball but 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.760
 moving the body 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:20.190
 it's amazing when one 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.080
 you play it and you get what you want 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.290
 do it feels spectacular feels 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.960
 really working and what you can do while 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:29.490
 some players who are more agile with 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.560
 A theme of attributes can do more 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.960
 easily but it's based on style 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:37.630
 of one on how to do it but when 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.580
 but it's let's say one on one cons 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.470
 against the defense it feels spectacular 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.580
 one month and has been making the cover of the 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.470
 game already three years 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.509
 what is the duration of your agreement 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.129
 with him we will see him again this year 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:51.720
 on the cover and I also wanted to tell you 

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:53.699
 because we have seen in the presentation 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.740
 that came out aguero next to the logo of the game 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:57.449
 means that we will see also the 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.099
 kun I can not tell you who's going to be 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:01.889
 on the cover still support that is going 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:04.919
 to announce at some point and I tell you the 

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:06.659
 most I do not know because I've seen that 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:08.409
 covers in different countries change 

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:12.999
 as well 

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:15.029
 that is now in the presentation not 

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:17.439
 it means that you go to the cover of the game 

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:21.849
 is because I know maybe because I am 

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:23.919
 Argentine but not in general are 

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:27.669
 for presentations and all that are done 

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:29.919
 templates so we can use and good 

00:07:27.669 --> 00:07:32.259
 as you know they know that I am Argentine they put 

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:35.399
 in general they gave emphasis to players 

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:35.399
 South Americans this year
