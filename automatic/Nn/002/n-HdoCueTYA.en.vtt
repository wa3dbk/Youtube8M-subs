00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:10.290
 Yes it is Hello now lottery system 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:16.070
 Are you going to do Gion pattern 2 of 83 pages in a class ? 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.070
 It is a fair story of the rate of change in February 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.090
 It is 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.090
 that 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:32.490
 I'm a simple 's com weak Let a little while ago from the conclusion or let's say a little while ago from conclusion 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:35.400
 Bought a'll have learned increase the amount of Toka me something two years specifically in the case of increasing the amount of the What if Well x prima facie 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.970
 Also it might try to remembered Te 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.400
 Let's do the way first 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:45.860
 First of all there is a quadratic function mart electronic formula 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.860
 Say the wave height of Tteyuu when the proportion and percentage of change 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:57.970
 Sentences will always come out for an hour At that time , I will come out, but I will come out 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:59.390
 I x is Stop it also statement of changes when autumn me from Nanbo of Nanbo of when to increase from brother to 4 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.620
 I will come to say 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:06.909
 First, the place Tteyuu Nanbo from this Nanbo 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.159
 Because it is good to meet these times this time 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:14.000
 First Cocona 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:17.180
 Please have it here anyway Brother from Yoneya + good 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.100
 For example, if you return -1 and 4 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.420
 -1 + good 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.420
 Please simply reached 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.170
 finally 22 +4 to calibration from tuscany 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.830
 Arou Kato 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.070
 Yes first gave 6 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:38.750
 Next time you see the ceremony 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.040
 Well, there 's always something like this on the front 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.040
 I say this is a proportional constant 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.080
 Take the part here and take a few minutes 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.050
 The 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.050
 So it 's only about six 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.759
 The answer is 12 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:10.500
 Answer me is ready, but is not talking about that do you leave a kind 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:14.110
 I'll come out like that, I guess this is a trick and a key technique, yes 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:19.990
 Any problem can be done Any problem can be done 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:26.200
 For example, isatoic roux - the x- to always put in x 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:27.560
 It is said to seek the rate of change when increasing from -1 to 4 seed 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.870
 What to do 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.860
 So standing 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.940
 If I- 1 Soyong + reason why Sanyana 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.750
 So here you go here 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.400
 Book 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:46.140
 It's 3 times minus 1 by 1 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.300
 -3 and this answer 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:54.160
 ok super easy 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:57.460
 In benefits It is a this prima facie the other is not to get 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:02.050
 Once you put something of 5 in the test Madokaya 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:06.130
 I of in prima facie Well that I enrollment 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:09.850
 It is to say I do not teach theory taught in tricks brush because it is exam students 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:14.200
 There is also the possibility of being criticized, so let's say some reason 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:17.200
 It is better to know that this theory is ne also for the future 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.650
 No I am wondering I I do not go to the future science and mathematics system 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.310
 Well it might not used much 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.950
 When the Well might say in its not so much thinking and math and science Once, however if 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:31.819
 Because there are always people 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.819
 I will go for a while, but the rate of change 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.910
 The formula has already been decided 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.910
 Amount of increase in x 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.000
 It is the increase of wye 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:51.960
 I think this has been seen 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.220
 Steak in which not all thank column in the next function in 3 hours Number of even a quadratic function in separate linear function 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.010
 Gane 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.480
 so 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:01.069
 So When you say what to do I thought Let there was this problem with this formula 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.810
 I do not think that the representative 's will be opened first 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.840
 x tone 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.580
 I would like to go to 4 from my brother this time 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.240
 From my brother 4 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.240
 High crotch 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:18.350
 This of chromatography, such as out Rutte increase of I Nja x 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.350
 Amount of increase 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.820
 x Minami-ku, planted I did not say Once the sea = 4 days I I was Tsu Is not a sister by the time 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.520
 With increased 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:35.790
 Well assignment Shaine When you say that time of the Wye or Nanbo 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:38.249
 The person 4 assignment City Council two people of the city Once you have 8 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.960
 After substituting 4 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:43.990
 In dumplings 16 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.920
 16 3's from Well 32 Volume multiplying 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.350
 Something like this 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:54.840
 I do not know how 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:54.840
 24 in the fact that dolphins on the sun's pull the name'm increased much together 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:04.190
 That's why this part here 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:05.569
 I wanted to be here , and if I didn't want to increase it, I would apply to this formula 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.240
 There is no 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:11.000
 You should fit well 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.290
 to the increase in x 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.100
 In the increase of wye 24 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.510
 If it becomes inside after calculation 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.590
 Ishihara cod 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:29.860
 Yes , this is how it works 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:36.850
 The Tteyuu that really good at child whether calculation good child does not even have at stake is negative here 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:39.500
 NiÃ±o purification spirits to minus where a person not good I do go at all to come at stake minus the cat 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.370
 It's already been someday now 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.449
 There 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:46.820
 There are a lot of people who become ah, but there is a lot of aging as well 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:53.510
 Huh 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:59.120
 So what you get to become an absolute way anymore Te this final time to seek any problems in also 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:06:00.909
 I can also face the front, but I won't call it now It's more important to handle than signing a Mr. a 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.420
 If there is time to disappear 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:08.420
 You should be able to do this 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:13.790
 First of all there are many excuses to say that Nambo is 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:15.030
 And this number it called the proportional constant that is attached to the front of the x- in front of the place 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:19.670
 Apply 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:22.650
 So to say that I leave in one shot 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:25.780
 This is how it looks 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:30.100
 Shall we do practice 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:35.010
 There is a problem with the ply on page 83 . 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.010
 Please try it because I think I can kill it
