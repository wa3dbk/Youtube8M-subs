00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
want to be aware of with this type of

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.190 
want to be aware of with this type of
solenoid<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:17.180> this<00:01:18.180> mounting<00:01:18.750> point<00:01:19.020> right

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
solenoid that this mounting point right

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.680 
solenoid that this mounting point right
here<00:01:19.410> where<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.680> mounts<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.160> to<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:21.090> fender<00:01:21.450> or

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
here where it mounts on to the fender or

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.559 
here where it mounts on to the fender or
the<00:01:21.810> firewall<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.500> actually<00:01:23.429> the<00:01:23.670> ground<00:01:23.910> so

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:24.569 
the firewall is actually the ground so

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:26.600 
the firewall is actually the ground so
whenever<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.380> go<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.830> test<00:01:26.100> things<00:01:26.369> and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
whenever you go and you test things and

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.139 
whenever you go and you test things and
when<00:01:27.149> I<00:01:27.179> tell<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.780> touch<00:01:28.560> your<00:01:29.250> probes<00:01:29.970> to

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
when I tell you to touch your probes to

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:31.820 
when I tell you to touch your probes to
the<00:01:30.390> ground<00:01:30.600> you're<00:01:31.350> actually<00:01:31.649> going<00:01:31.770> to

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
the ground you're actually going to

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.070 
the ground you're actually going to
touch<00:01:32.039> it<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.429> this<00:01:32.550> bracket<00:01:33.119> or<00:01:33.270> another

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
touch it to this bracket or another

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.020 
touch it to this bracket or another
ground<00:01:34.380> point<00:01:34.740> on<00:01:34.950> your<00:01:35.369> vehicle

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
ground point on your vehicle

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.290 
ground point on your vehicle
so<00:01:36.929> the<00:01:37.560> first<00:01:37.800> step<00:01:37.979> test<00:01:38.819> that<00:01:39.060> we're<00:01:39.209> going

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
so the first step test that we're going

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.059 
so the first step test that we're going
to<00:01:39.360> conduct<00:01:39.720> today<00:01:39.929> is<00:01:40.140> we're<00:01:40.500> gonna<00:01:40.590> check

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:41.069 
to conduct today is we're gonna check

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:43.279 
to conduct today is we're gonna check
the<00:01:41.250> ohms<00:01:41.429> of<00:01:41.670> resistance<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:42.420> between<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
the ohms of resistance in between the

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.199 
the ohms of resistance in between the
switch<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.369> ground<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.170> go<00:01:46.170> ahead<00:01:46.380> and

00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:47.209 
switch and the ground and go ahead and

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:54.109 
switch and the ground and go ahead and
move<00:01:48.209> my<00:01:48.420> multimeter<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.259> ohms<00:01:53.119> obviously

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
move my multimeter to ohms obviously

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.320 
move my multimeter to ohms obviously
black<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.869> my<00:01:54.990> ground<00:01:55.259> red<00:01:56.190> up<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:57.000> my<00:01:57.090> positive

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
black to my ground red up to my positive

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.370 
black to my ground red up to my positive
and<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:58.500> want<00:01:58.679> to<00:01:58.770> see<00:01:59.330> approximately<00:02:00.330> 3.5<00:02:01.050> ohms

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
and I want to see approximately 3.5 ohms

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.020 
and I want to see approximately 3.5 ohms
of<00:02:01.649> resistance<00:02:02.420> so<00:02:03.619> if<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:05.190> if<00:02:05.459> everything

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
of resistance so if I if everything

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.180 
of resistance so if I if everything
there<00:02:06.179> checks<00:02:06.509> out<00:02:06.690> the<00:02:07.410> next<00:02:07.740> thing<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:07.950> I'm

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
there checks out the next thing that I'm

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.760 
there checks out the next thing that I'm
gonna<00:02:08.280> do<00:02:08.490> is<00:02:08.670> I'm<00:02:09.509> gonna<00:02:09.720> go<00:02:09.929> ahead<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.200> check

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and check

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.910 
gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and check
the<00:02:11.009> power<00:02:11.250> going<00:02:11.849> through<00:02:12.080> this<00:02:13.080> solenoid

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
the power going through this solenoid

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.040 
the power going through this solenoid
now<00:02:14.849> to<00:02:14.910> hook<00:02:15.209> that<00:02:15.360> up<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.720> for<00:02:15.900> this

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
now to hook that up and for this

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.540 
now to hook that up and for this
demonstration<00:02:16.230> I've<00:02:17.130> actually<00:02:17.250> got<00:02:17.520> a

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.800 
battery and some cables and we'll set
that<00:02:20.550> up

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.140 

so<00:02:23.560> now<00:02:23.709> that<00:02:23.770> I<00:02:23.920> know<00:02:24.040> that<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.610> have<00:02:24.880> power

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
so now that I know that I have power

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.210 
so now that I know that I have power
coming<00:02:25.630> into<00:02:25.930> my<00:02:26.200> solenoid<00:02:26.560> we<00:02:26.800> want<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.040> check

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
coming into my solenoid we want to check

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.790 
coming into my solenoid we want to check
to<00:02:27.459> make<00:02:27.520> sure<00:02:27.760> we<00:02:27.970> have<00:02:28.090> power<00:02:28.300> going<00:02:28.420> out<00:02:28.900> now

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
to make sure we have power going out now

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.710 
to make sure we have power going out now
the<00:02:29.890> way<00:02:30.069> to<00:02:30.130> do<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:30.459> is<00:02:30.670> again<00:02:31.480> we're<00:02:31.630> going

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
the way to do that is again we're going

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.240 
the way to do that is again we're going
to<00:02:31.780> use<00:02:31.840> our<00:02:32.110> multimeter<00:02:32.560> I'm<00:02:32.830> going<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.100> take

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
to use our multimeter I'm going to take

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.710 
to use our multimeter I'm going to take
the<00:02:33.400> multimeter<00:02:33.790> lead<00:02:34.060> put<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:34.450> on<00:02:34.569> the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
the multimeter lead put it on the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.290 
the multimeter lead put it on the
outside<00:02:35.350> of<00:02:35.410> my<00:02:35.620> positive<00:02:36.250> I'm<00:02:36.520> going<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.150> take

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
outside of my positive I'm going to take

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.630 
outside of my positive I'm going to take
my<00:02:37.510> negative<00:02:37.860> multimeter<00:02:38.860> lead<00:02:39.040> hook<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.550> up

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
my negative multimeter lead hook it up

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.640 
my negative multimeter lead hook it up
to<00:02:39.790> my<00:02:39.819> negative<00:02:40.300> again<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:40.750> I'm<00:02:41.319> going<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.560> go

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
to my negative again and I'm going to go

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.650 
to my negative again and I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:41.770> and<00:02:42.160> jump<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.760> solenoid<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.390> way<00:02:43.480> that

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
ahead and jump the solenoid the way that

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.150 
ahead and jump the solenoid the way that
I'm<00:02:43.780> going<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:43.930> do<00:02:44.050> that<00:02:44.260> is<00:02:44.500> take<00:02:44.739> my<00:02:44.890> short

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
I'm going to do that is take my short

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.080 
I'm going to do that is take my short
piece<00:02:45.310> of<00:02:45.340> wire<00:02:45.489> and<00:02:46.530> I'm<00:02:47.530> going<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.040> hook<00:02:48.970> it

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
piece of wire and I'm going to hook it

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.870 
piece of wire and I'm going to hook it
up<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:49.270> my<00:02:49.510> positive<00:02:50.170> and<00:02:50.440> I'm<00:02:51.400> simply<00:02:51.730> going

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
up to my positive and I'm simply going

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.960 
up to my positive and I'm simply going
to<00:02:51.940> touch<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.690> s<00:02:53.020> terminal<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:53.860> I<00:02:54.640> hear<00:02:54.880> it

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
to touch the s terminal and I hear it

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.610 
to touch the s terminal and I hear it
click<00:02:55.209> so<00:02:55.690> I<00:02:55.720> know<00:02:55.900> my<00:02:56.019> cell<00:02:56.260> enoyed<00:02:56.500> is

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
click so I know my cell enoyed is

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.620 
click so I know my cell enoyed is
actually<00:02:56.980> working<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:58.060> I<00:02:58.150> look<00:02:58.330> at<00:02:58.480> my

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
actually working and I look at my

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.930 
actually working and I look at my
multimeter<00:02:59.320> and<00:02:59.530> I<00:02:59.769> see<00:02:59.980> that<00:03:00.280> I<00:03:00.310> have<00:03:00.670> almost

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
multimeter and I see that I have almost

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.750 
multimeter and I see that I have almost
eleven<00:03:01.510> and<00:03:01.600> a<00:03:01.660> half<00:03:01.720> volts<00:03:02.140> coming<00:03:02.830> out<00:03:03.130> of<00:03:03.489> my

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
eleven and a half volts coming out of my

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.090 
eleven and a half volts coming out of my
solenoid<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.930> I<00:03:04.959> know<00:03:05.110> that<00:03:05.230> my<00:03:05.470> solenoid<00:03:05.739> is

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
solenoid so I know that my solenoid is

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.970 
solenoid so I know that my solenoid is
operating<00:03:06.610> properly<00:03:07.260> now<00:03:08.260> if<00:03:08.440> there's<00:03:08.680> still

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
operating properly now if there's still

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.160 
operating properly now if there's still
some<00:03:09.220> electrical<00:03:09.760> gremlins<00:03:10.239> in<00:03:10.569> your<00:03:10.750> system

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
some electrical gremlins in your system

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.080 
some electrical gremlins in your system
you<00:03:11.350> want<00:03:12.069> to<00:03:12.160> make<00:03:12.310> sure<00:03:12.340> that<00:03:12.730> you<00:03:12.850> check

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
you want to make sure that you check

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.509 
you want to make sure that you check
things<00:03:13.360> like<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.720> ignition<00:03:14.200> switch<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:14.769> any
