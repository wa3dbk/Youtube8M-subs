00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
the art of motorcycle maintenance where

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.250 
the art of motorcycle maintenance where
it<00:02:36.710> says<00:02:36.950> that<00:02:37.100> if<00:02:37.220> you're<00:02:37.630> traveling<00:02:38.630> by<00:02:38.840> car

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
it says that if you're traveling by car

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.110 
it says that if you're traveling by car
then<00:02:39.800> you're<00:02:39.950> watching<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.430> movie<00:02:40.760> if<00:02:40.910> you're

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
then you're watching the movie if you're

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.490 
then you're watching the movie if you're
traveling<00:02:41.480> by<00:02:41.510> bike<00:02:41.750> you're<00:02:41.930> in<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:42.200> movie

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
traveling by bike you're in the movie

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.050 
traveling by bike you're in the movie
and<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:42.740> think<00:02:42.800> that<00:02:43.070> sums<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.670> up<00:02:43.700> perfectly

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
and I think that sums it up perfectly

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.940 
and I think that sums it up perfectly
because<00:02:44.840> on<00:02:44.960> the<00:02:45.050> bike<00:02:45.230> you're<00:02:45.440> out<00:02:45.590> there<00:02:45.830> in

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950

you're right there and you can just
speak<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:08.840> them<00:03:09.020> immediately<00:03:09.470> or<00:03:09.560> not<00:03:09.880> walled

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
speak to them immediately or not walled

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.640 
speak to them immediately or not walled
off<00:03:11.090> from<00:03:11.330> them<00:03:11.510> in<00:03:11.630> this<00:03:11.750> kind<00:03:11.960> of<00:03:12.110> metal<00:03:12.410> box

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
off from them in this kind of metal box

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.960 
off from them in this kind of metal box
and<00:03:12.980> I<00:03:13.040> think<00:03:13.100> that's<00:03:13.430> that's<00:03:13.670> a<00:03:13.850> really

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
and I think that's that's a really

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.490 
and I think that's that's a really
healthy<00:03:14.210> way<00:03:14.450> to<00:03:14.480> see<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.990> world<00:03:15.170> and<00:03:15.380> meet

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
healthy way to see the world and meet

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.949 
healthy way to see the world and meet
people<00:03:16.060> yeah<00:03:17.060> doing<00:03:17.330> these<00:03:17.540> trips<00:03:17.750> has

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
people yeah doing these trips has

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.390 
people yeah doing these trips has
definitely<00:03:18.350> changed<00:03:18.380> my<00:03:18.740> life<00:03:18.890> I<00:03:19.100> mean<00:03:19.250> it

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
definitely changed my life I mean it

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.760 
definitely changed my life I mean it
gave<00:03:19.820> me<00:03:20.030> a<00:03:20.060> new<00:03:20.240> career<00:03:20.570> which<00:03:21.170> was<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.410> kind<00:03:21.709> of

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
gave me a new career which was a kind of

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.470 
gave me a new career which was a kind of
byproduct<00:03:22.340> really<00:03:22.520> that<00:03:22.640> I<00:03:22.670> wasn't<00:03:22.940> expecting

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
byproduct really that I wasn't expecting

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.410 
byproduct really that I wasn't expecting
but<00:03:23.709> that's<00:03:24.709> how<00:03:24.830> I<00:03:24.860> got<00:03:25.010> into<00:03:25.250> writing<00:03:25.430> which

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
but that's how I got into writing which

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.850 
but that's how I got into writing which
was<00:03:26.600> fantastic<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.350> that's<00:03:27.470> probably<00:03:27.680> the

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
was fantastic and that's probably the

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.380 
was fantastic and that's probably the
best<00:03:28.160> thing<00:03:28.400> for<00:03:28.430> me<00:03:28.670> that's<00:03:28.820> come<00:03:28.970> out<00:03:29.060> of<00:03:29.120> it

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
best thing for me that's come out of it

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.680 
best thing for me that's come out of it
but<00:03:29.930> other<00:03:30.140> than<00:03:30.350> that<00:03:30.440> it's<00:03:30.770> also<00:03:31.420> it<00:03:32.420> just

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
but other than that it's also it just

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.930 
but other than that it's also it just
gives<00:03:32.870> you<00:03:32.959> um<00:03:33.200> I<00:03:33.500> think<00:03:33.740> a<00:03:34.010> sense<00:03:34.430> of<00:03:34.610> just

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
gives you um I think a sense of just

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.830 
gives you um I think a sense of just
self<00:03:35.270> confidence<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:37.390> you're<00:03:38.390> more<00:03:38.570> willing

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
self confidence and you're more willing

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.050 
self confidence and you're more willing
to<00:03:38.870> take<00:03:39.110> risks<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:39.770> navigate<00:03:40.400> things<00:03:40.580> and

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
to take risks and navigate things and

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.820 
to take risks and navigate things and
not<00:03:41.270> just<00:03:41.540> relating<00:03:42.080> to<00:03:42.170> motorcycling<00:03:42.739> or

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
not just relating to motorcycling or

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.979 
not just relating to motorcycling or
travel<00:03:43.160> but<00:03:43.340> just<00:03:43.610> genuinely<00:03:44.030> in<00:03:44.450> all<00:03:44.600> areas

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
travel but just genuinely in all areas

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.070 
travel but just genuinely in all areas
of<00:03:45.020> your<00:03:45.170> life<00:03:46.030> I'm<00:03:47.030> really<00:03:47.510> pleased<00:03:47.780> to<00:03:47.900> see

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
of your life I'm really pleased to see

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.020 
of your life I'm really pleased to see
that<00:03:48.260> a<00:03:48.290> lot<00:03:48.410> more<00:03:48.650> girls<00:03:48.920> are<00:03:49.130> doing<00:03:49.430> these

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
that a lot more girls are doing these

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.910 
that a lot more girls are doing these
kind<00:03:50.300> of<00:03:50.390> chips<00:03:50.600> on<00:03:50.750> bikes<00:03:51.020> and<00:03:51.380> I<00:03:51.440> just<00:03:51.770> think

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
kind of chips on bikes and I just think

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.890 
kind of chips on bikes and I just think
that's<00:03:52.010> brilliant

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
that's brilliant

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.510 
that's brilliant
then<00:03:53.900> I've<00:03:54.050> seen<00:03:54.230> no<00:03:54.440> reason<00:03:54.620> why<00:03:54.980> you<00:03:55.040> can't

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
then I've seen no reason why you can't

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.320 
then I've seen no reason why you can't
have<00:03:56.480> a<00:03:56.540> motorcycle<00:03:56.959> adventurer<00:03:57.590> as<00:03:57.830> a<00:03:57.860> woman

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
have a motorcycle adventurer as a woman

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.699 
have a motorcycle adventurer as a woman
and<00:03:59.330> in<00:03:59.510> some<00:03:59.720> ways<00:03:59.900> I<00:04:00.080> think<00:04:00.260> it's

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
and in some ways I think it's

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.370 
and in some ways I think it's
advantageous<00:04:01.520> even<00:04:02.180> I<00:04:02.330> think<00:04:02.450> you<00:04:02.870> get<00:04:03.050> into

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
advantageous even I think you get into

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.490 
advantageous even I think you get into
places<00:04:03.620> you<00:04:04.010> get<00:04:04.390> that<00:04:05.390> you<00:04:05.570> may<00:04:05.720> not<00:04:05.900> do<00:04:06.320> if

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
places you get that you may not do if

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.250 
places you get that you may not do if
you<00:04:06.620> a<00:04:06.680> man<00:04:07.130> or<00:04:07.160> couple<00:04:07.730> of<00:04:07.790> guys<00:04:07.940> together

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
you a man or couple of guys together

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.170 
you a man or couple of guys together
could<00:04:09.260> be<00:04:09.290> seen<00:04:09.560> as<00:04:09.709> an<00:04:09.830> intimidating<00:04:10.550> you

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180
