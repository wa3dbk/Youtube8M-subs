briefly show you how to swap out your
crankshaft<00:00:08.880> positioning<00:00:09.630> sensor<00:00:09.920> which<00:00:10.920> is

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
crankshaft positioning sensor which is

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.970 
crankshaft positioning sensor which is
this<00:00:11.490> little<00:00:11.730> booger<00:00:12.000> right<00:00:12.179> here<00:00:12.620> so<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.650> was

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
this little booger right here so I was

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.799 
this little booger right here so I was
driving<00:00:14.250> down<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.400> road<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.880> my<00:00:15.360> engine

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
driving down the road and my engine

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.420 
driving down the road and my engine
randomly<00:00:16.440> just<00:00:16.710> cut<00:00:17.039> off<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:17.400> me<00:00:17.520> one<00:00:17.670> day<00:00:17.820> and

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
randomly just cut off on me one day and

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.570 
randomly just cut off on me one day and
I<00:00:21.410> try<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.439> crank<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.740> back<00:00:22.769> up<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.100> wooden<00:00:23.310> crank

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
I try to crank it back up a wooden crank

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.849 
I try to crank it back up a wooden crank
and<00:00:23.760> my<00:00:24.150> check<00:00:24.449> engine<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.990> slip<00:00:25.350> lights<00:00:25.590> came

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
and my check engine and slip lights came

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.650 
and my check engine and slip lights came
on<00:00:25.920> looked<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.609> went<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.880> Autozone<00:00:27.119> had<00:00:27.570> the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
on looked I went to Autozone had the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.279 
on looked I went to Autozone had the
codes<00:00:27.869> checked<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.500> was<00:00:28.619> code<00:00:28.859> po3<00:00:29.490> 35<00:00:30.359> which

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
codes checked it was code po3 35 which

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.659 
codes checked it was code po3 35 which
is<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.560> crankshaft<00:00:31.890> positioning<00:00:32.520> sensor

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
is the crankshaft positioning sensor

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.190 
is the crankshaft positioning sensor
which<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.300> guy<00:00:33.480> right<00:00:33.660> here<00:00:33.719> now<00:00:34.020> however

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
which is this guy right here now however

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.200 
which is this guy right here now however
it<00:00:34.500> could<00:00:34.649> be<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.010> wiring<00:00:35.610> harness<00:00:35.910> as<00:00:36.030> well

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
it could be the wiring harness as well

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.660 
it could be the wiring harness as well
but<00:00:37.050> hopefully<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.559> case<00:00:37.829> it's<00:00:38.550> just

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
but hopefully in this case it's just

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.250 
but hopefully in this case it's just
this<00:00:39.030> little<00:00:39.300> guy<00:00:39.420> right<00:00:39.600> here<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:40.790> this<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.850> a

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
this little guy right here so this is a

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.930 
this little guy right here so this is a
magnet<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:43.680> end<00:00:43.890> here<00:00:43.950> which<00:00:44.460> slides

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
magnet on this end here which slides

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.819 
magnet on this end here which slides
down<00:00:45.149> into<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.780> backside<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.320> transmission

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
down into the backside the transmission

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.069 
down into the backside the transmission
right<00:00:47.039> where<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> flywheel<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.120> which<00:00:48.780> reads

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
right where the flywheel is which reads

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.510 
right where the flywheel is which reads
the<00:00:49.230> rotational<00:00:49.829> rate<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.250> make<00:00:50.370> sure

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
the rotational rate and make sure

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.920 
the rotational rate and make sure
everything<00:00:50.969> sort<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.270> running<00:00:51.449> correctly

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
everything sort of running correctly

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.560 
everything sort of running correctly
there<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.219> got<00:00:53.399> one<00:00:53.640> 10<00:00:53.969> millimeter<00:00:54.390> bolt

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
there so it's got one 10 millimeter bolt

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.410 
there so it's got one 10 millimeter bolt
and<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.680> wiring<00:00:55.890> harness<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.489> pretty<00:00:56.940> much<00:00:57.059> I

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
and the wiring harness is pretty much I

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.060 
and the wiring harness is pretty much I
got<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.140> off<00:00:58.320> with<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> flathead<00:00:58.890> screwdriver

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
got that off with a flathead screwdriver

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.650 
got that off with a flathead screwdriver

the<00:02:49.890> crankshaft<00:02:50.280> position<00:02:50.370> sensor<00:02:50.670> I<00:02:51.209> pull

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
the crankshaft position sensor I pull

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.949 
the crankshaft position sensor I pull
that<00:02:52.230> guy<00:02:52.410> out<00:02:52.910> again<00:02:53.910> this<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:54.569> what<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.780> looks

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
that guy out again this is what it looks

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.069 
that guy out again this is what it looks
like<00:02:55.140> this<00:02:55.650> guy<00:02:55.829> right<00:02:56.010> here<00:02:56.480> so<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.540> can<00:02:57.930> sort

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
like this guy right here so you can sort

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.110 
like this guy right here so you can sort
of<00:02:58.170> see<00:02:58.379> it<00:02:58.799> sort<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.069> just<00:02:59.220> slides<00:02:59.760> right<00:02:59.879> in

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
of see it sort of just slides right in

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.890 
of see it sort of just slides right in
like<00:03:01.079> this<00:03:01.319> I<00:03:01.590> can<00:03:01.829> hold<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.129> sort<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.849> know

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
like this I can hold it sort of you know

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.089 
like this I can hold it sort of you know
and<00:03:03.900> your<00:03:04.019> wiring<00:03:04.290> harness<00:03:04.620> plugs<00:03:04.829> into<00:03:04.980> the

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
and your wiring harness plugs into the

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.150 
and your wiring harness plugs into the
top<00:03:05.280> there<00:03:05.549> so<00:03:06.290> if<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.440> happen<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.799> drop<00:03:07.980> your

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
top there so if you happen to drop your

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.680 
top there so if you happen to drop your
bolt<00:03:08.340> no<00:03:08.549> big<00:03:08.700> deal<00:03:08.910> it's<00:03:09.239> not<00:03:09.359> going<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.540> fall

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
bolt no big deal it's not going to fall

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.660 
bolt no big deal it's not going to fall
into<00:03:09.930> uni<00:03:10.349> I<00:03:10.379> dropped<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.069> few<00:03:11.250> times<00:03:11.370> it

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
into uni I dropped it a few times it

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.000 
into uni I dropped it a few times it
just<00:03:11.700> fell<00:03:12.000> right<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.390> ground<00:03:12.660> so<00:03:13.010> you

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
just fell right to the ground so you

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
just fell right to the ground so you
shouldn't<00:03:14.250> have<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.400> worry<00:03:14.609> at<00:03:14.730> least<00:03:14.849> too

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
shouldn't have to worry at least too

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.349 
shouldn't have to worry at least too
much<00:03:15.209> about<00:03:15.680> losing<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.769> bolt<00:03:16.980> into<00:03:17.340> an<00:03:18.060> abyss

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
much about losing the bolt into an abyss

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.009 
much about losing the bolt into an abyss
of<00:03:18.569> engine<00:03:18.900> compartment<00:03:20.239> and<00:03:21.239> hopefully<00:03:21.630> it

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
of engine compartment and hopefully it

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.990 
of engine compartment and hopefully it
cranks<00:03:22.349> right<00:03:22.530> back<00:03:22.680> up<00:03:22.919> I<00:03:23.160> do<00:03:23.489> suggest<00:03:23.730> you

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
cranks right back up I do suggest you

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.150 
cranks right back up I do suggest you
get<00:03:24.180> your<00:03:24.239> codes<00:03:24.510> cleared<00:03:24.870> out<00:03:25.019> once<00:03:25.950> you<00:03:26.040> get

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
get your codes cleared out once you get

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.740 
get your codes cleared out once you get
it<00:03:26.250> started<00:03:26.579> back<00:03:26.940> up<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.299> hopefully<00:03:27.599> it's

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
it started back up and hopefully it's

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.300 
it started back up and hopefully it's
not<00:03:27.840> your<00:03:28.019> wiring<00:03:28.200> harness<00:03:28.620> because<00:03:28.859> that<00:03:29.069> is

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
not your wiring harness because that is

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.860 
not your wiring harness because that is
a<00:03:29.370> pain<00:03:29.849> in<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:30.060> arse<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.540> I<00:03:30.599> would<00:03:30.720> probably

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
a pain in the arse and I would probably

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.930 
a pain in the arse and I would probably
take<00:03:31.109> it<00:03:31.139> to<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.410> dealership<00:03:31.650> or<00:03:32.040> Nissan

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
take it to the dealership or Nissan

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.390 
take it to the dealership or Nissan
repair<00:03:33.239> facility<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.840> do<00:03:33.959> that<00:03:34.109> so<00:03:35.010> if<00:03:35.130> all<00:03:35.310> of
