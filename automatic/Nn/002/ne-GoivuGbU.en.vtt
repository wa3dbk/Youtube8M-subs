00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
shot from my NEC machine I'm going to

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.109 
shot from my NEC machine I'm going to
get<00:01:16.210> exactly<00:01:16.720> that<00:01:16.990> much<00:01:17.290> liquid<00:01:17.770> and<00:01:18.119> now

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
get exactly that much liquid and now

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.389 
get exactly that much liquid and now
let's<00:01:19.540> talk<00:01:19.659> about<00:01:19.869> how<00:01:19.990> to<00:01:20.050> do<00:01:20.290> the<00:01:20.649> lungo

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
let's talk about how to do the lungo

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.430 
let's talk about how to do the lungo
shot<00:01:21.759> now<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.509> reason<00:01:22.840> you<00:01:22.869> would<00:01:23.140> want<00:01:23.170> to

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
shot now the reason you would want to

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.430 
shot now the reason you would want to
program<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:24.369> lungo<00:01:24.700> shot<00:01:25.210> properly<00:01:25.810> with

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
program the lungo shot properly with

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.960 
program the lungo shot properly with
your<00:01:26.470> inicio<00:01:26.920> machine<00:01:27.250> is<00:01:27.399> because<00:01:27.520> there<00:01:27.820> are

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
your inicio machine is because there are

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.149 
your inicio machine is because there are
some<00:01:28.330> ground<00:01:28.600> crew<00:01:28.899> capsules<00:01:29.409> from<00:01:29.619> Nespresso

some ground crew capsules from Nespresso

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.310 
some ground crew capsules from Nespresso
that<00:01:30.640> specifically<00:01:31.240> are<00:01:31.420> labeled<00:01:31.780> as<00:01:31.899> lungo

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
that specifically are labeled as lungo

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.350 
that specifically are labeled as lungo
meaning<00:01:32.830> that<00:01:32.890> you<00:01:33.040> want<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.430> use<00:01:33.580> the<00:01:33.820> lungo

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
meaning that you want to use the lungo

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.840 
meaning that you want to use the lungo
size<00:01:35.140> option<00:01:35.649> from<00:01:35.800> your<00:01:36.009> NEC<00:01:36.190> a<00:01:36.340> machine<00:01:36.670> to

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
size option from your NEC a machine to

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.880 
size option from your NEC a machine to
get<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.210> optimal<00:01:37.840> brew<00:01:38.110> out<00:01:38.320> of<00:01:38.440> your<00:01:38.560> machine

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
get the optimal brew out of your machine

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.620 
get the optimal brew out of your machine
so<00:01:39.429> let's<00:01:39.700> program<00:01:39.910> our<00:01:40.240> machine<00:01:40.479> I'm<00:01:40.600> going

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
so let's program our machine I'm going

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.290 
so let's program our machine I'm going
to<00:01:40.899> use<00:01:41.110> a<00:01:41.140> lungo<00:01:41.710> shot<00:01:41.979> or<00:01:42.729> should<00:01:43.060> I<00:01:43.090> say<00:01:43.270> a

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
of a lungo shot I have noticed that this

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.400 
of a lungo shot I have noticed that this
machine<00:02:06.280> brewed<00:02:06.729> a<00:02:06.880> little<00:02:07.180> bit<00:02:07.360> over<00:02:07.960> the

size<00:02:08.590> that<00:02:08.829> I<00:02:08.860> would<00:02:09.009> usually<00:02:09.160> expect<00:02:09.869> for<00:02:10.869> a

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
size that I would usually expect for a

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.620

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
lungo so I'm going to program this to

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.430 
lungo so I'm going to program this to
right<00:02:13.870> about<00:02:14.170> there<00:02:15.600> this<00:02:16.600> should<00:02:16.810> be<00:02:16.989> just

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440

right about there this should be just
about<00:02:17.590> right<00:02:17.890> for<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:18.250> lungo<00:02:18.610> shot<00:02:18.880> this<00:02:19.329> means

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
about right for a lungo shot this means

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.270 
about right for a lungo shot this means
that<00:02:19.810> I'm<00:02:19.930> going<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.350> get<00:02:20.560> each<00:02:20.739> time<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.040> press
