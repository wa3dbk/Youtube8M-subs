00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:09.090
 hi now come in today we are going to make some 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:12.150
 rich bread glasses with longaniza and nothing else 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.400
 I have longaniza that started so I have a 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.769
 pound 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.990
 if this game so that it falls apart that 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:24.029
 not too big and this 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.180
 so you see, and here I have the potatoes 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.439
 vacancies are known what also 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.090
 It makes three layers but you can 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.550
 put four if you like this is not going to 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.960
 reach hands for 4 digs and 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.620
 is cooked and right now they will be 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.530
 humanist 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.930
 and it's a little bit more golden I'm going to 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.890
 split the cup into squares and I'll 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:47.360
 add so everything is cold and then 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.360
 here is what we are going to use 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.879
 the teleras like this look ok already in case 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.969
 If you can not find age, you can use 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.609
 bolillo the traditional is the telera but 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.429
 Well, if you can not get this 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.269
 can use bobbin and then here is 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.269
 but the sauce 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.210
 here we only have two chile 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.979
 california and four of the chiles 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.670
 Japanese with a little water this goes to 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.270
 be to bathe the bread 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:21.530
 just add a little bit of the way 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.530
 like two fingers 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.119
 medium low and let's see what had moved 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.119
 I'm going to strain it in a container 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.400
 use to fit 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.080
 literal calves me what is it 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.060
 let's do after this one the 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.759
 longaniza with the potatoes 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.829
 and that 's where the sausage is being and for 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.680
 accompany to put it up I'm going to 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:53.650
 put chicken a little cream and 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.750
 avocado and of course its sauce 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.740
 so committed making the longaniza 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.420
 it is cooking 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.430
 we're going to break it a bit with the 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.210
 spoon 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.429
 and how do I tell you that this would be for 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.990
 then incorporate in the covers for each 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.800
 circuit that looks like it's already in 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.800
 cooked tapas 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:23.610
 and I will not take off because neither want 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.430
 so close but it 's so funny either 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.409
 here I have the covers 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.409
 that already the cuts in everything 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.820
 and we're going to mix it so it's cold 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.560
 well, well, not rich, and what are these layers 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.560
 that they also undo a little 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.459
 this is this is nothing quick about 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.459
 five minutes here nothing more 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.730
 and that's it 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:05.010
 this I'll let you make thus a 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:07.430
 little around here and that as they do to 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.870
 manchica as well as it is almost entirely not 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.560
 here I have the sauce and this service already 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.349
 colaba for the pirate 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.400
 proportionally so my mass remains 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:21.549
 a potato 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.829
 the ico is seen but let's do it 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.010
 in front they will give you a little 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.010
 oil 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.750
 for here in the person we love 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.700
 and the bread 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.910
 and put it here in the sauce 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.250
 okay 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.260
 just be careful as well 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.260
 closed that does not get inside 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.569
 be careful because that if it is medium 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:54.829
 hot I'm going to actually lower it 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.829
 I'm going to beat well 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.910
 and I'm going to put it 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.910
 even though 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:10.219
 to brown on both sides 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.219
 this is a little bit and he called us 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.700
 in oil and high 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.280
 and then we're going to put it 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.150
 the filling 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:35.529
 and good to have that 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.839
 with what we are going to do next 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:39.970
 we finally go to the preparation and 

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:43.729
 I stay palmer 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:46.719
 little gold, let's put 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.719
 the filling 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:50.689
 she is the bottom part 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.550
 that is then to your liking what 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.060
 you want to put but I more or 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:04.669

 singing that they reach stop 4 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:12.560
 that 's how I'm going to put this cream 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.560
 s 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:23.300
 the truth that this looks is delicious 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.460
 I 'm going to put some cabbage 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.510

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:32.370

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.660
