00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
practice septuplets except tablet is a

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:57.400 
practice septuplets except tablet is a
group<00:00:08.490> of<00:00:08.610> seven<00:00:09.059> notes<00:00:09.300> over<00:00:10.110> one<00:00:10.469> beat

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.799 

this<00:00:58.410> next<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:59.129> will<00:00:59.250> lower<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.030> BPM<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> little

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
this next I will lower the BPM a little

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.930 
this next I will lower the BPM a little
bit<00:01:00.930> because<00:01:01.170> it's<00:01:01.769> hard<00:01:02.040> for<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.370> brain<00:01:02.610> to

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
bit because it's hard for the brain to

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.690 
bit because it's hard for the brain to
combine<00:01:03.780> all<00:01:04.050> the<00:01:04.290> stuff<00:01:04.619> that's<00:01:05.070> happening

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
combine all the stuff that's happening

00:01:05.700 --> 00:02:09.880 
combine all the stuff that's happening
underneath<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:07.170> more<00:01:07.470> clear<00:01:07.770> like<00:01:08.130> this

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.620

I'll try a little application of this

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.630 
I'll try a little application of this
concept<00:02:24.240> so<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.230> can<00:02:25.500> see<00:02:25.710> how<00:02:25.740> it<00:02:26.070> moves<00:02:26.340> when

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
concept so you can see how it moves when

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:54.330 
concept so you can see how it moves when
you<00:02:26.700> improvise<00:02:27.060> with<00:02:27.450> it

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.400
