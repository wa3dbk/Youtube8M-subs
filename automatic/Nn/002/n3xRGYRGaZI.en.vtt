00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:14.200
 ok so far I have indicated the notes with 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.700
 simply of the linen circles between 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.890
 these circle lim actually not 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.170
 they mean nothing because you learn 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.599
 any kind of score is chopin 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.270
 mozart beethoven clementi any kind 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.570
 score you will find notes instead 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:33.640
 with a somewhat more complete figuration 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:36.910
 you will then have a note but you can find it 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:41.580
 so another note you won't be able to find 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:46.260
 so another note you will find so 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:48.760
 it's another note, you'll find it like this 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.860
 they are almost the four main ones 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.960
 types of night to find 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.580
 obviously there are other figures 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.770
 musicals that maybe we'll go to 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.360
 however, analyzing it later is not enough 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.460
 to know that these four exist 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.770
 figure what it means that I don't 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.210
 score I find this note rather than 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.990
 this rather than this one 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.450
 that these figures do not influence 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.509
 in no way the height of the note if 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:17.170
 we have a pentagram as I have 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:19.799
 always shown and we have this 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:24.189
 note on the second line or a sol 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.119
 drawn so a drawn sol is so 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.939
 always a sol 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:31.450
 the thing that changes is the duration of the 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:34.060
 note ok I put these notes in 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.789
 order of duration the note that lasts longer 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.979
 and the note that lasts less 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:41.920
 this note above 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.760
 it's called short seeds and lasts four 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:52.060
 quarters 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:54.440
 a no four quarters no so 34 e 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.990
 on the beginning of the 5th we know the finger on the 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:05.600
 key the note below is called minimum 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:11.090
 and lasts two quarters for example a do da 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:13.940
 two parts becomes 12 I finish the 2 e 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.290
 on the beginning of the 3rd bag via the finger 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.870
 so a note that I can not say that 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.390
 this note lasts for two centuries now 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:25.190
 it is called minimal seed and lasts a quarter 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.740
 for example if they ask me to play a 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.920
 I give from a fourth I first and I look for the dott 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.510
 on the keyboard then I hold my finger 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.890
 pressed for a second because we have 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.840
 having said that a quarter is equivalent to a 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.990
 second then it went by a quarter and so 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.970
 Street 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:47.540
 when by a fourth this other note is 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.459
 called chrome is an eighth 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.010
 as you can see every note is half of 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.900
 the previous one works this way music and 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.450
 also the other figures that do not 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.350
 we have examined work in this 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.390
 way 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.550
 now let's talk a little bit about why 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.890
 say that it is a date that lasts four quarters 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.440
 yes four quarters to the fraction but that 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.709
 what is really meant for now 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.330
 for now we can say in broad terms that 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.209
 a hard four-quarter note 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.489
 practically four seconds a note a 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.620
 two quarters lasts two seconds a note from 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.790
 a quarter a second and a note a 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.000
 eighth in half a second 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.250
 however, it is only in my sense 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.320
 four seconds can be for 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.050
 another person longer or shorter 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.200
 so it's a very subjective thing to 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.269
 to ensure that every note has its own value 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.430
 precise they invented the metronome which 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.560
 then we will examine well, however, for now 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.230
 we can say that this note lasts 4 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.100
 seconds what born 2 this one this 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.350
 half a second 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:49.910
 recapping semi short minimum seeds 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.310
 minimum chroma 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.670
 ok so slower known our most 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.740
 fast if we have one for four 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.020
 quarters means that we press that 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.500
 key and stay down for four 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.660
 seconds 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.690
 1234 the end of the 4 seconds we raise the 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.880
 hand we always know, however, only this 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.920
 Once last two quarters we sleep 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.440
 we keep down only for two seconds after 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.989
 that we raise the title to the button 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.489
 here you will find all these types 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.390
 of figurations within the 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:26.140
 score and you can find in succession 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:29.030
 in this way also in a casual way 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:32.060
 all within a time 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.650
 then we talked before 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.210
 which, however, we didn't put because of course 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.300
 we knew what it was 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.480
 now these fractions these durations must 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:46.400
 we always have a correspondence 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:49.340
 our key pentagram of sol like 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.650
 first thing and then inside you will find 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.960
 a fraction for example let's say that 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.960
 we find four quarters inside 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.230
 what it means means that 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.920
 within this staff or 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:06.740
 within this score you must 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.540
 insert in each bar of the notes or 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.600
 also things because music is 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:14.480
 made also of summing silences 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.210
 give the unit of the fraction I have to go 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.220
 the fraction or four quarters us 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.840
 we find a score here of course 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.450
 I make nice short but the scores 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:28.900
 they can even last three or four pages 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:31.940
 20 pages do not have their own 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.520
 end each author decides how much he owes 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.610
 last a score every score is 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.900
 divided into bars or measures and these 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.490
 jokes are nothing but 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:46.340
 vertical arms that divide the 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.140
 pentagram these vertical bars 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.390
 it is called proper earpieces or even 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:53.540
 breaks jokes some say 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:57.650
 ok within each measure size 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:06:00.440
 is that portion of a pentagram that goes 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.960
 from one bar to the other 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.840
 in practice I always tell children that 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.150
 a joke and this box here every 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.169
 little box is equivalent to a joke with 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.139
 measure 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:15.530
 ok within each size you will find 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:17.810
 always notes a note or more notes la 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.930
 what sum between them is the fraction 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:23.120
 of time therefore we cannot put 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.190
 for example if time is four here 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.639
 quarters we ca n't put 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.650
 within a line of the notes la 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:33.800
 as a sum of more than four quarters 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:36.979
 for example how easy to fill four 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.380
 quarters I put a note of four 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:42.020
 quarters but finished inside this one 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:45.380
 little box I can no longer put on 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.810
 no note I have no break as I can 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:50.330
 fill another small box of four 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:54.919
 quarters for example I can put one 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:57.490
 note from two quarters and another note from 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:57.490
 two quarters 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.980
 ok so i put two quarters plus two 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.330
 quarters and we all knew he did 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.190
 four quarters so that's fine 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:10.500
 inside this joke I can't 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:13.330
 more to put anything if you had to find 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.190
 even a quarter note we have two 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.800
 fourths plus two quarters plus a quarter that 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:19.960
 does five quarters and this is a mistake is 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.060
 a mistake because as long as every joke 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.340
 therefore there must be four quarters 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.560
 it works like this in a joke 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:29.710
 we cannot have any notes which 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:33.900
 sum away more than the fraction of time 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.900
 established at the beginning of the score
