grease<00:01:14.259> I<00:01:14.560> have<00:01:14.740> on<00:01:15.520> hand<00:01:15.820> to<00:01:18.060> get<00:01:19.060> all<00:01:19.329> these

things<00:01:19.509> back<00:01:19.869> in<00:01:20.020> there<00:01:20.140> to<00:01:20.229> where<00:01:20.320> they're

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
things back in there to where they're

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:22.109 
things back in there to where they're
actually<00:01:20.590> removable<00:01:21.490> in<00:01:21.579> the<00:01:21.670> future<00:01:21.969> but

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
actually removable in the future but

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.490 
actually removable in the future but
with<00:01:22.299> this<00:01:22.450> I<00:01:22.630> think<00:01:22.840> this<00:01:22.930> is<00:01:23.049> really<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.350> key

with this I think this is really the key
I<00:01:23.530> think<00:01:23.770> this<00:01:23.890> is<00:01:24.039> just<00:01:24.250> a<00:01:24.310> little<00:01:24.520> bit<00:01:24.640> of

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
I think this is just a little bit of

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.880 
I think this is just a little bit of
insurance<00:01:25.270> but<00:01:25.990> I<00:01:26.049> put<00:01:26.229> one<00:01:26.409> of<00:01:26.469> them<00:01:26.590> back<00:01:26.710> in

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
insurance but I put one of them back in

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.709 
insurance but I put one of them back in

come<00:01:29.020> out<00:01:29.109> it<00:01:29.530> actually<00:01:29.649> kind<00:01:29.979> of<00:01:30.039> makes<00:01:30.219> a

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
go take a quick look and my panel in

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.729 
go take a quick look and my panel in
what<00:02:10.330> I<00:02:10.360> had<00:02:10.539> what<00:02:10.810> I<00:02:10.840> did<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.260> it<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.500> how<00:02:11.709> I

what I had what I did to it and how I

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.330 
what I had what I did to it and how I
fixed<00:02:12.069> it

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
fixed it

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.550 
fixed it
a<00:02:13.370> quick<00:02:13.670> note<00:02:13.880> before<00:02:13.910> we<00:02:14.420> go<00:02:14.540> do<00:02:14.720> that<00:02:14.930> I<00:02:15.170> did

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
a quick note before we go do that I did

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.110 
a quick note before we go do that I did
this<00:02:15.650> with<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:15.860> small<00:02:16.280> flat-blade<00:02:16.580> screwdriver

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
this with a small flat-blade screwdriver

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.809 
this with a small flat-blade screwdriver
but<00:02:17.930> I'm<00:02:18.740> not<00:02:18.860> sure<00:02:19.040> if<00:02:19.100> this<00:02:19.220> is<00:02:19.280> focusing

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
but I'm not sure if this is focusing

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.410 
but I'm not sure if this is focusing
very<00:02:19.850> well<00:02:20.209> but<00:02:20.990> inside<00:02:21.500> here<00:02:22.150> don't<00:02:23.150> try<00:02:23.360> to

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
very well but inside here don't try to

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.320 
very well but inside here don't try to
remove<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:24.530> bulbs<00:02:24.980> without<00:02:25.790> removing<00:02:26.209> the

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330

remove the bulbs without removing the
wiring<00:02:26.890> harness<00:02:27.890> first<00:02:28.069> and<00:02:28.400> there's<00:02:28.790> this

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
wiring harness first and there's this

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.910 
wiring harness first and there's this
little<00:02:29.209> clip<00:02:29.360> right<00:02:29.540> up<00:02:29.690> here<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.140> if<00:02:30.800> you

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
little clip right up here and if you

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.380 
little clip right up here and if you

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
look around the candle gently it doesn't

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.470 
look around the candle gently it doesn't
take<00:02:36.140> many<00:02:36.350> force<00:02:36.770> at<00:02:36.890> all<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.250> just<00:02:37.400> slip<00:02:38.360> it

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
easy I've got some LEDs in here they'll

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.580 
easy I've got some LEDs in here they'll
come<00:02:47.330> out<00:02:47.420> I'll<00:02:47.600> show<00:02:47.780> you

nice<00:02:51.590> little<00:02:51.860> LED<00:02:52.190> bulb<00:02:52.459> this<00:02:53.180> kind<00:02:53.420> of<00:02:53.540> fills

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
nice little LED bulb this kind of fills

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.870 
nice little LED bulb this kind of fills
up<00:02:54.140> these<00:02:54.470> side<00:02:54.709> ones<00:02:54.920> it's<00:02:55.430> not<00:02:55.580> even

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
up these side ones it's not even

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.809 
up these side ones it's not even
focusing<00:02:56.239> very<00:02:56.300> well<00:02:57.400> anyways<00:02:58.400> these<00:02:58.580> little

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
focusing very well anyways these little

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.400 
focusing very well anyways these little
side<00:02:59.000> ones<00:02:59.209> fill<00:02:59.510> up<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.780> area<00:03:00.019> pretty<00:03:00.260> well

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
side ones fill up the area pretty well

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.960 
side ones fill up the area pretty well
these<00:03:00.620> shine<00:03:00.830> directly<00:03:01.190> down<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.640> shine

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
these shine directly down the shine

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.550 
these shine directly down the shine
upwards<00:03:02.450> which<00:03:02.660> just<00:03:02.989> fills<00:03:03.230> up<00:03:03.410> the

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
upwards which just fills up the

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.250 
upwards which just fills up the
reflector<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.310> little<00:03:04.519> bit<00:03:04.610> more<00:03:04.790> but<00:03:05.720> these

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
reflector a little bit more but these

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.920 
reflector a little bit more but these
are<00:03:06.319> my<00:03:06.709> LEDs<00:03:07.040> that<00:03:07.310> I<00:03:07.370> put<00:03:07.640> in<00:03:07.790> they<00:03:08.750> work

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
are my LEDs that I put in they work

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.780 
are my LEDs that I put in they work
fairly<00:03:09.170> well<00:03:09.260> they're<00:03:09.530> not<00:03:09.620> super<00:03:10.250> bright<00:03:10.400> but

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
fairly well they're not super bright but

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.960 
fairly well they're not super bright but
they<00:03:10.880> work<00:03:11.000> with<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:12.610> other<00:03:13.610> reasons<00:03:13.819> you

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
they work with you other reasons you

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.280 
they work with you other reasons you
might<00:03:14.150> want<00:03:14.300> to<00:03:14.330> get<00:03:14.420> back<00:03:14.569> here<00:03:14.870> for<00:03:15.170> the

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
might want to get back here for the

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.720 
might want to get back here for the
backup<00:03:15.590> camera<00:03:15.769> I'm<00:03:16.069> pretty<00:03:16.370> sure<00:03:16.489> that's

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
backup camera I'm pretty sure that's

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.610 
backup camera I'm pretty sure that's
what<00:03:16.850> this<00:03:17.120> connector<00:03:17.570> just<00:03:17.600> shoved<00:03:18.410> into<00:03:18.530> a

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
what this connector just shoved into a

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.160 
what this connector just shoved into a
bike<00:03:18.860> off<00:03:19.070> black<00:03:19.810> blanking<00:03:20.810> plate<00:03:21.019> is<00:03:21.170> for<00:03:21.440> but

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
bike off black blanking plate is for but

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.150 
bike off black blanking plate is for but
not<00:03:24.170> really<00:03:24.380> sure<00:03:24.500> how<00:03:24.620> you<00:03:24.680> get<00:03:24.769> to<00:03:24.829> where<00:03:24.950> the

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
not really sure how you get to where the

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.590 
not really sure how you get to where the
camera<00:03:25.430> mounts<00:03:25.730> but<00:03:25.880> pretty<00:03:26.239> sure<00:03:26.360> that's

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
camera mounts but pretty sure that's

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.759 
camera mounts but pretty sure that's
another<00:03:26.900> reason<00:03:27.110> you'd<00:03:27.320> want<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.500> get<00:03:27.590> back

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
another reason you'd want to get back

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.810 
another reason you'd want to get back
here<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.610> then<00:03:28.730> random<00:03:29.570> sensor<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:30.829> another

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
here and then random sensor and another

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.240 
here and then random sensor and another
seems<00:03:32.269> like<00:03:32.420> a<00:03:32.450> random<00:03:32.780> sensor<00:03:35.860> so<00:03:36.860> this<00:03:37.010> is<00:03:37.130> my

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
seems like a random sensor so this is my

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.860 
seems like a random sensor so this is my
back<00:03:37.459> panel<00:03:37.760> I<00:03:37.850> had<00:03:37.970> to<00:03:38.060> fix<00:03:38.239> I<00:03:38.570> have<00:03:39.170> used<00:03:40.040> some

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
back panel I had to fix I have used some

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.069 
back panel I had to fix I have used some
epoxy<00:03:42.220> 5-minute<00:03:43.220> which<00:03:43.820> is<00:03:44.000> it<00:03:44.570> start<00:03:44.930> to<00:03:44.989> get

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
epoxy 5-minute which is it start to get

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.770 
epoxy 5-minute which is it start to get
tacky<00:03:45.350> after<00:03:45.859> and<00:03:46.070> gummy<00:03:46.850> after<00:03:47.329> about<00:03:47.480> two<00:03:47.660> or

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
tacky after and gummy after about two or

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.949 
tacky after and gummy after about two or
three<00:03:47.829> but<00:03:48.829> it's<00:03:48.980> plastic<00:03:49.730> epoxy<00:03:50.120> stinks<00:03:50.690> like

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
three but it's plastic epoxy stinks like

the<00:03:56.329> slap<00:03:56.600> job<00:03:56.840> I<00:03:57.019> did<00:03:57.200> it's<00:03:57.410> really<00:03:57.739> hard<00:03:57.920> like

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
the slap job I did it's really hard like

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.490

I<00:03:58.100> said<00:03:58.250> I<00:03:58.280> got<00:03:58.400> tacky<00:03:58.730> and<00:03:59.269> so<00:03:59.870> this<00:04:00.079> one<00:04:00.230> side

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
I said I got tacky and so this one side

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.830 
I said I got tacky and so this one side
looks<00:04:00.709> a<00:04:00.769> little<00:04:00.859> bit<00:04:01.040> better<00:04:01.329> that's<00:04:02.329> I<00:04:02.780> was

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
looks a little bit better that's I was

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.870 
looks a little bit better that's I was
like<00:04:02.959> oh<00:04:03.140> Lord<00:04:03.500> I<00:04:03.829> added<00:04:04.430> a<00:04:04.459> little<00:04:04.609> bit<00:04:04.730> to<00:04:04.850> it

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
like oh Lord I added a little bit to it

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.349 
like oh Lord I added a little bit to it
so<00:04:05.090> it<00:04:05.180> looks<00:04:05.329> messy<00:04:05.660> but<00:04:06.579> it's<00:04:07.579> solid<00:04:07.820> now<00:04:08.150> but

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
as I give it very sufficient alarms time

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.310 
as I give it very sufficient alarms time
to<00:04:21.590> dry<00:04:22.120> but<00:04:23.120> it's<00:04:23.300> just<00:04:23.780> snapped<00:04:24.110> it<00:04:24.289> right

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
to dry but it's just snapped it right

my fingers out you might find something
else<00:04:57.440> a<00:04:57.560> little<00:04:57.680> easier<00:04:58.010> but<00:04:59.000> get<00:04:59.330> your<00:04:59.480> tools

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810

that<00:05:00.080> I<00:05:00.140> had<00:05:00.290> recommended<00:05:00.850> and<00:05:01.990> that's<00:05:02.990> where

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
that I had recommended and that's where

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.660 
that I had recommended and that's where
you<00:05:03.230> start<00:05:03.440> to<00:05:03.470> pop<00:05:03.710> that<00:05:03.920> one<00:05:04.070> out<00:05:04.190> and<00:05:04.490> then

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
you start to pop that one out and then

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.970 
you start to pop that one out and then
you'll<00:05:04.940> be<00:05:05.060> able<00:05:05.270> to<00:05:05.390> the<00:05:05.720> plan<00:05:05.960> panel<00:05:06.440> it<00:05:06.590> does

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
you'll be able to the plan panel it does

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.070 
you'll be able to the plan panel it does
have<00:05:07.130> a<00:05:07.190> little<00:05:07.310> give<00:05:07.580> and<00:05:07.820> you<00:05:08.540> can<00:05:08.690> start<00:05:08.930> to

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
have a little give and you can start to

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.650 
have a little give and you can start to
see<00:05:09.370> the<00:05:10.370> rest<00:05:10.670> probably<00:05:11.060> work<00:05:11.180> along<00:05:11.480> the

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
see the rest probably work along the

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.930 
see the rest probably work along the
bottom<00:05:11.990> and<00:05:12.980> then<00:05:13.220> you<00:05:13.310> can<00:05:13.400> get<00:05:13.490> your<00:05:13.670> arm<00:05:13.820> up

bottom and then you can get your arm up
in<00:05:14.120> there<00:05:14.330> start<00:05:15.110> pulling<00:05:15.320> out<00:05:15.410> the<00:05:15.500> wrist

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
in there start pulling out the wrist

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.090 
in there start pulling out the wrist

I<00:05:39.440> mean<00:05:39.680> it's<00:05:40.130> pretty<00:05:40.310> crazy<00:05:41.530> these<00:05:42.530> slide<00:05:43.100> in

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
I mean it's pretty crazy these slide in

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.500 
I mean it's pretty crazy these slide in
like<00:05:43.400> this<00:05:43.550> and<00:05:43.610> when<00:05:43.880> you<00:05:43.910> reinstall<00:05:44.390> the

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
like this and when you reinstall the

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.320 
like this and when you reinstall the
panel<00:05:45.340> you<00:05:46.340> need<00:05:46.460> to<00:05:46.580> slide<00:05:46.820> all<00:05:46.970> these<00:05:47.120> into

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
panel you need to slide all these into

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.520 
panel you need to slide all these into
place<00:05:47.740> again<00:05:48.740> we'll<00:05:49.130> loop<00:05:49.430> them<00:05:49.580> up<00:05:50.380> and<00:05:51.380> when

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
place again we'll loop them up and when

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:52.990 
place again we'll loop them up and when
you<00:05:51.590> just<00:05:51.740> literally<00:05:52.280> set<00:05:52.580> the<00:05:52.669> panel<00:05:52.850> in

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
you just literally set the panel in

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.120 
you just literally set the panel in
place<00:05:53.120> start<00:05:54.020> pushing<00:05:54.380> or<00:05:54.650> we<00:05:54.770> know<00:05:54.919> all<00:05:55.100> of

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
place start pushing or we know all of

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.860 
place start pushing or we know all of
these<00:05:55.370> are<00:05:55.580> I<00:05:55.820> might<00:05:56.300> even<00:05:56.450> print<00:05:56.750> out<00:05:56.840> a

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
these are I might even print out a

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.450 
these are I might even print out a
picture<00:05:57.200> so<00:05:57.410> I<00:05:57.440> know<00:05:57.590> exactly<00:05:58.040> where<00:05:58.220> to<00:05:58.250> push

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
picture so I know exactly where to push

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.600 
picture so I know exactly where to push
for<00:05:58.729> each<00:05:58.790> one<00:05:58.970> of<00:05:59.000> them<00:06:00.040> but<00:06:01.040> I'll<00:06:01.460> make

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
for each one of them but I'll make

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.300 
for each one of them but I'll make
another<00:06:01.880> video<00:06:02.080> why<00:06:03.080> I<00:06:03.110> had<00:06:03.350> this<00:06:03.500> off<00:06:03.680> LEDs<00:06:04.160> do

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
another video why I had this off LEDs do

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.670 
another video why I had this off LEDs do
the<00:06:04.400> whole<00:06:04.550> car<00:06:04.790> show<00:06:05.450> each<00:06:05.630> location<00:06:06.080> what<00:06:06.650> I

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
the whole car show each location what I

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.060 
the whole car show each location what I
put<00:06:07.010> what<00:06:07.250> I<00:06:07.280> recommend<00:06:07.760> what<00:06:08.150> I<00:06:09.010> suggest<00:06:10.010> you
