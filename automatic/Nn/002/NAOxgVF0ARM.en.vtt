00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 floor 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.590
 begins his reprise bruno cani mounts 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.420
 caramel of monte andrés in this replica 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.270
 of san jorge 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:27.279
 we see the exit to the trot gathered must 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.279
 take the track to the right 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.440
 there is now a diagonal continuum in 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.300
 medium jog 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.400
 we make the trunk amplitude of 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.310
 horse 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.780
 this beautiful sorrel horse named 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.780
 caramel of mont andrés 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.399
 While the following side from f 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.810
 begins a back inside to the 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.810
 left 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.440
 which will continue to turn 8 meters in 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.440
 the letter b 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.510
 there we see the back inside very 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.300
 correct to all equal flanks 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.940
 that round of 8 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.060
 is worth in the now with support to the 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.060
 left 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.320
 there we see how it crosses the extremities 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.049
 how does the right foot pass in front of the 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.140
 left takes the track to the left 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:26.289
 to continue with a diagonal in trot 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.289
 long from h to efe 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:34.670
 it is very regular 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.979
 very driven very active the horse 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.210
 wait forever with that neck and up 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.400
 that perfect placement 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.470
 and now he touches his back inside the 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.320
 right 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.320
 in Spain's will have a round of 8 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.680
 meters to which the support to the 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.680
 right 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.860
 there we see the turn of 8 meters and now 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.860
 start the support 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.630
 well it is a very correct support very fluid 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.990
 we see that it always keeps the same 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.789
 pace transition to the step now very 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.789
 Quiet forward the horse 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:22.730
 h has left turn to 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:26.739
 prepare half pirouette on the left / 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.739
 the m and the g 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.230
 we see how he gathers the step and there he starts his 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.629
 half tibet on the left 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.549
 the whips are checked perfectly 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:41.299
 of the feet as the horse does not stop 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:44.209
 maintains that activity at all times and 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.010
 there we have the pirouette to the right in 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.500
 the same conditions the feet always 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.650
 they are moving there is always that desire 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.640
 to advance that little that little point 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.530
 of impulsion 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:03.110
 now it's a long step going through the mr and 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.110
 diagonal xa the uve 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.600
 there you could ask maybe a little 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.190
 more amplitude in the step and of 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.500
 elongation of the upper line 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.330
 although we see how he remains calm 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.000
 flexible on the back 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.890
 now gathers the step has an exit from 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.890
 gallop left on the k 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.810
 there's the gallop exit 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.770
 well and now you have to do a support to 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.680
 the left from efe to x in x 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.450
 change standing in the air and supporting the 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.370
 right to the m 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.700
 there we have the change of foot very 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.160
 right very good very calm the 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.150
 support to the right and again the change 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.290
 standing 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.290
 perfect change of foot 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:04.049
 Now play the half gallop pirouettes 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.569
 galloping pirouettes we see how he gathers 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.140
 gallop begins the half pirouette to the 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.140
 left 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:16.489
 that's it keeps the beats keeps the 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.090
 drive the neck up change foot 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.090
 in the air 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.670
 we see as always the changes are foot and 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.670
 hand at a time 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.699
 there we have the pirouette on the right 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.169
 those four whipping trunks which is what 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:35.120
 that is looked for in the pirouette 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.430
 in the half pirouette between three and four 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.060
 Whipped trunks again the change of 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.150
 foot in the cee 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:45.060
 and start now with series 5 changes 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.270
 on the diagonal every four trunks 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.450
 there we have the second change the third 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.860
 change the rump escapes a little 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:57.080
 from time to time 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:02.599
 well finished this diagonal 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:07.030
 linked with the other diagonal here xm with 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:07.030
 five foot changes every three francs 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.000
 there we have the first one it seems that left 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.729
 the foot a little behind the third change 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.060
 the room is correct also and the 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:20.759
 fifth also maintains a quality of 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.919
 gallop always the same before the 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:25.090
 changes after changes during 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:28.720
 the changes 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.350
 ok and now it only has diagonal left 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.139
 x 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:35.650
 efe has to lengthen the gallop gallop 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:39.389
 long before gathering a little bit of 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.389
 gallop and change standing in the air 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.979
 we see how it meets the feet of the 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:47.319
 horse there we have the change and already for 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:49.650
 end the central line compared in 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:49.650
 X 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.950
 and this reprise has brought Bruno to 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:58.090
 hurdle with caramel from monte andrés el 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.090
 first place
