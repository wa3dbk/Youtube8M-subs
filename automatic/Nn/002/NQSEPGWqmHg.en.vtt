we're<00:00:12.000> gonna<00:00:12.330> try<00:00:12.600> dissolving<00:00:13.380> about<00:00:13.680> 50

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
we're gonna try dissolving about 50

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.859 
we're gonna try dissolving about 50
milliliters<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.980> zywall<00:00:16.980> into<00:00:17.760> about<00:00:18.330> 600

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
milliliters of zywall into about 600

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:28.550 
milliliters of zywall into about 600
milliliters<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.610> waste<00:00:20.610> vegetable<00:00:20.880> oil<00:00:27.560> we

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
milliliters of waste vegetable oil we

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:44.480 
milliliters of waste vegetable oil we
see<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.849> swirling<00:00:30.840> difference<00:00:35.660> I<00:00:43.250> still<00:00:44.250> see

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:44.490 
see a swirling difference I still see

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:57.260 
see a swirling difference I still see
differences

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.560 

I<00:00:57.330> guess<00:00:58.200> and<00:00:58.710> they're<00:00:59.010> not<00:00:59.190> really

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
I guess and they're not really

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.810 
I guess and they're not really
dissolving<00:01:00.570> super<00:01:01.140> readily<00:01:01.620> they<00:01:02.610> may

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
dissolving super readily they may

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.740 
dissolving super readily they may
actually<00:01:03.060> have<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> same<00:01:03.750> specific<00:01:04.379> gravity

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
actually have the same specific gravity

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.810 
actually have the same specific gravity
there<00:01:06.750> definitely<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:08.540> differences<00:01:10.520> but<00:01:11.520> my

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
there definitely is a differences but my

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.640 
there definitely is a differences but my
guess<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.120> is<00:01:12.570> they<00:01:12.720> dissolved<00:01:13.320> into<00:01:13.470> each

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
guess is is they dissolved into each

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.270 
guess is is they dissolved into each
other<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.250> it'll<00:01:14.520> just<00:01:14.700> take<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.940> few<00:01:15.090> minutes

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
other and it'll just take a few minutes

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.990 
other and it'll just take a few minutes
for<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.310> solution<00:01:17.940> to<00:01:20.479> clear<00:01:21.479> up<00:01:22.880> we'll<00:01:23.880> leave

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
for the solution to clear up we'll leave

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
for the solution to clear up we'll leave
this<00:01:24.180> overnight<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.900> see<00:01:25.050> what<00:01:25.200> happens<00:01:27.020> it's

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
this overnight and see what happens it's

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.960 
this overnight and see what happens it's
been<00:01:28.170> about<00:01:28.380> five<00:01:28.800> minutes<00:01:28.830> in<00:01:29.460> these<00:01:29.640> I'll

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
been about five minutes in these I'll

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.670 
been about five minutes in these I'll
all<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:31.220> waste<00:01:32.220> vegetable<00:01:32.520> oil<00:01:33.200> seem<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.440> have

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
all and waste vegetable oil seem to have

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.940 
all and waste vegetable oil seem to have
dissolved<00:01:35.610> one<00:01:35.940> into<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.390> other<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:37.259> we<00:01:37.920> can

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
dissolved one into the other so we can

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.859 
dissolved one into the other so we can
say<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.310> zai<00:01:38.700> Lal<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.210> successful

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
say that zai Lal is a successful

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.139 
say that zai Lal is a successful
blending<00:01:40.500> agent<00:01:40.920> for<00:01:41.190> waste<00:01:41.460> vegetable<00:01:41.759> oil

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
blending agent for waste vegetable oil

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.030 
blending agent for waste vegetable oil
this<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.750> about<00:01:42.960> six<00:01:43.229> hundred<00:01:43.290> millilitres<00:01:44.009> of

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
this is about six hundred millilitres of

this is about six hundred millilitres of
waste<00:01:44.340> vegetable<00:01:44.670> oil<00:01:45.180> with<00:01:46.520> zile<00:01:47.520> all<00:01:47.820> added

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
waste vegetable oil with zile all added

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.530 
waste vegetable oil with zile all added
to<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.690> and<00:01:48.960> took<00:01:49.590> about<00:01:50.030> five<00:01:51.030> minutes<00:01:51.300> for

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
to it and took about five minutes for

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.859 
to it and took about five minutes for
the<00:01:51.630> two<00:01:51.810> fluids<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.410> become<00:01:52.770> uniform

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
the two fluids to become uniform

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.080 
the two fluids to become uniform
agitation<00:01:54.869> was<00:01:55.350> not<00:01:55.530> required<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.369> mix<00:01:56.970> the

agitation was not required to mix the
two<00:01:57.119> fluids<00:01:57.660> and<00:01:58.310> after<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> few<00:01:59.520> days<00:01:59.670> is

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
two fluids and after a few days is

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.570 
two fluids and after a few days is
settling<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:01.080> two<00:02:01.380> fluids<00:02:01.740> did<00:02:01.890> not<00:02:02.039> separate

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
settling the two fluids did not separate

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.230 
settling the two fluids did not separate
nor<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.149> there<00:02:03.750> any<00:02:03.899> indication<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.800> a

Xylo and - it
have<00:02:14.010> some<00:02:16.290> gasoline<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.620> it<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:17.920> see<00:02:18.160> if<00:02:18.670> the

have some gasoline to it to see if the

have some gasoline to it to see if the
three<00:02:19.180> solutions<00:02:19.750> will<00:02:19.959> play<00:02:20.200> our<00:02:20.590> play<00:02:20.709> do

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.130 

all<00:02:31.720> right<00:02:31.780> we<00:02:32.110> see<00:02:32.319> the<00:02:32.440> swirling<00:02:32.950> of

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
all right we see the swirling of

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.100 
all right we see the swirling of
solutions<00:02:35.140> I<00:02:35.440> can<00:02:35.709> actually<00:02:35.860> see<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:37.470> minor

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
solutions I can actually see a minor

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.770 
solutions I can actually see a minor
emulsion<00:02:41.110> layer<00:02:41.260> forming<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:42.569> we'll<00:02:43.569> just

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
emulsion layer forming and we'll just

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.860 
emulsion layer forming and we'll just
give<00:02:43.959> it<00:02:44.050> a<00:02:44.110> few<00:02:44.290> minutes<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.739> see<00:02:45.040> if<00:02:45.870> the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
give it a few minutes to see if the

whether you don't
this<00:02:52.510> is<00:02:52.720> a<00:02:52.750> sample<00:02:53.410> of<00:02:53.650> 600<00:02:54.459> milliliters<00:02:54.700> of

gasoline added to it and the solution
has<00:03:02.920> become<00:03:03.280> uniform<00:03:03.790> so<00:03:04.630> Xylo<00:03:05.260> should

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
has become uniform so Xylo should
