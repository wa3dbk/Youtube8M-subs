00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:38.340
 iron cap as desperately so 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:46.530
 speak so the charger itself on 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:51.140
 5 volts so 5 volts under 5 volts 600 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:59.370
 milliampere so the back cover 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:01:02.340

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.119
 yusb cable standard mini usb standard 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:13.729
 so screwdriver itself 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:17.450
 let's evaluate the phone itself 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.450
 what do we apply 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:28.500
 the phone itself looks pretty and 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.369
 small world he compares his cigarette lighter 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.520
 it is possible so well in general can be compared with 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.860
 lighter if private I find now 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.320

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.369
 phone a little bit more lighters 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:52.590
 very small so well let's 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.890
 let's see what we have ourselves 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:02.250
 buttons so on the front panel 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.939
 the volume of the speaker then displeychike 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.970
 my two inches if not less 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:10.630
 logistic android 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.890
 shockproof buttons as stated so 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.510
 here it is on the right side is a model 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.820
 so to the right of the country is a dummy below 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:25.330
 mikrofonchik well and maturity so with the right 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.590
 side we have such a stub 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:35.920
 under which is the charger 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:40.750
 a device that is to have a floor loud 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.850
 scream lighter on loud so myself 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.950
 ahead is we do not have the side 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.900
 is it changed without charging but 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.580
 supposedly there to plug wrap as the 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.290
 you can connect headphones but alas there 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.660
 there is no 35 same three and a half jack 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.510
 Do not pass for headphones possible through 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.760
 mini yourself you can beat the day headphones so 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.240
 well and let's that the most important thing for them 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.330
 battery because two older brothers 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:14.620

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:17.890

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.350

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.209
 bkb bti battery and thickness and not 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:27.970
 inferior lighters by the way can it 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:30.760
 notice lit the more so so 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.580
 Okay, by the way, here we are under the battery 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.450

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:41.500

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.990
 back of the view because nobody 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.820
 I think I did not notice so the camera we have on 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.120
 2 megapixels supposedly you should be 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.160
 flash but no 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.700

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:24.330
 there is so well the speaker itself 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.700
