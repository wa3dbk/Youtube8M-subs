00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.399
 hello people maybe you still know it 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.410
 if you have it, I was teacher 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:12.049
 In the past always like face of the day 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.850
 and outfit of the day videos in one 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.320
 video so i just combine time 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.160
 Make me up today and what I am 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.990
 'm wearing today 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.670
 and that's exactly what I want to do 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.350
 It is not a special occasion or 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.150
 so i wanted to go again 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.250
 One wonders about a time like that 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.210
 the things maybe better and sooner 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.920
 That's why I just wanted to go 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.910
 try again is turn because 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.440
 I have not done that for a long time 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.180
 have done and also look like you 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.800
 like and so and that's why I want 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.510
 today my face of the day and mine 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.100
 Show outfit of the day and I would 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.620
 say I'll start with that first 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.899
 Face of Fame a face of today's today 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.040
 looks more makeup than usual 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.230
 but I actually have a lot less 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.660
 Products used as usual and indeed 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.160
 sometimes, by the way , my face and looks 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.809
 bit spotty out of all this way 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.190
 But that is by the light so if 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.110
 I look in the mirror then I do not see 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.809
 I do not even have a make-up on it then 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.340
 my skin is somehow so and for 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.050
 The skin finished with it directly 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.309
 I only concealer uses all products 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.200
 I'll write you in the infobox 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.600
 i used concealer then i did 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.070
 my eyebrows tightened and then 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.139
 actually only made an eye make up 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.909
 what only kajal eyeliner and mascara 

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:13.100
 I just have it 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.979
 with kajal pulled a topstroke above 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.899
 then I have one with the kohl below 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.249
 very thin line drawn and then 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.840
 I have with the eyeliner because the 

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:23.389
 tip of the island a bit 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.670
 finer is below me almost eyelashes 

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:27.289
 painted so I just have so short 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.149
 painted small strokes because I do it all 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.979
 funny place and then got down well 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.659
 no mascara used but only above 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.709
 and it has such an effect of very blatant 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.509
 showered eyelashes 

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:36.979
 Actually, I think that's cool 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.439
 whole eyes make up as I said 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.450
 This, of course, a bit crass 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.279
 or dollars as I wear it else but 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.479
 I like the outfit and stuff like that 

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:46.189
 Seeing it will fit 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.779
 very well and that's why I have that 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.459
 I also did the rest 

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:51.289
 Relatively received back are only 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:54.020
 two things and once pale that 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.939
 it is such a mixture of bronze and 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.569
 Chorale Farbenem place I am quite beautiful 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.069
 find 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:00.349
 and then the lipstick that is 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.270
 brown lipstick no news but 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:03.649
 rather a brown with a light red 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.539
 I do something pretty and underneath 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.909
 of course, and that is indeed 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.110
 my entire make up so it is 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.850
 actually I only believe six or 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.560
 seven products 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.390
 So it's only good, but sometimes it stops 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.950
 Just more and it just looks 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.660
 Find out more and eyelashes 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.550
 and I think that's pretty cool too 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.230
 funny you can try it 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.150
 you do not have so much about it 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.770
 make thick as I depending on the 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.300
 I just wear hair and open hair 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.460
 Although just to the side because they 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.220
 today are ebler and then it suits me 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.470
 pretty good and it is also comfortable and 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.930
 not so elaborate and then I show 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.680
 short my nails and that way 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.870
 they look 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.370
 I edited and cut them because they did 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.690
 all are broken off and then I do 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.250
 the more often i just take it 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.200
 once back arrows so that you are at rest 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.700
 can grow again and have easy 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.410
 a nude-colored new varnish on it 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.590
 made and think that's nice because 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.510
 that is very natural and yes that is 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.740
 for today my face of the day at 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.690
 I have my outfit so a 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.310
 little bit of the black and white trends 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.200
 I now totally orientate many 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.120
 have seen magazines and I'll show it 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.740
 take a quick look at where the things are and 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.250
 so I climb in the infobox of 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.660
 For simplicity's sake first 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.920
 above what you really wear a chain 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.560
 is it such a chain with such beautiful 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.240
 Sometimes it turns a bit silver 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.560
 looks and sometimes a bit gold 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.970
 it depends on the light on mine 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.070
 I like and with the black one 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.810
 I have that as a gem 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.540
 so to speak, just like this ring here 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.100
 that again but with one 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.540
 black stone I think it always fits 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.670
 All right, I can find them together 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.250
 beautiful then I wear a white 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.990
 blouse have a tunic which believe 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.000
 I'd better just call it that 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.560
 is low loose falls back one 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 is a bit longer and me 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.460
 actually very much like proof super 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.380
 comfortable is a black top under it 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.870
 just a top are mine 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.080
 feel good and that's why I have 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.760
 that and then a black one 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.220
 Washed-out jeans jeans I totally 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.690
 beautiful 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.280
 actually that was really fun for me though 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.890
 I do not know what I like anymore 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.590
 and then down my jeffrey 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.300
 campbell abschatsch shoes I first 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.160
 currently very much really wear 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.140
 because they are so comfortable you can believe that 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.180
 her she looks like this or places 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.910
 claude marin feet but it's easy 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.680
 really comfortable and I like him first 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.800
 Luke so together I am that 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.300
 balance i find it relatively good 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.579
 combined resp 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.260
 it has something fresh nice somehow 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.710
 and this black and white has one 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.330
 bit yes so super text moderately in it 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.730
 because the heel of the shoes and also 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.770
 the chain and so only in style 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.870
 So a very comfortable is doing but what 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.280
 not delivered looks exactly these 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.500
 I like it 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.580
 and yes I do not know what you will be 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.120
 Maybe you will not find it that way 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.370
 especially 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.930
 I really like to know and I like it 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.820
 really comfortable for the day 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.919
 You can also watch school there 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.960
 also many other shoes and 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.370
 yes that was it from my outfit and that 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.350
 the two things should have read 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.850
 combined in a video i feel 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.250
 so a bit backward I know 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.570
 as I always thought it was pretty 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.980
 can again feedback since he also 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.419
 Just say something like that to us 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.250
 show what you have up to today 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.640
 make-up today if that's cool or 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.940
 Not 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.140
 and yes, yes, I'm curious 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.140
 I 've thought about that today 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.790
 thought that so so and therefore exactly 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.710
 okay I noticed a bit 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.720
 unsure but just let me know 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.120
 then I know and so 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.120
 Wishes 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.220
 a progressive day and us 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.090
