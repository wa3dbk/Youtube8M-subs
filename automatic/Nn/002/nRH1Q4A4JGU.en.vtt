00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.040 
27 on the bottle up here at the top I
don't<00:00:38.489> think<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.090> they're<00:00:39.270> doing<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.840> don't

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
don't think that they're doing I don't

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.500 
don't think that they're doing I don't
think<00:00:40.290> there's<00:00:40.410> doing<00:00:41.129> batches<00:00:42.000> like<00:00:42.030> you

would expect like there's gonna be a
batch<00:00:43.980> 28<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.670> think<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.239> 27<00:00:45.780> actually<00:00:46.079> refers

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
batch 28 I think that 27 actually refers

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.000 
batch 28 I think that 27 actually refers
to<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:47.280> fact<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.610> they<00:00:48.230> marry<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.710> three

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
to the fact that they marry the three

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.510 
to the fact that they marry the three

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
interesting I'm adding a little bit of

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.039 
interesting I'm adding a little bit of
water<00:01:09.689> here

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
water here

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.520 
water here
this<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.590> bottled<00:01:10.979> at<00:01:11.100> 43<00:01:11.580> percent<00:01:11.909> alcohol

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
but not it doesn't so it's blended but

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.300 
but not it doesn't so it's blended but
it's<00:02:50.660> not<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.840> blended<00:02:51.350> Scotch<00:02:51.620> it's<00:02:51.860> a<00:02:51.950> blended

malt so it's all malt whiskey it has
much<00:02:55.100> more<00:02:55.340> body<00:02:55.580> than<00:02:55.880> a<00:02:55.910> blended<00:02:56.420> Scotch<00:02:57.170> has

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
much more body than a blended Scotch has

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.660 
much more body than a blended Scotch has
just<00:02:59.780> because<00:03:00.019> it's<00:03:00.260> just<00:03:00.470> it's<00:03:01.130> just<00:03:01.250> thicker

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
just because it's just it's just thicker

just because it's just it's just thicker
the<00:03:02.450> sweetness<00:03:02.840> is<00:03:03.019> much<00:03:03.230> richer<00:03:03.500> it's<00:03:04.220> much

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
specific flavor and this is also very

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.930

very very much toffee blended mole
but<00:04:44.300> it<00:04:44.360> does<00:04:44.510> not<00:04:44.660> have<00:04:45.050> a<00:04:45.080> ton<00:04:45.500> of<00:04:45.560> depth<00:04:45.800> and

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
but it does not have a ton of depth and

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.460 
but it does not have a ton of depth and
yeah<00:04:48.740> for<00:04:48.980> burn<00:04:49.160> maturation<00:04:49.850> pretty<00:04:50.090> good<00:04:50.470> I

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
yeah for burn maturation pretty good I

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.980 
yeah for burn maturation pretty good I
would<00:04:52.100> say<00:04:52.450> more<00:04:53.920> depth<00:04:54.920> than<00:04:55.310> black<00:04:55.640> bow<00:04:55.990> but

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
would say more depth than black bow but

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.110 
would say more depth than black bow but
black<00:04:57.560> bull<00:04:57.740> has<00:04:57.950> quite<00:04:58.340> a<00:04:58.370> bit<00:04:58.550> more<00:04:58.730> sherry

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
black bull has quite a bit more sherry

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.380 
black bull has quite a bit more sherry
and<00:04:59.780> so<00:05:02.050> yeah<00:05:03.050> I<00:05:03.400> don't<00:05:04.400> know<00:05:04.580> if<00:05:04.730> that<00:05:04.940> that

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
and so yeah I don't know if that that

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.880 
and so yeah I don't know if that that
helps<00:05:05.660> with<00:05:05.780> any<00:05:05.900> kinds<00:05:06.170> of<00:05:06.230> decisions<00:05:06.680> but

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
helps with any kinds of decisions but

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:07.840
