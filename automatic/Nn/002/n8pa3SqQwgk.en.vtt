00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
system for my house okay this is how it

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.340 
system for my house okay this is how it
works<00:00:53.190> basically<00:00:53.550> for<00:00:54.000> my<00:00:54.120> house<00:00:54.300> what<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.199> do

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
works basically for my house what you do

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.770 
works basically for my house what you do
is<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.770> put<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.789> light<00:00:57.030> sensor<00:00:57.329> out<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
is you put the light sensor out to the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.110 
is you put the light sensor out to the
open<00:00:58.079> sunlight<00:00:58.500> as<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:59.430> can<00:00:59.550> see<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.910> light

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
open sunlight as you can see the light

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.860 
open sunlight as you can see the light
is<00:01:00.359> hitting<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.780> sensor<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.469> daylight<00:01:02.219> out

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
is hitting the sensor it's daylight out

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.780 
is hitting the sensor it's daylight out
turning<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.110> but<00:01:04.890> you're<00:01:05.280> thinking<00:01:05.430> why

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
turning it on but you're thinking why

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.789 
turning it on but you're thinking why
would<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.119> want<00:01:06.360> lights<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.750> we'll<00:01:07.619> see

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
would you want lights on we'll see

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.550 
would you want lights on we'll see
that's<00:01:07.950> where<00:01:08.220> you're<00:01:08.340> wrong<00:01:09.320> I'm<00:01:10.320> going<00:01:10.500> to

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
that's where you're wrong I'm going to

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.359 
that's where you're wrong I'm going to
break<00:01:10.680> away<00:01:10.799> my<00:01:11.010> house<00:01:11.159> here<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:12.240> little<00:01:12.810> bit

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
break away my house here a little bit

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.620 
break away my house here a little bit
with<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.460> reason<00:01:14.790> they<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> stone<00:01:15.360> block

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
with the reason they have a stone block

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.420 
with the reason they have a stone block
here<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.080> because<00:01:16.290> there's<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.860> torch<00:01:17.189> on<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
here is because there's a torch on the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.010 
here is because there's a torch on the
other<00:01:17.549> side<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.000> inverting<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.689> signal

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
other side that is inverting the signal

other side that is inverting the signal
turning<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.250> light<00:01:20.490> off<00:01:20.780> so<00:01:21.780> I'm<00:01:21.900> going<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.049> do

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
turning the light off so I'm going to do

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.300 
turning the light off so I'm going to do
is<00:01:22.229> I'm<00:01:22.320> going<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.500> change<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> time<00:01:23.070> did

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
is I'm going to change the time did

implemented it up in my tree house if
you<00:01:43.530> didn't<00:01:43.740> see<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:43.920> have<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.220> little<00:01:44.640> bit<00:01:44.759> more

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
you didn't see I have a little bit more

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.030 
you didn't see I have a little bit more
sophisticated<00:01:45.600> setup<00:01:45.930> up<00:01:46.170> here<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.649> little

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
sophisticated setup up here a little

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.399 
sophisticated setup up here a little
more<00:01:47.220> hidden<00:01:47.430> too<00:01:47.670> as<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.390> can<00:01:48.509> see<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.259> light

nighttime out the light is the sensor is

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.959 
nighttime out the light is the sensor is
off<00:02:00.439> which<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.469> letting<00:02:02.009> these<00:02:02.189> torches<00:02:02.640> turn

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
off which is letting these torches turn

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.539 
off which is letting these torches turn
on<00:02:03.149> powering<00:02:03.630> these<00:02:03.869> four<00:02:04.320> but<00:02:05.009> if<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.250> were<00:02:05.399> to

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
on powering these four but if I were to

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.940 
on powering these four but if I were to
set<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.820> time<00:02:06.030> today<00:02:06.409> those<00:02:07.409> who<00:02:07.590> turn<00:02:07.770> on

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
or the redstone lamps which were

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.690 
or the redstone lamps which were
implemented<00:02:14.840> into<00:02:15.079> Minecraft<00:02:15.799> one<00:02:16.159> point<00:02:16.459> two

piston wired up to a piece of sand
that's<00:02:30.170> on<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.349> piston<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:31.010> when<00:02:31.670> its<00:02:31.819> day

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
that's on the piston and when its day

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.289 
that's on the piston and when its day
the<00:02:32.030> Pistons<00:02:32.629> up<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:33.109> when<00:02:33.349> it's<00:02:33.640> night<00:02:34.640> the

the Pistons up and when it's night the

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.000 
the Pistons up and when it's night the
