00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
triangle with this open space because

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.039 
triangle with this open space because
these<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.159> open<00:02:11.519> space<00:02:11.849> here<00:02:12.359> in<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.780> front

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
these the open space here in the front

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.369 
these the open space here in the front
part<00:02:13.409> has<00:02:14.099> a<00:02:14.670> particular<00:02:15.359> shape<00:02:15.719> as<00:02:16.049> you<00:02:16.200> can

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
part has a particular shape as you can

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.330 
part has a particular shape as you can
see<00:02:16.620> because<00:02:17.459> I<00:02:17.930> didn't<00:02:18.930> just<00:02:19.230> make<00:02:19.379> an<00:02:20.040> open

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
see because I didn't just make an open

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.440 
see because I didn't just make an open
triangle<00:02:20.819> but<00:02:21.599> I<00:02:21.870> decided<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:23.099> make<00:02:23.310> this<00:02:24.090> part

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
triangle but I decided to make this part

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.069 
triangle but I decided to make this part
more<00:02:24.780> open<00:02:25.260> as<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.950> can<00:02:26.129> see<00:02:26.519> the<00:02:27.269> shape<00:02:27.629> of

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
more open as you can see the shape of

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.660 
more open as you can see the shape of
this<00:02:28.590> open<00:02:29.519> space<00:02:29.879> is<00:02:30.719> like<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.560> circle<00:02:32.250> okay

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
this open space is like a circle okay

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.209 
this open space is like a circle okay
and<00:02:34.069> so<00:02:35.069> that's<00:02:35.549> all<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:36.060> hope<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.840> publish<00:02:37.219> the
