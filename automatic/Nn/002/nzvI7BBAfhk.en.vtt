00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.640
 go well today I show you 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.179
 how to make this milking so it's 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.800
 a 13.3 sailboats on some sides 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.780
 it looks like a twist of some 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.000
 sides there looks like a braid she 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.830
 is not very difficult to do 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.050
 just take the hand it's a 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.640
 tutorial that I saw on the chain of his 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.840
 babies xo I put you a link to his 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.519
 video in info bar if you want 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.000
 see her breasts is an English tutorial 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.230
 I really like 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.099
 this is a version not at all 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.230
 manikin or vouchers issued 0 lied 6 and everything 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.469
 I 'll show you how to do it 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.610
 become more blurred at the end 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.950
 first thing I do or before 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.809
 do me that kind of things I take from 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.460
 the oil I have in many brands 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.530
 now I mix a little while there 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.420
 it was there it is to chimay I also have the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.829
 in the buell cilic 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:57.219
 I have the dirty mania tome I have I throw 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.449
 organic argan oil all in all I 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.129
 take the first one I have on hand 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.719
 and I play if you're interested 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.609
 video about my hair oils 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.839
 tell me do not hesitate so I 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:07.149
 take the oil if needed 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.390
 there I do it a little bit more of 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.950
 mails quickly but not either 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.020
 for three hours it's really a 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.060
 roughly for whom 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.340
 fight for them to be loved up 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.810
 if you are afraid of having a little trouble 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.600
 the first time to train or 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.549
 if you have a big gradient you 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.780
 can put a directissime elastic 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.049
 I do not do it but you can 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.819
 do it 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:34.720
 then we know by the hair in three 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:35.920
 when they had a braid and 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.899
 we pay careful attention that 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.649
 three wicks is about the same 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:44.500
 thickness so 1 2 and 3 I'm going to hold 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.539
 the middle one and the right one for 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.580
 me in my right hand the one on the left 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.100
 it's all alone with the left hand 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.770
 and I go there separated into 2 so for the 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.770
 separating from I pass my index in the middle 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.929
 simply hop with one hand 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.000
 it's feasible to separate you in two and 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.769
 you will spend each piece around 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.629
 of the middle wick so he you 

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:07.479
 just once you have the douala of 

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:09.849
 take the middle wick here and from 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.180
 going on and you recover in the thumb and 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.650
 the opposite index up the two matches 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.860
 be careful not to go re mix 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:22.569
 since there you will turn them on 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.590
 herself hop like that there the one that 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:29.610
 generally pass right below 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:33.040
 pass it over and we reverse them tac 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.250
 and then you the meals it's the turn 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.510
 right wick 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.940
 so I think l2 behind those of 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.879
 before and there she becomes one again 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.260
 mass capture them or per day show 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.030
 so I have the starting wick I'm going 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.950
 to make you 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.230
 our desire hoping that it helps you 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.770
 a little jealous of departure I divide into 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.500
 two I pass thumb and forefinger at 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.200
 middle I take the middle wick with 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.100
 thumb and forefinger to pass that of 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.110
 in front and behind 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.410
 around once they're in the middle 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.700
 I reverse them 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.800
 hop always in the same direction as that 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.150
 from above and there I pass them around 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.580
 the one on the right the one behind and 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.970
 the one in front and I pull for it to serve 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.459
 good for my third angle care 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.519
 it's better than in the cinema 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.630
 hop so I do not know with the index I 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:29.400
 pass thumb and forefinger 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.870
 I take the middle one hop I you 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.000
 shows one last time in full group 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.709
 from the extreme then in close- up it gives 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.850
 I have the match I pass the finger to 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:45.239
 mid day day I take the wick of 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:48.720
 middle I pass the front one then 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:51.239
 the one from behind who become the 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.890
 wick of middle age is that of 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:57.510
 behind dropped the front one I the 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:01.410
 reverse and I pass them around the 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.720
 third I get the one in front 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.350
 the one behind that ends up in a 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.350
 only here 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.830
 and when you see that matches 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.060
 become a little too narrow 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.500
 to really continue a time will you 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.240
 do one or two again 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.710
 become necessarily smaller but in 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.150
 big dice you have you see this 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.680
 wick there I feel that there is really more 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.169
 a lot of things in it and that she is going 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.060
 not take very long so I'm going 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.140
 not force me to really go 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.780
 hair because I know that 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:44.050
 it may not hold up well so when 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:48.220
 I'm here, I'll stop and put 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:51.220
 an elastic and art you see them 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.460
 several phases here it looks almost 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.480
 a normal braid up on the side she 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.200
 is a little bit different 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.580
 and here it looks like a twist so it's 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.410
 what's cool is that she does not have the 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.850
 same head depending on the angle where you are 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.590
 so you can obviously the sphere 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.419
 behind you can also do it on 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.490
 the side I find it rather nice your 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.990
 side and I just want it to give so 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.000
 you try to panic is a small 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.740
 little then you can decide to patrick 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.990
 is only the top only the 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:33.550
 below or a little bit everything I do a 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:37.270
 little bit too much and see the vowel 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.400
 a lot more volume whatever the 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:43.450
 side where we look at it 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.830
 in fact you adjust and that's where you 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.760
 see it was not super hard what 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.410
 I like it is she is 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.000
 impressive in quotation marks but 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.160
 she's mostly pretty fast so 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.479
 it's longer than a normal trace but 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.550
 it's a lot less gaps precipitates 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:55.780
 wheat for example and is still a 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.460
 little more than a normal kit 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.660
 I find so here I hope it 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.950
 you liked it and you will manage to do it 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.700
 red shit makes you big fat 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.850
 kisses and I tell you 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.850
 and quick
