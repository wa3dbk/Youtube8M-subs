that's how it works and this just goes
inside<00:02:48.079> the<00:02:48.290> machine<00:02:48.620> like<00:02:48.799> this<00:02:49.600> and<00:02:50.600> we<00:02:50.720> just

inside the machine like this and we just

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.770 
inside the machine like this and we just
kind<00:02:51.140> of<00:02:51.200> put<00:02:51.920> it<00:02:52.040> in<00:02:52.130> first

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
and that's how easy it is to get this

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.520 
and that's how easy it is to get this
thing<00:03:00.370> set<00:03:00.610> up<00:03:00.670> once<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.120> get<00:03:01.270> it<00:03:01.360> you<00:03:01.450> just

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530
