so<00:00:01.439> in<00:00:01.530> this<00:00:01.620> video<00:00:01.800> I'm<00:00:02.040> going<00:00:02.159> to

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
so in this video I'm going to

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.999 
so in this video I'm going to
demonstrate<00:00:02.490> how<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.149> set<00:00:03.419> up<00:00:03.449> synergy<00:00:04.049> on<00:00:04.230> a

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
demonstrate how to set up synergy on a

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.480 
demonstrate how to set up synergy on a
mac<00:00:05.430> and<00:00:05.730> Windows<00:00:06.859> synergy<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:07.980> basically<00:00:08.460> a

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
mac and Windows synergy is basically a

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.839 
mac and Windows synergy is basically a
small<00:00:08.790> piece<00:00:08.970> of<00:00:09.120> software<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:09.630> is

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:10.849 
small piece of software that is

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.160 
small piece of software that is
perfectly<00:00:11.929> capable<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:13.290> running<00:00:13.410> on<00:00:13.740> Mac

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
perfectly capable of running on Mac

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.380 
perfectly capable of running on Mac
certain<00:00:16.170> linux<00:00:16.470> distributions<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:19.250> windows

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
certain linux distributions and windows

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.939 
certain linux distributions and windows
with<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.510> linux<00:00:21.779> distributions<00:00:22.410> basically

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
with the linux distributions basically

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.920 
with the linux distributions basically
when<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.550> go<00:00:23.760> when<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.180> download<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.810> can

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
when you go when you download it you can

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.710 
when you go when you download it you can
download<00:00:25.140> or<00:00:25.769> google<00:00:26.519> download<00:00:26.789> synergy

that's sy n e r gy and sourceforge has

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.500 
that's sy n e r gy and sourceforge has
it<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.690> go<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.870> files<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:35.239> binaries<00:00:36.239> and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
it you go to files and binaries and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.240 
it you go to files and binaries and
under<00:00:37.260> there<00:00:37.440> you'll<00:00:37.649> have<00:00:37.860> three<00:00:38.100> different

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
under there you'll have three different

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.389 
under there you'll have three different
files<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.969> exe<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.950> RPM<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.360> a<00:00:42.360> tar.gz<00:00:43.399> the

files in exe and RPM and a tar.gz the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.790 
files in exe and RPM and a tar.gz the
tar.gz<00:00:44.640> will<00:00:45.570> give<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.840> what<00:00:46.079> results<00:00:46.710> in

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
tar.gz will give you what results in

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.459 
tar.gz will give you what results in
this<00:00:50.000> so<00:00:51.000> basically<00:00:51.360> what<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.600> did<00:00:51.870> for<00:00:52.079> Mac<00:00:52.289> is

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
this so basically what I did for Mac is

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.880 
this so basically what I did for Mac is
I<00:00:52.590> downloaded<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.329> on<00:00:54.559> target<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:56.809> I<00:00:57.890> copied

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
I downloaded it on target and I copied

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.209 
I downloaded it on target and I copied
it<00:00:59.039> into<00:00:59.129> my<00:00:59.550> Applications<00:01:00.210> folder<00:01:00.300> i<00:01:01.219> renamed

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
it into my Applications folder i renamed

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.740 
it into my Applications folder i renamed
it<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.399> make<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.640> look<00:01:02.760> all<00:01:02.940> pretty<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.329> copied

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
it to make it look all pretty and copied

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.840 
it to make it look all pretty and copied
into<00:01:03.899> my<00:01:04.080> Applications<00:01:04.680> folder<00:01:06.170> under

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
into my Applications folder under

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.340 
into my Applications folder under
Windows<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.030> get<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.270> exe<00:01:10.700> standard<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:12.780> RPM

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
Windows you get the exe standard the RPM

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.760 
Windows you get the exe standard the RPM
would<00:01:13.799> be<00:01:13.950> used<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:14.729> any<00:01:15.060> RPM<00:01:15.930> based<00:01:16.170> linux

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
would be used for any RPM based linux

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.920 
would be used for any RPM based linux
distributions<00:01:17.549> such<00:01:17.640> as<00:01:17.909> fedora<00:01:18.270> Red<00:01:18.720> Hat

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
distributions such as fedora Red Hat

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.719 
distributions such as fedora Red Hat
Santa<00:01:19.380> less<00:01:21.470> so<00:01:22.470> basically<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.130> terminology

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
Santa less so basically the terminology

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.810 
Santa less so basically the terminology
here<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.450> have<00:01:24.600> server<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.229> client

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
here is that you have server and client

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.480 
here is that you have server and client
and<00:01:27.049> to<00:01:28.049> continue<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.650> think<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.040> got<00:01:29.220> off<00:01:29.310> track

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
and to continue I think I got off track

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.999 
and to continue I think I got off track
synergy<00:01:30.479> will<00:01:30.750> share<00:01:31.110> your<00:01:31.350> keyboard<00:01:31.860> and

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
synergy will share your keyboard and

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.130 
synergy will share your keyboard and
mouse<00:01:32.189> over<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.850> network<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.600> another

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
mouse over the network to another

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.380 
mouse over the network to another
operating<00:01:34.950> system<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.490> could<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.820> windows<00:01:36.210> if

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
operating system it could be windows if

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.380 
operating system it could be windows if
you<00:01:36.479> want<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.869> be<00:01:37.159> it<00:01:38.159> could<00:01:38.400> be<00:01:38.579> Windows<00:01:39.240> to

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
you want it to be it could be Windows to

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.030 
you want it to be it could be Windows to
Mac<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.810> what<00:01:39.960> i'm<00:01:40.049> doing<00:01:40.290> here<00:01:40.530> windows<00:01:40.890> to

as<00:01:49.229> it's<00:01:49.380> supported<00:01:49.860> now<00:01:50.579> there's<00:01:51.329> two

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
as it's supported now there's two

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.109 
as it's supported now there's two
different<00:01:51.659> terms<00:01:51.930> here<00:01:52.340> server<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.640> client

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
different terms here server and client

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.300 
different terms here server and client
as<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.570> can<00:01:54.689> see<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.020> have<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.200> synergy<00:01:55.710> s<00:01:55.860> and

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
as you can see you have a synergy s and

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.399 
as you can see you have a synergy s and
the<00:01:56.460> synergy<00:01:56.939> see<00:01:57.210> S<00:01:57.479> stands<00:01:58.020> for<00:01:58.110> server

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
the synergy see S stands for server

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.789 
the synergy see S stands for server
client<00:01:58.890> stands<00:01:59.310> for<00:01:59.640> or<00:02:00.200> C<00:02:01.200> stands<00:02:01.500> for<00:02:01.590> client

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.899 

basically<00:02:05.799> the<00:02:05.950> server<00:02:06.159> would<00:02:06.399> be<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.640> device

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
basically the server would be the device

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.400 
basically the server would be the device
that<00:02:07.090> has<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.509> keyboard<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.200> mouse

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
that has the keyboard and mouse

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.070 
that has the keyboard and mouse
physically<00:02:09.009> plugged<00:02:09.280> into<00:02:09.459> it<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:10.080> the

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
physically plugged into it and the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.650 
physically plugged into it and the
client<00:02:11.410> would<00:02:11.530> be<00:02:11.650> through<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.660> client

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
client would be through the client

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.089 
client would be through the client
computer<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.170> one<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.500> you're<00:02:14.620> going<00:02:14.830> to<00:02:14.980> be

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
computer the one that you're going to be

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.070 
computer the one that you're going to be
moving<00:02:15.580> your<00:02:15.790> your<00:02:16.330> mouths<00:02:16.569> off<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.959> edge<00:02:17.049> of

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
moving your your mouths off the edge of

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.759 
moving your your mouths off the edge of
the<00:02:17.260> screen<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.860> get<00:02:18.129> to<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:20.200> basically<00:02:20.560> the

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
the screen to get to so basically the

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.650 
the screen to get to so basically the
way<00:02:20.890> it'll<00:02:21.069> work<00:02:21.250> is<00:02:21.489> when<00:02:21.640> I'm<00:02:21.760> done<00:02:22.000> which<00:02:22.510> I

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
way it'll work is when I'm done which I

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.539 
way it'll work is when I'm done which I
basically<00:02:22.959> already<00:02:23.379> got<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.799> setup<00:02:24.160> I<00:02:24.340> just

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
basically already got the setup I just

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.160 
basically already got the setup I just

windows and the one to the right as mac

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.410 
windows and the one to the right as mac
and<00:02:44.250> literally<00:02:45.250> you're<00:02:45.519> seeing<00:02:45.730> exactly<00:02:46.060> what

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
and literally you're seeing exactly what

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.119 
and literally you're seeing exactly what
this<00:02:46.989> is<00:02:47.049> on<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.560> screen<00:02:47.709> because<00:02:47.920> i'm<00:02:48.099> using

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
this is on the screen because i'm using

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.210 
this is on the screen because i'm using
teamviewer<00:02:49.379> as<00:02:50.379> you<00:02:50.530> can<00:02:50.650> see<00:02:50.799> I've<00:02:50.980> enabled

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
teamviewer as you can see I've enabled

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.100 
teamviewer as you can see I've enabled
the<00:02:51.489> remote<00:02:51.790> cursor<00:02:52.180> so<00:02:52.390> you<00:02:52.450> will<00:02:52.720> be<00:02:52.750> able<00:02:52.930> to

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
the remote cursor so you will be able to

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.099 
the remote cursor so you will be able to
see<00:02:53.319> that<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.709> works<00:02:53.739> when<00:02:54.519> it's<00:02:54.700> done<00:02:55.109> so

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
see that it works when it's done so

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.670 
see that it works when it's done so
basically<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:58.480> get<00:02:58.629> your<00:02:58.870> windows<00:02:59.230> version

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
basically you get your windows version

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.259 
basically you get your windows version
installed<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:00.459> you'll<00:03:00.549> come<00:03:00.760> up<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.970> a<00:03:01.030> screen

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
installed and you'll come up to a screen

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.330 
installed and you'll come up to a screen
that<00:03:01.299> looks<00:03:01.420> like<00:03:01.599> this<00:03:01.890> since<00:03:02.890> this<00:03:03.040> is<00:03:03.190> going

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
that looks like this since this is going

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.830 
that looks like this since this is going
to<00:03:03.400> be<00:03:03.489> my<00:03:03.609> server<00:03:03.849> this<00:03:04.150> is<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.420> one<00:03:04.569> that<00:03:04.690> the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
to be my server this is the one that the

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.270 
to be my server this is the one that the
mouse<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.170> keyboard<00:03:05.560> are<00:03:05.890> physically

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
mouse and keyboard are physically

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.490 
mouse and keyboard are physically
plugged<00:03:06.489> into<00:03:06.670> I<00:03:06.970> say<00:03:07.510> share<00:03:07.780> this<00:03:07.989> computer's

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
plugged into I say share this computer's

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.270 
plugged into I say share this computer's
keyboard<00:03:08.769> and<00:03:09.160> mouse<00:03:09.930> server<00:03:10.930> say<00:03:11.829> server

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
keyboard and mouse server say server

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.759 
keyboard and mouse server say server
client<00:03:12.519> server<00:03:12.910> client<00:03:13.139> go<00:03:14.139> into<00:03:14.349> configure

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
client server client go into configure

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.910 
client server client go into configure
now<00:03:15.250> you<00:03:15.340> set<00:03:15.519> up<00:03:15.549> both<00:03:15.760> your<00:03:15.790> screens

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
now you set up both your screens

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.440 
now you set up both your screens
basically<00:03:17.920> a<00:03:17.950> screen<00:03:18.280> is<00:03:18.459> think<00:03:19.120> of<00:03:19.209> it<00:03:19.299> like<00:03:19.389> a

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
basically a screen is think of it like a

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.559 
basically a screen is think of it like a
computer<00:03:19.750> video<00:03:20.410> card<00:03:20.799> so<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.010> speak<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:22.450> hit

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
computer video card so to speak you hit

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.879 
computer video card so to speak you hit
the<00:03:22.690> plus<00:03:22.900> give<00:03:23.769> it<00:03:23.889> the<00:03:23.950> screen<00:03:24.220> name

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
the plus give it the screen name

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.890 
the plus give it the screen name
convention<00:03:26.889> is<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.069> use<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:28.030> host<00:03:28.569> name<00:03:28.780> of

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
convention is to use the host name of

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.740 
convention is to use the host name of
the<00:03:28.959> computer<00:03:29.079> so<00:03:29.829> i<00:03:29.859> got<00:03:30.130> bue<00:03:30.760> office<00:03:31.540> that's

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
the computer so i got bue office that's

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.240 
the computer so i got bue office that's
my<00:03:31.900> Windows<00:03:32.200> machine<00:03:32.230> and<00:03:32.739> of<00:03:32.829> course<00:03:33.010> matts

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250

telling synergy where the other computer

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.319 
telling synergy where the other computer
is<00:03:46.959> and<00:03:47.319> where<00:03:47.440> your<00:03:47.650> computer<00:03:48.069> is<00:03:48.239> so<00:03:49.239> you

OK and then go ahead and open up test

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.619 
OK and then go ahead and open up test
now<00:04:18.280> once<00:04:18.489> you<00:04:18.579> open<00:04:18.729> up<00:04:18.909> test<00:04:19.209> you'll<00:04:19.479> get

00:04:19.619 --> 00:04:19.629 
now once you open up test you'll get

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:24.480 
now once you open up test you'll get
this<00:04:19.750> screen<00:04:19.810> here<00:04:21.659> this<00:04:22.659> screen<00:04:23.050> here<00:04:23.490> that
