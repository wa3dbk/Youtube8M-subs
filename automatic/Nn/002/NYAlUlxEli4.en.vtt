00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:27.240
 swiss concrete and wheels is the model 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:29.840
 that comes a greeting for all your 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.840

 and I hope you like it 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.800
 well let's assemble the seat 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.989
 first let's check out 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.230
 the bottom piece 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:51.000
 of the support that attracts in blue color to 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.000
 customize a little bit more the bike 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.989
 this piece 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.559
 attracts the blue color 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.140
 making a italy stamp 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.880
 personalized to eat 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.930
 and positioned and we sleep in 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.220
 on your site 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.220
 well let's put 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.250
 the portico where I played also 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.710
 covers pods 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.530
 pass 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.180
 and make the front wheel assembly 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.750
 and the adjustment 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:11.130
 the front clip 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:14.990
 this is a protector to put between 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.700
 the pills in case we get the doubt 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.590
 and we tighten the brake lever without 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.130
 want that we do not close the 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.130
 pistons 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.659
 well, we have 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.340
 the mounted front wheel 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.260
 the brake adjustment 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.290
 to adjust the brake caliper 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.290
 Brake 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.270
 we hold the brake tight we leave 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.660
 roll the wheel a little 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:58.150
 and we left it finally tight 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.530
 then with the pills closed 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.530
 we tighten the clamp 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:09.480
 this sometimes works sometimes not 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.610
 so if that does not work we have to 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.120
 make a small manual adjustment 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.120
 we'll see 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.190

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.190
 12 in the pill 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.099
 therefore we will release a little bit the 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.099
 pin 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.620
 well let's go with the handlebar assembly 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.560
 we have removed part of the packaging 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:43.410

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.410

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.890

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.620

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.290
