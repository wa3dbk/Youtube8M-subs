00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.680
 Hello everyone and I bring you step number 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.900
 5 in the ies tÃ©rek of exo zombies in the 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.090
 map of out break and good first of 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.919
 everything for this step we need this 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.140
 drink from here that if I remember correctly is 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:24.790
 the ex-soldier is this that we hit the 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.860
 double jump and when we give it at once 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.869
 hit with a punch on the ground or a 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.130
 kick on the ground exactly and good 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.559
 we have to come to this area here and 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.450
 there is just the next card 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.680
 and what we have to do is between 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.920
 all among the four players 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.660
 we shoot until this lever does not matter 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.820
 a person is shot as if they shoot 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.170
 3 4 ok let's shoot this lever 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.360
 until little by little as you see 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.130
 going down and there will come a time when 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.010
 will disappear little by little going down and 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.020
 there comes a point where it disappears 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.820
 when this lever has disappeared what 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.950
 what we have to do is skip the 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.050
 four players because this tutorial is 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.550
 for four players since good for 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.380
 one player or two or three 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.579
 players is similar but for four 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.829
 as I said before it has to be a 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.270
 little bit more concrete, as you can see, 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:09.280
 has disappeared to the lever what 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.659
 next thing we have to do is we 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.420
 we put the four here and we have 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.870
 to jump in the square this you see 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.040
 there in front 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.310
 it's worth the four at a time we have to 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.840
 make the double jump and with that advantage 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.280
 hit the kick on the ground as well as 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.230
 you are seeing this first time we fail 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.720
 and now how are you going to see the second time 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.540
 is just going to get under the 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.430
 soil and the other wash will rise that the 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.720
 another square as you want to call it 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.820
 there's ahead just now 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.000
 we make the double jump we paste with the 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.040
 come down on the thing this is worth and 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.900
 when it goes up it 's here we just have 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.090
 to take the card just the one 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.300
 have to catch the card is the old 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.770
 not the one with the cap the cleaning guy is 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.750
 the one who has to take the card when 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.040
 up the other platform up 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.840
 ok since when we are four 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.880
 players this character is the one that has 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.620
 have to take the card if not not not 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.330
 they will let you take the card so good 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.790
 this is the fifth step soon you are going to 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.530
 have the sixth and soon we do not have it 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.820
 finished because this is already finished 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.560
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.000

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.270
