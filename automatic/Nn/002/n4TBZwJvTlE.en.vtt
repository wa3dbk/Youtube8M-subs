UAV and this is kind of self-explanatory

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.989 
UAV and this is kind of self-explanatory
it's<00:01:33.439> one<00:01:33.619> of<00:01:33.649> the<00:01:33.799> more<00:01:34.009> easy<00:01:34.399> kill<00:01:34.759> streaks

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:34.999 
it's one of the more easy kill streaks

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:36.099 
it's one of the more easy kill streaks
to<00:01:35.149> get<00:01:35.299> but<00:01:35.479> it's<00:01:35.600> one<00:01:35.779> of<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:35.959> more

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:36.109 
to get but it's one of the more

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:38.529 
to get but it's one of the more
effective<00:01:36.590> if<00:01:36.709> that<00:01:36.889> makes<00:01:37.069> sense<00:01:37.340> now<00:01:37.579> this

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
effective if that makes sense now this

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:39.879 
effective if that makes sense now this
is<00:01:38.749> something<00:01:39.259> that's<00:01:39.350> going<00:01:39.529> to<00:01:39.619> allow<00:01:39.740> the

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:39.889 
is something that's going to allow the

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:41.709 
is something that's going to allow the
enemies<00:01:40.520> to<00:01:40.639> show<00:01:40.789> up<00:01:40.909> on<00:01:41.029> your<00:01:41.060> mini-map<00:01:41.359> and

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
enemies are at all times so the UAV is

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.129 
enemies are at all times so the UAV is
definitely<00:01:47.090> going<00:01:47.240> to<00:01:47.299> assist<00:01:47.569> you<00:01:47.779> in<00:01:47.810> doing

warfare<00:01:54.439> now<00:01:54.740> I<00:01:55.009> put<00:01:55.340> these<00:01:55.459> together<00:01:55.639> because

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
warfare now I put these together because

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.219 
warfare now I put these together because
they're<00:01:56.299> pretty<00:01:56.450> much<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.630> same<00:01:56.869> score

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
they're pretty much the same score

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.779 
they're pretty much the same score
streak<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:57.770> they're<00:01:57.979> just<00:01:58.249> in<00:01:58.490> different

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
streak and they're just in different

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.789 
streak and they're just in different
games<00:01:59.179> so<00:01:59.509> like<00:02:00.049> I<00:02:00.139> said<00:02:00.200> I<00:02:00.349> put<00:02:00.590> them<00:02:00.679> together

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
games so like I said I put them together

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.129 
games so like I said I put them together
because<00:02:01.279> they<00:02:01.399> do<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.700> same<00:02:01.909> exact<00:02:02.329> thing<00:02:02.630> now

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:03.139 
because they do the same exact thing now

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:05.260 
because they do the same exact thing now
the<00:02:03.200> amount<00:02:03.499> of<00:02:03.590> like<00:02:04.340> kills<00:02:04.639> and<00:02:04.880> all<00:02:04.969> that

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
the amount of like kills and all that

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.449 
the amount of like kills and all that
are<00:02:05.689> pretty<00:02:05.899> much<00:02:06.079> the<00:02:06.200> same<00:02:06.409> throughout<00:02:07.009> each

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
are pretty much the same throughout each

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.249 
are pretty much the same throughout each
call<00:02:07.700> of<00:02:07.789> duty<00:02:07.999> i<00:02:08.030> think<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:08.479> was<00:02:08.630> about<00:02:08.750> seven

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
call of duty i think it was about seven

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.770 
call of duty i think it was about seven
or<00:02:09.349> eight<00:02:09.470> kills<00:02:09.770> and<00:02:10.009> they<00:02:10.759> both<00:02:11.330> genuinely

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
or eight kills and they both genuinely

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.080 
or eight kills and they both genuinely
do<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.319> same<00:02:12.530> amount<00:02:12.680> of<00:02:12.950> work<00:02:13.010> now<00:02:13.730> you'll

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
do the same amount of work now you'll

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.140 
do the same amount of work now you'll
get<00:02:14.239> about<00:02:14.920> four<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.099> five<00:02:16.130> kills<00:02:16.700> depending

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
get about four to five kills depending

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.309 
get about four to five kills depending
on<00:02:17.270> how<00:02:17.420> well<00:02:17.630> you're<00:02:17.810> bombing<00:02:17.989> round<00:02:18.200> is

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
on how well you're bombing round is

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.960 
on how well you're bombing round is
going<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.500> do<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:18.800> what<00:02:18.980> map<00:02:19.130> you're<00:02:19.340> on<00:02:19.459> but

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
going to do and what map you're on but

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.340 
going to do and what map you're on but
other<00:02:20.180> than<00:02:20.330> that<00:02:20.390> like<00:02:20.720> i<00:02:20.870> said<00:02:21.080> this

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
other than that like i said this

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.110 
other than that like i said this
killstreak<00:02:21.980> almost<00:02:22.310> guarantees<00:02:22.730> you<00:02:22.910> about

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
killstreak almost guarantees you about

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.490 
killstreak almost guarantees you about
four<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.420> five<00:02:23.450> kills<00:02:23.930> per

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
four to five kills per

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.650 
four to five kills per
every<00:02:24.770> time<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.100> call<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:25.490> in<00:02:25.700> so<00:02:26.000> definitely

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
every time you call it in so definitely

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.240 
every time you call it in so definitely
one<00:02:27.050> of<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.200> better<00:02:27.350> ones<00:02:27.470> in<00:02:27.830> call<00:02:28.100> of<00:02:28.130> duty

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
one of the better ones in call of duty

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.250 
one of the better ones in call of duty
now<00:02:28.940> coming<00:02:29.240> in<00:02:29.330> at<00:02:29.450> number<00:02:29.570> eight<00:02:29.870> we<00:02:30.080> have

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
now coming in at number eight we have

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.020 
now coming in at number eight we have
the<00:02:30.380> counter<00:02:30.710> UAV<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.340> system<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:31.820> canned

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
the counter UAV and the system a canned

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.190 
the counter UAV and the system a canned
again<00:02:32.240> I'll<00:02:32.630> put<00:02:32.810> these<00:02:32.960> two<00:02:33.080> together

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
again I'll put these two together

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.660 
again I'll put these two together
because<00:02:33.680> they<00:02:33.830> pretty<00:02:34.010> much<00:02:34.100> do<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.370> same

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
because they pretty much do the same

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.340 
because they pretty much do the same
exact<00:02:35.030> thing<00:02:35.330> they're<00:02:35.840> just<00:02:35.870> in<00:02:36.200> different

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
exact thing they're just in different

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.100 
exact thing they're just in different
games<00:02:36.770> now<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.640> reason<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:37.940> this<00:02:38.390> is<00:02:38.600> such<00:02:38.810> a

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
games now the reason that this is such a

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.870 
games now the reason that this is such a
good<00:02:39.500> kill<00:02:39.710> streak<00:02:39.950> is<00:02:40.070> because<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:40.550> can<00:02:40.730> get

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
good kill streak is because you can get

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.710 
good kill streak is because you can get
it<00:02:41.000> at<00:02:41.120> an<00:02:41.300> early<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.080> easy<00:02:42.400> kill<00:02:43.570> spread<00:02:44.570> if

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
it at an early and easy kill spread if

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.510 
it at an early and easy kill spread if
that<00:02:44.870> makes<00:02:45.050> sense<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.560> it's<00:02:45.830> also<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.160> very

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
that makes sense and it's also a very

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.640 
that makes sense and it's also a very
effective<00:02:46.970> killstreak<00:02:47.540> because<00:02:47.840> it<00:02:48.140> is<00:02:48.320> able

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
effective killstreak because it is able

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.010 
effective killstreak because it is able
to<00:02:49.040> discombobulate<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:50.000> enemy<00:02:50.330> it<00:02:50.750> takes

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
to discombobulate the enemy it takes

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.900 
to discombobulate the enemy it takes
away<00:02:51.200> their<00:02:51.350> mini<00:02:51.560> map<00:02:51.740> and<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.070> also<00:02:52.340> allows

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
away their mini map and it also allows

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.790 
away their mini map and it also allows
you<00:02:53.120> guys<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.570> be<00:02:53.660> able<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:53.930> flank<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.470> use<00:02:54.650> on

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
you guys to be able to flank and use on

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.140 
you guys to be able to flank and use on
silenced<00:02:55.190> weapons<00:02:55.550> and<00:02:55.730> things<00:02:55.790> of<00:02:56.120> that

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
silenced weapons and things of that

this<00:03:46.220> always<00:03:46.820> depends<00:03:47.239> on<00:03:47.360> the<00:03:47.480> map<00:03:47.630> that<00:03:47.780> you

this always depends on the map that you

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.110 
this always depends on the map that you
guys<00:03:48.049> call<00:03:48.320> them<00:03:48.440> in<00:03:48.560> because<00:03:48.709> it<00:03:49.459> differs

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
guys call them in because it differs

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.880 
guys call them in because it differs
from<00:03:50.269> map<00:03:50.510> to<00:03:50.720> map<00:03:50.900> how<00:03:51.170> much<00:03:51.410> work<00:03:51.680> your

from map to map how much work your
attack<00:03:52.610> dogs<00:03:52.880> are<00:03:53.090> actually<00:03:53.360> going<00:03:53.450> to<00:03:53.570> do<00:03:53.690> so

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
attack dogs are actually going to do so

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.960 
attack dogs are actually going to do so
like<00:03:54.440> I<00:03:54.560> said<00:03:54.620> this<00:03:55.010> score<00:03:55.340> streak<00:03:55.579> actually

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
like I said this score streak actually

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.789 
like I said this score streak actually
depends<00:03:56.390> on<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.630> map<00:03:56.840> but<00:03:57.380> other<00:03:57.560> than<00:03:57.650> that

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
depends on the map but other than that

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.250 
depends on the map but other than that
these<00:03:58.370> will<00:03:58.579> average<00:03:58.760> you<00:03:59.000> about<00:03:59.239> 5<00:03:59.570> to<00:03:59.870> 15

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
these will average you about 5 to 15

these will average you about 5 to 15
kills<00:04:00.530> depending<00:04:00.950> on<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.160> map<00:04:01.310> that<00:04:01.489> you<00:04:01.519> guys

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
kills depending on the map that you guys

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.370 
kills depending on the map that you guys
called<00:04:01.970> it<00:04:02.120> in<00:04:02.299> and<00:04:02.450> depending<00:04:03.170> on<00:04:03.290> the

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
called it in and depending on the

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.720 
called it in and depending on the
enemies<00:04:03.739> on<00:04:03.860> the<00:04:03.890> other<00:04:04.070> team<00:04:04.310> because<00:04:04.610> you

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
enemies on the other team because you

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.000 
enemies on the other team because you
can<00:04:04.970> kill<00:04:05.239> the<00:04:05.360> attack<00:04:05.630> dogs<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.170> that's<00:04:06.769> the

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
can kill the attack dogs and that's the

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.860 
can kill the attack dogs and that's the
only<00:04:07.040> downside<00:04:07.760> to<00:04:07.910> it<00:04:07.940> but<00:04:08.299> you<00:04:08.420> get<00:04:08.540> a<00:04:08.600> lot<00:04:08.840> of

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
only downside to it but you get a lot of

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.380 
only downside to it but you get a lot of
them<00:04:09.079> so<00:04:09.350> that's<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.860> upside<00:04:10.250> to<00:04:10.730> it<00:04:10.760> now

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
them so that's the upside to it now

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.850 
them so that's the upside to it now
anyways<00:04:11.690> coming<00:04:11.959> in<00:04:12.049> at<00:04:12.170> number<00:04:12.230> 4<00:04:12.590> we<00:04:12.739> have

the swarm from black ops 2 and this is

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.650 
the swarm from black ops 2 and this is
also<00:04:15.890> another<00:04:16.220> map<00:04:16.549> dependent<00:04:17.180> kill<00:04:17.390> streak

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
also another map dependent kill streak

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.479 
also another map dependent kill streak
but<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.440> amount<00:04:18.590> of<00:04:18.739> work<00:04:18.919> that<00:04:18.979> this<00:04:19.280> did

but the amount of work that this did

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.039 
but the amount of work that this did
before<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:20.000> patch<00:04:20.180> and<00:04:20.450> even<00:04:20.660> after<00:04:20.840> the

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.350 
before the patch and even after the
patch<00:04:21.229> you<00:04:21.739> could<00:04:21.919> average<00:04:22.100> about<00:04:22.430> five<00:04:22.760> to

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
patch you could average about five to

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.140 
patch you could average about five to
forty<00:04:24.050> kills<00:04:24.290> per<00:04:24.650> swarm<00:04:25.040> and<00:04:25.280> that's<00:04:25.550> a<00:04:25.760> lot

forty kills per swarm and that's a lot

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.960 
forty kills per swarm and that's a lot
and<00:04:26.419> that's<00:04:26.540> a

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
and that's a

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.480 
and that's a
huge<00:04:27.200> variation<00:04:28.200> from<00:04:28.350> five<00:04:28.620> to<00:04:28.860> forty<00:04:29.250> so

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
huge variation from five to forty so

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.460 
huge variation from five to forty so
like<00:04:30.000> I<00:04:30.090> said<00:04:30.150> it<00:04:30.390> all<00:04:30.600> depends<00:04:31.080> on<00:04:31.140> the<00:04:31.290> map

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
like I said it all depends on the map

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.320 
like I said it all depends on the map
that<00:04:31.650> you<00:04:31.680> guys<00:04:31.860> call<00:04:32.100> it<00:04:32.220> in<00:04:32.370> it<00:04:32.520> also<00:04:32.880> depends

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
that you guys call it in it also depends

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.720 
that you guys call it in it also depends
on<00:04:33.480> the<00:04:33.600> enemies<00:04:33.930> as<00:04:34.140> well<00:04:34.560> now<00:04:35.160> coming<00:04:35.490> in<00:04:35.580> at

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
on the enemies as well now coming in at

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.180 
on the enemies as well now coming in at
number<00:04:35.910> three<00:04:36.390> we<00:04:36.930> have<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.170> ac-130<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:38.070> the

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
number three we have the ac-130 and the

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.190 
number three we have the ac-130 and the
chopper<00:04:38.490> gunner<00:04:38.850> now<00:04:39.210> this<00:04:39.660> is<00:04:39.870> going<00:04:39.990> to<00:04:40.110> be

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
chopper gunner now this is going to be

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.920 
chopper gunner now this is going to be
from<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.530> mw2<00:04:40.800> series<00:04:41.580> so<00:04:41.910> that<00:04:42.180> way<00:04:42.330> these

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
from the mw2 series so that way these

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.290 
from the mw2 series so that way these
are<00:04:43.200> the<00:04:43.380> best<00:04:43.800> kill<00:04:44.160> streaks<00:04:44.460> in<00:04:44.640> the<00:04:45.090> game

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
are the best kill streaks in the game

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.050 
are the best kill streaks in the game
now<00:04:45.830> once<00:04:46.830> you<00:04:46.920> got<00:04:47.100> these<00:04:47.340> you<00:04:47.730> were<00:04:47.850> almost

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
now once you got these you were almost

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.730 
now once you got these you were almost
guaranteed<00:04:48.630> your<00:04:48.840> nuke<00:04:49.020> and<00:04:49.260> that's<00:04:49.500> the

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
guaranteed your nuke and that's the

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.530 
guaranteed your nuke and that's the
reason<00:04:50.070> why<00:04:50.100> this<00:04:50.310> is<00:04:50.730> so<00:04:50.970> high<00:04:51.150> up<00:04:51.180> on<00:04:51.510> the

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
reason why this is so high up on the

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.620 
reason why this is so high up on the
list<00:04:51.840> because<00:04:52.460> this<00:04:53.460> guaranteed<00:04:54.120> you<00:04:54.360> at

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
list because this guaranteed you at

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.030 
list because this guaranteed you at
least<00:04:55.410> 10<00:04:56.220> to<00:04:56.370> 15<00:04:56.820> kills<00:04:57.090> if<00:04:57.330> not<00:04:57.560> 15<00:04:58.560> to<00:04:58.680> 20

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
least 10 to 15 kills if not 15 to 20

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.460 
least 10 to 15 kills if not 15 to 20
depending<00:04:59.220> on<00:04:59.610> the<00:04:59.910> spawns<00:05:00.270> depending<00:05:00.870> on<00:05:00.990> how

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
depending on the spawns depending on how

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.740 
depending on the spawns depending on how
all<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:01.890> enemies<00:05:02.130> were<00:05:02.640> and<00:05:03.000> how<00:05:03.240> well<00:05:03.510> your

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
all the enemies were and how well your

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.080 
all the enemies were and how well your
score<00:05:04.080> streaks<00:05:04.380> actually<00:05:04.590> went<00:05:05.010> in<00:05:05.220> so<00:05:05.520> these

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
score streaks actually went in so these

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.630 
score streaks actually went in so these
like<00:05:06.450> I<00:05:06.570> said<00:05:06.750> we're<00:05:06.990> the<00:05:07.110> best<00:05:07.380> kill<00:05:08.310> streaks

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
like I said we're the best kill streaks

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.990 
like I said we're the best kill streaks
in<00:05:08.850> mw2<00:05:09.540> now<00:05:10.440> coming<00:05:10.830> in<00:05:10.920> at<00:05:11.040> number<00:05:11.130> 2<00:05:11.430> we<00:05:11.880> have

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
in mw2 now coming in at number 2 we have

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.900 
in mw2 now coming in at number 2 we have
the<00:05:12.150> V<00:05:12.300> set<00:05:12.570> and<00:05:12.780> the<00:05:13.020> Blackbird<00:05:13.680> and<00:05:13.950> this

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
the V set and the Blackbird and this

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.820 
the V set and the Blackbird and this
goes<00:05:15.120> without<00:05:15.270> saying<00:05:15.450> that<00:05:15.930> this<00:05:16.350> is<00:05:16.560> one<00:05:16.740> of

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
goes without saying that this is one of

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.530 
goes without saying that this is one of
the<00:05:16.920> better<00:05:17.130> kill<00:05:17.460> streaks<00:05:17.790> in<00:05:18.000> call<00:05:18.360> of<00:05:18.390> duty

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
the better kill streaks in call of duty

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.840 
the better kill streaks in call of duty
just<00:05:19.320> for<00:05:19.470> the<00:05:19.530> simple<00:05:19.830> fact<00:05:19.860> that<00:05:20.190> you<00:05:20.490> cannot

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
just for the simple fact that you cannot

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.600 
just for the simple fact that you cannot
counter<00:05:21.360> it<00:05:21.510> and<00:05:21.830> this<00:05:22.830> shows<00:05:23.160> the<00:05:23.370> enemy

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
counter it and this shows the enemy
