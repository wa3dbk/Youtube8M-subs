now<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:30.560> sun<00:00:30.830> this<00:00:31.160> is<00:00:31.280> my<00:00:31.400> shot<00:00:31.580> of<00:00:31.700> the

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
now the sun this is my shot of the

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.819 
now the sun this is my shot of the
flower<00:00:32.000> we<00:00:32.300> have<00:00:32.480> some<00:00:32.989> contrasting<00:00:33.500> colors

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
flower we have some contrasting colors

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.650 
flower we have some contrasting colors
with<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.160> reds<00:00:34.520> and<00:00:34.700> the<00:00:34.789> Greens<00:00:35.030> very<00:00:35.420> nicely

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
with the reds and the Greens very nicely

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.889 
with the reds and the Greens very nicely
done<00:00:36.050> in<00:00:37.010> this<00:00:37.460> shot<00:00:37.670> I<00:00:37.969> think<00:00:38.449> would<00:00:38.749> have

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
done in this shot I think would have

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:40.810 
done in this shot I think would have
been<00:00:39.050> better<00:00:39.289> if<00:00:39.440> it<00:00:39.769> was<00:00:39.890> vertical<00:00:40.460> there's

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
been better if it was vertical there's

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.729 
been better if it was vertical there's
just<00:00:41.059> too<00:00:41.300> much<00:00:41.480> background<00:00:41.870> showing<00:00:42.379> and

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
just too much background showing and

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.559 
just too much background showing and
this<00:00:42.949> isn't<00:00:43.370> standing<00:00:43.730> out<00:00:43.879> very<00:00:44.300> well

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:44.569 
this isn't standing out very well

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:47.799 
this isn't standing out very well
against<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.050> background<00:00:45.370> so<00:00:46.370> I<00:00:46.699> would<00:00:47.329> um<00:00:47.510> I

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
against the background so I would um I

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.189 
against the background so I would um I
would<00:00:48.199> bring<00:00:48.530> it<00:00:48.679> way<00:00:48.949> in<00:00:49.159> and<00:00:49.899> shoot<00:00:50.899> it<00:00:50.989> as<00:00:51.170> a

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
would bring it way in and shoot it as a

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.259 
would bring it way in and shoot it as a
vertical<00:00:51.769> hopefully<00:00:52.489> you<00:00:52.609> could<00:00:52.789> get<00:00:52.940> that<00:00:53.120> in

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
vertical hopefully you could get that in

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:54.939 
vertical hopefully you could get that in
camera<00:00:53.719> and<00:00:53.929> not<00:00:54.140> worry<00:00:54.350> about<00:00:54.440> trying<00:00:54.829> to

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
camera and not worry about trying to

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.489 
camera and not worry about trying to
crop<00:00:55.219> it<00:00:55.249> afterwards<00:00:55.989> but<00:00:56.989> I<00:00:57.019> think<00:00:57.139> it's<00:00:57.409> a

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:57.499 
crop it afterwards but I think it's a

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:00.700 
crop it afterwards but I think it's a
stronger<00:00:57.889> shot<00:00:58.129> like<00:00:58.339> that<00:00:59.289> this<00:01:00.289> another

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
stronger shot like that this another

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.229 
stronger shot like that this another
shot<00:01:00.829> of<00:01:01.159> that<00:01:01.190> I<00:01:01.339> like<00:01:01.609> the<00:01:01.729> other<00:01:01.760> one<00:01:01.969> better

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
shot of that I like the other one better

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.969 
shot of that I like the other one better
if<00:01:02.870> you<00:01:02.989> look<00:01:03.109> at<00:01:03.229> the<00:01:03.350> other<00:01:03.499> one<00:01:03.710> the

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
if you look at the other one the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.370 
if you look at the other one the
background<00:01:04.549> I<00:01:04.699> William<00:01:05.630> was<00:01:05.780> obviously

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
background I William was obviously

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.490 
background I William was obviously
closer<00:01:06.799> this<00:01:07.220> time<00:01:07.280> to<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:07.820> flowers<00:01:08.240> so<00:01:09.170> it

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
closer this time to the flowers so it

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.200 
closer this time to the flowers so it
made<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:09.830> background<00:01:10.310> a<00:01:10.400> little<00:01:10.430> more<00:01:10.850> blurry

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
made the background a little more blurry

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.810 
made the background a little more blurry
and<00:01:11.600> he<00:01:12.530> has<00:01:12.650> a<00:01:12.680> more<00:01:12.980> uniform<00:01:13.490> background

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
and he has a more uniform background

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.480 
and he has a more uniform background
from<00:01:14.300> this<00:01:14.510> angle<00:01:14.780> from<00:01:15.560> this<00:01:15.800> angle<00:01:16.040> we<00:01:16.340> have

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
from this angle from this angle we have

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.150 
from this angle from this angle we have
this<00:01:16.700> big<00:01:16.910> varied<00:01:17.390> background<00:01:17.990> and<00:01:18.320> it's

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
this big varied background and it's

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.460 
this big varied background and it's
distracting<00:01:20.060> it's<00:01:20.300> taken<00:01:20.780> our<00:01:20.900> attention<00:01:21.350> off

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
distracting it's taken our attention off

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.970 
distracting it's taken our attention off
the<00:01:21.650> flowers<00:01:23.230> this<00:01:24.230> is<00:01:24.320> a<00:01:24.380> beautiful<00:01:24.530> shot

this is you know a three second exposure

the meantime you look at this job here

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.270 
the meantime you look at this job here
and<00:02:38.079> William<00:02:39.079> did<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.230> fantastic<00:02:39.470> job<00:02:39.859> you<00:02:40.129> can

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
and William did a fantastic job you can

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.589 
and William did a fantastic job you can
see<00:02:40.430> we<00:02:40.579> start<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.239> have<00:02:41.299> the<00:02:41.450> little

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
see we start to have the little

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.929 
see we start to have the little
starburst<00:02:42.200> effect<00:02:42.409> on<00:02:42.829> these<00:02:43.069> street<00:02:43.670> lamps

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:43.939 
starburst effect on these street lamps

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:45.819 
starburst effect on these street lamps
right<00:02:44.150> here<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:44.959> that's<00:02:45.139> because<00:02:45.319> he<00:02:45.530> used<00:02:45.709> a

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
right here and that's because he used a

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:47.740 
right here and that's because he used a
pretty<00:02:46.040> small<00:02:46.280> aperture<00:02:46.790> after<00:02:47.090> a<00:02:47.209> point<00:02:47.569> oh

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
pretty small aperture after a point oh

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.589 
pretty small aperture after a point oh
and<00:02:48.260> he<00:02:48.379> got<00:02:48.530> that<00:02:48.590> starburst<00:02:49.310> effect<00:02:49.549> he<00:02:50.420> was

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
and he got that starburst effect he was

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.559 
and he got that starburst effect he was
probably<00:02:50.799> eight<00:02:51.799> point<00:02:52.129> o<00:02:52.220> was<00:02:52.400> probably<00:02:52.849> like

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
probably eight point o was probably like

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.559 
probably eight point o was probably like
the<00:02:54.400> limit<00:02:55.400> II<00:02:55.459> could<00:02:55.670> have<00:02:55.760> got<00:02:55.939> it<00:02:56.150> as<00:02:56.329> a

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
the limit II could have got it as a

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:57.819 
the limit II could have got it as a
matter<00:02:56.810> of<00:02:56.870> fact<00:02:56.930> I<00:02:57.169> wouldn't<00:02:57.349> be<00:02:57.439> surprised

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
matter of fact I wouldn't be surprised

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.069 
matter of fact I wouldn't be surprised
if<00:02:57.980> William<00:02:58.310> told<00:02:58.579> me<00:02:58.879> that<00:02:59.480> he<00:02:59.689> used<00:02:59.900> an

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
if William told me that he used an

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.080 
if William told me that he used an
aftermarket<00:03:00.620> program<00:03:01.310> to<00:03:01.519> get<00:03:01.639> the<00:03:01.790> stars

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
aftermarket program to get the stars

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.690 
aftermarket program to get the stars
because<00:03:03.079> there<00:03:03.260> are<00:03:03.409> some<00:03:03.829> programs<00:03:04.159> out

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
because there are some programs out

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.940 
because there are some programs out
there<00:03:04.970> that<00:03:05.180> are<00:03:05.569> add-ons<00:03:05.959> to<00:03:06.470> Lightroom

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
there that are add-ons to Lightroom

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.319 
there that are add-ons to Lightroom
where<00:03:07.189> you<00:03:07.310> could<00:03:07.519> get<00:03:07.700> this<00:03:07.909> kind<00:03:08.180> of

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
where you could get this kind of

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.449 
where you could get this kind of
starburst<00:03:08.810> effect<00:03:09.069> so<00:03:10.069> I<00:03:10.099> wouldn't<00:03:10.400> be

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
starburst effect so I wouldn't be

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.399 
starburst effect so I wouldn't be
surprised<00:03:10.879> if<00:03:11.180> because<00:03:11.780> they<00:03:11.900> look<00:03:12.139> almost

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 
surprised if because they look almost

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:14.710 
surprised if because they look almost
too<00:03:12.709> uniform<00:03:12.980> actually<00:03:13.639> so<00:03:14.239> he<00:03:14.450> might<00:03:14.599> have

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
too uniform actually so he might have

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.720 
too uniform actually so he might have
used<00:03:14.870> an<00:03:15.049> aftermarket<00:03:15.620> program<00:03:16.280> to<00:03:16.459> get<00:03:16.609> that

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
used an aftermarket program to get that

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.240 
used an aftermarket program to get that
little<00:03:16.939> burst<00:03:17.299> effect<00:03:17.780> but<00:03:18.500> you<00:03:18.829> don't<00:03:19.069> always

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
little burst effect but you don't always

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.069 
little burst effect but you don't always
need<00:03:19.579> the<00:03:19.730> program<00:03:20.120> if<00:03:20.329> you're<00:03:20.450> not<00:03:20.569> using<00:03:20.810> it

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
need the program if you're not using it

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.409 
need the program if you're not using it
you<00:03:21.200> can<00:03:21.349> do<00:03:21.500> some<00:03:21.849> you<00:03:22.849> know<00:03:22.939> just<00:03:23.239> use<00:03:23.389> a

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
you can do some you know just use a

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:25.750 
you can do some you know just use a
small<00:03:23.780> aperture<00:03:24.319> usually<00:03:24.739> around<00:03:24.889> f13<00:03:25.549> will

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
small aperture usually around f13 will

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.250 
small aperture usually around f13 will
give<00:03:25.909> you<00:03:26.000> a<00:03:26.090> really<00:03:26.449> nice<00:03:26.599> starburst<00:03:27.139> effect

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
give you a really nice starburst effect

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.039 
give you a really nice starburst effect
not<00:03:28.010> all<00:03:28.220> lenses<00:03:28.519> were<00:03:28.849> will<00:03:29.299> do<00:03:29.479> it<00:03:29.659> because

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
not all lenses were will do it because

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.619 
not all lenses were will do it because
it's<00:03:30.769> dependent<00:03:31.459> on<00:03:31.579> the<00:03:31.849> internal<00:03:32.269> structure

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
it's dependent on the internal structure

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.379 
it's dependent on the internal structure
of<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:33.349> diaphragm<00:03:33.680> in<00:03:34.099> your<00:03:34.250> lens<00:03:34.489> whether<00:03:35.209> or

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
of the diaphragm in your lens whether or

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.899 
of the diaphragm in your lens whether or
not<00:03:35.510> you're<00:03:35.810> you'll<00:03:36.470> get<00:03:36.650> this<00:03:36.829> up<00:03:37.010> fact<00:03:37.280> but

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
not you're you'll get this up fact but

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.460 
not you're you'll get this up fact but
try<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.239> out<00:03:38.419> hopefully<00:03:38.690> your<00:03:38.959> lens<00:03:39.169> will<00:03:39.319> do

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
try it out hopefully your lens will do

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.670 
try it out hopefully your lens will do
it<00:03:40.269> that's<00:03:41.269> a<00:03:41.359> very<00:03:41.569> cool<00:03:41.810> shot<00:03:42.049> very<00:03:42.470> another

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.559 
it that's a very cool shot very another
night<00:03:42.979> scene<00:03:43.340> you<00:03:43.699> know<00:03:43.819> stuff<00:03:44.209> moving<00:03:44.449> around

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
night scene you know stuff moving around

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.949 
night scene you know stuff moving around
we<00:03:44.989> do<00:03:45.139> have<00:03:45.349> the<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:46.299> ferris<00:03:47.299> wheel<00:03:47.389> kind<00:03:47.750> of

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
we do have the the ferris wheel kind of

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.599 
we do have the the ferris wheel kind of
shutting<00:03:48.560> into<00:03:48.859> the<00:03:48.949> pitcher<00:03:49.250> I<00:03:49.280> think<00:03:49.549> it

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
shutting into the pitcher I think it

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:50.860 
shutting into the pitcher I think it
would<00:03:49.729> have<00:03:49.819> been<00:03:49.879> a<00:03:49.940> stronger<00:03:50.389> image<00:03:50.629> if<00:03:50.750> we

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
would have been a stronger image if we

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.460 
would have been a stronger image if we
just<00:03:51.139> had<00:03:51.379> this<00:03:52.280> swing<00:03:53.090> ride<00:03:53.900> whatever<00:03:54.199> they

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
just had this swing ride whatever they

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.800 
just had this swing ride whatever they
call<00:03:54.650> it<00:03:54.680> if<00:03:55.159> they<00:03:55.340> had<00:03:55.489> we<00:03:55.699> had<00:03:55.849> that<00:03:56.060> alone<00:03:56.599> in

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
call it if they had we had that alone in

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:57.879 
call it if they had we had that alone in
the<00:03:56.900> image<00:03:57.169> I<00:03:57.290> think<00:03:57.500> it<00:03:57.560> would<00:03:57.650> have<00:03:57.739> been<00:03:57.829> a

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
the image I think it would have been a

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:01.689 
the image I think it would have been a
much<00:03:57.949> stronger<00:03:58.340> image<00:04:00.069> it's<00:04:01.069> another<00:04:01.370> sunset

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:01.699 
much stronger image it's another sunset

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:04.479 
much stronger image it's another sunset
