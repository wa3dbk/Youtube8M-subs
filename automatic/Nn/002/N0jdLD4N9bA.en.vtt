while back what I did was as you
remember<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:20.189> wanted<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.910> replace<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:22.760> solid

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
remember I I wanted to replace the solid

705 with barrel standoffs which is
something<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.450> benchmate<00:00:34.050> has<00:00:34.200> been<00:00:34.410> going

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
something that benchmate has been going

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.470 
something that benchmate has been going
to<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.219> lot<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.430> their<00:00:35.640> more<00:00:35.820> recent<00:00:35.850> knives

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
to in a lot of their more recent knives

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.520 
to in a lot of their more recent knives
of<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.670> 806<00:00:38.670> 901<00:00:39.329> for<00:00:39.570> example<00:00:39.989> maybe<00:00:40.200> some<00:00:40.440> of

of the 806 901 for example maybe some of

of the 806 901 for example maybe some of
the<00:00:40.590> other<00:00:40.770> 806<00:00:41.399> s<00:00:41.579> have<00:00:41.820> got<00:00:42.030> open

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the other 806 s have got open

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.130 
the other 806 s have got open
construction<00:00:43.430> the<00:00:44.430> 950<00:00:45.120> rift<00:00:45.420> it's<00:00:45.690> got<00:00:45.840> open

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
construction the 950 rift it's got open

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.410 
construction the 950 rift it's got open
construction<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.280> ordered<00:00:48.270> up<00:00:48.390> some

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
construction so I ordered up some

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.319 
construction so I ordered up some
spacers<00:00:49.140> from<00:00:49.320> knife<00:00:49.620> kits<00:00:49.920> comm<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:51.020> I<00:00:52.020> found

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
spacers from knife kits comm and I found

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.569 
spacers from knife kits comm and I found
spacers<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.360> are<00:00:54.750> correct<00:00:55.050> for<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.379> 705<00:00:56.100> and

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
spacers that are correct for the 705 and

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.060 
spacers that are correct for the 705 and
the<00:00:56.760> 710<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.480> didn't<00:00:58.109> find<00:00:58.350> any<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.800> were<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the 710 I didn't find any that were the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.439 
the 710 I didn't find any that were the
right<00:00:59.190> size<00:00:59.460> for<00:00:59.489> the<00:01:00.260> 707<00:01:01.260> which<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.680> even

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
right size for the 707 which is even

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.850 
right size for the 707 which is even
even<00:01:03.449> thinner<00:01:04.080> than<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:05.720> 705<00:01:06.720> for<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.170> 705<00:01:07.830> I

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
even thinner than the 705 for the 705 I

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.230 
even thinner than the 705 for the 705 I
used<00:01:08.430> some<00:01:08.970> decimal<00:01:09.810> 140<00:01:10.580> back<00:01:11.580> spacers

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
used some decimal 140 back spacers

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.020 
used some decimal 140 back spacers
barrel<00:01:13.140> spacers<00:01:13.619> rather<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.250> can<00:01:14.729> see

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
barrel spacers rather and you can see

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.130 
barrel spacers rather and you can see
those<00:01:15.270> here<00:01:15.750> they're<00:01:16.430> they're<00:01:17.430> kind<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.759> plain

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
those here they're they're kind of plain

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.350 
those here they're they're kind of plain
they<00:01:19.140> were<00:01:19.200> threaded<00:01:19.860> for<00:01:20.220> number<00:01:20.549> one<00:01:20.759> screws

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
they were threaded for number one screws

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.149 
they were threaded for number one screws
and<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.110> screws<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.740> go<00:01:22.799> through<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
and the screws that go through the

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.999 
and the screws that go through the
through<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.189> scales<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:27.090> liners<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> 705

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
through the scales and liners on the 705

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.060 
through the scales and liners on the 705
are<00:01:30.979> 256<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.579> had<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.909> drill<00:01:33.210> those<00:01:33.390> out

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
are 256 so I had to drill those out

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.410 
are 256 so I had to drill those out
which<00:01:35.070> really<00:01:35.250> wasn't<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.670> problem<00:01:35.820> that's<00:01:36.210> all

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
which really wasn't a problem that's all

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.819 
which really wasn't a problem that's all
it's<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.900> little<00:01:37.079> bit<00:01:37.170> finicky<00:01:37.350> because

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
it's a little bit finicky because

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.410 
it's a little bit finicky because
they're<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.130> small<00:01:38.189> but<00:01:39.090> other<00:01:39.240> than<00:01:39.329> that

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
they're so small but other than that

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.069 
they're so small but other than that
it's<00:01:39.750> it's<00:01:40.110> not<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.409> hard<00:01:40.680> project<00:01:41.390> I<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
it's it's not a hard project I like the

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.130 
it's it's not a hard project I like the
way<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.350> came<00:01:43.649> out<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.860> like<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:45.140> open

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
way this came out I like the open

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.149 
way this came out I like the open
construction<00:01:47.689> it<00:01:48.740> doesn't<00:01:49.740> seem<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.040> have

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
construction it doesn't seem to have

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.889 
construction it doesn't seem to have
taken<00:01:50.659> any<00:01:51.659> hit<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.500> rigidity<00:01:52.829> area<00:01:53.899> so

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
taken any hit in the rigidity area so

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.480 
taken any hit in the rigidity area so
you<00:01:54.990> got<00:01:55.140> flow<00:01:55.500> through<00:01:55.799> dirt<00:01:56.040> there<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.369> just

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
you got flow through dirt there you just

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.440 
you got flow through dirt there you just
blow<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.939> right<00:01:56.969> out<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:59.280> only<00:01:59.549> reservation<00:01:59.880> I

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
blow it right out the only reservation I

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.289 
blow it right out the only reservation I
guess<00:02:00.630> I'd<00:02:00.780> have<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.259> if<00:02:01.439> if<00:02:02.119> heaven<00:02:03.119> forbid

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
guess I'd have is if if heaven forbid

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.030 
guess I'd have is if if heaven forbid
you<00:02:03.600> kept<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:03.960> pocket<00:02:04.380> knife<00:02:04.560> in<00:02:04.799> your

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
you kept this pocket knife in your

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.760 
you kept this pocket knife in your
pocket<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.820> had<00:02:06.600> keys<00:02:06.960> or<00:02:07.229> coins<00:02:07.469> or

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
pocket and you had keys or coins or

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.229 
pocket and you had keys or coins or
something<00:02:08.099> like<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.459> could<00:02:08.700> see<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.000> edge

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
something like that I could see the edge

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.600 
something like that I could see the edge
of<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.720> blade<00:02:10.020> could<00:02:10.470> definitely<00:02:11.099> take<00:02:11.580> some

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
of the blade could definitely take some

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.710 
of the blade could definitely take some
damage<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.420> way

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
damage that way

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.650 
damage that way
but<00:02:13.500> if<00:02:14.460> you're<00:02:14.610> carrying<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.150> somewhere

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
but if you're carrying it somewhere

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.930 
but if you're carrying it somewhere
clipped<00:02:16.250> where<00:02:17.250> it's<00:02:17.400> not<00:02:17.550> gonna<00:02:17.700> have<00:02:17.910> any

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940

your<00:02:23.040> backpack<00:02:23.520> then<00:02:24.210> that<00:02:24.450> would<00:02:24.600> be<00:02:24.750> fine

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
your backpack then that would be fine

kits<00:02:31.740> had<00:02:31.980> several<00:02:32.400> choices<00:02:32.930> this<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.140> what<00:02:34.350> I

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
kits had several choices this is what I

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.190 
kits had several choices this is what I
wound<00:02:34.650> up<00:02:34.830> ordering<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.520> think<00:02:35.790> they<00:02:35.940> look<00:02:36.150> fine

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
wound up ordering I think they look fine

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.040 
wound up ordering I think they look fine
these<00:02:37.650> were<00:02:38.190> threaded<00:02:38.700> 256<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:39.810> just

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
these were threaded 256 and I just

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.170 
these were threaded 256 and I just
threaded<00:02:40.560> them<00:02:41.490> right<00:02:42.210> on<00:02:42.950> it<00:02:43.950> sounds<00:02:44.520> like<00:02:44.940> it

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
threaded them right on it sounds like it

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.630 
threaded them right on it sounds like it
wouldn't<00:02:45.480> work<00:02:45.690> but<00:02:46.080> because<00:02:46.770> you're<00:02:47.160> you're

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
wouldn't work but because you're you're

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.810 
wouldn't work but because you're you're
threading<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.930> screw<00:02:49.260> into<00:02:49.500> this<00:02:49.890> into<00:02:50.700> the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
threading the screw into this into the

threading the screw into this into the
spacer<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.540> then<00:02:51.780> into<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.500> liner<00:02:52.740> on<00:02:52.950> the

other side in practice it worked out

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.590 
other side in practice it worked out
great<00:02:55.730> everything<00:02:56.730> seems<00:02:57.030> very<00:02:57.150> nice<00:02:57.540> and

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
great everything seems very nice and

great everything seems very nice and
rigid<00:02:57.990> I<00:02:58.260> was<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.470> little<00:02:58.860> bit<00:02:59.100> I<00:02:59.310> was<00:02:59.880> wondering

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
rigid I was a little bit I was wondering

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.730 
rigid I was a little bit I was wondering
whether<00:03:00.570> I<00:03:00.690> would<00:03:00.930> lose<00:03:01.110> something<00:03:01.500> in<00:03:01.590> terms

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
whether I would lose something in terms

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.550 
whether I would lose something in terms
of<00:03:01.920> handle<00:03:02.250> rigidity<00:03:02.790> on<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.240> 710<00:03:03.810> which<00:03:04.410> is

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
of handle rigidity on the 710 which is

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.190 
of handle rigidity on the 710 which is
bigger<00:03:04.850> in<00:03:05.850> practice<00:03:06.360> I<00:03:06.480> really<00:03:06.750> can't<00:03:06.959> tell

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
bigger in practice I really can't tell

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.900 
bigger in practice I really can't tell
the<00:03:07.320> difference<00:03:07.350> this<00:03:07.830> is<00:03:08.010> what<00:03:08.190> came<00:03:08.459> out<00:03:08.670> of

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
the difference this is what came out of

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.110 
the difference this is what came out of
the<00:03:09.000> knife<00:03:09.209> a<00:03:10.220> couple<00:03:11.220> holes<00:03:11.459> in<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.850> stern

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
the knife a couple holes in the stern

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.060 
the knife a couple holes in the stern
for<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.690> screws<00:03:13.020> and<00:03:13.440> you<00:03:13.560> can<00:03:13.709> see<00:03:13.890> that

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
for the screws and you can see that

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.670 
for the screws and you can see that
there's<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.310> lug<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:15.150> holds<00:03:15.870> it<00:03:15.959> in<00:03:16.050> place<00:03:16.260> at

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
there's a lug that holds it in place at

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.940 
there's a lug that holds it in place at
the<00:03:16.890> forward<00:03:17.400> end<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:20.180> 705<00:03:21.180> back<00:03:21.600> spacer<00:03:22.110> is<00:03:22.350> a

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
the forward end the 705 back spacer is a

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.590 
the forward end the 705 back spacer is a
smaller<00:03:23.489> version<00:03:23.760> but<00:03:24.120> essentially

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
smaller version but essentially

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.190 
smaller version but essentially
identical<00:03:25.250> so<00:03:26.250> that's<00:03:27.180> how<00:03:27.330> these<00:03:27.480> came<00:03:27.750> out<00:03:27.930> I

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
identical so that's how these came out I

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.070 
identical so that's how these came out I
think<00:03:28.410> it's<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.890> I<00:03:29.480> personally<00:03:30.480> like<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:30.870> look

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
think it's the I personally like to look

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.840 
think it's the I personally like to look
and<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.350> like<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.680> function<00:03:32.780> if<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:34.489> want<00:03:35.489> to

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
and I like the function if you want to

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.940 
and I like the function if you want to
if<00:03:36.780> you<00:03:36.870> want<00:03:37.019> to<00:03:37.110> get<00:03:37.200> your<00:03:37.320> knifes<00:03:37.560> converted

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
if you want to get your knifes converted

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.440 
if you want to get your knifes converted
let<00:03:38.070> me<00:03:38.160> know<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.459> I'll<00:03:38.580> order<00:03:38.760> some<00:03:39.000> spacers

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
let me know and I'll order some spacers

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.560 
let me know and I'll order some spacers
for<00:03:39.600> that<00:03:39.750> as<00:03:39.959> well<00:03:40.459> or<00:03:41.459> if<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.269> want<00:03:42.420> to<00:03:42.480> leave

for that as well or if you want to leave
them<00:03:42.660> alone<00:03:42.810> that's<00:03:43.080> fine<00:03:43.320> too
