00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
but what you can do is put this in a

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.839 
but what you can do is put this in a
ziplock<00:03:07.170> sandwich<00:03:07.530> bag<00:03:07.769> cover<00:03:08.489> it<00:03:08.700> with

ziplock<00:03:12.989> bag<00:03:13.170> really<00:03:13.349> works<00:03:13.709> because<00:03:14.010> it

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
ziplock bag really works because it

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.800 
ziplock bag really works because it
helps<00:03:14.400> keep<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.700> heat<00:03:14.970> in<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.360> it's<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.599> very

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
helps keep the heat in so it's a very

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.809 
helps keep the heat in so it's a very
effective<00:03:16.200> compress<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.040> it's<00:03:17.129> it's

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
effective compress and it's it's

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.849 
effective compress and it's it's
manageable<00:03:18.389> it<00:03:18.569> will<00:03:18.690> fit<00:03:18.930> into<00:03:19.139> your<00:03:19.260> nursing

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
manageable it will fit into your nursing

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.170 
manageable it will fit into your nursing
bra<00:03:20.010> so<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.250> would<00:03:20.549> definitely<00:03:20.880> give<00:03:21.000> this<00:03:21.120> a

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
bra so I would definitely give this a

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.870 
bra so I would definitely give this a
try<00:03:21.389> but<00:03:21.660> be<00:03:21.810> very<00:03:21.989> safe<00:03:22.230> with<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.620> okay<00:03:23.069> so

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
try but be very safe with it okay so

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.280 
try but be very safe with it okay so
you're<00:03:24.239> going<00:03:24.359> to<00:03:24.420> do<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.630> warm<00:03:24.840> showers
