00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
will get a steady green light here to

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.750 
will get a steady green light here to
indicate<00:02:00.690> a<00:02:00.900> full<00:02:01.230> charge<00:02:04.310> I'll<00:02:05.310> take<00:02:05.610> this

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
indicate a full charge I'll take this

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.640 
indicate a full charge I'll take this
out<00:02:05.940> pretend<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.080> lamp<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.470> fully

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
charged and then it's a good idea to

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.660 
charged and then it's a good idea to
close<00:02:10.319> these<00:02:10.590> against<00:02:10.920> as<00:02:11.250> soon<00:02:11.430> as<00:02:11.550> you've

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
close these against as soon as you've

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.309 
close these against as soon as you've
taken<00:02:11.909> the<00:02:12.120> plug<00:02:12.299> out<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.749> protect<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.290> from

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
taken the plug out to protect it from

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.820 
and then mount a solar panel to the
light<00:04:47.720> head<00:04:48.100> to<00:04:49.100> adjust<00:04:49.820> the<00:04:50.750> angle<00:04:51.050> towards

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
light head to adjust the angle towards

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.189 
light head to adjust the angle towards
the<00:04:51.889> Sun<00:04:52.190> you<00:04:53.180> need<00:04:53.330> to<00:04:53.389> make<00:04:53.630> sort<00:04:53.900> of<00:04:53.960> like<00:04:54.050> an

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
the Sun you need to make sort of like an

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:55.900 
the Sun you need to make sort of like an
S<00:04:54.380> shape<00:04:54.650> here<00:04:54.889> because<00:04:55.220> if<00:04:55.370> you<00:04:55.400> bend<00:04:55.669> it<00:04:55.760> too

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
S shape here because if you bend it too

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.480 
S shape here because if you bend it too
much<00:04:56.060> forward<00:04:56.449> it<00:04:56.600> will<00:04:56.889> fall<00:04:57.889> down<00:04:58.039> but<00:04:58.400> if

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
much forward it will fall down but if

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.400 
much forward it will fall down but if
you<00:04:58.610> make<00:04:58.820> a<00:04:58.850> nice<00:04:59.210> S<00:04:59.449> shape<00:04:59.720> you<00:04:59.900> can<00:05:00.050> actually

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
you make a nice S shape you can actually

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.510 
you make a nice S shape you can actually
adjust<00:05:01.070> it<00:05:01.460> pretty<00:05:01.699> neatly<00:05:01.940> towards<00:05:02.570> the<00:05:02.720> Sun

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
adjust it pretty neatly towards the Sun

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.420 
adjust it pretty neatly towards the Sun
so<00:05:04.520> that's<00:05:04.729> one<00:05:05.120> tip<00:05:05.360> another<00:05:06.229> one<00:05:06.470> is<00:05:06.740> if<00:05:07.160> you

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
so that's one tip another one is if you

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.450 
so that's one tip another one is if you
need<00:05:07.970> to<00:05:08.150> travel<00:05:08.389> lights<00:05:09.010> you<00:05:10.010> don't<00:05:10.039> have<00:05:10.310> too

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
need to travel lights you don't have too

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.520 
need to travel lights you don't have too
much<00:05:10.639> room<00:05:10.880> in<00:05:11.030> your<00:05:11.060> backpack<00:05:11.570> you<00:05:12.260> can<00:05:12.289> leave

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
function as where the Sun Bell so that's

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.000 
function as where the Sun Bell so that's
kind<00:05:23.900> of<00:05:23.960> neat<00:05:26.380> finally<00:05:27.380> I'd<00:05:27.470> like<00:05:27.650> to<00:05:27.830> show

and it will actually enhance the sound

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.159 
and it will actually enhance the sound
or<00:05:57.300> amplify<00:05:58.300> the<00:05:58.360> sound<00:05:58.720> about<00:05:59.020> three<00:05:59.590> times

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
or amplify the sound about three times

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.589 
or amplify the sound about three times
one<00:06:02.169> thing<00:06:02.409> try<00:06:03.159> it<00:06:03.220> out<00:06:03.370> see<00:06:03.909> if<00:06:03.940> you<00:06:04.030> like<00:06:04.090> it
