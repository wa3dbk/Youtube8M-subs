00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.910
 the people wing 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:15.990
 I am healthy and today have thought air 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.449
 force fish 2277 came to me there 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.550
 short time it is a low headset 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:27.240
 cost about 75 dollars 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:32.130
 and for me it has been very useful that he 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.500
 works on play 3 in xbox on pc to him 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.969
 comes with its main cable a cable of 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.270
 a meter or so comes with this cable 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:44.910
 the xbox chat cables to 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.500
 you connect to the xbox control but the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:53.309
 chat comes with a splitter 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.000
 splitter is the one for you to use both the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.789
 xbox and play 3 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.469
 you can use this splitter both one 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.000
 hdmi connection 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.430
 while there is no connection and if it comes 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.750
 with a cable of three and a half minutes to 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:16.500
 Are you connecting a cell phone or an ipad? 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.240
 for example that is his amplifier 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.220
 with the chat volume controls and 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.560
 microphone volume to it has a 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.579
 about two and a half meters or so 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.939
 this amplifier added to the cable 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:37.560
 r7 gives three meters three and a half meters 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:42.770
 total of cable to that is the depth of it 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:46.950
 this art she is not detachable is fixed in the 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.930
 17 and it's pretty malleable I'm 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.220
 using it now to record this review 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.259
 so you can see the quality of the 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:58.229
 he has a 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.049
 very good internal shoreline gives a 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.659
 sound insulation in the 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.680
 overall set it is a good network 7 of 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.569
 low cost and a stereo headset what 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.599
 also justifies part of the price 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.290
 I've been using it for a few weeks now and 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.329
 also satisfied with the result and is 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.749
 here's my recommendation for a low headset 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.749
 cost 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:26.900
 Good, I'll be staying here and until 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.900
 next
