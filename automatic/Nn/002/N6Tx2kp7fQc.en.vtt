this just comes off with a bracket

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.750 
this just comes off with a bracket
itself<00:00:27.290> so<00:00:27.830> i'll<00:00:27.920> put<00:00:28.040> it<00:00:28.190> on<00:00:28.280> a<00:00:28.310> minute<00:00:28.670> with

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
itself so i'll put it on a minute with

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.630 
itself so i'll put it on a minute with
the<00:00:28.910> bolt<00:00:29.260> but<00:00:30.260> I'm<00:00:30.410> you<00:00:31.070> know<00:00:31.130> just<00:00:31.250> take<00:00:31.490> off

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
the bolt but I'm you know just take off

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.880 
the bolt but I'm you know just take off
those<00:00:31.820> six<00:00:32.119> bolts<00:00:34.570> readjust<00:00:35.570> this<00:00:35.870> and<00:00:36.560> you're

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
those six bolts readjust this and you're

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.920 
those six bolts readjust this and you're
sure<00:00:36.920> that's<00:00:37.700> pretty<00:00:37.910> much<00:00:38.000> it<00:00:38.500> okay<00:00:40.870> put<00:00:41.870> on

the bracket I had to remove on this side

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.020 
the bracket I had to remove on this side
there's<00:00:45.950> a<00:00:46.040> bracket<00:00:46.520> holding<00:00:46.790> all<00:00:46.910> these

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
there's a bracket holding all these

there's a bracket holding all these
harnesses<00:00:48.399> you'll<00:00:49.399> see<00:00:49.610> there's<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:50.680> bolts

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
harnesses you'll see there's the bolts

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.740 
harnesses you'll see there's the bolts
of<00:00:51.800> lip<00:00:51.980> I<00:00:52.190> can<00:00:52.399> see<00:00:52.550> now<00:00:52.730> but<00:00:53.030> it<00:00:53.600> actually

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
of lip I can see now but it actually

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.620 
of lip I can see now but it actually
screws<00:00:54.320> onto<00:00:54.530> his<00:00:54.860> for<00:00:55.160> this<00:00:55.340> right<00:00:55.520> here<00:00:55.730> okay

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
screws onto his for this right here okay

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.910 
screws onto his for this right here okay
after<00:00:56.930> removing<00:00:57.350> just<00:00:57.530> let<00:00:57.680> it<00:00:57.800> hang<00:00:57.950> free

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
after removing just let it hang free

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.139 
after removing just let it hang free
just<00:01:00.920> for<00:01:00.980> those<00:01:01.190> things<00:01:01.610> going<00:01:01.790> to<00:01:01.850> put<00:01:02.030> one

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
just for those things going to put one

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.689 
just for those things going to put one
of<00:01:02.239> these<00:01:02.360> on<00:01:02.890> just<00:01:03.890> tighten<00:01:04.040> those<00:01:04.250> up<00:01:04.309> again

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
of these on just tighten those up again

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.899 
of these on just tighten those up again
with<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:04.939> 14<00:01:05.360> millimeter<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.049> then<00:01:06.790> you<00:01:07.790> know

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
with the 14 millimeter and then you know

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.710 
with the 14 millimeter and then you know
run<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:08.299> bar<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:09.320> also<00:01:09.590> has<00:01:09.799> a<00:01:10.540> extensions<00:01:11.540> on

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
run the bar and also has a extensions on

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.130 
run the bar and also has a extensions on
each<00:01:11.870> end<00:01:12.110> to<00:01:12.380> run<00:01:12.680> how<00:01:13.930> expand<00:01:14.930> it<00:01:15.080> a<00:01:15.110> little

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
each end to run how expand it a little

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.570 
each end to run how expand it a little
bit<00:01:15.470> or<00:01:15.590> adjust<00:01:15.950> it<00:01:16.130> so<00:01:17.049> um<00:01:18.159> yeah<00:01:19.159> it<00:01:19.369> should<00:01:19.549> be

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
bit or adjust it so um yeah it should be

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.219 
bit or adjust it so um yeah it should be
it<00:01:19.790> and<00:01:19.970> just<00:01:20.090> hook<00:01:20.299> it<00:01:20.390> up<00:01:20.510> into<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.080> end

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
it and just hook it up into the end

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:35.940 
it and just hook it up into the end

all right here's the startup my car

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.729 
all right here's the startup my car
there's<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.610> p75<00:02:49.269> ECU<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:50.290> got<00:02:50.769> chipped<00:02:52.739> easy

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
there's the p75 ECU I got chipped easy

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.400 
there's the p75 ECU I got chipped easy
to<00:02:53.860> get<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.160> just<00:02:54.370> lift<00:02:54.640> your<00:02:54.819> carpet<00:02:55.450> there's

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
to get to just lift your carpet there's

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.920 
to get to just lift your carpet there's
about<00:02:56.620> five<00:02:57.489> to<00:02:57.700> six<00:02:57.879> bolts<00:02:58.480> holding<00:02:58.780> on<00:02:58.900> a

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
about five to six bolts holding on a

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.339 
about five to six bolts holding on a
plate<00:02:59.549> and<00:03:00.549> so<00:03:00.760> here<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:02.310> uncover<00:03:03.310> it<00:03:04.349> should

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
plate and so here and uncover it should

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:24.930 
plate and so here and uncover it should
go<00:03:05.500> back<00:03:06.150> what<00:03:07.150> we<00:03:07.329> do<00:03:07.450> ones<00:03:07.690> that<00:03:08.019> plug

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:33.110 

I<00:03:25.770> have<00:03:26.770> to<00:03:26.890> take<00:03:27.040> my<00:03:27.070> water<00:03:27.490> connection<00:03:28.060> to

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.360 

it's<00:03:34.120> kind<00:03:34.240> of<00:03:34.330> a<00:03:34.420> weird<00:03:34.450> idle<00:03:35.140> when<00:03:35.350> I<00:03:35.380> rev<00:03:36.220> it

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
it's kind of a weird idle when I rev it

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.340 
it's kind of a weird idle when I rev it
up<00:03:36.520> i<00:03:36.730> think<00:03:36.760> i<00:03:37.060> got<00:03:37.210> a<00:03:37.270> some<00:03:37.660> still<00:03:38.050> gotta<00:03:38.200> get

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
up i think i got a some still gotta get

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.860 
up i think i got a some still gotta get
it<00:03:38.440> tuned<00:03:38.650> so<00:03:39.450> hopefully<00:03:40.450> that<00:03:40.570> will<00:03:40.660> take

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
it tuned so hopefully that will take

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.220 
it tuned so hopefully that will take
care<00:03:41.110> of<00:03:41.170> it

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230
