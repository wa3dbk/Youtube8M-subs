golf or the Fiat or lexus you should be

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.710 
golf or the Fiat or lexus you should be
in<00:00:28.160> pretty<00:00:28.430> good<00:00:28.520> shape

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
in pretty good shape

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.630 
in pretty good shape
as<00:00:30.230> long<00:00:30.349> as<00:00:30.380> you<00:00:30.560> can<00:00:30.710> take<00:00:30.890> a<00:00:30.920> course<00:00:31.220> pretty

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
as long as you can take a course pretty

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.049 
as long as you can take a course pretty
well<00:00:31.880> he's<00:00:32.419> not<00:00:32.629> very<00:00:32.870> hard<00:00:33.079> at<00:00:33.379> all

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.729 

now<00:00:39.059> personally<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.750> don't<00:00:40.020> think<00:00:40.230> flames<00:00:40.500> look

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
now personally I don't think flames look

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.900 
now personally I don't think flames look
on<00:00:40.920> any<00:00:41.219> car<00:00:41.489> but<00:00:42.500> aside<00:00:43.500> from<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.739> his<00:00:44.640> car

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
on any car but aside from that his car

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.569 
on any car but aside from that his car
is<00:00:45.030> pretty<00:00:45.210> nice<00:00:45.390> looking<00:00:46.370> from<00:00:47.370> for<00:00:47.519> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
is pretty nice looking from for the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.400 
is pretty nice looking from for the
flames<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.180> strange<00:00:48.420> color<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.019> rims

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
flames and the strange color on the rims

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.500 
flames and the strange color on the rims
I'd<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:49.920> it

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.689 

now<00:00:55.109> both<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.559> Vics<00:00:55.800> races<00:00:56.160> are<00:00:56.399> sprints

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
now both the Vics races are sprints

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.020 
now both the Vics races are sprints
the<00:00:59.699> first<00:01:00.000> one<00:01:00.269> has<00:01:01.140> few<00:01:01.769> highway<00:01:02.190> parts<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
the first one has few highway parts the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.940 
the first one has few highway parts the
second<00:01:03.390> one<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.809> mostly<00:01:04.259> in<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.530> city<00:01:04.830> so

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
second one is mostly in the city so

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.170 
second one is mostly in the city so
really<00:01:06.159> the<00:01:06.280> harder<00:01:06.549> one<00:01:06.729> should<00:01:06.969> be<00:01:07.060> the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
really the harder one should be the

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:18.200 
really the harder one should be the
first<00:01:07.420> one

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.750 

for<00:01:18.390> collage<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.990> pretty<00:01:19.380> much<00:01:19.530> necessary<00:01:19.799> if

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
for collage is pretty much necessary if

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.660 
for collage is pretty much necessary if
you<00:01:20.850> want<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.090> get<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.299> leg<00:01:21.479> up<00:01:21.600> from

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.310 

don't<00:01:28.030> drain<00:01:28.240> it<00:01:28.390> all<00:01:28.509> because<00:01:28.780> you<00:01:28.990> might<00:01:29.170> get

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
don't drain it all because you might get

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:42.000 
don't drain it all because you might get
later

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.720 

take<00:01:42.610> corners<00:01:43.030> as<00:01:43.180> clean<00:01:43.450> as<00:01:43.570> you<00:01:43.600> can<00:01:43.990> but<00:01:44.440> if

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
take corners as clean as you can but if

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.610 
take corners as clean as you can but if
a<00:01:45.760> little<00:01:46.090> bit<00:01:46.210> too<00:01:46.390> much<00:01:46.600> don't<00:01:46.990> don't<00:01:47.500> be

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
a little bit too much don't don't be

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.960 
a little bit too much don't don't be
afraid<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:47.890> use<00:01:48.040> a<00:01:48.070> little<00:01:48.280> bit<00:01:48.370> nitrous<00:01:48.730> to

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
afraid to use a little bit nitrous to

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:57.060 
afraid to use a little bit nitrous to
get<00:01:49.600> back<00:01:49.750> some<00:01:49.900> speed

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.130 

chances<00:01:57.880> are<00:01:58.060> that<00:01:58.090> really<00:01:58.600> no<00:01:58.750> matter<00:01:58.870> how

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
chances are that really no matter how

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.460 
chances are that really no matter how
bad<00:01:59.409> your<00:01:59.860> turn<00:02:00.130> is<00:02:00.280> hit<00:02:00.610> make<00:02:00.790> one

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
bad your turn is hit make one

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:11.990 
bad your turn is hit make one
not<00:02:02.650> worse

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.880 

through<00:02:12.600> these<00:02:12.720> narrow<00:02:13.020> roads<00:02:13.350> is<00:02:13.590> really

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
through these narrow roads is really

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.520 
through these narrow roads is really
important<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.520> look<00:02:14.670> out<00:02:14.850> for<00:02:14.880> cars<00:02:15.410> be<00:02:16.410> on

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
important to look out for cars be on

important to look out for cars be on
your<00:02:16.650> best<00:02:16.830> lookout<00:02:17.130> not<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.700> hit<00:02:17.850> them

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
you do she'll be a lot farther behind

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.960 
you do she'll be a lot farther behind
and<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:39.230> should<00:02:39.410> be<00:02:39.440> a<00:02:39.560> little<00:02:40.459> bit<00:02:40.640> distance

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
the section here he'll probably start

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.660 
the section here he'll probably start
catching<00:04:01.110> up<00:04:01.410> to<00:04:01.590> you<00:04:01.680> there's<00:04:02.460> a<00:04:02.520> lot<00:04:02.550> of

catching up to you there's a lot of

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.150 
catching up to you there's a lot of
hills<00:04:02.910> and<00:04:03.209> jumps<00:04:03.569> and<00:04:03.720> evolution<00:04:04.140> on<00:04:04.290> speed

hills and jumps and evolution on speed
this<00:04:06.370> is<00:04:06.490> also<00:04:06.670> where<00:04:07.060> it's<00:04:07.390> the<00:04:07.510> most<00:04:07.720> tricky

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
this is also where it's the most tricky

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.060 
this is also where it's the most tricky
because<00:04:08.350> of<00:04:08.590> little<00:04:08.980> inlets<00:04:09.970> and<00:04:10.090> outlets<00:04:10.300> and

make<00:04:13.250> you<00:04:13.370> take<00:04:13.549> some<00:04:13.760> pretty<00:04:13.969> odd<00:04:14.209> corners

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599 
make you take some pretty odd corners

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:17.220 
make you take some pretty odd corners
and<00:04:14.959> he'll<00:04:15.349> probably<00:04:15.590> pass<00:04:16.009> you

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
and he'll probably pass you
