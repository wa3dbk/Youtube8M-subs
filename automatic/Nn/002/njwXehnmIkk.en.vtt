00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 there is a big topic on the ifa and 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.299
 that's really big here behind me too 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.410
 see big screens in the case up 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.730
 to 75 inches 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.349
 we just look through the 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.950
 hall what is so special 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.590
 is 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.790
 Here I would say it is just first 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.120
 times only sized and drag compared 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.610
 then later we go through 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.690
 because the whole thing is far too easy, of course 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.090
 for us here would be with our normal 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.680
 stood equipment rumzulaufen we thought 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.630
 We make the test for the video and 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.850
 Picture quality with this time recognize 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.260
 her 650 de have the first broadcast of 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.810
 less than two weeks ago I think 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.460
 So now you can watch the whole movie 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.830
 review that will now see you too 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.360
 the your 650 de in things video quality 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.800
 then good impression also what you get 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.130
 manage some darker scenes 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.600
 can 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.430
 foto quality we show you of course 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.500
 I would, too 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.670
 say just go through and around 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.160
 and the theme television in again 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.650
 to bring just 90 inches from behind me 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.839
 sharp and good picture quality, however 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.460
 only full hd that will be at the size 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:55.989
 and again pixelated so we go 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.010
 go on 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.960
 Of course , such a fair still offers a lot 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.670
 more than just great TV 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.440
 are also really very, very often 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.640
 very dark the whole fair halls 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.750
 Of course we have a bit here 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.950
 trick again a video light 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.450
 built up and with my stories 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.650
 on the left a little bit through drawings 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.659
 because otherwise you have in the 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.620
 background too much brightness of 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.210
 the whole monitors 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.120
 Still , you think you might be fine 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.500
 see that with the eos 650 de very much 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.390
 good filming can be synonymous with high 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.310
 iso values what sometimes dark environment 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.080
 living needs but also to the 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.130
 go to the TV and there background 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.790
 kids relatively small 3d tv wall from lg 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.659
 push through 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.819
 these 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.990
 absolutely stylish 3d glasses here too 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:33.979
 to be able to judge the one 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.450
 i would say visit it a bit 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.979
 quieter because it is quite loud here 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.979
 sometimes so come again 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.030
 at 84 inches not quite the largest 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.799
 monitor which there are however with the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.210
 insanely sharp picture and like me 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.609
 found much better 3d physicians already 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.850
 could see together here is the 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:01.170
 so called u the 3d tv i hope mine 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.549
 Idea is getting old for me 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.590
 otherwise I'm too pretty 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.000
 Do not know that 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.439
 wiesaz looks pretty good from the colors 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 are a bit over the top 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.860
 Everything can be a computer animated picture 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.510
 You do not have much to say to everyone 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.069
 case one can see the trend 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.959
 TV will always be 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.790
 bigger and, as I said, lucky 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.590
 at the same time that brings now 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.120
 Finnish that means simply higher 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.650
 dissolve it with this enormous 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.120
 Picture really needs more in 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.010
 Image information does not get it 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.230
 again pixelated looks 450 already 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.280
 really good, I think it's great effective 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.810
 same time around here there are also 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.190
 a few super thin monitor 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.959
 millimeters thick 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:39.720
 So I would say pans about it 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.250
 with 34 mm hg actually with the 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.900
 thinnest monitor you can currently get 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.579
 can and will say because I am right now 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.950
 we start we turn around 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.510
 little bit that this little gray 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.040
 he just could not see that 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.920
 is this huge monitor that stands here 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.639
 think so 46 50 inches must be in 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.370
 about said bistum be 4 mm thin yes 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:01.349
 much more at the thickest place though 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.459
 Unfortunately, one can not do so 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.540
 accordingly we can handle 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.579
 not much to the processing quality 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.260
 say about it but actually looks like that 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.370
 quite a bit of metal 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.500
 you will most likely too 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.630
 just need to say this one 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.760
 screen thick quotes 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.959
 very stable material needs with the 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.099
 you can still work with that 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.840
 all not to see through it 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.120
 somehow somebody can be a problem 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.470
 which is natural at the same time 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.169
 is so thin that there is barely room for 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.150
 have connections that means hdmi cable etc 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:29.519
 lg shifts that accordingly 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.630
 slowly into the base of the whole device 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.030
 and goes with a single cable 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.230
 it has integrated with this monitor 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.459
 already know but especially I think 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.290
 that may well be his future 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.180
 next years even thinner much much 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.370
 much much thinner monitor 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.890
 around the party you know 650 of them 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.109
 finish things photo quality is 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.250
 Of course everything is objectively dependent 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.530
 Of course, that already applies to ours 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.760
 other commander tells that is 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.469
 if he really super super super 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.849
 wanted to take great pictures picks you 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:57.280
 easy in accordingly a good one 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.079
 objectively if you demo foto what you with 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.859
 added the 40 millimeter stm 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.510
 we can already see 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.159
 Do you really have a good one? 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.269
 picture quality everything is very sharp too 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:08.590
 in the fair halls even at high 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:10.510
 iso-values ​​but now with 550 650 de 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.430
 or 0 78 stays at the end and 18 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.439
 So megapixel sensor is not much 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.730
 changed the subject to television 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:18.280
 of course now also to finish 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.799
 behind us here in 84 inches from toshiba 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.620
 on with 4k resolution among so-called 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.180
 ego engine what does the latter can do too 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.729
 normal full hd material for example 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.849
 from the blu-ray on this 4k 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.440
 extrapolate 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:31.630
 that means there are better ones 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.070
 Video quality at the end on the TV 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.259
 Nevertheless, as seen here with back 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.849
 native 4k material is simple 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:38.169
 it's going to be breathtaking to see that 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:40.150
 any case, one of the trends would be the 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.320
 next year if he still two to 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.479
 three days then have time here 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.720
 come to hall 21a toshiba on the 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:49.320
 ifa 2012 in the sense of chosen by and to 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.320
 to the next video
