00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.289
 the negative is one of the gloves that 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.060
 represents the elite collection of its two 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.189
 gatekeepers is to say the muse bed that are 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.160
 maximum range gloves that we manufacture 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.039
 for the sp brand 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.630
 in this case is the model there is there is a 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.400
 of the two denominations that present 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.160
 how to use this collection and it means that 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.070
 is a 2 or lightened on the wife 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.559
 we have there presents an area in 2 or 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.239
 more textile LaTeX therefore 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.040
 feeling of lightness and mobility is 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.480
 the superior to the other models 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.190
 how we have achieved it 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.360
 mainly combining three pieces of 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.310
 latex and a larger piece of textile 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.840
 the main one before 2 this 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.090
 white piece that you see that takes the 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.340
 four main we consider that 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.750
 work these four separately 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.070
 of the three important is to say these 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.960
 100 x fingers always prepared from 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.310
 glove because they are the ones that remain 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.780
 worked a combined in any 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.850
 goalkeeper action either by closing the 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.979
 fist or working to do to 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.940
 complicate therefore one we want to separate 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.590
 this zone 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.240
 and for me, glove, because we have 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.190
 put a very large textile area of 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.350
 this case the textile of mf that was the 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.090
 great sensation in the discovery of 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.920
 the previous projection and that we want 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.850
 transfer to this new appearance of 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.320
 vélez that has presence in 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.860
 practically all gloves 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.930
 It is a textile that contains an armed 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.580
 medium is a textile that facilitates 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.410
 interior ventilation of endurance and that 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.630
 it does not absorb too much water either 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.780
 It is very comfortable and comfortable for the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.549
 goalie 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.020
 maybe if we put this area of 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.650
 textile then sue would turn out too much 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.460
 light we would have hardly armed nor 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.530
 grip in the hand 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.540
 that's why there are two pieces of latex one of 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.180
 black color and another one of blue soap that 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.310
 As you can see, it goes all over the back 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.720
 forming a small support a small 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.310
 glove stabilization system 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.110
 from the finger weaker than the finger 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.420
 pinky here we start in the area of 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.280
 reinforcement going through the whole relationship to 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.229
 fists clearance and reaching the 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.819
 base of the back the post endurance 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.560
 any movement any act has 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.630
 been more of a one small piece of 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.160
 support the same as this blue piece a 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.360
 piece a little more basic because 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.640
 It will also contribute to the area 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.810
 center of the back that keeps it 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.790
 little bit more than a little bit more 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.890
 stability 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.299
 Lastly, the thumb is another of the 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.859
 areas that we consider important 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.290
 reinforce and more are elite gloves with 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:31.239
 more we are to therefore it does not present 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.340
 only textile in addition to the structure 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.930
 of the palm presents a piece of latex 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.819
 numerous is quite important where 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.030
 It has incorporated the air screen printing 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:44.019
 the important part of the back of the 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.019
 muse gloves this year 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.519
 is a piece of the base of place up 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.170
 the end of the doll is about 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.670
 get that wang having present two 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.560
 as differentiated parts as it presented 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.450
 I was watching the area the wristband 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.310
 one side and the glove body area 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.590
 on the other the way that always seemed 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.209
 that does not have a normal activity is 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.400
 say the glove was moving so 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.200
 too independent therefore with 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.840
 this we got the one from our glove and 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.069
 closed the fixing strip as 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.569
 have a support any movement 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.939
 which performs the doll mainly 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.349
 lateral twists the glove have ssp 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.569
 have buttress supports that 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.430
 help us to see from the base of 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.490
 although until the fingertips the 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.680
 glove as a faster area 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.000
 if we talk about the palm what 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.560
 first indicate that it presents in the 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.030
 adversity of good let's see the before 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.950
 of maximum adherence of the brand are the 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.420
 goalkeepers a delicate latex but that is going to 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.840
 ensure maximum grip in any 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.520
 game condition and to ride it 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.290
 we combine two cuts of their own 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.600
 each other but they get 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.670
 a very good feeling and cutting it 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.220
 define to withstand the force when 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.680
 we get a difficult ball of the fingers 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.300
 beginnings of dominique tooth and stopped 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.280
 the centrals the fingers that have to 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.610
 bring sensitivity and touch to the hour 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.980
 to lock we mount negative in the 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.300
 area between the fingers the textile is the 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.130
 textile in ep efe that we talked about 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.780
 previously therefore also in 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.740
 these middle fingers are going to have 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:09.280
 feeling so nice 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.280
 Armed proportions 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.680
 we have a small cut as a test and 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.449
 elastic in the middle 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.160
 since this is the area that presents more 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.720
 tension when we do any blocking 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.880
 or any action of goal 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.530
 gloves tend to break through here with 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.270
 this elastic witness minimized those 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.800
 breakage possibilities 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.110
 as we can in the side area of the 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.180
 palm a small envelope of the before not 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.069
 arrives right up to the torso but yes 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.930
 that there would be a small tube in that area 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.520
 The lateral one gets to make more anatomical the 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.409
 gloves of the jobs that we had to 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.970
 although this projection that the glove does not 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:45.120
 it was too much or it was not too much 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.009
 rough if it was not anatomical and finally 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.419
 of the wristband area and the area 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.400
 the palm we see that there is one last 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.460
 articulation that also presents the 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.740
 textile mpg 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.160
 so when we bend the hand we do not know 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.480
 that annoying bag that many times 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.370
 they form the palm 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.289
 another important feature is that 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.789
 once four gloves 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.800
 we will notice in the area that enters 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:11.080
 contact with the ball in both the yolks 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.960
 of the fingers as the base of the palm 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.610
 a few small inserts of how to let it 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.650
 of silicone that are very nice 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.900
 they improve sensitivity with the ball and 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.819
 maybe they do not make as much as they can 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.590
 the tube the hands and therefore we 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:25.360
 we lose the sensitivity that we do 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.819
 makes you lose YouTube and at the same time we win 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.879
 this very pleasant feeling of contact 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:32.229
 with the ball as we can see the 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:34.480
 buttress in front of kálamos 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.760
 previously once closed 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.550
 fixing the but enclosing the 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.710
 links 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:44.890
 it is perfectly disguised and it's going 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.890
 to contribute that extra that we wanted to fix
