00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.100 
remind yourself which version of the
timer<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.580> you're<00:02:05.730> actually<00:02:05.910> using<00:02:06.120> from

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
timer that you're actually using from

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.949 
timer that you're actually using from
your<00:02:07.290> toolbox<00:02:11.269> regardless<00:02:12.269> of<00:02:12.390> which<00:02:12.629> timer

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
your toolbox regardless of which timer

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.739 
your toolbox regardless of which timer
you<00:02:13.230> use<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:14.069> timer<00:02:14.370> relies<00:02:14.879> on<00:02:14.909> two<00:02:15.420> things

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:15.749 
you use the timer relies on two things

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:17.120 
you use the timer relies on two things
first<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.230> all<00:02:16.379> you'll<00:02:16.560> need<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.829> set<00:02:17.010> the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
first of all you'll need to set the

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.760 
first of all you'll need to set the
interval<00:02:17.550> or<00:02:17.730> rather<00:02:18.450> how<00:02:18.810> often<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.650> will

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
interval or rather how often it will

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.340 
interval or rather how often it will
fire<00:02:20.130> its<00:02:20.430> event<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.150> then<00:02:21.750> secondly<00:02:22.170> you'll

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
fire its event and then secondly you'll

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.110 
fire its event and then secondly you'll
need<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.590> write<00:02:22.770> code<00:02:22.980> behind<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.850> timed

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
need to write code behind the timed

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.100 
need to write code behind the timed
event<00:02:24.650> in<00:02:26.030> this<00:02:27.030> example<00:02:27.420> we'll<00:02:27.690> do<00:02:27.840> something

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
event in this example we'll do something

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.600 
event in this example we'll do something
fairly<00:02:28.380> simple<00:02:28.830> as<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.040> can<00:02:29.160> see<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.340> have<00:02:29.460> a

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
fairly simple as you can see I have a

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.000 
fairly simple as you can see I have a
project<00:02:29.850> called<00:02:30.120> timer<00:02:30.480> control<00:02:30.900> CS<00:02:31.320> and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
project called timer control CS and

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.840 
project called timer control CS and
we'll<00:02:32.220> simply<00:02:32.580> show<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.090> current<00:02:33.450> day<00:02:33.810> time

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
we'll simply show the current day time

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.760 
we'll simply show the current day time
the<00:02:35.850> first<00:02:36.120> example<00:02:36.660> is<00:02:36.690> set<00:02:37.410> with<00:02:37.650> an

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
the first example is set with an

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.040 
the first example is set with an
interval<00:02:38.130> of<00:02:38.160> one<00:02:38.520> second<00:02:39.030> so<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.630> can<00:02:39.780> see

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
interval of one second so you can see

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.460 
interval of one second so you can see
will<00:02:40.320> select<00:02:40.710> windows<00:02:41.070> forms<00:02:41.520> timer<00:02:41.820> and

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
will select windows forms timer and

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.390 
will select windows forms timer and
we've<00:02:43.470> set<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:43.920> interval<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.610> 1000<00:02:45.680> so<00:02:46.680> 1000

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
we've set the interval to 1000 so 1000

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.470 
we've set the interval to 1000 so 1000
milliseconds<00:02:47.640> equal<00:02:48.420> one<00:02:48.630> second<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:51.150> second

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
milliseconds equal one second the second

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.040 
milliseconds equal one second the second
example<00:02:51.810> has<00:02:52.560> an<00:02:52.770> interval<00:02:53.220> of<00:02:53.330> 5000<00:02:54.330> so<00:02:54.600> for

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
example has an interval of 5000 so for

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.880 
example has an interval of 5000 so for
every<00:02:55.320> five<00:02:55.500> seconds<00:02:56.780> so<00:02:57.780> while<00:02:58.230> we're<00:02:58.440> simply

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
every five seconds so while we're simply

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.260 
every five seconds so while we're simply
displaying<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.490> current<00:02:59.790> time<00:03:00.000> in<00:03:00.180> this

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
displaying the current time in this

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.390 
displaying the current time in this
example<00:03:00.630> keep<00:03:00.930> in<00:03:01.050> mind<00:03:01.320> that<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:02.130> could<00:03:02.310> be

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
example keep in mind that this could be

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.210 
example keep in mind that this could be
used<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.940> in<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:04.080> number<00:03:04.320> of<00:03:04.350> capacities<00:03:04.560> for

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
used to in a number of capacities for

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.830 
used to in a number of capacities for
example<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.760> monitor<00:03:06.240> the<00:03:06.420> state<00:03:06.660> of<00:03:06.780> an

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
example to monitor the state of an

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.440 
example to monitor the state of an
application<00:03:06.960> or<00:03:07.590> some<00:03:08.400> resource<00:03:08.910> on<00:03:09.240> the

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
application or some resource on the

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.870 
application or some resource on the
network<00:03:09.630> instead<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.440> just<00:03:10.680> updating<00:03:11.340> the

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
network instead of just updating the

network instead of just updating the
label<00:03:12.240> as<00:03:12.360> will<00:03:12.570> do<00:03:12.720> here<00:03:15.530> so<00:03:16.530> let's<00:03:16.740> take<00:03:16.860> a

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
label as will do here so let's take a

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.880 
label as will do here so let's take a
look<00:03:17.100> at<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.250> source<00:03:17.460> code<00:03:18.740> initially<00:03:19.740> all

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
look at the source code initially all

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.150 
look at the source code initially all
we're<00:03:20.070> going<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.220> do<00:03:20.430> in<00:03:20.550> the<00:03:20.640> form<00:03:20.910> load<00:03:21.150> event

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
we're going to do in the form load event

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.230 
we're going to do in the form load event
is<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:25.260> set<00:03:25.770> both<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.400> system<00:03:26.760> timer<00:03:26.970> label

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
is to set both the system timer label

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.900 
is to set both the system timer label
and<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:28.320> wind<00:03:28.530> forum<00:03:28.770> timer<00:03:29.070> label<00:03:29.310> in<00:03:29.730> other

and the wind forum timer label in other
words<00:03:30.120> these<00:03:30.780> two<00:03:31.020> labels<00:03:31.200> here<00:03:32.720> we'll<00:03:33.720> set

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
words these two labels here we'll set

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.980 
words these two labels here we'll set
those<00:03:34.170> equal<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.860> system<00:03:35.370> day<00:03:35.700> time<00:03:35.970> now<00:03:36.540> and

those equal to system day time now and
because<00:03:37.950> we<00:03:38.070> want<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.370> view<00:03:38.460> seconds<00:03:38.970> we'll

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
because we want to view seconds we'll

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.720 
because we want to view seconds we'll
set<00:03:39.390> it<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:39.770> convert<00:03:40.770> to<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:40.980> long<00:03:41.310> time

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
set it to convert to the long time

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:49.790 
set it to convert to the long time

interval equal to 1000 each time that
that<00:04:07.230> occurs<00:04:07.709> it<00:04:08.130> will<00:04:08.190> raise<00:04:08.640> an<00:04:08.670> event

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
that occurs it will raise an event

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.660 
that occurs it will raise an event
called<00:04:09.300> the<00:04:09.450> tick<00:04:09.690> event<00:04:10.340> so<00:04:11.340> we're<00:04:11.490> going<00:04:11.550> to

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
called the tick event so we're going to

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.090 
called the tick event so we're going to
capture<00:04:12.060> that<00:04:12.120> event<00:04:12.540> and<00:04:12.810> will<00:04:13.770> merely

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
capture that event and will merely

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.960 
capture that event and will merely
update<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:15.660> label<00:04:16.140> text<00:04:16.830> property<00:04:17.340> equal<00:04:17.730> to

next<00:04:28.740> when<00:04:28.860> somebody<00:04:29.130> clicks<00:04:29.960> start<00:04:30.960> five

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
next when somebody clicks start five

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.580 
next when somebody clicks start five
second<00:04:31.590> timer<00:04:32.600> will<00:04:33.600> call<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:34.110> start<00:04:34.410> method

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
second timer will call the start method

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.780 
second timer will call the start method
on<00:04:34.980> our<00:04:35.910> system<00:04:36.480> timer<00:04:37.190> again<00:04:38.190> this<00:04:38.520> is<00:04:38.670> the

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
on our system timer again this is the

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.610 
on our system timer again this is the
more<00:04:38.970> accurate<00:04:39.210> version<00:04:39.660> of<00:04:40.110> our<00:04:40.440> timer<00:04:42.620> each

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
more accurate version of our timer each

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.160 
more accurate version of our timer each
five<00:04:43.980> seconds<00:04:44.580> will<00:04:45.030> be<00:04:45.210> able<00:04:45.300> to<00:04:45.450> capture<00:04:45.720> an

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
five seconds will be able to capture an

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.630 
five seconds will be able to capture an
elapsed<00:04:46.920> event<00:04:48.260> so<00:04:49.260> it's<00:04:49.290> called<00:04:49.710> it's

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
elapsed event so it's called it's

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.280 
elapsed event so it's called it's
different<00:04:50.880> than<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.420> tick<00:04:51.600> event<00:04:51.900> and<00:04:52.170> so

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
different than the tick event and so

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.080 
different than the tick event and so
much<00:04:52.440> just<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:52.860> name<00:04:53.040> is<00:04:53.220> different<00:04:53.640> but

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
much just the name is different but

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.450 
much just the name is different but
essentially<00:04:54.870> it's<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.050> same<00:04:55.290> thing<00:04:55.590> and<00:04:55.800> here

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
essentially it's the same thing and here

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.000 
essentially it's the same thing and here
we'll<00:04:56.730> update<00:04:57.000> the<00:04:57.450> label<00:04:57.810> as<00:04:57.930> well<00:04:58.170> to<00:04:58.770> the

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
we'll update the label as well to the

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.620 
we'll update the label as well to the
current<00:05:00.950> hours<00:05:01.950> minutes<00:05:02.280> and<00:05:02.370> seconds<00:05:02.820> using

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
current hours minutes and seconds using

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.890 
current hours minutes and seconds using
the<00:05:04.170> system<00:05:04.380> date<00:05:04.800> I'm<00:05:05.010> not<00:05:05.490> too<00:05:06.090> long<00:05:06.540> time

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
the system date I'm not too long time

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.190 
the system date I'm not too long time
string<00:05:07.850> let's<00:05:08.850> go<00:05:08.940> and<00:05:09.060> run<00:05:09.180> the<00:05:09.270> example<00:05:09.780> just

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
string let's go and run the example just

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.400 
string let's go and run the example just
to<00:05:10.260> demonstrate<00:05:10.470> how<00:05:10.890> this<00:05:11.040> works<00:05:11.310> and<00:05:12.410> we'll

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
to demonstrate how this works and we'll

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.050 
to demonstrate how this works and we'll
start<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:13.770> clock<00:05:14.040> and<00:05:15.800> this<00:05:16.800> is<00:05:17.040> now<00:05:17.520> using

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
start the clock and this is now using

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.650 
start the clock and this is now using
the<00:05:18.510> windows<00:05:18.930> forms<00:05:19.470> timer<00:05:20.300> you<00:05:21.300> see<00:05:21.540> that

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
the windows forms timer you see that

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.980 
the windows forms timer you see that
every<00:05:21.900> 1<00:05:22.110> second<00:05:23.060> elapses<00:05:24.060> and<00:05:24.360> here<00:05:24.870> we're

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
every 1 second elapses and here we're

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.110 
every 1 second elapses and here we're
going<00:05:25.080> to<00:05:25.170> start<00:05:25.410> the<00:05:25.860> five<00:05:26.790> second<00:05:27.270> timer<00:05:27.510> and

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
going to start the five second timer and

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.790 
going to start the five second timer and
you'll<00:05:30.120> notice<00:05:30.300> every<00:05:30.570> five<00:05:30.780> seconds<00:05:31.230> it

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
you'll notice every five seconds it

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:40.610 
you'll notice every five seconds it
begins

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620
