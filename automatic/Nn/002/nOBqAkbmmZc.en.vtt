actually are kind of hollow and they

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.200 
actually are kind of hollow and they
don't<00:00:31.050> have<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.199> primer<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:32.099> allows<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:33.030> to

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
don't have a primer this allows you to

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
especially when your hand sweat now if

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.310 
especially when your hand sweat now if
this<00:00:37.589> was<00:00:37.769> a<00:00:37.800> flat<00:00:38.129> surface<00:00:38.839> you<00:00:39.839> might<00:00:40.080> you

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
this was a flat surface you might you

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.090 
this was a flat surface you might you
know<00:00:40.500> slip<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:42.239> actually<00:00:42.600> gives<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.930> a

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
know slip and this actually gives you a

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.610 
know slip and this actually gives you a
bigger<00:00:44.100> advantage<00:00:44.430> if<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.390> bullet<00:00:45.719> casing

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
bigger advantage if the bullet casing

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.000 
bigger advantage if the bullet casing
was<00:00:46.770> flat<00:00:47.180> this<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.360> our<00:00:48.539> Hydra<00:00:49.440> red<00:00:49.649> Tiger

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010

other competitors you can buy yourself a

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.590 
other competitors you can buy yourself a
good<00:01:10.050> looking<00:01:10.380> affordable<00:01:10.979> controller<00:01:11.600> for

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
good looking affordable controller for

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.810 
good looking affordable controller for
approximately<00:01:15.710> let's<00:01:16.710> say<00:01:16.950> if<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.159> take<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
approximately let's say if you take the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.050 
approximately let's say if you take the
standard<00:01:18.570> control<00:01:18.960> with<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> bullet<00:01:19.590> buttons

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
standard control with the bullet buttons

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.340 
standard control with the bullet buttons
you<00:01:21.060> know<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.570> probably<00:01:21.780> be<00:01:22.020> somewhere

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
you know you can probably be somewhere

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.179 
you know you can probably be somewhere
around<00:01:22.470> 130<00:01:23.130> 140<00:01:24.259> and<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.650> course<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.070> know

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
around 130 140 and of course you know

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.300 
around 130 140 and of course you know
these<00:01:26.430> Hydra<00:01:26.970> dip<00:01:27.119> controls<00:01:28.040> require<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> lot

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
these Hydra dip controls require a lot

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.429 
these Hydra dip controls require a lot
of<00:01:29.460> work<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:30.329> there<00:01:30.540> will<00:01:30.600> be<00:01:30.659> just<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:31.259> little

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
of work so there will be just a little

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.580 
of work so there will be just a little
bit<00:01:31.560> more<00:01:31.740> expensive<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.549> not<00:01:32.880> much<00:01:33.090> at<00:01:33.270> all

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
bit more expensive but not much at all

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.039 
bit more expensive but not much at all
just<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.680> give<00:01:34.860> an<00:01:34.950> example<00:01:35.390> this<00:01:36.390> show<00:01:36.630> here

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
just to give an example this show here

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.810 
just to give an example this show here
is<00:01:37.520> 129<00:01:38.520> 95<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:40.619> comes<00:01:41.100> with<00:01:41.220> rapid-fire

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
is 129 95 and that comes with rapid-fire

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.560 
is 129 95 and that comes with rapid-fire
jitter<00:01:42.450> auto<00:01:42.869> burst<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.579> have<00:01:45.149> an<00:01:45.240> option

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
jitter auto burst and you have an option

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.139 
jitter auto burst and you have an option
for<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.869> drop<00:01:46.170> shot<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:47.220> if<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.460> just<00:01:47.640> decided

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
for a drop shot so if you just decided

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.450 
for a drop shot so if you just decided
to<00:01:48.270> purchase<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.840> controller<00:01:49.320> as<00:01:49.680> is

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
to purchase this controller as is

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.580 
to purchase this controller as is
without<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.090> mods<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:52.079> would<00:01:52.290> be<00:01:53.719> $90<00:01:54.719> plus

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
without the mods it would be $90 plus

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.520 
without the mods it would be $90 plus
the<00:01:55.770> cost<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.250> buttons<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.869> can<00:01:58.110> find

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the cost of the buttons so you can find

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.730 
the cost of the buttons so you can find
that<00:01:59.270> find<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.390> prices<00:02:00.780> on<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.990> website<00:02:01.439> and
