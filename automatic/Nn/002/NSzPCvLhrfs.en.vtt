00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
alright this is how i made the parachute

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.270 
alright this is how i made the parachute
bomb<00:00:03.480> dropper<00:00:06.140> it's<00:00:07.140> just<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.529> bunch<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:07.859> balsa

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
bomb dropper it's just a bunch of balsa

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.880 
bomb dropper it's just a bunch of balsa
wood<00:00:10.250> glued<00:00:11.250> together<00:00:12.620> with<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.740> door<00:00:13.950> flap<00:00:14.370> I

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
wood glued together with the door flap I

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.500 
wood glued together with the door flap I
used<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:18.770> plastic<00:00:19.770> tube<00:00:20.310> which<00:00:21.119> i<00:00:21.240> bought<00:00:21.449> a

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
used a plastic tube which i bought a

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.620 
used a plastic tube which i bought a
parachute<00:00:22.020> man<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.760> that's<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.970> cargo<00:00:24.390> thing

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
parachute man in that's the cargo thing

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.070 
parachute man in that's the cargo thing
and<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:24.840> split<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.350> half<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:26.160> make<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.460> wider

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
and I split it in half to make it wider

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.630 
and I split it in half to make it wider
plus<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.260> also<00:00:28.380> figured<00:00:28.680> if<00:00:28.949> some<00:00:29.160> air<00:00:29.310> gets<00:00:29.550> in

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
plus I also figured if some air gets in

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.310 
plus I also figured if some air gets in
the<00:00:29.760> front<00:00:30.000> here<00:00:30.240> then<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.810> will<00:00:30.929> help<00:00:31.080> push

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
the front here then it will help push

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.430 
the front here then it will help push
out<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.650> gear<00:00:31.920> out<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.910> back<00:00:35.300> so<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.840> hang<00:00:37.320> this

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
out the gear out the back so I hang this

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.560 
out the gear out the back so I hang this
from<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.770> middle<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.129> my<00:00:38.190> slow<00:00:38.610> stick<00:00:38.910> that

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
from the middle of my slow stick that

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.310 
from the middle of my slow stick that
way<00:00:40.129> doesn't<00:00:41.129> affect<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.730> center<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.180> gravity

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
way doesn't affect the center of gravity

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.470 
way doesn't affect the center of gravity
it<00:00:43.320> stays<00:00:43.680> right<00:00:44.010> where<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.280> should<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.910> can<00:00:45.329> put

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
it stays right where it should I can put

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.569 
it stays right where it should I can put
it<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.690> take<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:45.989> off<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:47.070> plane<00:00:47.280> flies

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
it on take it off and the plane flies

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.229 
it on take it off and the plane flies
the<00:00:47.760> same<00:00:47.969> way<00:00:48.090> with<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.600> or<00:00:48.780> without<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:50.239> use

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
the same way with it or without it I use

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.560 
the same way with it or without it I use
these<00:00:51.449> little<00:00:51.690> velcro<00:00:52.489> wire<00:00:53.489> strap<00:00:54.030> things<00:00:54.390> I

servo<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.369> mean<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.970> don't<00:01:06.150> know<00:01:06.240> how<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.869> did<00:01:07.110> this

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
servo I mean I don't know how I did this

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.719 
servo I mean I don't know how I did this
I<00:01:07.350> just<00:01:07.560> sat<00:01:07.710> down<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.920> new<00:01:08.189> little<00:01:08.310> bit<00:01:08.490> for<00:01:08.670> a

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
I just sat down a new little bit for a

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.070 
I just sat down a new little bit for a
while<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.180> hooked<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.229> up<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.409> my<00:01:11.900> channel<00:01:12.900> 5

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
while I hooked it up to my channel 5

while I hooked it up to my channel 5
gear<00:01:13.590> switch<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.820> my<00:01:15.060> controller<00:01:15.890> so<00:01:16.890> that

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
gear switch on my controller so that

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:32.410 
gear switch on my controller so that
when<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.189> clip<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:20.670> door<00:01:20.880> closes<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.600> opens

you<00:01:33.420> can<00:01:33.570> use<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:33.960> about<00:01:34.080> anything<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
you can use just about anything for the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.490 
you can use just about anything for the
the<00:01:36.390> cargo<00:01:36.810> bay<00:01:37.080> I<00:01:37.490> also<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.730> these<00:01:38.880> uh<00:01:39.500> like

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
the cargo bay I also have these uh like

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.730 
the cargo bay I also have these uh like
a<00:01:40.530> crystal<00:01:40.860> light<00:01:41.160> generic<00:01:41.910> can<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.620> would

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
a crystal light generic can that would

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.490 
a crystal light generic can that would
work<00:01:43.890> great<00:01:44.750> even<00:01:45.750> though<00:01:45.870> it<00:01:45.900> bigger<00:01:46.230> ox

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
work great even though it bigger ox

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.450 
work great even though it bigger ox
might<00:01:46.740> be<00:01:46.860> nice<00:01:47.930> um<00:01:49.130> but<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.430> just

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
might be nice um but this is just

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.830 
might be nice um but this is just
something<00:01:50.760> I've<00:01:51.000> slapped<00:01:51.330> together<00:01:51.450> in

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
something I've slapped together in

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.780 
something I've slapped together in
probably<00:01:52.170> 20<00:01:52.440> minutes<00:01:52.740> with<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> lot<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.640> hot

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
probably 20 minutes with a lot of hot

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.600 
probably 20 minutes with a lot of hot
glue<00:01:54.380> some<00:01:55.380> spare<00:01:55.680> balsa<00:01:56.130> wood<00:01:56.160> that<00:01:56.400> I<00:01:56.430> had

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
glue some spare balsa wood that I had

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.220 
glue some spare balsa wood that I had
laying<00:01:56.790> around<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.120> house<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> real<00:01:57.930> small

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
laying around the house a real small

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.360 
laying around the house a real small
servo<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.990> it's<00:02:00.990> actually<00:02:01.170> worked<00:02:01.830> very<00:02:02.280> well

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
servo and it's actually worked very well

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.550 
servo and it's actually worked very well
and<00:02:02.580> hasn't<00:02:03.180> broken<00:02:03.390> yet<00:02:03.570> despite<00:02:04.050> some<00:02:04.380> rough

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
and hasn't broken yet despite some rough

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.490 
and hasn't broken yet despite some rough
landings<00:02:04.950> where<00:02:05.130> its<00:02:05.250> bottom<00:02:05.580> def<00:02:05.790> right<00:02:05.970> here

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
landings where its bottom def right here

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.859 
landings where its bottom def right here
um<00:02:07.610> my<00:02:08.610> name<00:02:08.820> is<00:02:08.970> that's<00:02:09.119> just<00:02:09.149> one<00:02:09.479> idea<00:02:09.630> on
