00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
session well it's not really a

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.390 
session well it's not really a

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
you get the point the session is small

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.990 
you get the point the session is small
and<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:38.690> downside<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.500> its<00:02:39.650> size<00:02:39.860> is<00:02:40.190> that<00:02:40.850> you

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
and the downside to its size is that you

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.790 
and the downside to its size is that you
lose<00:02:41.270> the<00:02:41.300> ability<00:02:41.569> to<00:02:41.959> control<00:02:42.319> certain

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
lose the ability to control certain

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.130 
lose the ability to control certain
functions<00:02:43.370> directly<00:02:43.790> on<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.390> device<00:02:44.480> you

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
functions directly on the device you

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.010 
functions directly on the device you
also<00:02:45.170> lose<00:02:45.830> an<00:02:46.040> LCD<00:02:46.490> panel<00:02:47.000> so<00:02:47.209> you<00:02:47.270> can't<00:02:47.690> see

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
also lose an LCD panel so you can't see

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.960 
also lose an LCD panel so you can't see

now<00:02:50.360> some<00:02:50.569> of<00:02:50.690> you<00:02:50.810> may<00:02:50.959> even<00:02:50.989> be<00:02:51.410> wondering

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
now some of you may even be wondering

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.430 
now some of you may even be wondering
how<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:52.040> turn<00:02:52.459> this<00:02:52.670> thing<00:02:52.730> off<00:02:53.090> if<00:02:53.450> there<00:02:54.140> is

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
how you turn this thing off if there is

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.620 
how you turn this thing off if there is
only<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.830> record<00:02:55.430> button<00:02:55.760> in<00:02:55.940> a<00:02:56.060> Wi-Fi<00:02:56.569> toggle

only a record button in a Wi-Fi toggle

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.990 
only a record button in a Wi-Fi toggle
well<00:02:57.500> that's<00:02:57.680> actually<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.100> really<00:02:58.340> cool<00:02:58.459> story

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
well that's actually a really cool story

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.059 
well that's actually a really cool story
in<00:02:59.300> an<00:02:59.690> effort<00:02:59.989> to<00:03:00.170> preserve<00:03:00.319> battery<00:03:00.709> life

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
in an effort to preserve battery life

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.920 
in an effort to preserve battery life
and<00:03:01.280> make<00:03:01.459> this<00:03:01.610> thing<00:03:01.790> super<00:03:02.120> simple<00:03:02.660> to<00:03:02.750> use

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
and make this thing super simple to use

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.470 
and make this thing super simple to use

want to start a recording it then turns
back<00:03:12.200> on<00:03:12.230> after<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.130> press<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.610> record

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
back on after you press the record

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.180 
back on after you press the record
button<00:03:14.060> there<00:03:14.840> is<00:03:15.080> a<00:03:15.110> little<00:03:15.560> bit<00:03:15.769> of<00:03:15.890> a<00:03:15.980> lag

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
button there is a little bit of a lag

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.370 
button there is a little bit of a lag
here<00:03:16.459> but<00:03:16.730> overall<00:03:17.120> it's<00:03:17.510> a<00:03:17.660> pretty<00:03:18.050> great

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
here but overall it's a pretty great

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.380 
here but overall it's a pretty great
system<00:03:18.860> and<00:03:19.069> there's<00:03:19.190> no<00:03:19.580> doubt<00:03:19.850> about<00:03:20.000> it<00:03:20.150> it

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
system and there's no doubt about it it

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.630 
system and there's no doubt about it it
does<00:03:20.690> help<00:03:21.050> with<00:03:21.230> battery<00:03:21.620> life<00:03:21.680> which<00:03:22.370> by<00:03:22.580> the

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
does help with battery life which by the

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.210 
does help with battery life which by the
way<00:03:22.760> is<00:03:23.030> about<00:03:23.239> an<00:03:23.390> hour<00:03:23.630> and<00:03:24.019> 45<00:03:24.500> minutes<00:03:24.920> to

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
way is about an hour and 45 minutes to

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.220 
way is about an hour and 45 minutes to
two<00:03:25.489> hours<00:03:25.850> on<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.120> single<00:03:26.540> charge<00:03:26.900> of

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
two hours on a single charge of

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.830 
two hours on a single charge of
continuous<00:03:28.040> footage<00:03:28.519> I<00:03:28.730> was<00:03:29.060> actually<00:03:29.269> very

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
continuous footage I was actually very

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.860 
continuous footage I was actually very
impressed<00:03:30.140> with<00:03:30.739> its<00:03:30.920> battery<00:03:31.280> performance

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
impressed with its battery performance

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.150 
impressed with its battery performance
unfortunately<00:03:32.870> though<00:03:33.110> because<00:03:33.769> of<00:03:34.010> the

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
unfortunately though because of the

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.640 
unfortunately though because of the
design<00:03:34.550> you<00:03:35.090> can't<00:03:35.480> remove<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:36.230> battery

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
design you can't remove the battery

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.560 
design you can't remove the battery
there's<00:03:37.069> no<00:03:37.250> spot<00:03:37.579> to<00:03:37.820> take<00:03:38.000> it<00:03:38.180> out<00:03:38.299> and

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
there's no spot to take it out and

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.870 
there's no spot to take it out and
therefore<00:03:39.320> you<00:03:39.500> can't<00:03:39.829> have<00:03:40.040> extra<00:03:40.489> batteries

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
therefore you can't have extra batteries

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.520 
therefore you can't have extra batteries
ready<00:03:41.120> to<00:03:41.299> plug<00:03:41.510> in<00:03:41.720> as<00:03:41.930> soon<00:03:42.079> as<00:03:42.200> this<00:03:42.350> one

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
ready to plug in as soon as this one

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.640 
ready to plug in as soon as this one
dies<00:03:42.970> still<00:03:43.970> I've<00:03:44.299> probably<00:03:44.780> charged<00:03:45.320> this

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
dies still I've probably charged this

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.740

expensive<00:06:40.580> at<00:06:40.820> 399<00:06:41.780> dollars<00:06:42.110> but<00:06:42.830> if<00:06:42.919> you<00:06:43.009> want

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
expensive at 399 dollars but if you want

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.580 
expensive at 399 dollars but if you want
a<00:06:43.250> small<00:06:43.550> concealable<00:06:44.210> action<00:06:44.630> camera<00:06:45.110> it's

a small concealable action camera it's

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.010

really<00:06:45.949> the<00:06:46.130> way<00:06:46.280> to<00:06:46.340> go<00:06:46.639> yeah<00:06:47.360> you<00:06:47.419> lose<00:06:47.780> some

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
really the way to go yeah you lose some

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.749
