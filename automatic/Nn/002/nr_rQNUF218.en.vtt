fantastic gameplay let's talk about the
amazingly<00:01:10.710> intuitive<00:01:11.310> controls<00:01:11.760> now<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.510> know

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
amazingly intuitive controls now I know

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.480 
amazingly intuitive controls now I know
what<00:01:12.810> you're<00:01:12.869> saying<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.860> how<00:01:14.040> can<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.220> game

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
what you're saying so how can a game

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.070 
what you're saying so how can a game
that<00:01:14.640> makes<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.939> simulate<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.479> chopping<00:01:15.990> of

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
that makes it simulate the chopping of

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.840 
that makes it simulate the chopping of
vegetables<00:01:16.680> with<00:01:16.770> two<00:01:16.950> analog<00:01:17.400> enough's<00:01:17.670> be

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
vegetables with two analog enough's be

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.210 
vegetables with two analog enough's be
intuitive<00:01:18.360> well<00:01:19.229> let's<00:01:19.530> say<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.770> typical

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
intuitive well let's say the typical

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.910 
intuitive well let's say the typical
right-handed<00:01:20.759> dude<00:01:21.140> stabilizes<00:01:22.140> his<00:01:22.290> master

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
fruit vegetable hybrid the tomato with

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.660 
fruit vegetable hybrid the tomato with
this<00:01:25.170> left<00:01:25.409> hand<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.860> does<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.250> chopping

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
this left hand and does the chopping

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.330 
this left hand and does the chopping
with<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:26.939> right<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> game<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:29.159> left

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
with this right so in the game the left

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.980 
with this right so in the game the left
and<00:01:29.549> right<00:01:29.610> knob<00:01:29.909> represents<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.479> respective

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
and right knob represents the respective

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.260 
and right knob represents the respective
hand<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> left<00:01:32.430> knob<00:01:32.640> controls<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
hand so the left knob controls the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.880 
hand so the left knob controls the
left-to-right<00:01:33.659> motion<00:01:34.259> just<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
left-to-right motion just like the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.550 
left-to-right motion just like the
stabilizing<00:01:35.550> hand<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:37.170> right<00:01:37.200> knob

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
stabilizing hand and the right knob

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.170 
stabilizing hand and the right knob
controls<00:01:37.800> the<00:01:38.130> up<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.430> down<00:01:38.610> motion<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
controls the up to down motion of the

mini tutorial but if you're like me and

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.969 
mini tutorial but if you're like me and
think<00:02:06.420> instruction<00:02:07.290> manuals<00:02:07.740> are<00:02:07.830> for

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
think instruction manuals are for

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.339 
think instruction manuals are for
pussies<00:02:08.369> then<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.090> skip<00:02:09.299> bypass<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.959> section

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
pussies then you skip bypass the section

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.530 
pussies then you skip bypass the section
of<00:02:11.039> course<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.670> bumps<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.060> learning<00:02:12.330> curve

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
of course that bumps the learning curve

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.630 
of course that bumps the learning curve

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:20.599 
actually how the head on battles work in

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:22.929 
actually how the head on battles work in
the<00:05:20.719> two-player<00:05:21.110> game<00:05:21.409> and<00:05:21.650> the<00:05:22.370> only<00:05:22.460> problem

00:05:22.929 --> 00:05:22.939 
the two-player game and the only problem

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:24.429 
the two-player game and the only problem
with<00:05:23.089> the<00:05:23.210> two-player<00:05:23.659> game<00:05:23.900> is<00:05:24.050> if<00:05:24.259> your

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:24.439 
with the two-player game is if your

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:27.399 
with the two-player game is if your
opponent<00:05:24.919> is<00:05:25.279> an<00:05:25.939> S<00:05:26.270> skilled<00:05:26.750> as<00:05:26.900> you<00:05:26.930> are<00:05:27.229> or

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:28.849 
doesn't really understand the gameplay

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:30.820 
doesn't really understand the gameplay
then<00:05:29.060> it's<00:05:29.240> really<00:05:29.479> not<00:05:29.629> fun<00:05:29.960> but<00:05:30.560> then<00:05:30.710> again

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
then it's really not fun but then again

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.219 
then it's really not fun but then again
that<00:05:31.039> applies<00:05:31.339> to<00:05:31.520> any<00:05:31.699> two<00:05:32.180> player<00:05:32.389> game

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
right so how do you fix that problem

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.290 
right so how do you fix that problem
well<00:05:36.439> of<00:05:36.620> course<00:05:36.650> presents<00:05:37.069> the<00:05:37.580> training
