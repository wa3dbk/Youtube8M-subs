can see hopefully just zip tied it to
the<00:04:27.110> handlebars<00:04:27.590> and<00:04:28.750> then<00:04:31.420> just<00:04:32.420> got<00:04:32.840> a

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
the handlebars and then just got a

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.370 
the handlebars and then just got a

amplification<00:04:37.250> but<00:04:38.060> it<00:04:38.240> helps<00:04:38.540> to<00:04:38.600> plug<00:04:39.410> and

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
amplification but it helps to plug and
