00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Hello dear friends my name is 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.220
 Anna and today is the third series of guides 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.890
 by 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.130
 industrial craft and as promised today 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.440
 I'll show you how to make a diamond but for 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.430
 start boosters 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.439
 this one of improvement this one of 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.970
 improvement 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:25.289
 which is available to the industry so far 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.289
 Only three things is one of them so 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.219
 we grow like this than just words and 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:36.930
 water bottle and bucket sfotkat 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:39.390
 then here it is here and here from 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.640
 chips and here are two wires here we have 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.010
 it turns out the accelerator so let's 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.700
 let's start to start on need 1 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.700
 100 cube for 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.210
 8-10 silicon and another iron block 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.039
 contain brick or 11 well let's 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.129
 let's start to start on on visiting 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:04.110
 moderator and melt coal well 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:06.860
 crush him so let's say made up 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.530
 watch boilers sauna everything melts straight 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.860
 wow how quickly things visyak energion 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.860
 him 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.350
 well, I'll just piss him redstone 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.670
 always just on the industry table like this 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:28.229
 so here so here so here so here so 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:33.210
 you just need a stack, and rather 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:36.030
 just 7 another point or she me and so 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.770
 we get coal powder what are we with 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.850
 we will do it further and then we 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.820
 take and we need cream not so here it is 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.380
 extremely take it and as well vylazhivaem 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.870
 this is how we already have a third 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:02:01.510
 coal powder we need them eight 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:02:03.130
 pieces and getting out so here so here 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.580
 8 something happened that we are with them 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.709
 doing more interesting of course but we 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.709
 put in the compressor we just take and 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:19.989
 so we put them here we still need 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:24.100
 coal red dust question mania faster 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:30.700
 fry and by the way that's all lost here 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:32.770
 we have three as compensated i 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.870
 care I broke of course this thing 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:42.970
 com pressed coal to 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:44.530
 pressed coal ball like this 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.350
 now I will quickly restore all 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:53.500
 what do we do next then us 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:55.690
 will need 1 obsidian eat one 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.630
 wonderful blog or one brick that is on 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.880
 the choice is the author of this mod but 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.660
 of course the most profitable way 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.269
 first we settle the most profitable of course 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.610
 Yes, and creak and we get a quiver 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.709
 but let me try looking like everyone 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.450
 red from all Kraft in one take 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.530
 iron most expensive one of the most 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.829
 expensive and then put here in the compressor 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.230
 and look we get 1 diamond then 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:26.310
 there is so much 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.910
 plot from one hundred to coal 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:35.680
 little energy but also stone and Teller 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:37.930
 then of the eight flint and a brick 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.970
 well, the most minimal and get integers 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.079
 mad stay here are you too lazy to go 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.660
 somewhere mine 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.390
 or diamonds you just can not find something 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.519
 it's a very simple way how simple 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.989
 sit your factories and make a diamond and but 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.170
 for this you will need boosters 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.300
 which I showed you 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.069
 and these that is for a few seconds here 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.130
 if the taxi driver has a few seconds 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:03.739
 You can make yourself diamonds 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.739
 what was the matter with you all good luck and bye
