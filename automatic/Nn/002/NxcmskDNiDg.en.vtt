00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.500
 about 20 years ago every state 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:14.349
 diagnosed a form of connectivity 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.390
 mixed thermal sclero better known as 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.029
 scleroderma although the form from which 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.490
 I'm expecting manifests over time in 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.630
 always unexpected and unexpected 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.630
 in various forms 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.009
 giulia is 38 years old and lives in reggio 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.870
 calabria where she was born and grew up 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.059
 at the age of 19 he comes to her 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.350
 diagnosed a very rare disease 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:43.610
 scleroderma a disease that still exists 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.610
 don't let it be 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.520
 is a disease during which the 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.410
 my body produces some systems 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.410
 defense that go against myself 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.890
 scleroderma symptoms yes 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.380
 show immediately difficulties 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.449
 respiratory and cardiovascular pains 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.660
 at the joints and problems of 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.660
 deambulation 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.550
 I had felt a disaster had seemed 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.550
 that I really can has come to an end 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:25.420
 immediately after the diagnosis I had later 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.710
 a few months I was called for 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.170
 first job for the first job in 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.760
 service as a school teacher 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.760
 elementary school in Milan 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.299
 unfortunately, however, climate change 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.180
 the change of habits the duty 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.800
 look after myself alone with non 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.050
 sufficient forces 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.060
 has precipitated the situation from there 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.560
 I wanted to go home right away because 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.560
 I sensed that there was something not 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.480
 was my heart rate was 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.390
 skyrocketed from 260 beats to 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.700
 minute 2 approximately and for one night the 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.930
 night before leaving with the first plane 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.220
 I thought I wouldn't get home alive 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.110
 I came here 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.630
 I went in search of the doctor who 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.950
 he had diagnosed me with the disease 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.120
 unfortunately it was not immediately 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.270
 recognized this form of 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.270
 bronchopneumonia 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.810
 and therefore some time has been lost 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.680
 and so I ended up in a coma for 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.680
 this form of bronchopneumonia 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.310
 I experienced the tunnel phase 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.000
 although I didn't believe it until 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.660
 then I have seen myself in the meantime 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.660
 I am seen from outside 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.420
 I remember leaving the tunnel e 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.910
 to have seen my living parents 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.870
 waiting for me smiling in one 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.870
 bright city 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.220
 after 17 days of coma giulia finally 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.959
 He wakes up 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.340
 what the doctors told me is 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.290
 state 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.290
 oh well it was definitely a miracle 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.500
 if I had not anchored myself to God I would not be 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.190
 arrived anywhere and I would not have 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.200
 believed in the possibility that a man there 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.820
 was next to me and loved me beyond 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.100
 everything my husband has always had 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.560
 ability to look at me 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:30.660
 beyond the hair that wasn't there at the 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:33.200
 beyond my crooked little walk 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.200
 right 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.230
 there is the phrase of St. Paul is that nothing 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.950
 it happens at home or those who rely 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.740
 to God's will and I chose it 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.770
 just like my reference sentence 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.850
 because I found it alive 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.850
 fully in my life 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:00.650
 the disease of giulia unfortunately the 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.390
 terrible disease of giulia the evidence 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.790
 the irrecoverable impossibility of having 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.590
 children but giulia and giovanni do si 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.530
 break down decide decide to 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.530
 face this challenge and the constraint 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.750
 after waking up from coma giulia 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.759
 finally he starts to live again he gets married 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.400
 with john and with time 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:28.139
 learn to live with your illness 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.180
 accepting even one of its effects 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.840
 heavier 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.840
 the impossibility of having children 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.840
 julie and her husband take one 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.770
 decision that will change their lives for 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.810
 always 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.810
 adopt three Indian siblings 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.770
 the photo they sent us the first 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.020
 photo we saw what there 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.099
 they sent when we said 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.099
 yes we want you 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.550
 my husband did n't even have it for one 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.319
 instant the doubt that we could instead 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.870
 take advantage on this occasion of the 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:08.650
 possibility of giving 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.660
 to give a bit of joy a bit of serenity 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.590
 to some other child who does not 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.590
 he would have had it 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:21.810
 here they are our three yusuf children 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:24.560
 Sunday at the ships Alessandro and Aiona b 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.560
 George 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:36.160
 let's see if you remember the day in here 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.160
 where we came to get them 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:42.529
 and the first meeting we didn't know what 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:46.189
 do when we arrived 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:47.479
 and now that we do not think I am 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:49.659
 now that I do I have to kiss them and 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.659
 to hug 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:06:00.099
 these guys immediately had 5 7 10 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:02.620
 years they trusted and entrusted to us are 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:05.949
 trust us they certainly are 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.849
 entrusted to us without any problem e 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.849
 this is a beautiful thing 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.590
 we are often told that good deed 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:18.470
 that you have done that of generosity that 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:21.040
 you had then it is not a 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.090
 donation because we most of the time 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.690
 we answer Spanish bad because there 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.610
 we believe 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:29.140
 it was they who did good 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.140
 not us andora
