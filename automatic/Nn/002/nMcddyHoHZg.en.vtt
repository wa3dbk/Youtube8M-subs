two digits on the end I recommend

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.920 
two digits on the end I recommend
something<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.860> 50s<00:01:23.340> for<00:01:24.060> some<00:01:24.330> reason<00:01:24.659> it

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
something in the 50s for some reason it

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.929 
something in the 50s for some reason it
makes<00:01:25.229> your<00:01:25.549> connection<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.610> little<00:01:26.820> bit

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
faster so there's something like 59 56

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.749 
faster so there's something like 59 56
and<00:01:30.030> then<00:01:30.450> just<00:01:30.659> ok<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.549> next<00:01:32.549> thing<00:01:32.579> you're
