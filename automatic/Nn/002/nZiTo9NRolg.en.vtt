seen<00:02:22.310> that<00:02:22.489> on<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.670> Schindler

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:58.370 

that<00:02:42.580> is<00:02:42.700> so<00:02:43.000> cool<00:02:43.360> that<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.840> elevator<00:02:44.379> talks

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:07.280 

there's<00:02:59.380> just<00:02:59.680> two<00:02:59.950> sweets<00:03:00.490> along<00:03:00.700> here

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.220 

if<00:03:07.830> only<00:03:08.129> they<00:03:08.519> had<00:03:08.549> 3d<00:03:09.209> arrows<00:03:09.720> because<00:03:09.989> I

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
if only they had 3d arrows because I

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.869 
if only they had 3d arrows because I
think<00:03:10.290> it<00:03:10.620> means<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.250> those<00:03:11.430> rooms<00:03:11.700> are

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
think it means that those rooms are

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:26.170 
think it means that those rooms are
pointing<00:03:12.269> this<00:03:13.260> way<00:03:14.150> are<00:03:15.150> down<00:03:15.569> here
