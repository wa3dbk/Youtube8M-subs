to use it there's really no difficulty
level<00:00:29.730> it's<00:00:30.359> like<00:00:30.619> in<00:00:31.619> blender<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.579> know<00:00:32.780> to

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
level it's like in blender you know to

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.410

move an object you hit G to resize it

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.540 
move an object you hit G to resize it
you<00:00:36.570> could<00:00:36.780> s<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.469> then<00:00:37.559> move<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.010> mouse<00:00:38.190> if

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
you could s and then move the mouse if

you could s and then move the mouse if
there's<00:00:38.730> no<00:00:38.879> difficulty<00:00:39.270> now<00:00:39.450> blender<00:00:39.930> can<00:00:40.079> do

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
there's no difficulty now blender can do

tool saying blender is hard to use is

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.729 
tool saying blender is hard to use is
like<00:00:50.550> saying<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.090> paintbrush<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:52.050> hard<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.530> use

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
like saying a paintbrush is hard to use

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
a paintbrush is not hard to use you just

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.950 
a paintbrush is not hard to use you just
may<00:00:56.399> use<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.850> differently<00:00:57.510> than<00:00:57.719> somebody

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
may use it differently than somebody

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.209 
may use it differently than somebody
else<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.530> may<00:00:58.649> not<00:00:58.800> be<00:00:58.920> getting<00:00:59.129> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
results you like but the paintbrush

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.049 
results you like but the paintbrush
itself<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.680> not<00:01:01.920> difficult<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.520> use<00:01:02.730> blender

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
itself is not difficult to use blender

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.250

is<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.870> tool<00:01:04.110> for<00:01:04.409> making<00:01:05.189> art<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.420> blender

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
is just a tool for making art so blender

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.410 
is just a tool for making art so blender
itself<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.950> like<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> potentially<00:01:09.150> blender

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
itself is like a potentially blender

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.880

I've said this number times and people

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.710 
I've said this number times and people
have<00:01:32.619> argued<00:01:32.890> with<00:01:33.220> me<00:01:33.490> I<00:01:33.700> guess<00:01:34.179> I'm<00:01:34.390> still

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
have argued with me I guess I'm still

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.770 
have argued with me I guess I'm still
just<00:01:34.780> not<00:01:34.990> explaining<00:01:35.679> it<00:01:35.799> well<00:01:36.149> and<00:01:37.149> the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
just not explaining it well and the

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.999 
just not explaining it well and the
other<00:01:37.960> day<00:01:38.079> I<00:01:38.110> came<00:01:38.200> across<00:01:38.679> this<00:01:39.460> video<00:01:39.729> here

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
other day I came across this video here

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.800 
other day I came across this video here
which<00:01:42.009> I<00:01:42.220> think<00:01:42.250> this<00:01:42.549> guy<00:01:42.759> takes<00:01:43.270> about<00:01:43.420> five

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
which I think this guy takes about five

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.499 
which I think this guy takes about five
minutes<00:01:43.840> is<00:01:44.500> his<00:01:45.130> channels<00:01:45.819> called<00:01:46.030> blender
