 the artistic director 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.329
 for high m density positiver the dbhb is an interesting part material 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.339
 to authorize them especially ordinary 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.480
 - lna 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.480
 many 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.090
 - lna 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.090
 according to the world

 virginia guilhaume 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.000
 we can learn everything about biology behavior finally the video that has 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.440
 been seduced by strangers 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.280
 thirty species of sharks j evolves around us

 so 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.810
 part of the citizens of this Sahelian city 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.070
 has no importance 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.060
 from all the days that come

 still has very sharp fastening system understand the hesitation 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.590
 biological mechanics visualization will come back only to work that's true 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.150
 what is it and can destabilize the become again avoid looking at the end 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.190
 you are most proud since there are fewer bacteria that grow 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.010
 the microphone is pretty good 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.010
 these organic texts are eliminated by 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.350
 g 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.810
