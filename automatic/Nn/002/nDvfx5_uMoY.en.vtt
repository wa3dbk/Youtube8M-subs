surgery until now I feel good it

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.510 
surgery until now I feel good it
actually<00:01:13.049> didn't<00:01:13.470> hurt<00:01:13.590> at<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.890> surgery

actually didn't hurt at the surgery

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.179 
actually didn't hurt at the surgery
didn't<00:01:14.700> really<00:01:14.850> hurt<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:16.080> guess<00:01:16.950> that's<00:01:17.130> a

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
didn't really hurt so I guess that's a

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.219 
didn't really hurt so I guess that's a
good<00:01:17.310> sign<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.880> its<00:01:18.030> weight<00:01:18.240> bearing<00:01:18.509> when<00:01:19.080> I

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
good sign and its weight bearing when I

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.130 
good sign and its weight bearing when I
can<00:01:19.409> do<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.650> all<00:01:20.390> quiz<00:01:21.390> said<00:01:21.659> one<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.480 
second we didn't really talk about
anything<00:01:33.780> but<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.500> figured<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.860> know<00:01:34.950> me

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
anything but I just figured you know me

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.490 
anything but I just figured you know me
getting<00:01:35.759> hurt<00:01:35.850> my<00:01:36.060> senior<00:01:36.420> year<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:37.350> he

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
getting hurt my senior year and he

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.020 
getting hurt my senior year and he
probably<00:01:37.680> was<00:01:37.890> thinking<00:01:38.250> oh<00:01:38.369> he<00:01:38.700> got<00:01:38.850> her

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
probably was thinking oh he got her

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.760 
probably was thinking oh he got her
hissing<00:01:39.390> years<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.840> what<00:01:40.259> if<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.500> happened

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
hissing years so what if that happened

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.859 
hissing years so what if that happened
to<00:01:40.829> me<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.159> he<00:01:41.250> just<00:01:41.369> felt<00:01:41.610> like<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:42.000> was<00:01:42.720> what

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
to me so he just felt like that was what

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.710 
to me so he just felt like that was what
he<00:01:42.899> wants<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.200> do<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.250> supporting<00:01:44.729> him<00:01:44.759> what

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
he wants to do and I supporting him what

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.290 
he wants to do and I supporting him what
was<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.899> like<00:01:46.049> being<00:01:46.229> out<00:01:46.380> here<00:01:46.409> without

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300
