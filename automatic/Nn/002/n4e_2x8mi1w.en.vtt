00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
here and so I'll show you in a little

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.340 
here and so I'll show you in a little
bit<00:00:35.880> how<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.450> works<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.840> we'll<00:00:36.989> talk<00:00:37.200> about

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
bit how it works and we'll talk about

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.979 
bit how it works and we'll talk about
the<00:00:37.920> practical<00:00:38.670> use<00:00:38.910> for<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.360> other<00:00:39.540> than<00:00:39.719> just

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
the practical use for it other than just

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.660 
the practical use for it other than just
sorting<00:00:40.559> your<00:00:40.680> items<00:00:41.040> which<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.460> can<00:00:41.640> easily

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
sorting your items which you can easily

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.160 
sorting your items which you can easily
do<00:00:42.350> but<00:00:43.640> yeah<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:44.940> it'd<00:00:45.059> be<00:00:45.329> best<00:00:45.660> for<00:00:45.809> like

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
do but yeah so it'd be best for like

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.990 
do but yeah so it'd be best for like
custom<00:00:46.620> maps<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.070> kind<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.670> stuff<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:47.969> that

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
custom maps and kind of stuff like that

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.670 
custom maps and kind of stuff like that
but<00:00:48.270> I'll<00:00:48.390> just<00:00:48.420> get<00:00:48.690> into<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.289> little<00:00:49.469> bit

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
but I'll just get into that a little bit

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.810 
but I'll just get into that a little bit

this<00:01:46.110> one<00:01:46.290> here<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.590> reduce<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.890> diamond

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
this one here to reduce the diamond

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.880 
this one here to reduce the diamond
listen<00:01:48.119> here<00:01:48.299> triggers<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.869> gold<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.740> once

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
listen here triggers the gold so once

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.560 
listen here triggers the gold so once
you<00:01:49.950> get<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.610> gold<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.060> just<00:01:51.240> kind<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.420> get

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
you get to the gold it just kind of get

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.999 
you get to the gold it just kind of get
sucked<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.079> there<00:01:52.290> like<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:54.829> so<00:01:55.829> this

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
sucked in there like this and so this

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.190 
sucked in there like this and so this
gets<00:01:56.159> sucked<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.640> there<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.060> if<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:57.899> works

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
gets sucked in there and if this works

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.719 
gets sucked in there and if this works
for<00:01:58.320> all<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.829> them<00:01:58.950> as<00:01:59.100> well<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.490> could<00:01:59.640> just

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
for all of them as well you could just

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.440 
for all of them as well you could just
do<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.560> whoops<00:02:01.880> since<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.090> doesn't<00:02:03.270> get

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
do this whoops since it doesn't get

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.819 
do this whoops since it doesn't get
sucked<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.840> there<00:02:04.020> just<00:02:04.170> travels<00:02:04.649> across

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
sucked in there just travels across

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.590 
sucked in there just travels across
their<00:02:05.189> get<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.579> push<00:02:05.729> down<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.149> water<00:02:06.360> and

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
their get to push down to the water and

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.300 
their get to push down to the water and
then<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.229> gets<00:02:07.350> collected<00:02:07.590> up<00:02:07.979> here<00:02:08.190> with

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
then it gets collected up here with

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.830 
then it gets collected up here with
these<00:02:08.459> ones<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.090> doesn't<00:02:09.420> go<00:02:09.479> any<00:02:09.629> further

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
these ones so it doesn't go any further

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.990 
these ones so it doesn't go any further
than<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.250> unless<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.550> spam<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.209> course

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
than that unless you spam it of course

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.070 
than that unless you spam it of course
you<00:02:14.000> don't<00:02:14.180> need<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.420> spam<00:02:14.720> it<00:02:16.510> so<00:02:17.510> yeah<00:02:17.690> so<00:02:17.960> as

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
you don't need to spam it so yeah so as

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.860 
you don't need to spam it so yeah so as
you<00:02:18.230> can<00:02:18.350> see<00:02:18.590> that<00:02:18.860> happens<00:02:19.610> all<00:02:20.180> these

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
you can see that happens all these

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.600 
you can see that happens all these
dispensers<00:02:21.650> here<00:02:21.860> are<00:02:22.040> filled<00:02:22.280> with<00:02:22.370> them

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
dispensers here are filled with them

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.460 
dispensers here are filled with them
that's<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:24.200> main<00:02:24.380> reason<00:02:24.410> until<00:02:25.300> yep<00:02:26.300> so<00:02:26.900> this

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
that's the main reason until yep so this

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.380 
that's the main reason until yep so this
this<00:02:27.800> is<00:02:28.010> quite<00:02:28.220> simple<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.610> build<00:02:28.820> actually

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
this is quite simple to build actually

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.950 
this is quite simple to build actually
it's<00:02:30.050> not<00:02:30.170> hard<00:02:30.470> at<00:02:30.590> all<00:02:30.790> um<00:02:31.790> pretty<00:02:32.750> much

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
it's not hard at all um pretty much

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.830 
it's not hard at all um pretty much
built<00:02:33.380> like<00:02:34.190> this<00:02:34.400> I<00:02:34.640> just<00:02:34.850> I<00:02:35.090> wanted<00:02:35.630> to<00:02:35.720> make

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
built like this I just I wanted to make

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.320 
built like this I just I wanted to make
it<00:02:36.020> a<00:02:36.050> little<00:02:36.200> fancy<00:02:36.620> entrance<00:02:36.980> there<00:02:37.340> until

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
it a little fancy entrance there until

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.880 
it a little fancy entrance there until
you<00:02:38.420> got<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.600> get<00:02:38.780> a<00:02:38.810> nice<00:02:39.110> little<00:02:39.320> fence<00:02:39.590> post

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
you got to get a nice little fence post

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.620 
you got to get a nice little fence post
you<00:02:40.370> have<00:02:40.460> to<00:02:40.580> take<00:02:40.730> out<00:02:40.880> this<00:02:41.000> block<00:02:41.330> here

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
you have to take out this block here

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.940 
you have to take out this block here
because<00:02:41.930> if<00:02:42.080> you<00:02:42.200> don't<00:02:42.320> if<00:02:42.530> you<00:02:42.590> put<00:02:42.740> another

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
because if you don't if you put another

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.710 
because if you don't if you put another
block<00:02:43.280> in<00:02:43.490> there<00:02:43.670> as<00:02:44.090> you<00:02:44.360> can<00:02:44.480> see<00:02:44.600> the

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
block in there as you can see the

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.740 
block in there as you can see the
offense<00:02:44.960> defense<00:02:45.320> attaches<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.160> both<00:02:46.400> sides

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
offense defense attaches to both sides

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.560 
offense defense attaches to both sides
so<00:02:47.750> until<00:02:48.020> you<00:02:48.140> throw<00:02:48.380> in<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.530> block<00:02:48.770> there<00:02:49.570> it

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
so until you throw in a block there it

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.930 
so until you throw in a block there it
doesn't<00:02:51.020> well<00:02:51.500> sometimes<00:02:52.460> it<00:02:52.640> doesn't<00:02:52.910> go

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
doesn't well sometimes it doesn't go

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.680 
doesn't well sometimes it doesn't go
through<00:02:54.730> us<00:02:55.730> because<00:02:56.150> this<00:02:56.330> one<00:02:56.480> here<00:02:56.600> I'll

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
through us because this one here I'll

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.590 
through us because this one here I'll
straights<00:02:56.960> wat<00:02:57.140> Ernie<00:02:57.440> but<00:02:58.250> uh<00:02:58.280> if<00:02:58.850> you<00:02:59.510> were

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
straights wat Ernie but uh if you were

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.290 
straights wat Ernie but uh if you were
to<00:02:59.690> go<00:02:59.840> to<00:02:59.900> this<00:03:00.200> one<00:03:00.380> here<00:03:00.710> and<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:02.090> were<00:03:02.180> to

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
to go to this one here and you were to

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.630 
to go to this one here and you were to
place<00:03:02.540> down<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.810> gold<00:03:03.110> block<00:03:03.380> there<00:03:06.640> it

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
place down a gold block there it

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.670 
place down a gold block there it
wouldn't<00:03:08.120> it<00:03:08.300> wouldn't<00:03:08.480> go<00:03:08.690> anywhere<00:03:08.990> so<00:03:09.320> just

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
wouldn't it wouldn't go anywhere so just

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.710 
wouldn't it wouldn't go anywhere so just
get<00:03:09.770> stuck<00:03:10.070> so<00:03:10.220> you<00:03:10.310> need<00:03:10.460> to<00:03:10.610> remove<00:03:10.880> those

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
get stuck so you need to remove those

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.110 
get stuck so you need to remove those
blocks<00:03:12.140> there<00:03:12.380> and<00:03:12.680> then<00:03:13.490> so<00:03:13.760> you<00:03:13.820> pretty<00:03:14.000> much

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
blocks there and then so you pretty much

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.780 
blocks there and then so you pretty much
less<00:03:14.390> build<00:03:14.660> like<00:03:14.960> a<00:03:14.990> stream<00:03:15.440> down<00:03:15.770> that<00:03:16.520> ends

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
less build like a stream down that ends

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.370 
less build like a stream down that ends
here<00:03:16.910> with<00:03:17.300> another<00:03:17.510> stream<00:03:17.900> coming<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.290> the

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
here with another stream coming to the

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.880 
here with another stream coming to the
other<00:03:18.500> side<00:03:18.709> with<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.340> dispenser<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.320> then<00:03:21.320> you

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
other side with a dispenser and then you

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.310 
other side with a dispenser and then you
just<00:03:22.100> add<00:03:22.250> in<00:03:22.459> your<00:03:22.490> block<00:03:23.480> of<00:03:23.690> choice<00:03:23.930> and

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
just add in your block of choice and

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.100 
just add in your block of choice and
then<00:03:24.470> it<00:03:24.650> all<00:03:24.800> clicks<00:03:25.130> up<00:03:25.310> right<00:03:25.490> there<00:03:25.780> so<00:03:26.780> as

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
then it all clicks up right there so as

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.590 
then it all clicks up right there so as
you<00:03:27.230> can<00:03:27.320> see<00:03:27.500> it's<00:03:27.680> quite<00:03:27.830> simple<00:03:28.600> the

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
you can see it's quite simple the

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.360 
you can see it's quite simple the
practical<00:03:30.260> uses<00:03:30.440> for<00:03:30.590> this<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:31.040> only<00:03:31.130> one<00:03:31.340> I

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
practical uses for this the only one I

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.650 
practical uses for this the only one I
can<00:03:31.520> really<00:03:31.670> think<00:03:31.970> of<00:03:32.180> is<00:03:32.440> in<00:03:34.300> so<00:03:35.300> you<00:03:35.360> make

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
can really think of is in so you make

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.930 
can really think of is in so you make
your<00:03:36.110> making<00:03:36.440> a<00:03:36.530> custom<00:03:36.950> map<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:37.430> it's<00:03:37.820> a

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
your making a custom map and it's a

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.790 
your making a custom map and it's a
challenge<00:03:38.360> you<00:03:38.420> up<00:03:38.510> to<00:03:38.660> like<00:03:38.780> find<00:03:39.470> a<00:03:39.620> certain

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
challenge you up to like find a certain

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.250 
challenge you up to like find a certain
brick<00:03:40.190> you<00:03:41.000> could<00:03:41.209> have<00:03:41.420> it<00:03:41.600> so<00:03:41.870> that<00:03:42.080> it's

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
brick you could have it so that it's

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.480 
brick you could have it so that it's
like<00:03:42.470> you<00:03:43.070> hit<00:03:43.490> it<00:03:43.640> and<00:03:43.930> then<00:03:44.950> it<00:03:45.950> travels<00:03:46.280> down

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
like you hit it and then it travels down

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.730 
like you hit it and then it travels down
there<00:03:46.880> to<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.150> end<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:47.810> then<00:03:48.020> it<00:03:48.200> opens<00:03:48.530> up<00:03:48.620> a

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
there to the end and then it opens up a
