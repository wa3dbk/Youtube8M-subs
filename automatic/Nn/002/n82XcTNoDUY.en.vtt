00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.860
 flotation I don't know what to do first 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.450
 calm down take a notebook 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.880
 further it will be your personal 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.510
 wedding book and start recording 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.890
 all the ideas about the event 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.049
 cut out of the magazine all the pictures 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.630
 which inspire you to glue them in 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:22.360
 this book is further by the way it will be 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.190
 a great memory for you groom nice 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.200
 in a few years will look through this 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.370
 notepad and remember what you were thinking 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.510
 when were you still 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.980
 the bride on the wife I have top 10 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.330
 items to start with 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.120
 wedding preparation 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.909
 I plan to give away to remove individual 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.640
 videos on each of the questions to 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.310
 you could more easily find answers to what 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.869
 I'm interested in you, and now I'm their 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.119
 just listed to somehow 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.869
 structure all the thoughts in your head 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.850
 and you could prioritize for 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.399
 Beginning is necessary to determine the style 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.500
 weddings and understand which direction you are 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.679
 want to move only after that 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.329
 take all the other steps 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.009
 then there are several topics in which 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.039
 It is difficult to distinguish the sequence because 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.629
 they are all interconnected my personal advice 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.660
 all the ideas that you will have 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:15.120
 write down two columns then why don't you 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.950
 ready to refuse under any circumstances 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.090
 this is something you would really like but it 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.200
 will depend on many others 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.700
 components 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.310
 then you will need to 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.680
 match your records with priorities 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.410
 believe you are waiting for the groom a lot 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.519
 surprises and the first one is what he 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.670
 no list leads and so on to you 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.890
 need to choose a wedding date 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.349
 make a guest list define 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.280
 the budget you want to spend on 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:47.220
 this event and choose approximate 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.260
 venue I'm not saying that you 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.840
 immediately identify a specific restaurant but 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.630
 you need to understand it in your city 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.630
 or outdoor event restaurant 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.480
 manor or tents in the open air 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.560
 maybe you start the ceremony on 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.049
 ocean shore 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.940
 well, or just want to sign the registry office 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:11.709
 go away for two honeymoon 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.299
 then proceeding from all these points you need 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.780
 understand who will be involved in the organization 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.530
 the wedding event itself 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.410
 steward 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.030
 or a wedding agency as you can see everything 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.139
 solve these issues one by one not 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.250
 maybe they are all tied to each other 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.930
 the next step for you will be 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.870
 decide on some more important 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.630
 matters this is all about ceremony 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.250
 for example who will lead you to the altar will 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.569
 do you have children at the wedding which will 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.209
 scatter the petals of roses and bring 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.840
 cushion with rings you will need 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.189
 choose bridesmaids and groomsmen 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.040
 the next item is an announcement of 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.090
 engagement write when and how you will 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.489
 do it 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.709
 bones need as soon as possible to report 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.780
 date of the wedding so that they celebrate in 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.480
 calendar and must have come 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.329
 plan think whether you will arrange 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.219
 your engagement party 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:06.530
 especially if the wedding is scheduled not soon 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:10.370
 then this is an excellent opportunity to meet 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.319
 loved ones and share with them the joy and 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.919
 this wonderful news 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.109
 it can be like dinner with parents 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:21.289
 so and going with friends to a nightclub 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.099
 The options are very following 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:26.630
 important point is performers 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:29.169
 you can't pick everyone fast but 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.789
 start thinking about this question already 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.580
 one of the best ways is 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:37.130
 remember those lines of events on 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.410

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.560
 Liked what cream floristics
