00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
I do you think that's a pretty good

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.240 
I do you think that's a pretty good
gamertag<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.320> was<00:00:25.439> actually<00:00:25.560> from<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.010> first

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
gamertag I was actually from the first

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.859 
gamertag I was actually from the first
sword<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:27.210> sort<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.449> try<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.660> boost

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
sword so you sort of try to boost

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.330 
sword so you sort of try to boost
another<00:00:28.080> paying<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.710> window<00:00:29.039> where<00:00:29.220> these

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
another paying that window where these

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.700 
another paying that window where these
guys<00:00:29.519> I'm<00:00:29.789> aiming<00:00:30.359> right<00:00:30.510> now<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.529> didn't

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
guys I'm aiming right now and it didn't

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.840 
guys I'm aiming right now and it didn't
work<00:00:31.830> out<00:00:31.980> for<00:00:32.040> them<00:00:32.189> they<00:00:32.309> got<00:00:32.460> taken<00:00:32.640> out<00:00:32.790> by

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
work out for them they got taken out by

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.150 
work out for them they got taken out by
ginger<00:00:33.300> Phil<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:34.140> they<00:00:34.320> they're<00:00:34.950> kind<00:00:35.130> of

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
ginger Phil so they they're kind of

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.160 
ginger Phil so they they're kind of
swapped<00:00:35.399> over<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:35.969> boosting<00:00:36.840> method

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
swapped over to this boosting method

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.229 
swapped over to this boosting method
where<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.380> can<00:00:37.649> see<00:00:37.860> terror<00:00:38.550> live<00:00:38.820> just<00:00:39.059> keeps

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
where you can see terror live just keeps

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.310 
where you can see terror live just keeps
going<00:00:39.420> back<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.719> window<00:00:39.960> with<00:00:40.079> his<00:00:40.140> tech

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
going back to the window with his tech

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.830 
going back to the window with his tech
insertion<00:00:40.829> trying<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.430> make<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.760> not<00:00:42.000> look<00:00:42.329> of

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
insertion trying to make it not look of

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.569 
insertion trying to make it not look of
this<00:00:43.050> by<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.649> know<00:00:43.770> facing<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.430> way

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
this by you know facing you the way

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.490 
this by you know facing you the way
maybe<00:00:44.820> he's<00:00:45.120> controlling<00:00:45.870> disconnected<00:00:46.440> or

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
maybe he's controlling disconnected or

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.850 
maybe he's controlling disconnected or
whatever

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
whatever

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.229 
whatever
I'm<00:00:47.129> not<00:00:47.399> sure<00:00:47.550> why<00:00:47.700> he's<00:00:47.789> doing<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.059> when

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
I'm not sure why he's doing that when

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.490 
I'm not sure why he's doing that when
it's<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.510> obvious<00:00:48.539> they<00:00:48.899> are<00:00:49.020> boosting<00:00:49.379> but

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
it's so obvious they are boosting but

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.470 
it's so obvious they are boosting but
anyway<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.190> point<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.579> video<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:51.120> to

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
anyway the point of this video is to

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.510 
anyway the point of this video is to
laugh<00:00:51.690> at<00:00:51.870> how<00:00:52.050> bad<00:00:52.289> these<00:00:52.949> guys<00:00:53.190> are<00:00:53.399> at

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
laugh at how bad these guys are at

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.700 
laugh at how bad these guys are at
boosting<00:00:53.850> they<00:00:54.059> are<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.360> worst<00:00:54.629> boosters<00:00:55.410> of

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
boosting they are the worst boosters of

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.500 
boosting they are the worst boosters of
all<00:00:56.190> time<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.670> may<00:00:57.030> actually<00:00:57.149> name<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
all time and I may actually name the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.720 
all time and I may actually name the
video<00:00:57.870> that's<00:00:58.140> because<00:00:58.500> honestly<00:00:58.980> they<00:00:59.699> are

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
video that's because honestly they are

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.040 
video that's because honestly they are
awful<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.329> you're<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:00.870> video

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
awful and you're so that in this video

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.990 
awful and you're so that in this video
so<00:01:01.199> there's<00:01:01.920> two<00:01:02.100> failed<00:01:02.340> tactics<00:01:02.820> right

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
so there's two failed tactics right

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.979 
so there's two failed tactics right
there<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.329> may<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:03.539> seen<00:01:03.660> them<00:01:03.809> try<00:01:03.930> to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
there you may have seen them try to

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.420 
there you may have seen them try to
boost<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.409> room<00:01:04.589> they<00:01:05.040> tried<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.250> boost

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
boost in the room they tried to boost

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.370 
boost in the room they tried to boost
across<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> map<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.210> though<00:01:06.360> they<00:01:07.140> tried<00:01:07.350> to

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
across the map and though they tried to

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.719 
across the map and though they tried to
boost<00:01:07.560> across<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.040> map<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> right<00:01:08.520> hand

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
boost across the map on the right hand

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.240 
boost across the map on the right hand
side<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:09.450> can<00:01:09.630> see<00:01:09.659> here<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.140> few<00:01:10.290> times<00:01:10.560> you

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
side you can see here in a few times you

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.649 
side you can see here in a few times you
know<00:01:11.280> terror<00:01:11.640> like<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:12.000> stands<00:01:12.240> there<00:01:12.330> and

know terror like just stands there and

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.960 
know terror like just stands there and
my<00:01:13.229> man<00:01:13.439> come<00:01:13.680> see<00:01:13.890> my<00:01:14.040> cat<00:01:14.310> tries<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.670> take<00:01:14.820> him

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
my man come see my cat tries to take him

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.359 
my man come see my cat tries to take him
out<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.119> few<00:01:15.360> times<00:01:15.479> as<00:01:15.689> well<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.310> before<00:01:17.310> this

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
out a few times as well so before this

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.370 
out a few times as well so before this
video<00:01:17.610> probably<00:01:17.790> gets<00:01:18.090> into<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.509> do<00:01:19.229> me<00:01:19.320> a

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
video probably gets into it do me a

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.960

hijacked and they get dicked on again

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.090 
hijacked and they get dicked on again
it's<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:50.930> answer<00:02:51.050> they<00:02:51.350> get<00:02:51.500> completely<00:02:51.680> dict

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
it's the answer they get completely dict

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.350 
it's the answer they get completely dict
on<00:02:52.250> they<00:02:52.490> don't<00:02:52.760> finish<00:02:52.910> with<00:02:53.060> very<00:02:53.270> good

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
on they don't finish with very good

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.480 
on they don't finish with very good
scores<00:02:53.600> at<00:02:53.720> all<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.140> honestly<00:02:54.709> like<00:02:55.010> watching

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
scores at all and honestly like watching

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.830 
scores at all and honestly like watching
this<00:02:55.550> back<00:02:55.760> makes<00:02:56.060> me<00:02:56.209> wonder<00:02:56.360> what<00:02:56.570> they<00:02:56.720> were

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
this back makes me wonder what they were

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.720 
this back makes me wonder what they were
trying<00:02:57.110> to<00:02:57.140> boost<00:02:57.350> for<00:02:57.709> generally<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.520> things

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
trying to boost for generally the things

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.270 
trying to boost for generally the things
that<00:02:58.880> people<00:02:59.030> try<00:02:59.390> to<00:02:59.420> boost<00:02:59.690> for<00:02:59.959> Moab's<00:03:00.920> or

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
that people try to boost for Moab's or

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.370 
that people try to boost for Moab's or
nukes<00:03:01.610> obviously<00:03:02.120> there's<00:03:02.270> no<00:03:02.390> mire<00:03:02.600> or<00:03:03.080> nuke

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
nukes obviously there's no mire or nuke

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.500 
nukes obviously there's no mire or nuke
in<00:03:03.530> this<00:03:03.650> game<00:03:03.860> there<00:03:04.370> is<00:03:04.459> a<00:03:04.490> nuclear<00:03:04.910> title<00:03:05.330> so

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
in this game there is a nuclear title so

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.640 
in this game there is a nuclear title so
maybe<00:03:05.720> they<00:03:05.840> would<00:03:05.959> try<00:03:06.050> to<00:03:06.080> boost<00:03:06.290> for<00:03:06.500> that

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
maybe they would try to boost for that

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.890 
maybe they would try to boost for that
maybe<00:03:07.310> they<00:03:07.490> were<00:03:07.550> going<00:03:07.850> for<00:03:08.270> like<00:03:08.570> a<00:03:08.630> kill

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
maybe they were going for like a kill

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.270 
maybe they were going for like a kill
streak<00:03:09.020> which<00:03:09.410> doesn't<00:03:09.740> make<00:03:09.860> sense<00:03:10.130> because

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
streak which doesn't make sense because

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.680 
streak which doesn't make sense because
they're<00:03:10.580> using<00:03:10.730> like<00:03:10.880> care<00:03:11.150> packages<00:03:11.570> and

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
they're using like care packages and

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.660 
they're using like care packages and
stuff<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:12.200> not<00:03:12.620> like<00:03:12.740> a<00:03:12.770> swarm<00:03:13.100> or<00:03:13.310> dogs<00:03:13.550> or

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
stuff and not like a swarm or dogs or

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.190 
stuff and not like a swarm or dogs or
whatever<00:03:13.820> so<00:03:14.540> that<00:03:14.660> doesn't<00:03:14.840> make<00:03:14.959> much<00:03:15.170> sense

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
whatever so that doesn't make much sense

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.410 
whatever so that doesn't make much sense
and<00:03:15.680> if<00:03:16.040> you<00:03:16.130> watch<00:03:16.340> this<00:03:16.550> this<00:03:16.880> is<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.030> complete

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
and if you watch this this is a complete

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.630 
and if you watch this this is a complete
mess<00:03:17.600> okay<00:03:17.989> my<00:03:18.140> main<00:03:18.350> tera<00:03:18.590> live<00:03:18.830> they<00:03:19.459> both

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
mess okay my main tera live they both

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.009 
mess okay my main tera live they both
put<00:03:19.880> their<00:03:19.910> attacking<00:03:20.209> sessions<00:03:20.630> down<00:03:20.750> fair

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
put their attacking sessions down fair

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.780 
put their attacking sessions down fair
enough<00:03:21.230> so<00:03:22.070> Tara<00:03:22.280> life<00:03:22.400> is<00:03:22.489> trying<00:03:22.640> to<00:03:22.700> get

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
enough so Tara life is trying to get

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.340 
enough so Tara life is trying to get
some<00:03:22.940> kills<00:03:23.120> with<00:03:23.239> the<00:03:23.300> ballistics<00:03:23.660> knives

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
some kills with the ballistics knives

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.560 
some kills with the ballistics knives
which<00:03:24.620> maybe<00:03:25.220> trying<00:03:25.519> to<00:03:25.610> get<00:03:25.730> some<00:03:26.000> you<00:03:26.510> know

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
which maybe trying to get some you know

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.750 
which maybe trying to get some you know
camos<00:03:26.989> for<00:03:27.170> whatever<00:03:27.350> get<00:03:27.680> a<00:03:27.709> few<00:03:27.920> kills<00:03:28.070> jumps

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
camos for whatever get a few kills jumps

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.280 
camos for whatever get a few kills jumps
off<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:28.910> map<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:29.420> you<00:03:29.540> think<00:03:29.720> maybe<00:03:29.930> that<00:03:30.200> was

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
off the map and you think maybe that was

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.470 
off the map and you think maybe that was
an<00:03:30.380> accident<00:03:30.739> so<00:03:30.830> he<00:03:30.860> kills<00:03:31.190> me<00:03:31.340> again<00:03:31.550> I<00:03:31.730> think

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
an accident so he kills me again I think

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.670 
an accident so he kills me again I think
he<00:03:32.600> jumps<00:03:33.019> off<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.230> map<00:03:33.350> again

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
he jumps off the map again

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.220 
he jumps off the map again
and<00:03:33.890> honestly<00:03:34.430> watch<00:03:35.120> this<00:03:35.390> man<00:03:35.600> watching<00:03:36.140> his

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
and honestly watch this man watching his

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.199 
and honestly watch this man watching his
back<00:03:36.410> makes<00:03:37.370> me<00:03:37.519> laugh<00:03:37.640> to<00:03:37.820> be<00:03:37.910> honest<00:03:38.120> because

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
back makes me laugh to be honest because

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.810 
back makes me laugh to be honest because
they<00:03:38.540> try<00:03:38.840> so<00:03:39.140> hard<00:03:39.170> all<00:03:39.620> game<00:03:39.860> and<00:03:40.130> they<00:03:40.640> get

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
they try so hard all game and they get

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.520 
they try so hard all game and they get
shut<00:03:41.030> down<00:03:41.060> again<00:03:41.630> and<00:03:41.750> again<00:03:42.050> you<00:03:42.170> can<00:03:42.290> see<00:03:42.410> my

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
shut down again and again you can see my

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.290 
shut down again and again you can see my
lolly<00:03:42.739> strike<00:03:43.010> attacking<00:03:43.370> them<00:03:43.550> out<00:03:43.730> there<00:03:44.030> so

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
lolly strike attacking them out there so

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.000 
lolly strike attacking them out there so
I<00:03:44.510> just<00:03:45.110> thought<00:03:45.230> I'd<00:03:45.410> share<00:03:45.620> this<00:03:45.709> with<00:03:45.890> you

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
I just thought I'd share this with you

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.320 
I just thought I'd share this with you
guys<00:03:46.040> because<00:03:46.340> I<00:03:46.519> found<00:03:46.730> it<00:03:46.910> hilarious<00:03:46.970> that

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
guys because I found it hilarious that

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.150 
guys because I found it hilarious that
these<00:03:47.480> guys<00:03:47.660> were<00:03:47.810> trying<00:03:47.989> to<00:03:48.140> boost<00:03:48.350> for

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
these guys were trying to boost for

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.040 
these guys were trying to boost for
whatever<00:03:49.550> reason<00:03:50.120> maybe<00:03:50.269> these<00:03:50.600> guys<00:03:50.780> going

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
whatever reason maybe these guys going

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.690 
whatever reason maybe these guys going
for<00:03:51.200> one<00:03:51.350> shots<00:03:51.590> would<00:03:51.680> be<00:03:51.769> Remington<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.459> the

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
for one shots would be Remington and the

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.850 
for one shots would be Remington and the
ballista<00:03:53.120> maybe<00:03:53.780> they're<00:03:53.989> going<00:03:54.140> for<00:03:54.260> camos<00:03:54.650> I

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
ballista maybe they're going for camos I

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.949 
ballista maybe they're going for camos I
don't<00:03:55.160> know<00:03:55.480> but<00:03:56.480> whenever<00:03:56.630> they<00:03:56.900> were

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
don't know but whenever they were

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.320 
don't know but whenever they were
boosting<00:03:57.350> for<00:03:57.530> they<00:03:58.130> were<00:03:58.190> really<00:03:58.489> really<00:03:59.060> bad

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
boosting for they were really really bad

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.729 
boosting for they were really really bad
at<00:03:59.480> it<00:03:59.630> and<00:03:59.870> you<00:03:59.959> can<00:04:00.110> see<00:04:00.260> here<00:04:00.440> they<00:04:00.530> get<00:04:00.680> a

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
at it and you can see here they get a

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.290 
at it and you can see here they get a
few<00:04:01.040> kills<00:04:01.250> in<00:04:01.459> a<00:04:01.519> row<00:04:01.550> and<00:04:01.850> this<00:04:01.940> may<00:04:02.180> actually

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
few kills in a row and this may actually

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.690 
few kills in a row and this may actually
be<00:04:02.510> their<00:04:02.780> most<00:04:02.930> successful<00:04:03.370> boosting<00:04:04.370> spree

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
be their most successful boosting spree

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.970 
be their most successful boosting spree
of<00:04:04.910> the<00:04:05.209> Hydra<00:04:05.480> game<00:04:05.690> and<00:04:05.930> after<00:04:06.500> a<00:04:06.530> few<00:04:06.709> kills

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
of the Hydra game and after a few kills

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.350 
of the Hydra game and after a few kills
I<00:04:07.100> think<00:04:07.280> it's<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.489> last<00:04:07.640> one<00:04:07.760> they<00:04:07.850> get<00:04:08.060> I

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
I think it's the last one they get I

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.090 
I think it's the last one they get I
come<00:04:09.019> around<00:04:09.080> the<00:04:09.230> corner<00:04:09.380> and<00:04:09.620> give<00:04:09.830> that<00:04:09.980> guy

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
come around the corner and give that guy

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.620

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
there's nothing he can do about it and

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.000

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.800 
then my lightly stroke comes in and
takes<00:04:40.490> him<00:04:40.700> out<00:04:40.820> and<00:04:41.120> he's<00:04:41.390> pretty<00:04:41.570> much<00:04:41.720> the

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
takes him out and he's pretty much the

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.600 
takes him out and he's pretty much the
end<00:04:41.870> of<00:04:42.020> the<00:04:42.110> game<00:04:42.260> and<00:04:42.500> make<00:04:43.010> your<00:04:43.190> book<00:04:43.370> the
