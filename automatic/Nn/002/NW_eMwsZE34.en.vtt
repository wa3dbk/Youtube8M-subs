00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 yes 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.260
 the renault clio was released 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.269
 originally in 1998 in france and since 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.669
 2000 began to take place in the mercosur 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:25.009
 since its conception it was installed as a 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:27.470
 reference of the segment by led to reindeer 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.390
 to a sales success that stayed as 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.400
 over the trajectory of this model 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.440
 now when in europe just 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.359
 present the fourth generation in 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.000
 our country was launched the renewal of 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:40.129
 Phase 2 and relocated in the range is 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.140
 say it became a true 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.660
 entry of range because by price 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.120
 some of the versions are by 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.070
 under the clio that sold up 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.890
 now he continues to leave the plant 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.260
 Cordovan of Santa Isabel and her redefinition 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.699
 it's basically aesthetic but it's also 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.100
 important to note that you are looking 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.800
 replace certain parts elements 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.420
 and surfaces to lower costs on 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.160
 replacement was not to the detriment of the 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.930
 final equation that as a relationship 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.080
 price-product is the best of 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.840
 market comes in bodies of three and 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.800
 five doors as the approved so 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.800
 that for this occasion 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.110
 let's talk about the design the highlights are 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.090
 appreciates in the tube there are certain 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.399
 traits of the new brand image of 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.290
 reno in Europe has a grill 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.060
 plastic in black that draws a 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.830
 kind of smile and that contains a 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.930
 large diamond in the center also 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.210
 slightly modified the bonnet and optics 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.390
 that include a dark mask that is 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.740
 a smoked tone have the sides 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.439
 unchanged except for the tone of the 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.780
 Mirror housing that may vary 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.340
 of color and the tail very little changes 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.380
 just a nerve that is born in the 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.569
 ends of the gate and merges with the 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.340
 optical object also of a small 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:58.780
 reformulation there is also a change in 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.209
 the lunette that at the top 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.310
 replaced its curvature by a wall lamp 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:05.590
 sheet metal the structures is to say what 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.420
 are the measures does not vary at all what 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.130
 that the image stands out as novelty 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.500
 in the huge variety of possibilities 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.200
 of customization that is offered are 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.810
 about 2000 options between stickers for 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.940
 the exterior appliques and tones and 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.769
 different combinations between what is 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.530
 the body and what is the interior is 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.780
 say with different applique finishes and 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.640
 others until the tires can vary their 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.280
 tonality for example the one 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.170
 proven looks the street look that has 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.720
 fog lamps alloy wheels 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.940
 of 13 inches and this striking plotting 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.160
 geometric on the ceiling the other clips 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.050
 They are the lady with some more details 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.970
 identified with the female world the 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.970
 my kit and also the sport with 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.480
 small differences between them the trunk 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.610
 maintains the 255 liters of capacity not 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.850
 It's generous but it's not out of place in the 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.850
 segment 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.260
 we go inside to see what happens 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.209
 inside the changes are minor no 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.950
 there is variation in space neither 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.140
 on the front plate that only 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.239
 change of tone has new upholstery and 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.480
 the plastics are all rigid of good 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.010
 presence although with improvable details 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.720
 especially in some cuts and re 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.819
 beards the best is in instrumental 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.500
 ordered with large numbers and good 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.480
 analog lighting for the 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.670
 how many revolutions and 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.400
 digital for fuel temperature 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.170
 now odometer and some other data in 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.790
 functionality terms the concept 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.440
 low cost came to resign some 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.700
 elements like the command of 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.380
 recirculation of the air that is now 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.360
 manual and non-electric belts 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.610
 front that no longer regulate in height and 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.709
 the backs are fixed three points 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.319
 except the central one that is abdominal 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.170
 even this had already happened in the 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.190
 last kids that is the last ones 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.319
 restyling I had suffered this in this 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.450
 compact model the command to open it 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.000
 remotely at the doors no longer 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.410
 is in the key but in the knowledge in 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.420
 instants then we continue with the 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.690
 test drive to the new renault clio 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.690
 my own 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.970
 the version tested by reuters endowed 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.310
 with the expression pack 1 equipment 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.720
 that is at the top of the range and that 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.670
 among the highlights has an air 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.470
 conditioning remote opening of doors 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.440
 as we told you earlier team 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.770
 audio with radio am fm cd and mp3 player 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.960
 + entry for usb sd card one 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.430
 onboard computer and forgetting alert 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.720
 of lights on in terms of 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.389
 safety head restraints 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.250
 active automatic closing of door in 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.200
 filming if you lock it when it reaches 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.030
 certain speed in addition to the 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.730
 anti-fog mentioned in the first 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.730
 part absent the abs and watches 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.550
 let's talk about the engine is the known and 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.310
 efficient and several times tested 1.2 of 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.920
 Valves 16 and 75 horsepower 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.230
 with low consumption has smooth answers 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.270
 and does not show jerks or reactions 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.040
 brusque at low regime is quite 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.410
 silent although when it enters 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.330
 speed becomes something buzzing with a 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.490
 correct drive and good box 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.800
 relationships get the service specified 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.350
 action in 13.2 seconds and the speed 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.150
 maximum is located in the 160 kilometers 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.670
 per hour let's talk about the consumption we had 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.500
 said that it is austere if really to 130 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.930
 with the stabilized motor requires some 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.480
 7 liters per 100 kilometers and in the city 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.030
 stretches a little above the 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.520
 8 liters really values ​​as I said 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.380
 austere and of course remarkable 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.570
 we are going to walk friends and we are already entering 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.280
 to the last part or to the end of this 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.290
 test driving my kilo an ideal car 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.730
 for the city is its habitat and where it 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.560
 feel comfortable robust in your 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.390
 displacement with good clearance and 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.490
 suspensions that do a good job 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:48.770
 even if the front train manifests 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.330
 certain roughness in stretches of even or 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.009
 out there at the exit of a donkey loin 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.529
 the address is somewhat slow but real 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:57.629
 helps you with the maneuvers 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:58.800
 parking lot and in transit so 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:00.930
 congested the action is good 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.210
 airs on route tends to inclinations 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.460
 I had already been doing it maybe better 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.529
 little bit but it 's one of the flaws and 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.399
 It also shows something sensitive to 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:10.399
 lateral winds 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.750
 the balance of the pros and cons 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.550
 we think with the points that for 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.800
 we would have to improve the 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.960
 safety equipment is certainly 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.940
 really poor in this in this area the 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.440
 standard equipment in general is not 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.389
 of the best and some details 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.430
 determinations that's what it would be 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:35.470
 susceptible to any changes please 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.540
 redesign was nice especially the 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.880
 nose looking at the front of the motor that is 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.770
 efficient and that we had already said 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.530
 praised on other occasions the 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.690
 consumption and the robustness in walking plus the 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.240
 guarantee this is important because they are 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.979
 three years or 100,000 kilometers everything there 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.870
 I analyze it based on prices 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:54.639
 you can not complain too much if you 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:57.250
 take into account that the range goes from the 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:07:01.180
 61 thousand pesos in the three base doors 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:03.010
 up to 68 thousand of the five version 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.570
 full doors like the one we tested 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.790
 us in rutgers for today 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:09.250
 his rivals the volkswagen power goal 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:12.100
 the celtic chevrolet the fiat palio fire and 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:14.590
 the 206 peugeot that is already reaching its 

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.720
 final stage his arguments we said a 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.400
 reliable mechanics the good guarantee that 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.220
 I mentioned you and a range of prices 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.720
 really tempting the public and the 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.740
 weather 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.740
 looking at their
