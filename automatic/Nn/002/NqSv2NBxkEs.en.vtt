 sean a cold and today I will recommend 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.369
 a mac application that is free 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:25.949
 for a limited time good takes free 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.090
 the truth that since March 31 the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.039
 truth is that it has been almost a month 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.779
 free for a limited time I do not know if the 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.949
 they are going to put in some moment of payment in 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.900
 the description says that we take it 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.430
 fast because because supposedly the 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.080
 they are going to put payment not so but 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.450
 well at least today it is free 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.010
 14 euros and is free for time 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.500
 Limited is a photography application 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.660
 it's called photos and without more let's see the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.700
 application let's go to alfred and let's 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.370
 open photos that this is the application 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.650
 that we are going to review today photos for mac 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.210
 is a pretty cool application with the 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.310
 that we will be able to edit add a 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.740
 series of very beautiful filters to our 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.480
 photographs and also improve photographs 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.490
 adjusting the exposure a little 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.470
 shine the contrast of a super form 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.390
 simple to note that we are going to take a 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.710
 photography for example this one that I have 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.120
 I did the other one we did the other day 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.980
 house we're good this was the 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.430
 last summer we are playing a 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.980
 departure 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.330
 of letters and with friends well then 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.920
 nothing to notice that to begin with we are going to 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.330
 can apply a series of filters 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.070
 we can tell you that you applied a filter 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.840
 Automatic to do the same thing 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.460
 color correction fix that from 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.470
 here we will be able to add all these 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.700
 filters as you are seeing with this 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.990
 let's improve the color a little 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.920
 also from claudio the truth is that I 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.410
 I think it's the best that was 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.479
 all this you can try it and put the 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.950
 that you want we have all these 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.840
 this also looks pretty good, I think 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.430
 that the claudy gives a tone I think 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.290
 that much more I do not know what's left 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.000
 little bit cleaner everything not so I do 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.530
 I'm going to leave in the cloud and see that 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.750
 also here we could compare the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.580
 original with the filter that we 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.740
 we have applied from here in croze 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.960
 we could crop the image as 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.720
 we would like free style or 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.790
 we are going to be able to take for example with 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.860
 some pre-established dimensions like 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.050
 you are seeing here not in this case I 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.520
 I will leave the original here we could 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.830
 adjust a little bit what it is said the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.210
 exposition for example to note that we're going 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.429
 to expand the exposure so that they have 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.280
 more or less brightness fix that we're going to 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.050
 touch the brightness agree to fix that 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.610
 let's touch the contrast and from this 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.470
 way then we could manually adjust 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.270
 a little photography to our liking 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.100
 we can remove a little bit of 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.830
 well I am to your liking we could not 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.600
 add a blur effect or that 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.820
 they saw more clearly in the photograph a 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.140
 effect be penn of these not in addition 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.450
 note that here we can touch the white 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.060
 balance the temperature and intensity 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.770
 of the beat of bing net that this I do not know what 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.980
 is but notice that it adds as a 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.140
 shaded on the edges according a 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.740
 I do not know why I do not know what is 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.970
 this 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.410
 good to note that here we have all 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.050
 these options of agreement here we have 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.460
 he is also here to rotate we have 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.680
 many options to edit the 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.910
 photography this is one of the things more 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.530
 cool because from here we could 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.030
 add effects we have a lot of 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.120
 fixed effects that we can apply 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.860
 all of these that we are seeing here the 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.430
 that we want to me those that more 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.620
 I like them 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.630
 here we have these filters here we go 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.000
 to see here we have white filters and 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.120
 black here we have filters of my 7 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.960
 also we agree we could put it 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.490
 any of all these the one 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.570
 we would like more to note that 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.880
 from here we could adjust the 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.890
 intensity is valid to leave it as 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.510
 our taste not the coolest I think 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.490
 that are here in him because they add us 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.960
 as an as an additional layer for 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.580
 make effect of old photograph and such 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.810
 note that they appear as lines 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.819
 around here this one 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.470
 of painting is also pretty cool 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.959
 also note that from here we are going to 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.430
 can remove the effect or minimize the 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.770
 effect not to make them look more or less 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.180
 here to note that we have nothing this 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.770
 is this from here that you are seeing me 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.630
 I think it's a pretty application 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.910
 cool to make very very pictures 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.560
 curious more things because we can 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.480
 apply fixed edges that we can 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.880
 Put some edges as cool as 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.430
 these here set all the edges 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.599
 the amount of edges that I have the 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.860
 truth is that it will not waste the 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.900
 opportunity now that it's free and I 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.190
 would lower it already if you have a mac because of 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.420
 truth that is an application that to me 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.010
 it's quite surprised I think it's 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.810
 very well in fact right now is in the 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.730
 top 1 of the appstore in apps 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.310
 free so I imagine it will be 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.549
 for something I will not leave this one that is like this 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.290
 of television sorry and then also 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.720
 we will be able to apply fuzzy 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.040
 we can choose an area that we 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.900
 we want this we will be able to do more 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.329
 big or smaller we're going to catch this 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.540
 area here is worth and then around 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.190
 we will be able to apply a blur as 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.290
 stronger if you see everything as more 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.389
 blurred and that's how it looks like less 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.919
 fuzzy we could catch the degree that 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.840
 we would like to let you 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.330
 something intermediate more or less there 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.340
 agree and note that we can add 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.900
 the blur but in linear 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.970
 not in a circle of agreement and also 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.350
 we could rotate it from here according 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.419
 and obviously we could do it because more 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.540
 small and such let's put it more or 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:48.000
 less there and we're going to leave it that way more or 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.710
 less let's leave it like that 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.650
 pretty cool and good to end 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.690
 We could export our creation 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.160
 Well let's put it on the desk 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:00.979
 for example let's put the name of 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.979
 photo and you're saving right now 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.520
 it has already been saved and good to see that 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.830
 we could also share with facebook 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.210
 and with twitter this fantastic creation 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.490
 what have we done in our mac 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.170
 in a super super simple way 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.150
 we want to see the original here we have the 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.620
 compare button we want to expand 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.840
 to zoom in since we could 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.940
 do it but we can rotate to the right 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.250
 to the left and here we are going to see all 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.350
 the information of the black file is a 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.210
 application that is a must have if you 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.120
 like to retouch your photographs to 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.770
 turn them into magnificent I recommend you 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.790
 photos and here I say goodbye I hope that you 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.320
 have liked the review of this 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.180
 application and we'll see if you 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.169
 you want handsome guapetons in a 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.169
 next video chao
