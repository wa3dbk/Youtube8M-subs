00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
two killers for me with this app doesn't

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.129 
two killers for me with this app doesn't
really<00:01:46.729> work<00:01:47.060> well<00:01:47.329> with<00:01:47.630> finding<00:01:48.020> your

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:48.139 
really work well with finding your

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:51.879 
really work well with finding your
location<00:01:48.679> on<00:01:48.799> 3g<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:50.079> another<00:01:51.079> thing<00:01:51.380> is<00:01:51.649> that

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:51.889 
location on 3g and another thing is that

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:53.589 
location on 3g and another thing is that
it<00:01:52.009> doesn't<00:01:52.219> have<00:01:52.340> push<00:01:52.579> notifications<00:01:53.389> I

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:53.599 
it doesn't have push notifications I

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:55.269 
it doesn't have push notifications I
would<00:01:53.749> rather<00:01:53.869> have<00:01:54.259> the<00:01:54.499> app<00:01:54.619> tell<00:01:55.039> me<00:01:55.189> if

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:55.279 
would rather have the app tell me if

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:56.859 
would rather have the app tell me if
there's<00:01:55.520> rain<00:01:55.789> imminent<00:01:56.270> within<00:01:56.389> an<00:01:56.719> hour

there's rain imminent within an hour

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.680 
there's rain imminent within an hour
rather<00:01:57.229> than<00:01:57.499> the<00:01:57.679> opening<00:01:58.039> up<00:01:58.189> the<00:01:58.340> end

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
rather than the opening up the end

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.830 
rather than the opening up the end
finding<00:01:59.110> out<00:01:59.230> so<00:02:00.040> two<00:02:00.430> things<00:02:00.700> not<00:02:01.450> really

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
finding out so two things not really

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.020 
finding out so two things not really
well<00:02:02.110> but<00:02:02.830> other<00:02:03.040> than<00:02:03.250> that<00:02:03.310> it's<00:02:03.640> a<00:02:03.730> great

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
well but other than that it's a great

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.760
