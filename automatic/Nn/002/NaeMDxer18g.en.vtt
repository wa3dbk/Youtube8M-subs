moves in a general downwards direction
price<00:01:26.759> down<00:01:27.150> trends<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.770> price<00:01:28.770> creates<00:01:29.340> this

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
price down trends and price creates this

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.960 
price down trends and price creates this
step<00:01:30.030> emotion<00:01:30.650> which<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> series<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.340> pushes

and<00:01:33.210> pullbacks<00:01:33.659> or<00:01:34.200> rallies<00:01:35.100> and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
and pullbacks or rallies and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.969 
and pullbacks or rallies and
retracements<00:01:35.960> so<00:01:36.960> with<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> downtrend<00:01:37.740> we

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
retracements so with the downtrend we

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.160 
retracements so with the downtrend we
can<00:01:38.130> have<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> rally<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> downside<00:01:39.479> their

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
can have a rally to the downside their

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.490 
can have a rally to the downside their
retracement<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:41.040> rally<00:01:41.899> retracement<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:42.990> so

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
retracement a rally retracement and so

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.580 
retracement a rally retracement and so
forth<00:01:43.880> with<00:01:44.880> an<00:01:45.000> uptrend<00:01:45.479> we<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:46.170> have<00:01:46.380> a

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
forth with an uptrend we can have a

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.219 
forth with an uptrend we can have a
rally<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.399> tray<00:01:47.640> sment<00:01:47.970> or<00:01:48.229> using

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
rally and a tray sment or using

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.859

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.819 
different terminology a push and a pull
back<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.649> push<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.909> pull<00:01:53.939> back<00:01:54.500> so<00:01:55.500> once<00:01:55.649> we

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
back a push and a pull back so once we

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.980 
back a push and a pull back so once we
