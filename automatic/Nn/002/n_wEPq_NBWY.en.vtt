00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.089
 There was a high flipped AP wedding ceremony showing there were two 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:06.020
 Separate weddings 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.850
 When it was kind of obvious what it started oh ... but I was told one 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.040
 She actually ended up dying the bride 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.499
 Heart attack 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:18.189
 At the wedding after knowing that he was not a direct party in Bronco 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:25.189
 Riding looked like a complete nightmare for our video explaining why 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.140
 How a disaster for you that parents if you want to 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.130
 And for anyone who seldom has the best of their lives in fact I do not think anyone has 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.489
 to 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.049
 There is a wedding ceremony that is the best in their personal lives to do it now and I am not 

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:53.950
 In exaggeration I will have joined a lot of fly address costing a lot of money 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:54.680
 Rude 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.219
 I mean you have all this opment 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.650
 Stands 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.330
 It's like a rumor that it's not even people like any I've seen 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.560
 For sock the mind years and sometimes they are in Philly and everyone gets on 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.900
 There 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.520
 As displeased with the time and days there 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.870
 Danels was excluded from what was the place to be fun 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.750
 That fight if you see that there is one man who say their best day 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.280
 Of their lives was the wedding 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.300
 Perhaps you are far away now that of course that would 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.479
 There are some women who have absolutely known adult orgasm but are not 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.650
 Good for us, not only 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.570
 One person was a dozen moving around saving lives and saying more and more 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.789
 Those when they need to find something better at the time and 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.289
 Blowing the air for really about one day will be the best day of your life 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.910
 Without the day you take off for your honeymoon too 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.970
 That would be better than having to deal with all this 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.670
 Nonsense is a good day for your kids earlier than the Kaitlin board but that's true 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.639
 But this is true 

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:58.719
 Such a much more important than 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.250
 This is as trivial 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.830
 The invention that you have to impress everyone with Yes alone, but I am 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.690
 Craig review because the whole people admire thinking 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:08.950
 It really bothers me 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.470
 So I'm actually with you on your thank you anyway anyway this one 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.040
 Have left a bit more disasters and you are one 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.079
 Death was not for the uncomplicated and of course shaking shook 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.609
 He went outside and suffered a heart attack and was all related to this could be 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:28.619
 What could be that it could also be but you know that ever in to 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:29.599
 that 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.699
 Tell you it's kind of fun 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:35.559
 You pick them up in Tibet and sweating his sweater that they want to tell you guys at Philly 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:37.359
 They go to work on each other 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:38.789
 No dysentery 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:42.149
 That this is uh ... and that he is not one of the guys that brother 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:46.379
 Groom's contracts both cops and people want and police brutality is that they are 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.529
 goes away 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:50.480
 They had to call back several times that they could not control 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.010
 Clinton is your people that almost 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.709
 They are out of control and we look at how to get the constitution to guide 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.540
 Wheelchair and so on however 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.239
 This is the man in which the men were 100 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.629
 Uh ... Drug attack in South Delhi after every issue of eight Acrobats 5 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.399
 Eight of the fact that it was in South Philly and that they are not all the time is 

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:11.459
 But so well 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.430
 And so I think that is why they have once 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.909
 If I like the cops so it's enough 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.690
 Its categorization of peace in the East is absolute enough 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.360
 This is the allies did not have to use in
