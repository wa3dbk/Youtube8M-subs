 We were also quiet in the ninth grade 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.000
 There was also a threat that an amok 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.970

 Did not want to know what was going on there 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.780
 the whole school was run by the police 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.880
 surrounded and there were so many 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.680
