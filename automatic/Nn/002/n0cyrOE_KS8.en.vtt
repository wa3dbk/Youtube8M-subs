the problem with the hybrid it's very

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.040 
the problem with the hybrid it's very
similar<00:04:29.550> to<00:04:29.670> the<00:04:29.760> v6<00:04:30.270> and<00:04:30.510> yes<00:04:30.780> it<00:04:30.960> gets

similar to the v6 and yes it gets

similar to the v6 and yes it gets
slightly<00:04:31.320> better<00:04:31.590> fuel<00:04:31.890> economy<00:04:31.980> but<00:04:32.580> it's

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
slightly better fuel economy but it's

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.790 
slightly better fuel economy but it's
also<00:04:32.910> more<00:04:33.300> expensive<00:04:33.600> and<00:04:34.230> has<00:04:34.530> a<00:04:34.560> more
