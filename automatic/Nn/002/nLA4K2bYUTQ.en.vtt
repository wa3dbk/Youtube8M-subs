00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.820
 hello to the dofus players i am 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.430
 joan pride the server soul and in this 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:16.420
 I'm going to teach you how to get an ace 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:18.320
 critical damage then for this we go 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:23.710
 to need 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:26.410
 koala belts that I have here 20 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.579
 and here is the recipe a hair of choose 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:34.019
 the reineta one of koala coconut one of 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:38.140
 koala kindi ccoo and one of wind color 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:40.300
 a drake alak skin and a skin of 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.879
 koala and mature 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.879
 well this can spoil 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.340
 the hairs from which we can hit them 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.390
 in the wild canyon area 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.280
 to the surroundings of the tranqui dungeon 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.430
 trunk 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.040
 well they are not so complicated of European and 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.330
 the other is 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.710
 the skin of 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.710
 dzeko alak immature 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.159
 well there are two areas to mop the 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.580
 Koalas mountain in the lakes 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.290
 enchanted and the forest the warm what 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.620
 most recommendable is in forest the 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.390
 adepts since the maps are more more 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.660
 stuck and they kill the mod 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.310
 the fastest mavs for this should 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.450
 have a good group with good protection 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.130
 because that's a bit difficult to European 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.920
 so well let's break the 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.299
 belts 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.299
 to see how many do not come out 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.450
 and I'm also preparing the 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.320
 next video that is runes of years 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.610
 to all the elements 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.800
 including neutral that are the most 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.360
 difficult to achieve in itself and are 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.850
 the masks 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.880
 so good in this video I love you 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.530
 send a greeting to dark got that 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:15.190
 he asked me to send him a greeting and 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.459
 to the player or blacks that yesterday also 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.110
 he was asking me to send him greetings 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.100
 in the next video then a greeting 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.500
 for them 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.630
 and well now I'm going to break the 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.630
 fragments can see that I do not have runes 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:40.459
 they came out 69 critical years of one and ten 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.870
 of three critical years that's nothing 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.519
 wrong 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.000
 and then let's look at how they are in 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.000
 the flea market 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.250
 good one's runes are in 44 thousand 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.670
 Beds 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.670
 that would be more than 2,400,000 beds per 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.610
 this and best of all is that he managed to stand 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:07.330
 in less than a day everything and the 10 of 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.350
 critical damage good one is at 89 thousand 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.900
 cameras 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.980
 I guess 850 thousand beds more or less 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.500
 10 for only 20 belts 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.260
 that this is a very good thing but 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.410
 I repeat that the drop of 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:28.830
 the tissues 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:30.810
 forgiveness tissues of which here mature and 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.310
 that's why he told them they have to go 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.130
 lead a group with good prospection 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.740
 to appropriate us then this is all 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:41.960
 for this video I hope it serves you 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.960
 a lot for your runes and see you later
