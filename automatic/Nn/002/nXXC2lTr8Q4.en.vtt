00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
sometimes of someone that the box is at

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.490 
sometimes of someone that the box is at
the<00:01:56.179> very<00:01:56.330> other<00:01:56.509> side<00:01:56.780> of<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.929> matter<00:01:57.140> won't

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
the very other side of the matter won't

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.580 
the very other side of the matter won't
this<00:01:58.399> is<00:01:58.520> very<00:01:58.640> smart<00:01:58.940> move<00:01:59.179> to<00:01:59.210> use<00:01:59.560> so<00:02:00.560> that

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
this is very smart move to use so that

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.859 
this is very smart move to use so that
you<00:02:01.100> don't<00:02:01.310> get<00:02:01.610> spotted<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.240> rage<00:02:02.450> quit<00:02:02.720> like

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
you don't get spotted and rage quit like

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.630 
you don't get spotted and rage quit like
I<00:02:02.990> usually<00:02:03.170> end<00:02:03.350> up<00:02:03.590> doing<00:02:03.920> then<00:02:04.429> you<00:02:04.520> go

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
I usually end up doing then you go

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.460 
I usually end up doing then you go
through<00:02:04.670> here<00:02:05.149> check<00:02:05.569> the<00:02:05.750> alley<00:02:05.929> make<00:02:06.380> sure

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
through here check the alley make sure

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.130 
through here check the alley make sure
there's<00:02:06.649> no<00:02:06.770> straight<00:02:07.190> analyzing<00:02:08.050> check<00:02:09.050> it

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
there's no straight analyzing check it

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.229 
there's no straight analyzing check it
twice<00:02:09.289> because<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:09.830> didn't<00:02:10.069> I<00:02:10.220> don't<00:02:10.489> know<00:02:10.580> what

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
twice because I didn't I don't know what

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.290 
twice because I didn't I don't know what
just<00:02:11.269> happened<00:02:12.130> alright<00:02:13.130> this<00:02:13.430> background

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
just happened alright this background

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.449 
just happened alright this background
lag<00:02:14.930> completely<00:02:15.470> basically<00:02:15.920> what<00:02:16.040> I<00:02:16.100> did<00:02:16.160> here
