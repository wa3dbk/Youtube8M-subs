00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.650
 really seen big price losses 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.290
 this is after luis suarez from 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.230

 yesterday he was still 90 miles how 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.250
 I speak you it is May 30, so 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.269
 this player weighs a lot for me I 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.709
 advise you if you want to buy it 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:20.680
 it 's waiting for years I think half 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.880
 mid June it will not be he will fall back and after 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.880
 he will go back normal I think 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.290
 yeah not bad so I think about the 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.420
 video we will put for the month of June 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.870

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:38.340
 after the party 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:41.270

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.550
 good player too so what player does it 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.959
 how do you explain that it ended 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.550
 they do not drop much but a time 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.500
 when we see his stats on the map 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.270
 it's normal 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.600
 yeah I think he wants 40000 you 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.069

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.580
 nani I bought the other 20000 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.830
 times I thought the price you can 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.130
 buy it it is resold 25000 so a 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.980
 small benefit anyway yes it's not 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.470

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.150
 am at this stage shots are not to 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.350
 gays it is necessary to persevere there if 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.229
 you see who did not arrive before 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.820
 you put put back term and rbb and must 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.700
 not hesitate to put these things back in 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.120
 to sell 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.440
 an hour the boosts not but the honor 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.640
 do not hesitate to submit your 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.200
 players on sale when we saw that they 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.550
 leave it maybe a few times 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.680
 lowered the desired price his share really 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.540
 it will not end 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.950
 but you always have to put your players 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.760
 on sale convoy that his share spent big 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.680
 players in any case after so joe hart 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.980
 you can find it with 4 tbsp 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.610
 14000 I think him widely and the 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.910
 sell 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.340
 not resell 2:14 p.m. oil and I think 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:56.450
 me in the hunt and 12000 that this is 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:59.510
 not a very big profit is worth him the 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.580
 worst it is him company 70000 at the beginning 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.100
 of the game is not even going there now 25000 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.900
