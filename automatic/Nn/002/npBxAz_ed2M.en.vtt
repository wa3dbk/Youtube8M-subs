g'day and welcome to take math Channel

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.889 
g'day and welcome to take math Channel
what<00:00:03.030> we're<00:00:03.120> going<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.270> be<00:00:03.360> having<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.659> look<00:00:03.750> at

what we're going to be having a look at
in<00:00:03.990> this<00:00:04.110> video<00:00:04.980> is<00:00:05.190> how<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.430> mentally<00:00:05.970> add

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
in this video is how to mentally add

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.030 
in this video is how to mentally add
numbers<00:00:06.720> together<00:00:06.899> okay<00:00:07.379> these<00:00:07.529> are<00:00:07.710> larger

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
numbers together okay these are larger

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.180 
numbers together okay these are larger
numbers<00:00:08.370> now<00:00:08.519> so<00:00:09.710> we've<00:00:10.710> been<00:00:10.860> looking<00:00:11.160> at

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
numbers now so we've been looking at

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.499 
numbers now so we've been looking at
these<00:00:11.309> in<00:00:11.460> previous<00:00:11.610> videos<00:00:12.090> we're<00:00:12.269> looking

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
these in previous videos we're looking

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.940 
these in previous videos we're looking
at<00:00:12.570> how<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.780> do<00:00:13.019> these<00:00:13.200> using<00:00:13.740> our

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
at how to do these using our

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.160 
at how to do these using our
complimentary<00:00:14.700> numbers<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.599> special<00:00:16.049> way

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
complimentary numbers and a special way

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.410 
complimentary numbers and a special way
of<00:00:16.199> adding<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:16.859> uses<00:00:17.640> little<00:00:17.820> techniques<00:00:18.270> if

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
of adding so uses little techniques if

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.820 
of adding so uses little techniques if
you<00:00:18.539> can<00:00:18.690> remember<00:00:18.869> how<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.080> do<00:00:19.289> them<00:00:19.470> but<00:00:19.680> now

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
you can remember how to do them but now

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.490 
you can remember how to do them but now
try<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.160> apply<00:00:20.550> them<00:00:20.960> adding<00:00:21.960> these<00:00:22.199> three

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
try to apply them adding these three

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.910 
try to apply them adding these three
numbers<00:00:22.619> you've<00:00:22.859> got<00:00:22.949> five<00:00:23.160> seconds<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:24.920> how

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
numbers you've got five seconds so how

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.679 
numbers you've got five seconds so how
did<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.220> go<00:00:26.369> with<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.730> already<00:00:27.300> that's<00:00:27.480> why

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
to have a look at how you might add

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.260 
to have a look at how you might add
these<00:00:37.590> together<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:38.730> does<00:00:39.000> take<00:00:39.239> a

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
these together and this does take a

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.970 
these together and this does take a
little<00:00:39.450> bit<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.719> practice<00:00:39.840> maybe<00:00:40.680> five

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
little bit of practice maybe five

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.619 
little bit of practice maybe five
seconds<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> little<00:00:41.820> bit<00:00:41.910> ambitious<00:00:42.270> maybe

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
seconds is a little bit ambitious maybe

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.540 
seconds is a little bit ambitious maybe
where<00:00:42.930> we're<00:00:43.410> looking<00:00:43.680> at<00:00:43.770> seven<00:00:44.129> seconds

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
where we're looking at seven seconds

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.029 
where we're looking at seven seconds
here<00:00:44.670> okay<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.379> maybe<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.559> I'm<00:00:46.680> going<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.860> show

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
here okay so maybe so I'm going to show

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.920 
here okay so maybe so I'm going to show
you<00:00:47.100> how<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.670> little<00:00:47.789> trick<00:00:48.390> for<00:00:48.539> adding<00:00:48.809> these

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
you how a little trick for adding these

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.720 
you how a little trick for adding these
together<00:00:49.140> now<00:00:49.530> last<00:00:49.829> video<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.340> were<00:00:50.430> having<00:00:50.670> a

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
together now last video we were having a

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.639 
together now last video we were having a
look<00:00:50.820> at<00:00:50.969> these<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.870> will<00:00:51.989> look<00:00:52.170> at<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.440> idea

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
look at these we will look at this idea

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.860 
look at these we will look at this idea
of<00:00:53.010> complementary<00:00:53.879> numbers<00:00:54.239> okay<00:00:54.539> these<00:00:54.690> are

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
of complementary numbers okay these are

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.220 
of complementary numbers okay these are
numbers<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.230> add<00:00:55.469> up<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.620> ten<00:00:55.890> one<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.730> nine

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
numbers that add up to ten one and nine

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.910 
numbers that add up to ten one and nine
two<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.620> eight<00:00:59.030> three<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.420> seven<00:01:00.719> four<00:01:01.500> and

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
two and eight three and seven four and

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.280 
two and eight three and seven four and
six<00:01:02.460> five<00:01:03.329> four<00:01:03.570> five<00:01:03.780> we're<00:01:04.049> going<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.229> be

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
six five four five we're going to be

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.469 
six five four five we're going to be
looking<00:01:04.500> for<00:01:04.890> these<00:01:05.010> once<00:01:05.369> again<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:06.030> try<00:01:06.299> and

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
looking for these once again to try and

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.510 
looking for these once again to try and
add<00:01:06.630> our<00:01:06.990> numbers<00:01:07.290> together<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.860> lot<00:01:08.189> easier

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
add our numbers together a lot easier

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.700 
add our numbers together a lot easier
well<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.090> meet<00:01:09.270> once<00:01:09.600> again<00:01:09.720> adding<00:01:10.170> from

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
well so you meet once again adding from

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.600 
well so you meet once again adding from
left<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.100> right

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
left to right

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.240 
left to right
okay<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.840> if<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.680> haven't<00:01:13.860> seen<00:01:14.130> those

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
okay so if you haven't seen those

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.580 
okay so if you haven't seen those
previous<00:01:14.729> videos<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.509> we'll<00:01:15.780> look<00:01:15.930> if<00:01:16.200> yeah

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
previous videos and we'll look if yeah

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.230 
previous videos and we'll look if yeah
you'll<00:01:16.830> probably<00:01:16.860> be<00:01:17.220> able<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.369> catch<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.729> up<00:01:17.850> I

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
you'll probably be able to catch it up I

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.600 
you'll probably be able to catch it up I
must<00:01:18.479> say<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.500> I'm<00:01:19.890> going<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.100> start<00:01:20.310> at<00:01:20.430> some

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
must say so I'm going to start at some

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.600 
must say so I'm going to start at some
easy<00:01:20.729> examples<00:01:21.360> one<00:01:21.869> here<00:01:22.080> we<00:01:22.140> go<00:01:23.090> 487<00:01:24.090> plus

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
easy examples one here we go 487 plus

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.340 
easy examples one here we go 487 plus
539<00:01:26.610> they<00:01:26.790> want<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.030> recommend<00:01:27.270> here<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.930> pause

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
539 they want to recommend here is pause

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.679 
539 they want to recommend here is pause
them<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.890> first<00:01:29.790> off<00:01:29.939> we're<00:01:30.060> headed<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.540> but

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
them and first off we're headed on but

them and first off we're headed on but
the<00:01:30.810> later<00:01:31.049> ones<00:01:31.320> pause<00:01:31.619> them<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.159> give<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.670> a

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
the later ones pause them and give it a

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:33.980 
the later ones pause them and give it a
go<00:01:32.909> doing<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.210> yourself<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.630> what<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:33.900> were

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
go doing it yourself so what we were

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.440 
go doing it yourself so what we were
doing<00:01:34.020> with<00:01:34.350> these<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.710> we're<00:01:35.490> adding<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.970> left

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
doing with these is we're adding it left

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.819 
doing with these is we're adding it left
or<00:01:36.630> right<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.869> going<00:01:37.049> as<00:01:37.170> follows<00:01:37.530> four

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
or right and going as follows four

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.940 
or right and going as follows four

honorable for these complementary

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.289 
honorable for these complementary
dummies<00:03:08.310> okay<00:03:09.310> what<00:03:09.549> about<00:03:09.640> we<00:03:09.880> go<00:03:10.000> another

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
dummies okay what about we go another

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:17.250 
dummies okay what about we go another
one<00:03:10.450> what<00:03:10.750> about<00:03:11.549> 597<00:03:12.549> and<00:03:13.530> 407<00:03:15.150> okay<00:03:16.150> so<00:03:17.049> let's

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
one what about 597 and 407 okay so let's

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.680 
one what about 597 and 407 okay so let's
start<00:03:17.500> adding<00:03:17.650> this<00:03:17.890> together<00:03:18.480> or<00:03:19.480> is<00:03:19.600> it

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
start adding this together or is it

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.810 
start adding this together or is it
first<00:03:19.930> maybe<00:03:20.170> five<00:03:20.799> hundred<00:03:20.829> nine<00:03:21.790> hundred

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
first maybe five hundred nine hundred

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.789 
first maybe five hundred nine hundred
nine<00:03:22.480> hundred<00:03:22.900> ninety<00:03:23.500> nine<00:03:23.530> hundred

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
nine hundred ninety nine hundred

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.930 
nine hundred ninety nine hundred
ninety-seven<00:03:25.170> 1004<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:27.340> I<00:03:27.459> reckon<00:03:27.790> this<00:03:27.910> is

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
ninety-seven 1004 and I reckon this is

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.759 
ninety-seven 1004 and I reckon this is
actually<00:03:28.480> a<00:03:28.510> lot<00:03:28.780> more<00:03:28.810> accurate<00:03:29.530> way<00:03:29.650> of

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
actually a lot more accurate way of

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:30.960 
actually a lot more accurate way of
doing<00:03:29.980> because<00:03:30.069> you're<00:03:30.220> not<00:03:30.340> trying<00:03:30.549> to<00:03:30.730> carry

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
doing because you're not trying to carry

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.300 
doing because you're not trying to carry
numbers<00:03:31.420> backwards<00:03:32.260> then<00:03:32.950> you're<00:03:33.190> actually

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
numbers backwards then you're actually

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.350 
numbers backwards then you're actually
you

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
you

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.640 
you
making<00:03:34.600> them<00:03:34.750> so<00:03:34.960> I<00:03:34.990> think<00:03:35.140> it's<00:03:35.320> a<00:03:35.410> lot<00:03:35.590> more

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
making them so I think it's a lot more

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.020 
making them so I think it's a lot more
an<00:03:36.250> accurate<00:03:36.850> method<00:03:37.770> okay<00:03:38.770> they<00:03:39.640> give<00:03:39.850> a<00:03:39.880> no

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
an accurate method okay they give a no

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.280 
an accurate method okay they give a no
probably<00:03:40.270> get<00:03:40.450> one<00:03:40.600> wrong<00:03:40.780> now<00:03:40.960> and<00:03:41.140> then<00:03:41.230> I
