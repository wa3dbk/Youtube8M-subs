 I always do not go net exceptionally 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.949
 but a tutorial 

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:11.289
 as always 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:16.240
 they hit his own now go make or create yes 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:20.980
 Here I have it is dissolved what you need some 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.810
 recording program 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.580
 here in parentheses always 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.520
 the example so I can Threats and a Reiner program then namely 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.839
 Taseer's trios 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:35.129
 and a game so for Swiss Re 1 and I take my place today as times 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:36.760
 example 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.110
 that's how we start 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.110
 that goes in Freetz 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.710
 and 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.670
 so when i 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.200
 you land her round 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.430
 then he clicks on movies 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.560
 and then look for excuse memory 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.560
 I'll take it now 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.060
 around 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.180
 I just look 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.700

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.080
 Tutorial 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.080
 then you click on rookie and then you have saved that device 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.900
 I can also show you a normal structure 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.500
 Zheng not 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.530
 this better structured 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.170
 for example, before he does it 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.870
 ultimately, here 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.310
 if I go to the room game Tomb Raider at the election 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.200
 the lines 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.200
 every day to be recorded on pa two stop 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.920
 in the case now 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.910
 and yes, and then I'll do it 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.570
 produces that are clear 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.410
 by her after another, I can safely save ten 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.020
 I call it "my Kleist" 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.250

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.250
 around 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.840
 then that will be done 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.610
 instead of the Dior is playing 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.630

 Daniel 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.829

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.869
 Yes here 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:28.799
 if he goes sounds of three years 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.759

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.429
 Sio that has gone now 

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:42.919
 and then I just go Online Krafts 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.359
 and press the buttons 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:46.449
 and then 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:49.529
 she's so interested 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:51.129
 just like that here 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.789
 rumkommen 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:55.959
 and then I push the keys again 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.959
 and last attempt, well, it does not matter 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:02.619

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:04.859
 Open Dietrich finished 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.029
 I can shoot my luck 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:11.029
 I go to the folder 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:14.589
 "Wulff tu's saved 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.659
 Meinke shipyard 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.609
 Happy on taken party 1 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.119
 and there I have that 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:26.359
 so 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.709
 public that margins program 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.709
 Camtasia Studio out of the public domain 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.049
 the eleven with that 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.049
 which goes on to place media 

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:41.869
 then you go up 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:43.749
 your saved lords 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:46.809
 who saved it 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:47.959
 to open 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.959
 then it's all over here in Italy 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:55.399
 and I always take 

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:56.979
 YouTube added 

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:59.979
 so here 

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:03.759
 his case with Dahlen 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:06.709
 really peaceful 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.709
 then I go to &amp; produce cie and pass it on 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.839
 and go to Hardy 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:14.409
 continue 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.400
 then submit 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.289
 there 4 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.809
 now it comes out producing it 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:24.340
 in the game 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.960
 that's another cheek added year 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.140
 Third store I included wines 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.460
 and then when I produce speakers is here one 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.099
 and I do not do 2 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:35.680
 my Kreft 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.249
 letzes 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:38.879
 clover 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.629
 pi 1 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:44.319
 and subfolders could make or not make that makes sense 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:45.349
 complete 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.999
 and so project is changed 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:50.779
 then we wait one hundred percent off 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:53.779
 he closes the windows that really need 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.080
 so 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.749
 now the Scots are 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:05.749
 at 50 percent 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:16.210
 18 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.210
 come on 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.589
 finished changed 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:26.479
 then he has the file through then her guest shoots the Schweicher food 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.699
 you can do it here if you want 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:31.400
 where do you go? 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.710
 yes, I do not have to show that anymore 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.710
 I just do it 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.870
 how does on YouTube 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.159
 her bad luck one I already have 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:53.159
 Euro lay 

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:59.229
 here four months 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:01.809
 Dahlen 

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:04.469
 Smith's court 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:06.059
 on 

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:08.219
 the epi produced 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:11.319
 Pauline's Michal Kadlec once said so is the minister 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.990
 from now on will be started 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.520
 No 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.400
 Well, well, change that now 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.400
 and then 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.699
 after the name 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:24.460
 descriptions 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.199
 Offender is 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:27.589
 category 

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:30.589
 and so he underlined that of course stops 

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:35.279
 yes and so he easily made his own play now 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:39.789
 Thanks for watching if you have any questions 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:41.550
