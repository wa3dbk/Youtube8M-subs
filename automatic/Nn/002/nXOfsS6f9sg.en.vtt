00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
my new kit goes with me job like this

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.290 
my new kit goes with me job like this
for<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.100> spring<00:00:38.809> and<00:00:39.809> comes<00:00:40.320> with<00:00:40.379> these<00:00:40.559> uh

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
for the spring and comes with these uh

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.860 
for the spring and comes with these uh
plastic<00:00:42.300> bushings<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:44.450> you<00:00:45.450> basically<00:00:45.750> just

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
plastic bushings so you basically just

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.380 
plastic bushings so you basically just
back<00:00:46.170> off<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.590> screw<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.340> old<00:00:47.850> visor<00:00:48.379> and

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
back off the screw in the old visor and

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:59.000 
back off the screw in the old visor and
that<00:00:51.390> piece<00:00:51.629> kind<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:52.079> pulls<00:00:52.440> out<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.710> there

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.500 

Oh

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.160 

pretty<00:01:02.079> easy<00:01:02.199> to<00:01:02.379> sex<00:01:02.710> all

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.590 

it<00:01:05.590> seemed<00:01:05.800> pretty<00:01:06.190> loose<00:01:06.460> this<00:01:06.790> way<00:01:07.030> it's

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
it seemed pretty loose this way it's

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.240 
it seemed pretty loose this way it's
interesting<00:01:08.200> to<00:01:08.500> see<00:01:08.650> how<00:01:08.680> to<00:01:08.800> do<00:01:08.950> once<00:01:09.130> more

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
interesting to see how to do once more

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.149 
interesting to see how to do once more
equality<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:11.110> there's<00:01:11.290> the<00:01:11.409> plastic<00:01:11.830> pushing

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
equality so there's the plastic pushing

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.359 
equality so there's the plastic pushing
you<00:01:12.250> can<00:01:12.370> actually<00:01:12.610> see<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:14.369> summarizer

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
you can actually see the summarizer

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.359 
you can actually see the summarizer

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
to be turning and that was probably part

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.910 
to be turning and that was probably part
of<00:02:45.840> my<00:02:45.900> problem<00:02:46.290> with<00:02:46.410> not<00:02:46.590> getting<00:02:46.860> those

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.820 
things to stay up the way I wanted and
the<00:02:50.130> new<00:02:50.220> ones<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.550> found<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.970> actually<00:02:51.180> had<00:02:51.510> to

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
the new ones I found I actually had to

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.500 
the new ones I found I actually had to
sand<00:02:52.830> around<00:02:53.340> here<00:02:53.670> because<00:02:54.060> they<00:02:54.150> were<00:02:54.209> so

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
sand around here because they were so

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.990 
sand around here because they were so
smooth<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:55.530> no<00:02:55.739> matter<00:02:55.860> how<00:02:56.040> hard<00:02:56.459> I<00:02:56.640> cranked

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
smooth that no matter how hard I cranked

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.300 
smooth that no matter how hard I cranked
