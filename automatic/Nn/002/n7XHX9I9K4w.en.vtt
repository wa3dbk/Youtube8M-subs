I<00:03:45.090> mean<00:03:45.630> what<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:45.810> brilliant<00:03:46.290> recipe<00:03:47.130> for<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.370> car

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
I mean what a brilliant recipe for a car

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.390 
I mean what a brilliant recipe for a car
and<00:03:47.940> no<00:03:48.120> wonder<00:03:48.510> that<00:03:48.630> since<00:03:49.020> in<00:03:49.590> e20<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:50.190> five

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
and no wonder that since in e20 and five

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.940 
and no wonder that since in e20 and five
so<00:03:51.120> many<00:03:51.330> people<00:03:51.690> have<00:03:51.959> tried<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.170> copy<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.709> I

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
so many people have tried to copy it I

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.729 
so many people have tried to copy it I
don't<00:03:53.730> think<00:03:53.790> anyone's<00:03:54.360> ever<00:03:55.050> build<00:03:55.380> a<00:03:55.500> car

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
don't think anyone's ever build a car

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:02.949 
don't think anyone's ever build a car
like<00:03:55.920> this<00:03:56.099> since<00:03:56.400> I<00:03:56.730> include<00:03:57.510> BMW<00:03:58.080> with<00:03:58.200> them

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.210 

one<00:04:03.959> of<00:04:04.050> the<00:04:04.110> things<00:04:04.260> I<00:04:04.349> absolutely<00:04:04.800> love

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
one of the things I absolutely love

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.920 
one of the things I absolutely love
about<00:04:05.250> this<00:04:05.640> car<00:04:05.849> is<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.000> old<00:04:06.239> fashioned<00:04:06.720> feel

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
about this car is the old fashioned feel

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.020 
about this car is the old fashioned feel
of<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.170> controls<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.980> do<00:04:08.459> think<00:04:08.790> they<00:04:08.880> can

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
of the controls I do think they can

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.589 
of the controls I do think they can

are<00:04:32.520> they<00:04:32.669> only<00:04:32.850> so<00:04:33.240> you<00:04:33.300> do<00:04:33.450> have<00:04:33.479> to<00:04:33.720> rev<00:04:33.870> it

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
are they only so you do have to rev it

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.659 
are they only so you do have to rev it
out<00:04:34.110> but<00:04:34.290> that<00:04:34.380> doesn't<00:04:34.410> mean<00:04:34.740> you've<00:04:35.490> got<00:04:35.580> to

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
out but that doesn't mean you've got to

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:41.080 
out but that doesn't mean you've got to
use<00:04:35.820> this<00:04:36.030> engine

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.900

red line six and a half thousand goes to

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.100 
red line six and a half thousand goes to
a<00:04:43.940> bit<00:04:44.060> further<00:04:44.300> than<00:04:44.480> that<00:04:44.570> if<00:04:44.720> you<00:04:44.810> want<00:04:45.020> to

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
a bit further than that if you want to

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.700 
a bit further than that if you want to
and<00:04:45.440> it<00:04:45.560> rewards<00:04:45.980> every<00:04:46.130> last<00:04:47.120> breath<00:04:47.960> it<00:04:48.440> just

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
and it rewards every last breath it just

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.110 
and it rewards every last breath it just
sounds<00:04:49.070> fantastic

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
sounds fantastic

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.030

you've<00:04:54.620> left<00:04:54.860> the<00:04:55.040> throttle<00:04:55.460> but<00:04:55.639> it's<00:04:56.360> just<00:04:56.510> a

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
you've left the throttle but it's just a

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.970 
you've left the throttle but it's just a

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
this motor quite a bit heavier I drove

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.129 
this motor quite a bit heavier I drove
one<00:05:10.730> recently<00:05:11.180> and<00:05:11.389> I<00:05:11.510> was<00:05:11.630> really

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
one recently and I was really

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:13.750 
one recently and I was really
disappointed<00:05:12.320> at<00:05:12.830> how<00:05:12.860> slow<00:05:13.250> it<00:05:13.400> felt<00:05:13.610> when

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
disappointed at how slow it felt when

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.730
