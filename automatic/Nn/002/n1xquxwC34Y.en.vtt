00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
one sort of this is a rhombic

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.780 
one sort of this is a rhombic
dodecahedron<00:00:10.980> I've<00:00:11.160> shown<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.519> this<00:00:11.730> before

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
dodecahedron I've shown you this before

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.820 
dodecahedron I've shown you this before
I<00:00:12.360> mean<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.750> could<00:00:13.019> show<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.259> again<00:00:13.559> with<00:00:13.799> a

I mean I could show you again with a
little<00:00:14.130> bit<00:00:14.809> slightly<00:00:15.809> different<00:00:17.570> technique

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
little bit slightly different technique

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.640 
little bit slightly different technique
okay

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650

very<00:00:20.130> slight<00:00:20.490> okay<00:00:20.820> two<00:00:21.029> balloons<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.660> don't

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
very slight okay two balloons you don't

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.540 
very slight okay two balloons you don't
fill<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.350> up<00:00:22.410> all<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.650> way<00:00:22.740> because<00:00:23.070> we're

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
fill it up all the way because we're

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.250 
fill it up all the way because we're
gonna<00:00:23.670> trim<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.029> at<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.300> end<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:24.810> we<00:00:24.960> start

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
gonna trim it at the end and so we start

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.589 
gonna trim it at the end and so we start
with<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.410> balloon<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.859> we<00:00:25.920> make<00:00:26.070> five<00:00:26.369> okay<00:00:26.880> so

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
with a balloon and we make five okay so

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:38.270 
with a balloon and we make five okay so
one<00:00:35.480> five<00:00:36.480> almost<00:00:37.050> spherical<00:00:37.170> bubbles<00:00:37.800> and

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
one five almost spherical bubbles and

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.490 
one five almost spherical bubbles and
then<00:00:38.399> we<00:00:38.520> bring<00:00:38.700> your<00:00:38.850> other<00:00:38.969> balloon<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.500> and

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
then we bring your other balloon in and

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:58.029 
then we bring your other balloon in and
then<00:00:40.680> we<00:00:40.770> make<00:00:40.920> another<00:00:40.950> five<00:00:44.989> is<00:00:47.239> connected

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.160 

off<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.280> going<00:00:59.460> like<00:00:59.579> this<00:00:59.730> two<00:01:00.629> ends<00:01:00.840> sticking

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
off to going like this two ends sticking

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.640 
off to going like this two ends sticking
out<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.800> now<00:01:01.949> flip<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.000> over<00:01:03.090> like<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.650> you

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
out so now flip it over like this you

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:14.899 
out so now flip it over like this you
make<00:01:04.830> two<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.159> each<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.820> these<00:01:06.409> one<00:01:07.409> two<00:01:13.909> and

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
make two of each of these one two and

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.660 
make two of each of these one two and
then<00:01:15.240> like<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.380> now<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.040> then<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.340> continue

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
then like that now and then you continue

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.980 
then like that now and then you continue
down<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.659> need<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.840> square<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:20.100> white<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:21.780> then

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
down you need a square of white and then

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.880 
down you need a square of white and then
you<00:01:22.080> make<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.439> square<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:23.040> half<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:24.890> leave

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
you make a square of half and I leave

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.280 
you make a square of half and I leave
that<00:01:26.100> alone<00:01:26.189> for<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.700> minute<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.960> then<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.170> do

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
that alone for a minute and then you do

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.760 
that alone for a minute and then you do
this<00:01:28.880> you<00:01:29.880> make<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> square<00:01:30.360> purple<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:33.770> we

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
this you make a square purple one we

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.880 
this you make a square purple one we
make<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> square<00:01:36.680> here

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
make a square here

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.560 
make a square here
okay<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.880> then<00:01:41.000> you<00:01:41.090> just<00:01:41.120> keep<00:01:41.390> continuing

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
okay and then you just keep continuing

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.510 
okay and then you just keep continuing
we<00:01:42.140> make<00:01:42.350> three<00:01:42.650> bubbles<00:01:42.980> this<00:01:43.130> time<00:01:43.340> one<00:01:45.520> so

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
we make three bubbles this time one so

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.830 
we make three bubbles this time one so
you<00:01:46.610> try<00:01:46.790> keeping<00:01:47.060> these<00:01:47.180> spherical<00:01:47.510> as<00:01:47.720> you

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
you try keeping these spherical as you

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.420 
you try keeping these spherical as you
can

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
can

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.370 
can
and<00:01:49.430> now<00:01:49.760> here's<00:01:50.300> what<00:01:50.570> I<00:01:50.600> don't<00:01:50.870> like

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
and now here's what I don't like

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.300 
and now here's what I don't like
you<00:01:51.860> pull<00:01:53.290> the<00:01:54.290> balloon<00:01:54.440> through<00:01:55.040> the

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
you pull the balloon through the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:07.960 
you pull the balloon through the
original<00:01:55.550> purple<00:01:56.210> square<00:02:05.830> okay<00:02:06.830> so<00:02:06.980> three<00:02:07.430> and

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
original purple square okay so three and

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.370 
original purple square okay so three and
through<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:08.390> original<00:02:08.780> square<00:02:08.990> you<00:02:09.170> got<00:02:09.320> to

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
through the original square you got to

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.140 
through the original square you got to
do<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.530> same<00:02:09.770> thing<00:02:10.070> for<00:02:10.460> the<00:02:10.610> white<00:02:10.790> one<00:02:10.940> now

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150

bubbles and now it's just a matter of

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.710 
bubbles and now it's just a matter of
finishing<00:02:45.650> it<00:02:45.860> off<00:02:45.950> so<00:02:46.220> we<00:02:46.310> go<00:02:46.430> one<00:02:46.700> we<00:02:47.390> pull<00:02:47.630> it

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
what I do is I need a bubble and that is

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.850 
what I do is I need a bubble and that is
when<00:02:56.150> I<00:02:56.209> go<00:02:56.360> to<00:02:56.540> this<00:02:56.660> part<00:02:59.170> and<00:03:00.170> then<00:03:00.290> I<00:03:00.440> let

when I go to this part and then I let

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.020 
when I go to this part and then I let
off<00:03:00.980> a<00:03:01.010> little<00:03:01.190> bit<00:03:01.340> here<00:03:03.670> make<00:03:04.670> sure<00:03:04.700> that

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
off a little bit here make sure that

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:13.790 
off a little bit here make sure that
that<00:03:06.040> can<00:03:07.040> i<00:03:07.130> push<00:03:07.549> that<00:03:07.760> inside

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.380 

okay

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
okay

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:32.340 
okay
one<00:03:30.300> minute<00:03:31.300> that's<00:03:31.390> hot<00:03:31.720> pockets<00:03:32.140> with<00:03:32.260> no

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
one minute that's hot pockets with no

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:47.100 
one minute that's hot pockets with no
teeth<00:03:32.560> no<00:03:35.100> pressure<00:03:36.300> tire<00:03:45.600> potentially<00:03:46.600> there

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
teeth no pressure tire potentially there

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.950 
teeth no pressure tire potentially there
you<00:03:47.290> have<00:03:47.500> it<00:03:47.680> now<00:03:47.830> if<00:03:48.220> you<00:03:48.310> look<00:03:48.520> closely<00:03:48.960> what

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
you have it now if you look closely what

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.630 
you have it now if you look closely what
we<00:03:50.110> have<00:03:50.320> is<00:03:52.110> three<00:03:53.110> sets<00:03:53.470> or<00:03:53.920> now<00:03:54.130> four<00:03:54.400> sets

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
we have is three sets or now four sets

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.370 
we have is three sets or now four sets
of<00:03:54.820> three<00:03:55.420> balloons<00:03:55.720> white<00:03:56.170> and<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:59.170> same

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
of three balloons white and the same

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.830 
of three balloons white and the same
with<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.650> purple<00:03:59.800> here<00:04:00.270> so<00:04:01.270> it<00:04:01.360> makes<00:04:01.480> it<00:04:01.660> kind

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
with the purple here so it makes it kind

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.200 
with the purple here so it makes it kind
of<00:04:01.870> a<00:04:01.960> nice<00:04:02.110> compact<00:04:02.710> structure<00:04:03.340> and<00:04:04.120> of

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
of a nice compact structure and of

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.120 
of a nice compact structure and of
course<00:04:04.420> if<00:04:04.540> you<00:04:04.630> want<00:04:04.840> to<00:04:04.930> have<00:04:05.050> it<00:04:05.200> more<00:04:05.530> like

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
course if you want to have it more like

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.190 
course if you want to have it more like
a<00:04:06.190> soccer<00:04:06.430> ball<00:04:06.580> then<00:04:07.120> you<00:04:07.150> go<00:04:07.390> with<00:04:07.600> the<00:04:07.990> black

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
a soccer ball then you go with the black

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.450 
a soccer ball then you go with the black
and<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:08.470> white<00:04:08.620> rather<00:04:08.890> than<00:04:09.040> the<00:04:09.130> purple

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
and the white rather than the purple

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.680 
and the white rather than the purple
room<00:04:09.550> and<00:04:10.420> I<00:04:10.480> hope<00:04:10.870> that<00:04:11.080> was<00:04:11.230> instructive

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
room and I hope that was instructive

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.970 
room and I hope that was instructive
probably<00:04:13.690> a<00:04:13.720> lot<00:04:13.840> to<00:04:13.960> repeat<00:04:14.200> a<00:04:14.260> couple<00:04:14.380> times

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
probably a lot to repeat a couple times

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.490 
probably a lot to repeat a couple times
Cheers
