00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.729 
into your compost bin and then the other

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
really there's not a lot you can do

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.240 
really there's not a lot you can do
about<00:01:50.330> sunburn<00:01:51.020> but<00:01:51.500> one<00:01:51.679> of<00:01:51.709> the<00:01:51.860> things<00:01:52.069> that

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
about sunburn but one of the things that

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.949 
about sunburn but one of the things that
does<00:01:52.429> seem<00:01:52.580> to<00:01:52.729> alleviate<00:01:53.239> the<00:01:53.390> problem<00:01:53.750> is<00:01:53.869> if

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:53.959 
does seem to alleviate the problem is if

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:55.719 
does seem to alleviate the problem is if
they're<00:01:54.140> well<00:01:54.319> watered<00:01:54.800> now<00:01:55.220> if<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:55.429> happens

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
they're well watered now if it happens

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:56.979 
they're well watered now if it happens

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:56.989 
really quick and you're not aware it's

00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:58.330 
really quick and you're not aware it's
gonna<00:01:57.140> get<00:01:57.289> to<00:01:57.410> be<00:01:57.500> a<00:01:57.530> hundred<00:01:57.739> and<00:01:57.890> two<00:01:58.069> you

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
gonna get to be a hundred and two you

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.070 
gonna get to be a hundred and two you
might<00:01:58.489> not<00:01:58.670> have<00:01:58.819> any<00:01:59.060> luck<00:01:59.360> watering<00:01:59.840> but<00:01:59.989> if

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
might not have any luck watering but if

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.600 
might not have any luck watering but if
you<00:02:00.200> can<00:02:00.440> and<00:02:00.679> you<00:02:00.739> know<00:02:00.890> it's<00:02:01.039> gonna<00:02:01.160> get<00:02:01.369> hot

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610

really water them long and deep in hard

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:04.930 
really water them long and deep in hard
and<00:02:04.039> that'll<00:02:04.220> fill<00:02:04.429> their<00:02:04.580> cells<00:02:04.789> with

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
and that'll fill their cells with

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.729 
and that'll fill their cells with
moisture<00:02:05.390> and<00:02:05.569> certainly<00:02:06.110> alleviate<00:02:06.590> a<00:02:06.619> lot

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:06.739
