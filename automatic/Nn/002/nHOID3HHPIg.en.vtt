00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.850 
full LibreOffice suite here which is a
simple<00:03:43.390> reason<00:03:43.660> why<00:03:43.840> it's<00:03:43.989> so<00:03:44.110> long<00:03:44.320> and<00:03:44.380> I<00:03:44.590> so

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
simple reason why it's so long and I so

simple reason why it's so long and I so
is<00:03:44.980> about<00:03:45.220> 340<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.269> 360<00:03:46.989> megabytes<00:03:47.950> instead<00:03:48.310> of

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
is about 340 to 360 megabytes instead of

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.850 
is about 340 to 360 megabytes instead of
the<00:03:48.459> usual<00:03:48.489> 150<00:03:49.180> ok<00:03:49.750> so<00:03:50.230> that's<00:03:50.350> quite<00:03:50.560> a<00:03:50.650> lot

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
the usual 150 ok so that's quite a lot
