00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
detail but there are some details pretty

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.370 
detail but there are some details pretty
sweet<00:01:07.550> little<00:01:07.640> casting<00:01:08.210> and<00:01:09.080> then<00:01:09.260> of<00:01:09.350> course

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
sweet little casting and then of course

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.030 
sweet little casting and then of course
the<00:01:09.710> Corolla<00:01:10.070> we've<00:01:10.280> already<00:01:10.460> seen<00:01:10.790> and<00:01:12.040> the

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
the Corolla we've already seen and the

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:30.840 
the Corolla we've already seen and the
black<00:01:14.650> mostly<00:01:15.650> black

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.810 

maybe<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:32.000> little<00:01:32.060> caste<00:01:36.070> there's<00:01:37.070> just<00:01:37.280> two<00:01:37.490> go

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
maybe a little caste there's just two go

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.400 
maybe a little caste there's just two go
ahead<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:38.090> put<00:01:38.240> them<00:01:38.300> on<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:38.600> wheel<00:01:41.410> and

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
ahead and put them on the wheel and

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.240 
ahead and put them on the wheel and
again<00:01:42.680> with<00:01:42.800> the<00:01:42.920> 2000<00:01:43.600> GT<00:01:44.800> you<00:01:45.800> actually<00:01:46.100> have

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
again with the 2000 GT you actually have

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:54.670 
again with the 2000 GT you actually have
a<00:01:46.280> roll<00:01:46.640> bar<00:01:46.820> back<00:01:47.270> there<00:01:53.200> so<00:01:54.200> that<00:01:54.350> tells<00:01:54.590> me

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
a roll bar back there so that tells me

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.530 
a roll bar back there so that tells me
they<00:01:54.860> probably<00:01:55.130> have<00:01:55.490> a<00:01:55.520> racing<00:01:56.090> version<00:01:56.120> of

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
they probably have a racing version of

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.640 
they probably have a racing version of
this<00:01:56.630> car<00:01:56.900> I'm<00:01:57.110> assuming<00:01:58.150> usually<00:01:59.150> when<00:01:59.270> they

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
this car I'm assuming usually when they

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.350 
this car I'm assuming usually when they
make<00:02:00.650> like<00:02:00.860> a<00:02:00.890> vintage<00:02:01.190> racing<00:02:01.850> or<00:02:02.060> something

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
make like a vintage racing or something

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.990 
make like a vintage racing or something
like<00:02:02.450> that<00:02:02.510> of<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:03.140> car<00:02:03.380> from<00:02:04.100> what<00:02:04.220> I<00:02:04.250> found<00:02:04.550> and

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
like that of a car from what I found and

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.210 
like that of a car from what I found and
if<00:02:05.120> these<00:02:05.240> artifacts<00:02:05.930> it's<00:02:06.770> just<00:02:06.920> from<00:02:07.070> my

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
if these artifacts it's just from my

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.330 
if these artifacts it's just from my
experience<00:02:08.709> they<00:02:09.709> usually<00:02:09.860> just<00:02:10.040> keep

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
experience they usually just keep

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.830 
experience they usually just keep
everything<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.760> same<00:02:10.850> and<00:02:11.360> then<00:02:11.480> just<00:02:11.660> make<00:02:11.810> a

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
everything the same and then just make a

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.660 
everything the same and then just make a
regular<00:02:12.110> version<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:12.920> so<00:02:12.950> still<00:02:13.400> have<00:02:13.490> the

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
regular version of it so still have the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.210 
regular version of it so still have the
roll<00:02:13.820> roll<00:02:14.510> bar<00:02:14.750> or<00:02:14.930> cage<00:02:15.170> you<00:02:15.830> know<00:02:15.920> whatever

roll roll bar or cage you know whatever

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:28.009 
roll roll bar or cage you know whatever
the<00:02:16.850> car<00:02:17.060> may<00:02:17.180> have

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.170
