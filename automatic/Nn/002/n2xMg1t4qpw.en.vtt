one of the new features in anime studio

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.510 
one of the new features in anime studio
Pro<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.080> ability<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.710> create<00:00:23.130> Bezier

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
Pro is the ability to create Bezier

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.359 
Pro is the ability to create Bezier
curves<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.240> your<00:00:24.300> motion<00:00:25.050> graph<00:00:25.369> to

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
curves in your motion graph to

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.159 
curves in your motion graph to
demonstrate<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.330> have<00:00:27.509> a<00:00:27.540> simple<00:00:27.990> object

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:28.169 
demonstrate this I have a simple object

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.740 
demonstrate this I have a simple object
on<00:00:28.500> screen<00:00:28.919> with<00:00:29.099> three<00:00:29.130> keyframes<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.180> can

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
on screen with three keyframes you can

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.229 
on screen with three keyframes you can
see<00:00:30.990> as<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.410> scrub<00:00:31.680> through<00:00:31.740> here<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.400> just

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
see as I scrub through here it just

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.500 
see as I scrub through here it just
plays<00:00:33.510> all<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.320> way<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.830> end<00:00:34.949> like<00:00:35.129> that

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
plays all the way to the end like that

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.840 
plays all the way to the end like that
it's<00:00:36.510> pretty<00:00:36.750> much<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:37.110> straight<00:00:37.379> line<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:37.920> now

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
it's pretty much a straight line so now

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.700 
it's pretty much a straight line so now
if<00:00:39.150> I<00:00:39.300> go<00:00:39.449> into<00:00:39.570> my<00:00:39.750> motion<00:00:40.110> graph<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.620> by

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
if I go into my motion graph just by

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.160 
if I go into my motion graph just by
clicking<00:00:41.100> on<00:00:41.220> the<00:00:41.519> motion<00:00:41.850> graph<00:00:42.030> tab<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:43.140> can

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
clicking on the motion graph tab we can

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.110 
clicking on the motion graph tab we can
see<00:00:43.530> what<00:00:43.769> this<00:00:43.920> motion<00:00:44.100> looks<00:00:44.460> like<00:00:44.699> in<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
see what this motion looks like in the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.530 
see what this motion looks like in the
graph<00:00:45.350> which<00:00:46.350> again<00:00:46.620> looks<00:00:46.860> pretty<00:00:47.339> basic<00:00:47.550> so

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
graph which again looks pretty basic so

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.170 
graph which again looks pretty basic so
what<00:00:48.839> I<00:00:48.870> can<00:00:49.080> do<00:00:49.260> here<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.739> highlight<00:00:50.580> all<00:00:50.909> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
what I can do here is highlight all the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.649 
what I can do here is highlight all the
keyframes<00:00:51.390> on<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.140> graph<00:00:53.180> right<00:00:54.180> click<00:00:54.479> on

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
keyframes on the graph right click on

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.439 
keyframes on the graph right click on
one<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.080> keyframes<00:00:55.589> and<00:00:56.119> choose<00:00:57.119> Bezier

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
one of the keyframes and choose Bezier

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.509 
one of the keyframes and choose Bezier
you'll<00:01:00.449> now<00:01:00.659> notice<00:01:00.900> that<00:01:01.470> all<00:01:01.680> my<00:01:01.710> keyframes

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
you'll now notice that all my keyframes

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.570 
you'll now notice that all my keyframes
have<00:01:02.879> desi<00:01:03.269> a<00:01:03.299> handles<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.619> for<00:01:04.890> instance<00:01:05.250> if<00:01:05.460> I

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
have desi a handles so for instance if I

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.180 
have desi a handles so for instance if I
come<00:01:05.790> into<00:01:06.000> my<00:01:06.119> middle<00:01:06.390> keyframe<00:01:06.869> here<00:01:07.190> hold

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
come into my middle keyframe here hold

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.250 
come into my middle keyframe here hold
down<00:01:08.340> my<00:01:08.369> left<00:01:08.490> mouse<00:01:08.850> button<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.390> move<00:01:09.450> this

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
down my left mouse button and move this

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.469 
down my left mouse button and move this
around<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:11.310> can<00:01:11.340> see<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.700> can<00:01:11.939> alter<00:01:12.270> both

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
around you can see I can alter both

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.289 
around you can see I can alter both
handles<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.799> keyframe<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.580> as<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.119> do

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
handles on this keyframe and as I do

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.750 
handles on this keyframe and as I do
this<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:16.200> canvas<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.950> reflecting<00:01:17.610> these

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
this the canvas is reflecting these

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.359 
this the canvas is reflecting these
changes<00:01:18.330> I'm<00:01:18.510> creating<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.590> different<00:01:20.100> curve

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
changes I'm creating a different curve

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.050 
changes I'm creating a different curve
in<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:21.030> motion<00:01:21.360> graph<00:01:22.579> and<00:01:23.579> this<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:23.909> give

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
in the motion graph and this can give

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.760 
in the motion graph and this can give
you<00:01:24.149> some<00:01:24.359> very<00:01:24.390> unique<00:01:24.719> results<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.619> could

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
you some very unique results so I could

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.190 
you some very unique results so I could
go<00:01:25.859> like<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.579> could<00:01:27.420> come<00:01:27.539> over<00:01:27.719> here<00:01:27.960> to

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
go like this I could come over here to

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.849 
go like this I could come over here to
the<00:01:28.409> N<00:01:28.530> keyframe<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.429> alter<00:01:29.789> it<00:01:29.820> like<00:01:30.030> this

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:30.859 
the N keyframe and alter it like this

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:34.010 
the N keyframe and alter it like this
come<00:01:31.859> to<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.009> beginning<00:01:32.420> do<00:01:33.420> stuff<00:01:33.630> like<00:01:33.719> that

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
come to the beginning do stuff like that

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.090 
come to the beginning do stuff like that
and<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:35.219> on<00:01:35.399> and<00:01:35.640> as<00:01:35.789> you<00:01:35.909> can<00:01:35.999> see<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.539> am

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
and so on and as you can see I am

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.709 
and so on and as you can see I am
radically<00:01:38.100> altering<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.789> path<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.420> this

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
radically altering the path of this

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.010 
radically altering the path of this
object<00:01:39.960> now<00:01:40.579> if<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.700> want<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.060> only<00:01:42.240> alter<00:01:42.749> one

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
object now if you want to only alter one

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.679 
object now if you want to only alter one
handle<00:01:43.499> at<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.679> time<00:01:44.070> go<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.969> a<00:01:45.090> keyframe<00:01:45.659> that

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
handle at a time go to a keyframe that

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.770 
handle at a time go to a keyframe that
has<00:01:46.020> two<00:01:46.380> handles<00:01:46.999> holding<00:01:47.999> your<00:01:48.179> Alt<00:01:48.359> key<00:01:48.569> on

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
has two handles holding your Alt key on

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.200 
has two handles holding your Alt key on
your<00:01:49.020> keyboard<00:01:49.289> and<00:01:49.770> then<00:01:50.460> move<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.819> handle

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
your keyboard and then move the handle

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.020 
your keyboard and then move the handle
you<00:01:51.869> can<00:01:52.049> see<00:01:52.319> the<00:01:52.710> second<00:01:53.069> handle<00:01:53.490> remains

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
you can see the second handle remains

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.010 
you can see the second handle remains
stationary<00:01:55.939> this<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.119> course<00:01:57.359> again<00:01:57.630> can<00:01:57.899> give

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
stationary this of course again can give

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.419 
stationary this of course again can give
us<00:01:58.140> some<00:01:58.319> very<00:01:58.530> unique<00:01:58.740> results<00:02:00.049> and<00:02:01.280> now<00:02:02.280> that

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
us some very unique results and now that

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.399 
us some very unique results and now that
I'm<00:02:02.520> done<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.969> can<00:02:03.299> go<00:02:03.389> back<00:02:03.569> here<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.139> start

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
I'm done I can go back here to the start
