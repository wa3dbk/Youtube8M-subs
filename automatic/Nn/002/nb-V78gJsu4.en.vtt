00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
Nolan maybe that's that wasn't the case

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.869 
Nolan maybe that's that wasn't the case
in<00:03:29.349> the<00:03:29.530> first<00:03:29.709> two<00:03:29.889> games<00:03:30.129> and<00:03:30.310> tonight<00:03:30.700> we

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
in the first two games and tonight we

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.149 
in the first two games and tonight we
make<00:03:31.659> sure<00:03:31.810> we<00:03:32.019> we<00:03:32.470> play<00:03:32.650> with<00:03:32.829> a<00:03:32.859> little<00:03:33.069> bit

you<00:04:33.909> guys<00:04:34.120> playing<00:04:34.389> pretty<00:04:34.750> close<00:04:35.020> to<00:04:35.139> the

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
you guys playing pretty close to the

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.640 
you guys playing pretty close to the
ceiling<00:04:36.930> we're<00:04:37.930> playing<00:04:38.139> well<00:04:38.289> right<00:04:38.470> now<00:04:38.590> but

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
ceiling we're playing well right now but

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.719 
ceiling we're playing well right now but
I<00:04:39.310> think<00:04:39.460> we're<00:04:39.909> not<00:04:40.199> consistent<00:04:41.199> I<00:04:41.800> think<00:04:42.610> we

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
I think we're not consistent I think we

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.939 
I think we're not consistent I think we
can<00:04:42.880> play<00:04:43.060> better<00:04:43.210> ass<00:04:43.570> the<00:04:44.169> whole<00:04:44.349> last<00:04:44.590> 60

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
can play better ass the whole last 60

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:47.879 
can play better ass the whole last 60
minutes<00:04:44.979> and<00:04:45.810> play<00:04:46.810> better<00:04:46.960> defensively<00:04:47.500> as<00:04:47.860> a

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
minutes and play better defensively as a

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.550 
minutes and play better defensively as a
team<00:04:48.190> and<00:04:48.870> obviously<00:04:49.870> mad<00:04:50.110> we<00:04:50.229> played<00:04:50.440> our

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
team and obviously mad we played our

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.860 
team and obviously mad we played our
best<00:04:50.590> game<00:04:50.950> in<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.580> series<00:04:51.789> and

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
best game in the series and

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.440 
best game in the series and
I<00:04:52.900> think<00:04:53.350> when<00:04:53.500> I<00:04:53.530> find<00:04:53.800> a<00:04:53.860> way<00:04:54.010> to<00:04:54.300> just<00:04:55.300> play

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
I think when I find a way to just play

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.260 
I think when I find a way to just play
the<00:04:55.570> same<00:04:55.720> way<00:04:57.060> thought<00:04:58.060> you<00:04:58.180> were

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
the same way thought you were

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.760 
the same way thought you were
dangerously<00:04:58.720> close<00:04:58.870> to<00:04:58.990> being<00:04:59.320> down<00:04:59.440> three

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
dangerously close to being down three

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.470 
dangerously close to being down three

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:57.330 
strength the Flyers probably don't want
to<00:05:56.410> talk<00:05:56.530> about<00:05:56.560> it<00:05:56.860> too<00:05:56.979> much<00:05:57.010> but

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
to talk about it too much but

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.640 
to talk about it too much but
Philadelphia<00:05:58.300> again<00:05:58.660> one<00:05:58.930> the<00:05:59.080> special<00:05:59.290> teams

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
Philadelphia again one the special teams

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.130 
Philadelphia again one the special teams
battle<00:06:00.070> well<00:06:00.520> what<00:06:01.240> I<00:06:01.270> saw<00:06:01.600> they<00:06:01.810> do<00:06:01.870> of<00:06:02.080> course

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140 
battle well what I saw they do of course

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.659 
battle well what I saw they do of course
they<00:06:02.320> scored<00:06:02.620> the<00:06:02.710> two<00:06:02.830> power<00:06:03.040> play<00:06:03.280> oils

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
they scored the two power play oils

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.060 
they scored the two power play oils
which<00:06:03.880> which<00:06:04.390> obviously<00:06:04.780> help<00:06:05.169> but<00:06:05.500> I<00:06:05.770> think

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
which which obviously help but I think

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.590 
which which obviously help but I think
the<00:06:06.130> other<00:06:06.280> thing<00:06:06.520> that<00:06:06.550> it's<00:06:06.790> done<00:06:07.000> is<00:06:07.360> that

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
the other thing that it's done is that

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.000 
the other thing that it's done is that
their<00:06:07.750> penalty<00:06:08.110> killing<00:06:08.320> changes<00:06:08.890> the

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.010 
their penalty killing changes the

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.560 
their penalty killing changes the
momentum<00:06:09.250> of<00:06:09.490> the<00:06:09.550> game<00:06:09.580> because<00:06:10.330> there<00:06:10.479> were

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
momentum of the game because there were

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.200 
momentum of the game because there were
times<00:06:10.870> when<00:06:11.140> Chicago<00:06:11.289> was<00:06:11.620> very

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
times when Chicago was very

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.499 
times when Chicago was very
even<00:06:12.660> strengthen<00:06:13.139> and<00:06:13.550> controlling<00:06:14.550> play<00:06:14.789> but

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:15.509 
even strengthen and controlling play but

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.320 
even strengthen and controlling play but
by<00:06:15.889> killing<00:06:16.889> off<00:06:17.070> those<00:06:17.340> penalties<00:06:17.759> the<00:06:18.150> way

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
by killing off those penalties the way

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.230 
by killing off those penalties the way
the<00:06:18.509> Flyers<00:06:18.810> do<00:06:19.139> blocking<00:06:19.800> shots<00:06:19.830> not<00:06:20.820> giving

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
the Flyers do blocking shots not giving

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.629 
the Flyers do blocking shots not giving
the<00:06:21.389> Hawks<00:06:21.930> many<00:06:22.259> good<00:06:22.500> looks<00:06:22.770> when<00:06:23.340> when<00:06:23.550> they

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 
the Hawks many good looks when when they

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:26.180 
the Hawks many good looks when when they
get<00:06:23.789> their<00:06:23.970> power<00:06:24.180> play<00:06:24.509> it<00:06:24.960> just<00:06:25.259> you<00:06:25.949> know<00:06:26.070> it

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
get their power play it just you know it

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.710 
get their power play it just you know it
just<00:06:26.220> turns<00:06:26.580> a<00:06:26.669> game<00:06:26.820> the<00:06:26.940> other<00:06:27.090> way<00:06:27.180> guys<00:06:27.509> is

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
just turns a game the other way guys is

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.540 
just turns a game the other way guys is
it<00:06:27.840> fair<00:06:28.050> to<00:06:28.080> say<00:06:28.229> maybe<00:06:28.470> that's<00:06:28.680> where<00:06:29.370> we're

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
it fair to say maybe that's where we're

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.010 
it fair to say maybe that's where we're
seeing<00:06:29.729> Mike<00:06:30.030> Richards<00:06:30.449> had<00:06:30.630> his<00:06:30.780> best

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
seeing Mike Richards had his best

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.719 
seeing Mike Richards had his best
because<00:06:31.320> maybe<00:06:31.710> the<00:06:31.889> other<00:06:32.009> areas<00:06:32.370> are<00:06:32.400> still

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:32.729 
because maybe the other areas are still

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:34.920 
because maybe the other areas are still
