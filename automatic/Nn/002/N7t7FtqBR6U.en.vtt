00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.960
 knees are not worn 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.940
 inside but during the movement le 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.070
 knees are pushed out and 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.720
 turn off the direction of the tip of the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.790
 foot in this way the back 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.850
 during the entire movement it does not curve 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.360
 but it always remains tense and aligned in 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.360
 this way 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.480
 this is the correct movement for 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.130
 safely perform this 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.600
 exercise 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:03.570
 ideal as said to train legs and 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:09.810
 buttocks then back straight and knees 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:11.820
 looking outside for a second 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.770
 the exercise I want to teach you are the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.350
 sink the lunges for yield that 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.930
 they are executed in this way by one 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.330
 standing position vin knees all 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.700
 back going to touch with the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.940
 back knee the floor of 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.009
 lift up contracts and buttocks one thing 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.650
 important during the execution of 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.660
 lunges is to not bring in 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.660
 forward this knee 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:44.960
 the correct way to do it is that 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:47.210
 to keep the knee still and steady 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.780
 so that it does not go over the tip 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.740
 of the foot 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:54.850
 that way when you get up 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.850
 has thrown out the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.860
 the third and final revenue we see 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.049
 today and the one-legged squat 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.460
 this exercise is ideal for those 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.319
 people who already have a good level 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.209
 athletic an exercise that requires 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.080
 balance is good muscle strength 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:16.840
 to execute it you will just need a chair e 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.959
 positioned nothing of standing and 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.180
 this position you lower with one 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.610
 single leg the other leg is detached from the 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:31.590
 floor and remains raised waiting for 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:35.190
 in front of you this way down and then up 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.650
 this is the one-legged squat 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.560

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.880
 buttocks and all lower limbs for 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.590
 perform this exercise 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.780
 a trick will need some balance 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.730
 which I can suggest to improve it e 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.590
 to look at a fixed point 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.180
 before you as a when one 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.630

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.630

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.769

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.950
