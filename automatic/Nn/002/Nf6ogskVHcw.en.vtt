 to carry out good management 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.550
 reproductive that is vital to maintain 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.379
 the farm in constant production is 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.410
 recommends in a special way to take care of 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.790
 Replacement method 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.620
 some of the factors that should be 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.050
 take into account so that the reproduction 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.960
 of the appropriate high quality is the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.340
 ventilation temperature humidity and 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.340
 above all the comfort of the rabbit 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.870
 Regarding breastfeeding, the rabbit has 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.820
 characteristics in character to 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.410
 breastfeeding moment then to 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.630
 difference from other species only 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.700
 breastfeed once a day thing that 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.130
 usually occurs at dawn or 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.260
 at dawn the approximate time is very 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.360
 short since it goes from two minutes 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.729
 until eight minutes so that the 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.160
 Survival of the rabbit is given depends 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.660
 that you receive all the cited due to 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.280
 the long intervals of the 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.100
 treated and the short time of 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.290
 breastfeeding because a gauze because 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.380
 loses a breastfeeding has a 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.899
 50% percent of survival and a 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.200
 few to because he loses two decades has 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:51.240
 low percentage by 75% 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.530
 The ability of the eyes can 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.079
 detect the pressures of the mother 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.810
 depends on the pheromones released by 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.240
 the rabbit the ability to release 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.369
 these depend on the reproductive status and 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.810
 maybe the season of the year 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.270
 produce mostly at the end of the 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.130
 pregnancy and the beginning of adaptation to 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.280
 end of spring and early 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.280
 summer 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.670
 weaning is the time when 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.980
 they separate the kits from the mother this 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.599
 critical stage for all times 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.909
 implies the separation of the mother 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.790
 the change of environment and the change of 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:29.180
 power this operation is performed 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.859
 between days 28 and 32 however you can 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.139
 vary depending on the system that is 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:35.000
 work on the farm the advisable thing is 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:38.389
 that this management is carried out when the 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.980
 gazapo has a weight not less than 350 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:40.939
 grams 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.489
 when the period of lactation and 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:45.700
 reduced the problems are increased in 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.959
 the kits in the fattening period 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.080
 mainly with problems of the apparatus 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.970
 digestive 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.430
 before all the problems that it brings 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.920
 I get the early weaning the ideal 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.380
 it would be done between 5 and 6 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.810
 weeks of age taking special 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.560
 attention in the hygienic aspects 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.840
 health and general management 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.540
 if they have to pay attention in the 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.090
 litters of more than 8 rabbits they will have 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.209
 less average weight and will experience more 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.860
 competition in the fattening area 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.020
 thus touching a delay in reaching the 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.420
 commercial weight 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.720
 to counteract this is recommended 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.760
 the standardization of litters 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.060
 the mortality rate varies a lot 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.670
 between 12% during the first four 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.010
 weeks of life the cause of mortality 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.830
 in the nest is mainly because of 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.920
 the environment of up to 80 per 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.520
 a hundred of which the most common factors 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.700
 they are one the lack of bed what causes 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.160
 the cold the society which as 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.970
 result causes bad smell and especially 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:57.030
 in nervousness in the humidity racks 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.590
 which also causes them 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.599
 cold and even more nervousness 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.760
 another factor that can cause 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.489
 litter mortality is due to the 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.739
 crushing by the rabbit or 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.950
 the departure of the kits had due to 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.629
 that the rabbit when leaving abruptly 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.669
 in a situation of stress can 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.750
 take them with them suspended in the 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.060
 tits 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.610
 Another factor that generates deaths is the 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.850
 cannibalism generated by mishandling as 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.100
 it may be the lack of food 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.470
 drink water lack of hygiene in the 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.770
 cage disposition on the property of 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:37.350
 unit the exposure is the stress before 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.830
 during or immediately after the 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.080
 childbirth visual hearing detection 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.090
 active wolf of predators or 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.370
 personnel outside the farm 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.740
 if correcting these problems the 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.729
 cannibalism follows this rabbit should be 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.740
 removed 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.740
 the effect of the photoperiod in the 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:01.520
 reproduction the photoperiod handling 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.279
 it is convenient to use from 15 to 16 light hours 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.979
 daily especially at the time of the end 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:09.020
 of summer and at the beginning of autumn that 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.430
 is when fertility drops 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.199
 you must carry out the 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:16.699
 pregnancy diagnosis in rabbits 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:18.860
 of 13 15 10 post coitus so that way 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.529
 check whether or not they were pregnant and 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.520
 take them again the correction the 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:27.759
 that have not been positive there are 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.289
 three methods of pregnancy diagnosis 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:33.499
 the first of them the examination of the 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:34.879
 mammary glands and abdomen here the 

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:36.469
 mammary glands begin to 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:39.379
 develop for half of the 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:41.629
 pregnancy , however, the percentage of 

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:44.120
 error of this practice is also elevated 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:47.160
 which it requires a lot of experience 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.500
 part of the person who made it 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.930
 another is to take the female back to 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.760
 male is the method that has great margin 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.940
 of error because there are many occasions 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.980
 in which females may not accept 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.770
 male and not simply because of the 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:04.200
 pregnancy, there is also the risk that 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:07.620
 the rabbit responds with aggression or 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.229
 okay let them ride again 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.120
 and finally the palpation this is the 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:14.790
 most advisable diagnostic method and 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.699
 insurance can be given a security of 90 to 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:22.040
 95 percent can also be known 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:22.040
 something about the size of the litter 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:28.800
 palpation should be performed between 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:32.040
 days 10 and 14 after I can do 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.720
 the whole ride if it is delayed more than 15 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:38.180
 days there is a risk of provoking 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.180
 abortions or distances
