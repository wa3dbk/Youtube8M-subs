00:00:02.203 --> 00:00:04.841
This initiative is called The Hand of the Architect.

00:00:04.853 --> 00:00:10.162
It has involved 110 architects from Italy and abroad

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:14.768
asked to donate their architectural drawings 

00:00:14.675 --> 00:00:16.963
 for Villa Necchi Campiglio 

00:00:16.963 --> 00:00:19.412
for the architect Piero Portaluppi 

00:00:19.412 --> 00:00:22.105
to the FAI - the Italian Environmental Fund

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:24.892
by direct invitation. 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.068
The initiative attracted over 378 drawings

00:00:31.068 --> 00:00:33.530
collected here at Villa Necchi Campiglio

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.726
in the Triennale Bovisa 

00:00:34.726 --> 00:00:37.647
and at the offices of the magazine Abitare... 

00:00:37.647 --> 00:00:42.008
the organisation of three shows

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:45.812
that will be open until 10 May

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:48.489
the production of a catalogue 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.097
published by Moleskine and Abitare Segesta

00:00:51.097 --> 00:00:54.348
all to collect funds 

00:00:54.348 --> 00:01:03.148
for the work on Villa Necchi Campiglio by Portaluppi. 

00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:07.792
The collected material recounts the design process

00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:11.174
and in the variety of these materials 

00:01:11.174 --> 00:01:14.317
we can see the first steps in the design

00:01:14.317 --> 00:01:17.775
with the first sketches and drafts, the first design ideas

00:01:17.775 --> 00:01:20.950
right up to the working drawings 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.433
specific details of the design

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:28.241
in solutions in the design issues 

00:01:28.241 --> 00:01:29.777
right up to the construction phase. 

00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:32.058
Milanese architecture is made of mistakes

00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:34.534
it's made of everything we find in these drawings. 

00:01:34.618 --> 00:01:37.251
It is made of mistakes in the best sense of the word

00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:39.699
in other words the fact that the process is gradual

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:43.683
that the design phases are shown in the drawings

00:01:43.683 --> 00:01:45.900
so in small steps

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.023
through small signs, small gestures

00:01:49.023 --> 00:01:52.344
which accompany the design and the design stages

00:01:52.344 --> 00:01:58.497
not through violent acts, imposed actions of force

00:01:58.497 --> 00:02:01.744
but through small shared processes.

00:02:01.744 --> 00:02:04.904
Perhaps these sketches can help us find

00:02:04.904 --> 00:02:07.625
the steps in the design process that were lost.

00:02:07.745 --> 00:02:11.104
A creation that takes place in time, a creation that takes place 

00:02:11.426 --> 00:02:13.506
in small phases

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.507
which may be accompanied, shared. 

00:02:16.443 --> 00:02:19.828
In these sketches and these drawings we often see rethinking

00:02:19.827 --> 00:02:25.083
there are discussions with the customer

00:02:25.127 --> 00:02:26.778
discussion between the architect 

00:02:26.822 --> 00:02:29.587
and those who will subsequently live 

00:02:29.587 --> 00:02:34.191
and perceive the architectural design.
