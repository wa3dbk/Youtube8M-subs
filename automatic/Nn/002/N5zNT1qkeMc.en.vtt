00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.139 
I think a lot of new collectors haven't
really<00:00:46.440> considered<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.950> logistics<00:00:47.879> of

solutions let's just talk about

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.020 
solutions let's just talk about

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740

hardshell plastic cases and those are

hardshell plastic cases and those are
great<00:03:17.880> they're<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.420> little<00:03:18.720> bit<00:03:18.810> harder<00:03:19.080> to

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
great they're a little bit harder to

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.480 
great they're a little bit harder to
track<00:03:19.440> down<00:03:19.650> especially<00:03:19.980> when<00:03:20.340> you're

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
track down especially when you're

of<00:03:23.250> mine<00:03:23.430> actually<00:03:23.700> has<00:03:24.330> a<00:03:24.360> company<00:03:25.020> that

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
of mine actually has a company that

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.430 
of mine actually has a company that
makes<00:03:26.030> plastic<00:03:27.030> bags<00:03:27.390> for<00:03:27.870> his<00:03:27.990> games<00:03:28.290> and

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
makes plastic bags for his games and

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.140 
makes plastic bags for his games and
that<00:03:28.860> might<00:03:29.010> sound<00:03:29.190> kind<00:03:29.460> of<00:03:29.520> silly<00:03:29.760> but<00:03:29.940> these

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
that might sound kind of silly but these

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.270 
that might sound kind of silly but these
are<00:03:30.300> they<00:03:30.780> fit<00:03:31.080> really<00:03:31.260> well<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.860> they<00:03:32.070> keep

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
are they fit really well and they keep

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.950 
are they fit really well and they keep
out<00:03:32.490> the<00:03:32.640> dust<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.150> moisture<00:03:33.630> it's<00:03:33.900> a

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
out the dust and the moisture it's a

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.110 
out the dust and the moisture it's a
pretty<00:03:34.170> interesting<00:03:34.410> solution<00:03:35.160> of<00:03:35.340> course<00:03:35.940> my

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
pretty interesting solution of course my

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.360 
pretty interesting solution of course my
favorite<00:03:36.360> solution<00:03:36.840> is<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.380> universal<00:03:38.070> game

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
favorite solution is the universal game

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.640 
favorite solution is the universal game
case<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.060> actually<00:03:39.720> made<00:03:39.870> an<00:03:39.990> entire<00:03:40.320> video

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
case and actually made an entire video

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.770 
case and actually made an entire video
about<00:03:40.830> this<00:03:41.310> solution<00:03:41.670> but<00:03:42.300> I<00:03:42.330> really<00:03:42.600> like

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
about this solution but I really like

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.360 
about this solution but I really like
this<00:03:42.960> because<00:03:43.140> it<00:03:43.350> gives<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:43.770> that<00:03:43.800> sort<00:03:44.250> of

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
this because it gives it that sort of

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.330 
this because it gives it that sort of
box<00:03:44.880> art<00:03:45.270> quality<00:03:45.600> so<00:03:46.410> it<00:03:46.620> sort<00:03:46.800> of<00:03:46.890> reminds

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
box art quality so it sort of reminds

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.880 
box art quality so it sort of reminds
you<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.520> being<00:03:48.030> at<00:03:48.270> a<00:03:48.300> store<00:03:48.720> back<00:03:49.260> in<00:03:49.320> the<00:03:49.560> 80s

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
you of being at a store back in the 80s

and I know gamester anyone uses this I
think<00:04:26.790> almost<00:04:26.970> exclusively<00:04:27.840> and<00:04:28.140> that's<00:04:28.620> a

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
think almost exclusively and that's a

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.190 
think almost exclusively and that's a

system of drawers drawers are nice

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.260 
system of drawers drawers are nice
because<00:04:31.620> they<00:04:31.770> keep<00:04:31.980> light<00:04:32.310> off<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.610> labels

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
because they keep light off the labels

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.390 
because they keep light off the labels
they<00:04:33.720> keep<00:04:33.990> dust<00:04:34.410> out<00:04:34.620> of<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:34.950> games<00:04:35.160> they

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
they keep dust out of the games they

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.280 
they keep dust out of the games they
keep<00:04:35.580> moisture<00:04:35.850> away<00:04:36.300> for<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:36.630> most<00:04:36.810> part<00:04:37.110> and

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
keep moisture away for the most part and

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.170 
keep moisture away for the most part and
they<00:04:37.680> also<00:04:37.890> you<00:04:38.100> can<00:04:38.460> actually<00:04:38.610> store<00:04:38.880> quite<00:04:39.120> a

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
they also you can actually store quite a

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.730 
they also you can actually store quite a
bit<00:04:39.390> maybe<00:04:39.660> even<00:04:39.930> more<00:04:40.110> than<00:04:40.260> you<00:04:40.350> can<00:04:40.530> on<00:04:40.560> a

in there and stack pretty nicely for
about<00:06:31.340> 20<00:06:31.760> dollars<00:06:31.910> so<00:06:32.690> check<00:06:33.020> that<00:06:33.050> out<00:06:33.410> as

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
about 20 dollars so check that out as

about 20 dollars so check that out as
well<00:06:33.700> now<00:06:34.700> no<00:06:34.940> matter<00:06:35.090> how<00:06:35.330> you<00:06:35.390> store<00:06:35.810> or
