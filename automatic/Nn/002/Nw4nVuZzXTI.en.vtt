which<00:02:28.490> looks<00:02:29.530> surprisingly<00:02:30.530> good<00:02:31.000> it's<00:02:32.000> a

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
which looks surprisingly good it's a

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.940 
which looks surprisingly good it's a
bitch<00:02:32.210> it's<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:32.930> bit<00:02:33.050> more<00:02:33.140> shiny<00:02:33.410> compared<00:02:33.800> to

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950
