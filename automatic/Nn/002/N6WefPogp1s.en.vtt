not<00:00:42.120> get<00:00:42.360> cold<00:00:42.829> another<00:00:43.829> thing<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.100> like<00:00:44.280> about

not get cold another thing I like about

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.670 
not get cold another thing I like about
it<00:00:44.550> versus<00:00:44.940> using<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.329> shovel<00:00:45.600> as<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.500> know

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
it versus using the shovel as you know

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.590 
it versus using the shovel as you know
with<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.920> subway<00:00:47.280> just<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.789> one<00:00:48.000> handle

with the subway just have the one handle

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.569 
with the subway just have the one handle
then<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.320> makes<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.590> very<00:00:49.710> difficult<00:00:49.829> because

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
then it makes it very difficult because

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.340 
then it makes it very difficult because
you're<00:00:51.090> using<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.539> muscles<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.989> your<00:00:52.020> back

here<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.920> here<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.850> after<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> while<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.600> get

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
here and here and after a while you get

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.209 
here and here and after a while you get
aching<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.469> then<00:00:55.620> you've<00:00:55.800> got<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.010> switch

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
aching and then you've got to switch

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.400 
aching and then you've got to switch
sides<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.820> use<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.050> don't<00:00:58.230> really

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
sides and use this and you don't really

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.290 
sides and use this and you don't really
get<00:00:58.649> good<00:00:58.859> leverage<00:00:59.070> with<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> shovel<00:00:59.699> it's
