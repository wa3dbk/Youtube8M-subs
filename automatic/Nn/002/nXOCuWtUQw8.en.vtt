 and one more pretty good 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.149
 interesting to walk 

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:12.149
 speed is usually code 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.900
 and victory key 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.900
 and got a second 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.210

 You can argue the way hryvnia 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.390
 if you want 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.190
 this is the mechanism i noticed but their 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.890
 the pictures are archaic 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.410

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.280
 nurture 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.420
 1 copy 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.770
 and that moment after a few percent 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.080
 this mechanism would have an interest in itself 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.660
 there is 1 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.650

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.930
 HIV speed 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.470

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.939
 under it they put wool multicolored 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:18.830
 Patkar matches Omsk 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.830
 and we take 6 which counters 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.230
 contractors who must open 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.770
 that is, the dye 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.830
 why mow take 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.890
 orange red paint 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.890
 black Pearl 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.200
 next we need 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.840
 craftsmanship 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.840

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.940
 point tears 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.130
 in which will 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.480
 we have lots 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.250

 miracle first match 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.040
 his hassle 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.700
 and we will get 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.700

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:19.299
 wednesday here he 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.699

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.739
 can put 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:57.009
