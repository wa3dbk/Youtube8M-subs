00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
of heaven yesterday it's too easy to

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.240 
of heaven yesterday it's too easy to
forget<00:02:49.630> that<00:02:49.900> it<00:02:50.350> was<00:02:50.410> written<00:02:50.680> by<00:02:50.830> people<00:02:51.040> who

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
forget that it was written by people who

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.800 
forget that it was written by people who
lived<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.549> long<00:02:51.730> time<00:02:52.060> ago<00:02:52.239> who<00:02:52.540> spoke

the third issue and perhaps the most

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.150 
the third issue and perhaps the most
significant<00:03:01.390> is<00:03:01.660> that<00:03:02.049> we've<00:03:02.440> become

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
significant is that we've become

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.000 
significant is that we've become
accustomed<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.880> reading<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.329> Bible<00:03:04.720> in

isolation we read by ourselves we have
personal<00:03:08.650> quiet<00:03:08.920> times<00:03:09.310> and<00:03:09.579> that's<00:03:09.640> good<00:03:09.970> but

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
personal quiet times and that's good but

personal quiet times and that's good but
if<00:03:11.079> that's<00:03:11.260> all<00:03:11.470> we<00:03:11.530> do<00:03:11.920> then<00:03:12.340> we<00:03:12.489> miss<00:03:12.670> out<00:03:12.850> on
