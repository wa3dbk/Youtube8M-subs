today now as a mapmaker and today's
invention<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.080> specifically<00:00:13.980> targeting

invention is specifically targeting
creative<00:00:16.049> red<00:00:16.500> stoners<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.130> mapmakers<00:00:17.460> as<00:00:18.300> a

creative red stoners and mapmakers as a

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.150 
creative red stoners and mapmakers as a
mapmaker<00:00:18.660> I'm<00:00:19.050> always<00:00:19.320> trying<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.859> find<00:00:19.920> a

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
mapmaker I'm always trying to find a

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.070 
mapmaker I'm always trying to find a
design<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.580> small<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.980> lag-free<00:00:23.840> and<00:00:24.840> I

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
design that is small and lag-free and I

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.830 
design that is small and lag-free and I
think<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.410> found<00:00:25.619> one<00:00:25.890> for<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.099> tea<00:00:26.279> flip-flop<00:00:26.849> I

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
think I found one for a tea flip-flop I

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.929 
think I found one for a tea flip-flop I
hope<00:00:28.680> people<00:00:28.769> can<00:00:28.980> find<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.250> useful<00:00:29.429> but

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
hope people can find this useful but

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.820 
hope people can find this useful but
basically<00:00:30.269> have<00:00:30.420> two<00:00:30.599> versions<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:31.080> 1.8

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
basically have two versions a 1.8

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.330 
basically have two versions a 1.8
version<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.700> 1.7<00:00:33.540> version<00:00:34.100> the<00:00:35.100> only

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
version and a 1.7 version the only

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.420 
version and a 1.7 version the only
difference<00:00:35.610> between<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.239> two<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:37.430> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
difference between the two is that the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.760 
difference between the two is that the
1.7<00:00:39.270> version<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.840> directional<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:40.649> to

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
1.7 version is directional you have to

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.290 
1.7 version is directional you have to
enter<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.010> slightly<00:00:41.460> different<00:00:41.760> piece<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.090> code

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
enter a slightly different piece of code

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.860 
enter a slightly different piece of code
depending<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.230> which<00:00:43.350> way<00:00:43.469> it's<00:00:43.590> pointing<00:00:44.870> so

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
depending on which way it's pointing so

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.750 
depending on which way it's pointing so
that's<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> only<00:00:46.320> real<00:00:46.680> difference<00:00:47.309> between

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
that's the only real difference between

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.100 
that's the only real difference between
them<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.000> can<00:00:48.120> use<00:00:48.270> either<00:00:48.300> one<00:00:48.629> but<00:00:48.930> just

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
them you can use either one but just

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.779 
them you can use either one but just
because<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.860> one<00:00:50.070> works<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.460> any<00:00:50.610> direction

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
because this one works in any direction

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.869 
because this one works in any direction
I<00:00:51.620> would<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.920> would<00:00:53.129> potentially<00:00:53.460> dough<00:00:53.730> for

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
I would I would potentially dough for

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.139 
I would I would potentially dough for
the<00:00:53.910> 1.8<00:00:54.360> one<00:00:54.539> if<00:00:54.660> you're<00:00:54.750> in<00:00:54.870> 1.8<00:00:55.520> so<00:00:56.520> let<00:00:57.030> me

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
the 1.8 one if you're in 1.8 so let me

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.810 
the 1.8 one if you're in 1.8 so let me
explain<00:00:57.510> how<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.660> works<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.370> 1.8

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
explain how this works this is the 1.8

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.049 
explain how this works this is the 1.8

has which tells it how much signal
strength<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.010> run<00:01:14.130> through<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> comparator<00:01:14.939> so

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
strength to run through a comparator so

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.630 
strength to run through a comparator so
if<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.900> succeeds<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.650> running<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.950> command<00:01:17.310> it

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
if it succeeds in running a command it

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.140 
if it succeeds in running a command it
sets<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:18.689> or<00:01:19.049> if<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:20.150> detecting

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
sets it to one or if it is detecting

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.609 
sets it to one or if it is detecting
players<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.630> sets<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> signal<00:01:22.200> strength<00:01:22.380> to

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
players it sets the signal strength to

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.149 
players it sets the signal strength to
the<00:01:22.740> number<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.070> players<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.580> two<00:01:23.670> texts<00:01:25.159> now

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
the number of players it two texts now

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.760 
the number of players it two texts now
what<00:01:27.000> happens<00:01:27.270> here<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:28.049> tries<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.320> set<00:01:28.619> its

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
what happens here is it tries to set its

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.350 
what happens here is it tries to set its
success<00:01:29.070> count<00:01:29.280> 21<00:01:29.460> it's<00:01:29.729> currently<00:01:30.000> at<00:01:30.060> zero

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
success count 21 it's currently at zero

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.230 
success count 21 it's currently at zero
so<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:31.320> says<00:01:31.530> its<00:01:31.740> success<00:01:32.040> count<00:01:32.220> 21<00:01:32.369> which

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
so it says its success count 21 which

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.289 
so it says its success count 21 which
causes<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.960> comparator<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.530> turn<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.299> it

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
causes the comparator to turn on and it

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.109 
causes the comparator to turn on and it
now<00:01:36.689> has<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.869> success<00:01:37.740> count<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.220> one<00:01:38.520> if<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.880> try

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
now has a success count of one if I try

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.679 
now has a success count of one if I try
and<00:01:39.270> run<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.540> command<00:01:39.630> again<00:01:40.909> its<00:01:41.909> success

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
and run that command again its success

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.260 
and run that command again its success
County<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.049> already<00:01:43.500> one<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.640> can't<00:01:44.909> change

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
County is already one so it can't change

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.179 
County is already one so it can't change
its<00:01:45.420> success<00:01:45.780> tag<00:01:46.290> which<00:01:46.470> means<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
its success tag which means that the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.670 
its success tag which means that the
block<00:01:47.430> did<00:01:47.640> command<00:01:48.030> failed<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.840> as<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.530> result

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
block did command failed and as a result

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.639 
block did command failed and as a result
it<00:01:50.040> sets<00:01:50.399> its<00:01:50.579> success<00:01:51.180> count<00:01:51.450> tag<00:01:51.899> back<00:01:52.380> to

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
it sets its success count tag back to

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.060 
it sets its success count tag back to
zero<00:01:52.920> turning<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> comparator<00:01:53.909> off<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.810> it's

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
zero turning the comparator off so it's

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.940 
zero turning the comparator off so it's
basically<00:01:56.090> it's<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.329> very<00:01:57.810> very<00:01:58.079> small<00:01:58.259> T

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
basically it's a very very small T

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.469 
basically it's a very very small T
flip-flop<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.549> can<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.969> compare<00:02:00.270> this

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
flip-flop and you can you compare this

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.910 
flip-flop and you can you compare this
in<00:02:00.600> any<00:02:00.719> way<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.930> like<00:02:01.140> i'm<00:02:01.350> using<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.649> button

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
in any way you like i'm using a button

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.249 
in any way you like i'm using a button
right<00:02:02.070> now<00:02:02.479> but<00:02:03.479> yeah<00:02:03.630> that's<00:02:03.840> really<00:02:04.049> handy

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
right now but yeah that's really handy

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.499 
right now but yeah that's really handy
because<00:02:04.490> comparators<00:02:05.490> don't<00:02:05.909> give<00:02:06.090> off<00:02:06.240> any

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
because comparators don't give off any

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.040 
because comparators don't give off any
particles<00:02:07.200> they<00:02:07.469> don't<00:02:07.649> cause<00:02:07.860> light<00:02:08.099> updates

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
particles they don't cause light updates

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.199 
particles they don't cause light updates
so<00:02:10.160> whichever<00:02:11.160> state<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.700> in<00:02:11.849> this

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
so whichever state this is in this

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.800 
so whichever state this is in this
causes<00:02:12.540> absolutely<00:02:13.140> no<00:02:13.319> lag

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
causes absolutely no lag

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.420 
causes absolutely no lag
only<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.380> tiny<00:02:14.590> little<00:02:14.739> bit<00:02:14.950> of<00:02:15.040> lag<00:02:15.220> when

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
only the tiny little bit of lag when

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.120 
only the tiny little bit of lag when
when<00:02:15.700> it's<00:02:15.819> when<00:02:16.150> it's<00:02:16.180> powered<00:02:16.599> of<00:02:16.720> course

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
when it's when it's powered of course

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.650 
when it's when it's powered of course
the<00:02:18.480> 1.7<00:02:19.480> version<00:02:19.840> is<00:02:19.989> very<00:02:20.890> similar<00:02:21.550> what<00:02:22.540> it

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
the 1.7 version is very similar what it

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.570 
the 1.7 version is very similar what it
does<00:02:22.930> is<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.200> uses<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.620> test<00:02:24.069> for<00:02:24.310> block

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
does is it uses the test for block

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.780 
does is it uses the test for block
command<00:02:25.680> this<00:02:26.680> number<00:02:27.040> here<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:29.459> this<00:02:30.459> number

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
command this number here and this number

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.210 
command this number here and this number
here<00:02:31.090> changes<00:02:31.840> depending<00:02:32.290> on<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.980> direction

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
here changes depending on the direction

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.660 
here changes depending on the direction
I<00:02:33.760> have<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.290> four<00:02:35.860> different<00:02:36.250> directions

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
I have the the four different directions

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.080 
I have the the four different directions
in<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.269> video<00:02:37.690> description<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:39.670> it

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
in the video description and it

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.250 
in the video description and it
basically<00:02:40.360> just<00:02:40.660> depends<00:02:40.930> on<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.050> direction

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
basically just depends on the direction

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.000 
basically just depends on the direction
what<00:02:41.410> this<00:02:41.590> does<00:02:41.830> is<00:02:42.069> it<00:02:42.790> tests<00:02:43.680> for<00:02:44.680> an

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
what this does is it tests for an

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.490 
what this does is it tests for an
unpowered<00:02:45.760> comparator<00:02:46.450> in<00:02:46.569> this<00:02:46.690> spot<00:02:46.959> so

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
unpowered comparator in this spot so

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.539 
unpowered comparator in this spot so
right<00:02:47.650> now<00:02:47.680> there<00:02:48.069> is<00:02:48.190> an<00:02:48.280> unpowered

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
right now there is an unpowered

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.699 
right now there is an unpowered
comparator<00:02:49.030> in<00:02:49.090> this<00:02:49.209> spot<00:02:49.420> if<00:02:49.840> I<00:02:49.900> press<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:50.140> it

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
comparator in this spot if I press it it

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.550 
comparator in this spot if I press it it
finds<00:02:51.610> one<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:51.970> because<00:02:52.630> it<00:02:52.780> successfully

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
finds one and because it successfully

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.289 
finds one and because it successfully
found<00:02:53.680> one<00:02:53.890> it<00:02:53.980> gives<00:02:54.100> a<00:02:54.310> success<00:02:54.970> count<00:02:55.209> of

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
found one it gives a success count of

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:56.729 
found one it gives a success count of
one<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:55.510> turns<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.930> comparator<00:02:56.319> on<00:02:56.410> now<00:02:56.560> next

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
one and turns the comparator on now next

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.479 
one and turns the comparator on now next
time<00:02:56.920> it<00:02:57.040> tries<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.370> find<00:02:57.610> a<00:02:58.349> an<00:02:59.489> unpowered

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
time it tries to find a an unpowered

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:01.740 
time it tries to find a an unpowered
comparator<00:03:01.060> there<00:03:01.209> it<00:03:01.299> only<00:03:01.360> founds<00:03:01.690> a

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
comparator there it only founds a

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.160 
comparator there it only founds a
powered<00:03:02.049> one<00:03:02.230> so<00:03:02.709> it<00:03:03.160> fails<00:03:03.819> and<00:03:04.299> sets<00:03:04.989> its

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
powered one so it fails and sets its

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.589 
powered one so it fails and sets its
success<00:03:05.500> count<00:03:05.709> 20<00:03:06.069> updating<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.150> comparator

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
success count 20 updating the comparator

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.140 
success count 20 updating the comparator
and<00:03:07.720> turning<00:03:08.049> the<00:03:08.110> signal<00:03:08.410> off<00:03:08.910> works<00:03:09.910> really

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
and turning the signal off works really

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.350 
and turning the signal off works really
nicely<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:10.750> I<00:03:11.319> like<00:03:11.680> I<00:03:11.860> have<00:03:12.069> the<00:03:12.220> only<00:03:12.370> slight

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
nicely and I like I have the only slight

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.090 
nicely and I like I have the only slight
flaw<00:03:13.599> with<00:03:13.870> this<00:03:14.019> is<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.730> gives<00:03:16.180> out<00:03:16.450> a

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
flaw with this is that it gives out a

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.190 
flaw with this is that it gives out a
power<00:03:18.100> strength<00:03:18.549> of<00:03:18.790> one<00:03:19.299> so<00:03:19.840> it's<00:03:19.989> quite<00:03:20.140> a

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
power strength of one so it's quite a

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.740 
power strength of one so it's quite a
week<00:03:20.440> output<00:03:21.000> that's<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.120> only<00:03:22.299> main<00:03:22.480> floor

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
week output that's the only main floor

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.349 
week output that's the only main floor
with<00:03:22.870> this<00:03:23.019> you<00:03:23.410> can<00:03:23.620> of<00:03:23.739> course<00:03:24.239> extend<00:03:25.239> that

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
with this you can of course extend that

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.930 
with this you can of course extend that
very<00:03:25.600> easily<00:03:25.780> using<00:03:26.320> a<00:03:26.440> repeater<00:03:27.280> it<00:03:27.609> doesn't

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
very easily using a repeater it doesn't

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.210 
very easily using a repeater it doesn't
damage<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.420> designer<00:03:28.840> in<00:03:29.019> any<00:03:29.200> way<00:03:29.470> or<00:03:30.190> a

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
damage the designer in any way or a

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.729 
damage the designer in any way or a
torch<00:03:30.549> if<00:03:30.760> you<00:03:30.850> wanted<00:03:31.150> to<00:03:31.350> extend<00:03:32.350> it<00:03:32.590> that

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
torch if you wanted to extend it that

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.920 
torch if you wanted to extend it that
way<00:03:32.920> but<00:03:32.980> bear<00:03:33.940> in<00:03:33.970> mind<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:34.420> as<00:03:34.870> I<00:03:35.049> said

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
way but bear in mind that as I said

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.840 
way but bear in mind that as I said
torches<00:03:37.930> give<00:03:38.109> off<00:03:38.230> particles<00:03:38.799> and<00:03:39.100> they

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
torches give off particles and they

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.220 
torches give off particles and they
cause<00:03:40.060> light<00:03:40.239> updates<00:03:40.600> when<00:03:40.750> they<00:03:40.870> when<00:03:41.109> they

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
cause light updates when they when they

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.039 
cause light updates when they when they
change<00:03:41.500> so<00:03:42.299> you<00:03:43.299> know<00:03:43.420> you<00:03:43.480> can<00:03:43.540> extend<00:03:43.930> the

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
change so you know you can extend the

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.470 
change so you know you can extend the
signal<00:03:44.350> but<00:03:44.620> if<00:03:44.980> possible<00:03:45.250> I'd<00:03:45.579> recommend

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
signal but if possible I'd recommend

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.390 
signal but if possible I'd recommend
connected<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:47.109> connecting<00:03:47.920> it<00:03:47.980> directly<00:03:48.069> to

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
connected to connecting it directly to

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.660 
connected to connecting it directly to
any<00:03:48.489> redstone<00:03:48.940> that<00:03:49.120> you<00:03:49.239> are<00:03:49.359> using<00:03:50.639> so<00:03:51.639> I

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
any redstone that you are using so I

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.640 
any redstone that you are using so I
mean<00:03:52.019> considering<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:53.200> different<00:03:53.470> things

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
mean considering the different things

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.780 
mean considering the different things
that<00:03:53.709> we're<00:03:53.859> trying<00:03:53.889> to<00:03:54.100> avoid<00:03:54.250> here<00:03:54.549> it's

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
that we're trying to avoid here it's

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.580 
that we're trying to avoid here it's
really<00:03:55.090> doing<00:03:55.569> a<00:03:55.630> good<00:03:55.780> job<00:03:55.840> I<00:03:56.170> mean<00:03:56.319> light

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
really doing a good job I mean light

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.530 
really doing a good job I mean light
updates<00:03:57.010> and<00:03:57.220> particles<00:03:57.700> from<00:03:57.819> torches<00:03:58.329> of

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
updates and particles from torches of

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.920 
updates and particles from torches of
both<00:03:58.720> cause<00:03:58.930> lag<00:03:59.250> particles<00:04:00.359> from<00:04:01.359> redstone

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
both cause lag particles from redstone

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.170 
both cause lag particles from redstone
dust<00:04:02.079> and<00:04:02.319> also<00:04:02.620> any<00:04:02.799> updates<00:04:03.609> in<00:04:03.790> redstone

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
dust and also any updates in redstone

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.150 
dust and also any updates in redstone
dust<00:04:04.389> signal<00:04:04.810> strength<00:04:05.109> the<00:04:05.560> algorithm<00:04:05.799> that

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
dust signal strength the algorithm that

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.569 
dust signal strength the algorithm that
updates<00:04:06.549> redstone<00:04:07.389> dust<00:04:07.540> is<00:04:07.780> very

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
updates redstone dust is very

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.710 
updates redstone dust is very
inefficient<00:04:09.579> we've<00:04:09.880> got<00:04:10.060> light<00:04:10.239> updates<00:04:10.569> and

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
inefficient we've got light updates and

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.960 
inefficient we've got light updates and
particles<00:04:11.139> from<00:04:11.290> repeaters<00:04:11.799> and<00:04:11.970> moving

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
particles from repeaters and moving

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.300 
particles from repeaters and moving
blocks<00:04:13.269> which<00:04:13.630> a<00:04:13.780> lot<00:04:13.989> of<00:04:14.019> T<00:04:14.560> flip-flops<00:04:15.069> have

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
blocks which a lot of T flip-flops have

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.979 
blocks which a lot of T flip-flops have
now<00:04:15.489> we<00:04:15.549> can<00:04:15.730> see<00:04:15.910> three<00:04:16.660> of<00:04:16.780> those<00:04:16.930> things

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
now we can see three of those things

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.500 
now we can see three of those things
right<00:04:17.560> here<00:04:17.590> actually<00:04:18.160> all<00:04:18.850> four<00:04:19.180> I<00:04:19.209> think

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
right here actually all four I think

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.100 
right here actually all four I think
we've<00:04:19.660> got<00:04:19.780> light<00:04:19.959> updates<00:04:20.489> particles

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
we've got light updates particles

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.200 
we've got light updates particles
redstone<00:04:23.110> updates<00:04:23.500> and<00:04:23.800> moving<00:04:24.130> blocks<00:04:24.400> so<00:04:24.970> I

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
redstone updates and moving blocks so I

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.270 
redstone updates and moving blocks so I
mean<00:04:25.570> there<00:04:25.720> are<00:04:25.840> other<00:04:26.169> versions

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
mean there are other versions

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.920 
mean there are other versions
of<00:04:27.340> T<00:04:27.490> flip<00:04:27.730> flops<00:04:27.970> but<00:04:28.180> I<00:04:28.270> think<00:04:28.420> most<00:04:28.660> of<00:04:28.780> them

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
of T flip flops but I think most of them

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.060 
of T flip flops but I think most of them
contain<00:04:29.590> at<00:04:30.010> least<00:04:30.070> one<00:04:30.400> of<00:04:30.550> these<00:04:30.730> things<00:04:31.000> so

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
contain at least one of these things so

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.250 
contain at least one of these things so
it's<00:04:33.070> a<00:04:33.280> fairly<00:04:33.400> neat<00:04:33.639> design<00:04:33.940> I<00:04:34.150> hope<00:04:35.020> that

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
it's a fairly neat design I hope that

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.990 
it's a fairly neat design I hope that
people<00:04:35.440> can<00:04:35.650> find<00:04:35.770> this<00:04:35.919> useful<00:04:36.130> I<00:04:36.490> certainly

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
people can find this useful I certainly

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.270 
people can find this useful I certainly
will<00:04:37.180> be<00:04:37.330> using<00:04:37.510> this<00:04:37.720> a<00:04:37.870> lot<00:04:37.900> I<00:04:38.169> think<00:04:38.320> it's

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
will be using this a lot I think it's

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
will be using this a lot I think it's
just<00:04:39.610> really<00:04:40.080> handy<00:04:41.080> and<00:04:41.290> I<00:04:41.500> think<00:04:41.560> it's<00:04:41.830> just

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
just really handy and I think it's just

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.580 
just really handy and I think it's just
about<00:04:43.300> as<00:04:43.600> small<00:04:43.840> as<00:04:43.990> you<00:04:44.080> can<00:04:44.200> get<00:04:44.380> a<00:04:44.410> tee

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
about as small as you can get a tee

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.460 
about as small as you can get a tee
flip-flop<00:04:45.010> design<00:04:45.280> I<00:04:45.310> think<00:04:46.110> so<00:04:47.110> yeah<00:04:47.230> thank

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
flip-flop design I think so yeah thank

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.080 
flip-flop design I think so yeah thank
