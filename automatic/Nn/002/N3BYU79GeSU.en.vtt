I'm gonna paint on this but then there
was<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.480> die<00:00:27.779> next<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.890> was<00:00:28.980> like<00:00:29.039> I'm

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
was a die next to it so I was like I'm

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.259 
was a die next to it so I was like I'm
gonna<00:00:29.310> paint<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.760> but<00:00:30.000> it's<00:00:30.090> gonna<00:00:30.179> be

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
gonna paint on this but it's gonna be

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.450 
gonna paint on this but it's gonna be
smaller<00:00:30.630> than<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.929> dime<00:00:34.280> whatever<00:00:35.280> i'm

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
smaller than a dime whatever i'm

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.760 
smaller than a dime whatever i'm
painting<00:00:35.760> it's<00:00:36.450> i<00:00:36.719> have<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.110> think<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.530> i

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
painting it's i have to think that i

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.910 
painting it's i have to think that i
don't<00:00:38.160> really<00:00:38.340> like<00:00:38.610> plan<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.120> out<00:00:39.239> it's<00:00:39.600> just

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
don't really like plan it out it's just

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.049 
don't really like plan it out it's just
instinctive<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.610> has<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.969> be

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
instinctive like this this has to be

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.720 
instinctive like this this has to be
done<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.710> that<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.890> authentic<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.489> me<00:00:44.520> because

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
done and that is authentic to me because

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.819 
done and that is authentic to me because
i<00:00:44.969> think<00:00:45.030> that's<00:00:45.390> where<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.660> individual<00:00:46.440> part

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
i think that's where the individual part

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.830 
i think that's where the individual part
comes<00:00:47.100> through<00:00:47.370> taking<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.210> know<00:00:48.300> taking<00:00:48.600> a

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
comes through taking you know taking a

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.770 
comes through taking you know taking a
step<00:00:49.079> outside<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.980> valid<00:00:50.250> reason<00:00:50.780> you

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
step outside of the valid reason you

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.689 
step outside of the valid reason you
really<00:00:52.050> don't<00:00:52.230> know<00:00:52.410> where<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:53.010> line<00:00:53.670> is

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
really don't know where that line is

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.700 
really don't know where that line is
until<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.719> cross<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:57.410> thought<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> lot<00:00:58.590> of

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
until you cross it I thought a lot of

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.959 
until you cross it I thought a lot of
people<00:00:58.890> say<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.160> know<00:00:59.280> we<00:00:59.430> don't<00:00:59.550> know<00:00:59.760> what

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
people say you know we don't know what

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.279 
people say you know we don't know what
you're<00:01:00.120> going<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.300> put<00:01:00.510> up<00:01:00.629> but<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:00.989> know<00:01:01.140> it's

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
you're going to put up but we know it's

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.689 
you're going to put up but we know it's
going<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.500> be<00:01:01.559> good<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.070> that's<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.550> good

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
going to be good and that's a good

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.329 
going to be good and that's a good
feeling<00:01:02.760> like<00:01:03.239> not<00:01:03.510> being<00:01:03.750> predictable<00:01:04.409> this

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
feeling like not being predictable this

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.820 
feeling like not being predictable this
particular<00:01:05.549> piece<00:01:06.060> when<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.360> saw<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:07.290> logo<00:01:07.650> far

it's something that I've been familiar

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.200 
it's something that I've been familiar
with<00:01:22.100> one<00:01:23.100> thing<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.400> stands<00:01:23.640> out<00:01:23.759> for<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.060> is

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
with one thing that stands out for it is

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.990 
with one thing that stands out for it is
is<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.900> bottle<00:01:25.229> it's<00:01:25.439> not<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.830> classical<00:01:26.460> style

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
is the bottle it's not a classical style

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.190 
is the bottle it's not a classical style
bottle<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.360> think<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.810> really<00:01:27.960> awesome

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.350 
bottle I think it's a really awesome
bottle<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:28.860> it's<00:01:29.130> kind<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.369> individual<00:01:30.000> thing

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
bottle so it's kind of individual thing

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.819 
bottle so it's kind of individual thing
