00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.250 

there's<00:03:09.880> a<00:03:09.940> lot<00:03:10.090> of<00:03:10.120> water<00:03:10.360> on<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:11.080> hoods

there's a lot of water on the hoods

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.809 
there's a lot of water on the hoods
there<00:03:11.590> so<00:03:11.830> it's<00:03:11.950> going<00:03:12.069> to<00:03:12.160> take<00:03:12.340> it<00:03:12.520> a<00:03:12.670> couple

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
underneath the carport and it's shaded

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.220 
underneath the carport and it's shaded
so<00:03:36.430> I<00:03:36.910> try<00:03:37.270> to<00:03:37.300> do<00:03:37.480> it<00:03:37.570> when<00:03:37.690> it's<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:37.930> sunniest

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
so I try to do it when it's the sunniest

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.130 
so I try to do it when it's the sunniest
outside<00:03:38.650> but<00:03:38.950> still<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:40.360> light<00:03:40.540> is<00:03:40.720> sometimes

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
outside but still the light is sometimes

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.510 
outside but still the light is sometimes
not<00:03:41.380> always<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.740> best<00:03:41.920> I<00:03:43.830> think<00:03:44.830> you<00:03:45.130> can<00:03:45.310> see

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
not always the best I think you can see

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.850 
not always the best I think you can see
there<00:03:45.730> that<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:46.360> right<00:03:47.260> side<00:03:47.530> of<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.680> hood

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
there that the right side of the hood

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.540 
there that the right side of the hood
has<00:03:48.190> just<00:03:48.760> about<00:03:49.090> completely<00:03:50.400> cheated<00:03:51.400> all

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
has just about completely cheated all

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.400 
has just about completely cheated all
the<00:03:51.760> water<00:03:51.970> off<00:03:52.180> of<00:03:52.210> the<00:03:52.420> hood<00:03:52.600> there's<00:03:53.290> almost

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
the water off of the hood there's almost

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.250 
the water off of the hood there's almost
no<00:03:53.740> water<00:03:53.980> left<00:03:54.280> on<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:54.790> on<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.660> reload<00:03:55.990> side

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
no water left on the on the reload side

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.490 
no water left on the on the reload side
of<00:03:56.530> this<00:03:56.980> hood<00:03:57.220> and<00:03:57.930> you<00:03:58.930> can<00:03:59.050> see<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.320> the

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
of this hood and you can see the the

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.230 
of this hood and you can see the the
left<00:03:59.680> side<00:03:59.860> is<00:04:00.130> sheathing<00:04:00.490> the<00:04:00.610> water<00:04:00.790> but

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
left side is sheathing the water but

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.440 
left side is sheathing the water but
it's<00:04:01.420> doing<00:04:01.630> it<00:04:01.690> very<00:04:01.900> slowly<00:04:02.520> I<00:04:03.520> think<00:04:04.240> if<00:04:04.360> you

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
it's doing it very slowly I think if you

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.920 
it's doing it very slowly I think if you
probably<00:04:05.670> you<00:04:06.670> know<00:04:06.790> let<00:04:06.970> this<00:04:07.090> go<00:04:07.330> for<00:04:07.360> a

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
probably you know let this go for a

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.580 
probably you know let this go for a
little<00:04:08.350> while<00:04:10.080> you<00:04:11.080> would<00:04:11.200> see<00:04:11.380> it<00:04:11.470> to

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
little while you would see it to

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.040 
little while you would see it to
continue<00:04:11.920> to<00:04:12.040> sheet<00:04:12.340> off<00:04:12.490> but<00:04:12.910> this<00:04:13.690> is<00:04:13.750> just<00:04:13.960> a

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
continue to sheet off but this is just a

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.750 
continue to sheet off but this is just a
general<00:04:14.290> comparison<00:04:14.620> so<00:04:15.100> we<00:04:15.370> pull<00:04:15.550> it<00:04:15.640> more

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
general comparison so we pull it more

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:24.750 
general comparison so we pull it more
water<00:04:15.910> on<00:04:16.030> it<00:04:16.239> you<00:04:16.300> can<00:04:16.450> see<00:04:16.570> real<00:04:16.750> quick<00:04:23.760> of

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
water on it you can see real quick of

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:39.760 
water on it you can see real quick of
how<00:04:24.910> these<00:04:25.060> two<00:04:25.270> different<00:04:25.600> sides<00:04:25.780> react

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.760 

I<00:04:40.569> hope<00:04:41.569> that's<00:04:41.750> coming<00:04:41.990> out<00:04:42.110> again<00:04:42.470> this<00:04:42.620> has

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
once it's been washed once just just

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.080 
once it's been washed once just just
regular<00:05:02.629> soap<00:05:02.870> and<00:05:03.169> uh<00:05:03.340> we'll<00:05:04.340> wash<00:05:04.550> pad<00:05:04.819> but

anything<00:05:08.870> like<00:05:09.020> that<00:05:09.050> this<00:05:09.349> is<00:05:09.500> just<00:05:09.530> still

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
anything like that this is just still

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:38.050 
anything like that this is just still
the<00:05:10.060> the<00:05:11.060> the<00:05:11.449> coatings<00:05:11.780> as<00:05:11.930> I<00:05:12.020> put<00:05:12.199> them<00:05:12.319> on

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.670 

it's<00:05:39.060> one<00:05:39.360> last<00:05:39.570> time<00:05:39.810> you<00:05:40.020> guys<00:05:40.139> can<00:05:40.380> see<00:05:40.590> it

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
it's one last time you guys can see it

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.900 
it's one last time you guys can see it
sheet<00:05:40.950> here<00:05:42.530> and<00:05:43.530> then<00:05:44.340> I<00:05:44.370> think<00:05:44.669> we'll<00:05:44.850> be

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
sheet here and then I think we'll be

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.090 
sheet here and then I think we'll be
wrapping<00:05:45.120> this<00:05:45.330> up<00:05:45.540> and<00:05:45.780> I'll<00:05:45.900> test<00:05:46.650> again<00:05:46.919> in

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
wrapping this up and I'll test again in

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.629 
wrapping this up and I'll test again in
another<00:05:47.160> two<00:05:47.370> weeks<00:05:48.889> just<00:05:49.889> after<00:05:50.130> my<00:05:50.250> birthday

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
another two weeks just after my birthday

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.950 
another two weeks just after my birthday
in<00:05:50.970> September<00:05:51.150> around<00:05:52.430> 25th<00:05:53.430> and<00:05:53.700> then<00:05:54.630> we'll

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
in September around 25th and then we'll

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:08.550 
in September around 25th and then we'll
see<00:05:55.080> where<00:05:55.230> Rhett

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.400 

just<00:06:09.100> let<00:06:09.280> this<00:06:09.600> finish<00:06:10.600> eating<00:06:10.960> off<00:06:11.050> here<00:06:11.290> but

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
just let this finish eating off here but

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.990 
just let this finish eating off here but
I<00:06:11.500> think<00:06:11.650> you<00:06:11.740> guys<00:06:11.860> get<00:06:12.070> the<00:06:12.130> idea

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.660 

as<00:06:16.390> you<00:06:16.540> can<00:06:16.690> see<00:06:16.840> just<00:06:17.140> about<00:06:17.470> now<00:06:17.710> the<00:06:18.310> entire

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:18.670 
as you can see just about now the entire

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.640 
as you can see just about now the entire
right<00:06:18.940> side<00:06:18.970> has<00:06:19.390> completely<00:06:20.050> shaded<00:06:20.290> all<00:06:20.530> the

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
right side has completely shaded all the

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.310 
right side has completely shaded all the
water<00:06:20.830> off<00:06:21.300> and<00:06:22.300> the<00:06:22.510> water<00:06:22.720> is<00:06:22.870> more<00:06:23.200> or<00:06:23.260> less

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
water off and the water is more or less

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.990 
water off and the water is more or less
sitting<00:06:25.830> on<00:06:26.830> the<00:06:26.980> left<00:06:27.130> side<00:06:27.340> which<00:06:27.610> was<00:06:27.790> the

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
sitting on the left side which was the

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.170 
sitting on the left side which was the
opti<00:06:28.600> seal<00:06:28.780> side<00:06:29.430> I'm<00:06:30.430> glad<00:06:30.610> we<00:06:30.730> can<00:06:30.850> see<00:06:31.030> the

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
opti seal side I'm glad we can see the

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.860 
opti seal side I'm glad we can see the
tape<00:06:31.600> line<00:06:31.750> a<00:06:31.780> little<00:06:32.020> bit<00:06:32.140> better<00:06:32.260> now<00:06:33.870> than
