used to do this a lot and then sit down
was<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.820> player<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.240> copied<00:01:18.630> from<00:01:18.659> so

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
was the player that I copied from so

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.929 
was the player that I copied from so
basically<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:20.100> putting<00:01:20.310> your<00:01:20.520> foot<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:20.850> top

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
basically it's putting your foot on top

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.910 
basically it's putting your foot on top
of<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.299> ball<00:01:21.540> rolling<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.439> behind<00:01:22.710> your

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
of the ball rolling it behind your

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.039 
of the ball rolling it behind your
standing<00:01:23.009> legs<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.790> then<00:01:24.090> tapping<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.659> for

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
standing legs and then tapping it for

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.899 
standing legs and then tapping it for
the<00:01:25.110> inside<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.590> your<00:01:25.740> foot<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.520> go<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.790> other

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
the inside of your foot to go the other

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.600 
the inside of your foot to go the other
way<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.409> if<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.590> was<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.740> use<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.250> game<00:01:29.400> I

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
way so if I was to use this in a game I

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.999 
way so if I was to use this in a game I
could<00:01:29.850> pretend<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.420> shoot<00:01:30.689> or<00:01:31.290> pass<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.799> ball

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
could pretend to shoot or pass the ball

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.060 
could pretend to shoot or pass the ball
and<00:01:32.250> then<00:01:32.880> roll<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.240> back<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.450> go<00:01:33.780> but<00:01:34.380> also<00:01:34.560> I

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
and then roll it back and go but also I

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.280 
and then roll it back and go but also I
can<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.729> one<00:01:35.939> fluid<00:01:36.210> motion<00:01:36.509> where<00:01:37.259> I

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
can do this in one fluid motion where I

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.109 
can do this in one fluid motion where I
could<00:01:37.619> use<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.009> sole<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.549> foot<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.909> then

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
could use the sole of the foot and then

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.700 
could use the sole of the foot and then
the<00:01:39.240> inside<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.720> my<00:01:39.780> foot<00:01:40.020> without<00:01:40.259> taking<00:01:40.619> my

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
the inside of my foot without taking my

now<00:03:33.730> with<00:03:33.880> this<00:03:34.000> skill<00:03:34.299> all<00:03:34.660> you<00:03:34.780> need<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:34.989> do

now with this skill all you need to do

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.840 
now with this skill all you need to do
is<00:03:35.200> make<00:03:35.380> sure<00:03:35.410> that<00:03:35.799> you<00:03:35.920> bring<00:03:36.519> your<00:03:36.640> foot

is make sure that you bring your foot
around<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.329> ball<00:03:37.420> so<00:03:38.079> it's<00:03:38.200> like<00:03:38.320> pretending

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
around the ball so it's like pretending

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.319 
around the ball so it's like pretending
to<00:03:38.950> pass<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.370> ball<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:39.670> outside<00:03:40.150> of<00:03:40.269> your

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
foot and then use the other foot to take

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.340 
foot and then use the other foot to take
away<00:03:42.790> because<00:03:43.299> they<00:03:43.420> start<00:03:43.750> figuring<00:03:43.959> out

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
away because they start figuring out

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.500 
away because they start figuring out
what<00:03:44.950> you're<00:03:45.100> doing<00:03:45.130> then<00:03:45.850> you<00:03:45.970> pretend<00:03:46.360> to

take the ball with one foot and then

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.360 
take the ball with one foot and then
fake<00:03:48.850> again<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.630> then<00:03:50.140> beat<00:03:50.350> the<00:03:50.470> player<00:03:50.709> if

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370

get as good as a Dan just remember it

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.830 
get as good as a Dan just remember it
takes<00:04:09.280> a<00:04:09.400> lot<00:04:09.579> of<00:04:09.610> practice<00:04:10.090> a<00:04:10.329> lot<00:04:10.780> of

takes a lot of practice a lot of

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.319 
takes a lot of practice a lot of
dedication<00:04:11.320> to<00:04:11.709> get<00:04:12.100> that<00:04:12.280> good<00:04:12.489> try<00:04:13.030> and<00:04:13.209> bet

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
dedication to get that good try and bet

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.280 
dedication to get that good try and bet
yourself<00:04:13.780> try<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:14.709> do<00:04:14.799> things<00:04:15.040> faster

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
yourself try and do things faster

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.440 
yourself try and do things faster
and<00:04:16.380> you<00:04:17.220> will<00:04:17.370> get<00:04:17.520> quick<00:04:17.790> feet<00:04:18.030> with<00:04:18.240> your

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
and you will get quick feet with your

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.480 
and you will get quick feet with your
right<00:04:18.660> foot<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.080> your<00:04:19.410> left<00:04:19.560> foot<00:04:19.620> so<00:04:20.370> the

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:20.490 
right foot and your left foot so the

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.950 
right foot and your left foot so the
first<00:04:20.730> thing<00:04:20.940> we're<00:04:21.030> going<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.180> do<00:04:21.360> is<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.600> tap

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
first thing we're going to do is a tap

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.530 
first thing we're going to do is a tap
tap<00:04:22.170> role<00:04:22.470> so<00:04:22.890> it's<00:04:23.040> two<00:04:23.340> taps<00:04:23.670> and<00:04:24.030> then<00:04:24.510> a

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
tap role so it's two taps and then a

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.890 
tap role so it's two taps and then a
role<00:04:24.810> so<00:04:25.320> tap<00:04:25.740> tap<00:04:26.310> role<00:04:26.850> so<00:04:27.300> your<00:04:27.420> alternate

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
role so tap tap role so your alternate

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.420 
role so tap tap role so your alternate
feet<00:04:28.080> you<00:04:28.230> never<00:04:28.410> use<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.710> same<00:04:28.890> foot<00:04:29.160> twice

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
feet you never use the same foot twice

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.090 
feet you never use the same foot twice
so<00:04:30.060> it's<00:04:30.360> tap<00:04:30.630> with<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:30.840> right<00:04:31.050> leg<00:04:31.260> tap<00:04:31.920> of

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
so it's tap with the right leg tap of

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.860 
so it's tap with the right leg tap of
the<00:04:32.160> left<00:04:32.370> leg<00:04:32.550> and<00:04:32.790> then<00:04:33.270> roll<00:04:33.600> with<00:04:33.780> the

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
the left leg and then roll with the

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.170 
the left leg and then roll with the
right<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.320> then<00:04:34.680> you<00:04:34.800> switch<00:04:35.070> it<00:04:35.250> around<00:04:35.310> so

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
right and then you switch it around so

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.020 
right and then you switch it around so
it's<00:04:36.330> left<00:04:36.540> right<00:04:36.810> left<00:04:37.380> and<00:04:38.100> then<00:04:38.430> right<00:04:38.700> left

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
it's left right left and then right left

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.320 
it's left right left and then right left
right

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
right

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.010 
right
so<00:04:39.900> it's<00:04:40.290> tap<00:04:40.590> tap<00:04:40.920> role<00:04:41.280> tap<00:04:41.790> tap<00:04:42.150> role<00:04:42.420> get

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
so it's tap tap role tap tap role get

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.760 
so it's tap tap role tap tap role get
that<00:04:43.170> in<00:04:43.260> your<00:04:43.350> head

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
that in your head
