composted material falls down to the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.060 
composted material falls down to the
bottom<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.629> if<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.290> open<00:00:46.530> up<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.710> bottom

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
bottom and if you open up the bottom

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.160 
bottom and if you open up the bottom
what<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.550> get<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.120> actual<00:00:48.480> composted

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
what you get is the actual composted

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.600 
what you get is the actual composted
material<00:00:49.290> at<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.950> bottom<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.370> never

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
material at the bottom so you never

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.279 
material at the bottom so you never
really<00:00:51.030> have<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.360> do<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.660> turning<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.200> you

very simple composter but it's got a
large<00:01:08.280> capacity<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.210> it'll<00:01:09.450> accommodate<00:01:09.930> a

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
large capacity so it'll accommodate a

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.840 
large capacity so it'll accommodate a
lot<00:01:10.410> of<00:01:10.560> yard<00:01:10.770> waste<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.310> lot<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.490> garden

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
scraps and it doesn't have a bottom so

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.770 
scraps and it doesn't have a bottom so
it's<00:01:14.610> really<00:01:14.790> nice<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.330> pick<00:01:15.540> up<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
is a little tumblr yeah this is called

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.039 
is a little tumblr yeah this is called
the<00:01:27.750> tumbleweed<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:29.220> top<00:01:29.509> opens<00:01:30.509> here<00:01:30.840> so

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
the tumbleweed and the top opens here so

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.820 
the tumbleweed and the top opens here so
you<00:01:31.110> can<00:01:31.320> put<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.619> waste<00:01:31.830> in<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.220> top<00:01:32.430> and

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
you can put the waste in the top and

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.100 
you can put the waste in the top and
then<00:01:34.830> you<00:01:35.610> just<00:01:35.790> simply<00:01:36.030> turn<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:36.869> rather

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
then you just simply turn it so rather

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.740 
then you just simply turn it so rather
than<00:01:37.439> using<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:38.009> pitchfork<00:01:38.220> or<00:01:38.820> heavy<00:01:39.240> lifting

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
than using a pitchfork or heavy lifting

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.929 
than using a pitchfork or heavy lifting
you<00:01:40.350> just<00:01:40.560> give<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.920> couple<00:01:41.070> spins<00:01:41.490> when<00:01:41.850> you

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
you just give it a couple spins when you

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.539 
you just give it a couple spins when you
walk<00:01:42.090> out<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> yard<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.009> the<00:01:44.009> spinning<00:01:44.400> it

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
walk out in the yard and the spinning it

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.429 
walk out in the yard and the spinning it
adds<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.030> aeration<00:01:45.360> into<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.900> compost<00:01:46.229> so

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
adds the aeration into the compost so

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.140 
adds the aeration into the compost so
it'll<00:01:46.650> actually<00:01:46.829> go<00:01:47.159> considerably<00:01:47.909> faster

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
it'll actually go considerably faster

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.149 
it'll actually go considerably faster
when<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.689> has<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.110> air<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.860> when<00:01:50.009> it's

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
when it has the air and so when it's

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.770 
when it has the air and so when it's
done<00:01:50.340> all<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.640> do<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.880> open<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.210> up<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.509> spill

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
done all you do is open it up and spill

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.389 
done all you do is open it up and spill
it<00:01:51.899> out<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.470> put<00:01:52.710> into<00:01:52.860> your<00:01:52.920> wheel<00:01:53.070> barrel

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
it out that put into your wheel barrel

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.710 
it out that put into your wheel barrel
so<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.670> makes<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:53.939> really<00:01:54.090> easy

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
so that makes it really easy

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.600 
so that makes it really easy
