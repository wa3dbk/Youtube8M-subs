00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
let's go ahead and I call it the circle

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.000 
let's go ahead and I call it the circle
ok<00:02:17.030> so<00:02:17.750> I'm<00:02:17.870> going<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.140> do<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.470> little<00:02:18.650> tight

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
ok so I'm going to do a little tight

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.190 
ok so I'm going to do a little tight
shot<00:02:19.400> on<00:02:19.640> this<00:02:19.970> hand<00:02:20.300> right<00:02:20.420> here<00:02:20.750> in<00:02:20.870> my<00:02:20.990> left

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
shot on this hand right here in my left

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.380 
shot on this hand right here in my left
hand<00:02:21.319> so<00:02:22.069> you<00:02:22.100> could<00:02:22.370> actually<00:02:22.580> see<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.180> lick

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
hand so you could actually see the lick

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.059 
hand so you could actually see the lick
again<00:02:24.140> I<00:02:24.170> call<00:02:24.590> this<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:25.040> circle<00:02:25.550> and<00:02:26.860> this<00:02:27.860> is

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
again I call this the circle and this is

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.460 
again I call this the circle and this is
what<00:02:28.459> it<00:02:28.819> sounds<00:02:29.360> like<00:02:29.600> this<00:02:29.959> is<00:02:30.020> what<00:02:30.350> it

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
what it sounds like this is what it

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.780 
what it sounds like this is what it
looks<00:02:30.650> like<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:31.069> then<00:02:31.220> we'll<00:02:31.430> go<00:02:31.550> ahead<00:02:31.670> and

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
looks like and then we'll go ahead and

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:46.150 
looks like and then we'll go ahead and
break<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.180> down<00:02:32.330> for<00:02:32.660> you<00:02:43.360> ok<00:02:44.360> so<00:02:45.140> what<00:02:45.920> am<00:02:46.040> i

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
string itself and that is the last part

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.839 
string itself and that is the last part
of<00:04:19.109> the<00:04:19.229> liq<00:04:19.440> which<00:04:20.280> is<00:04:20.609> your<00:04:21.599> pinky<00:04:22.289> on<00:04:22.849> the

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
8th fret of the second string and I bend

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:33.230 
8th fret of the second string and I bend
that<00:04:28.440> up<00:04:28.620> a<00:04:28.800> full<00:04:29.130> step<00:04:31.490> and<00:04:32.490> I<00:04:32.520> put<00:04:32.729> a<00:04:32.759> vibrato

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
that up a full step and I put a vibrato

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:41.779 
that up a full step and I put a vibrato
on<00:04:33.479> the<00:04:33.720> end<00:04:33.900> of<00:04:34.020> it<00:04:34.169> so<00:04:35.009> it<00:04:35.340> goes<00:04:40.039> okay<00:04:41.039> at

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
on the end of it so it goes okay at

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:47.749 
on the end of it so it goes okay at
speed<00:04:44.870> and<00:04:45.870> I<00:04:46.289> scrape<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:46.919> strings<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.550> last

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
speed and I scrape the strings the last

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.749 
speed and I scrape the strings the last
time<00:04:48.030> just<00:04:48.300> to<00:04:48.389> give<00:04:48.539> it<00:04:48.570> a<00:04:48.690> little<00:04:48.810> flavor<00:04:49.759> but

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
time just to give it a little flavor but

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.779 
time just to give it a little flavor but
you<00:04:51.750> could<00:04:52.020> get<00:04:52.289> into<00:04:52.530> that<00:04:52.770> lick<00:04:53.250> doing

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
you could get into that lick doing

00:04:53.789 --> 00:05:04.000 
you could get into that lick doing
anything

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:10.750 

okay<00:05:05.540> you<00:05:06.540> can<00:05:06.720> do<00:05:06.810> other<00:05:06.990> things<00:05:07.110> as<00:05:07.530> well<00:05:09.710> but

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
okay you can do other things as well but

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.909 
okay you can do other things as well but
the<00:05:11.760> main<00:05:12.060> thing<00:05:12.090> is<00:05:12.480> to<00:05:12.690> get<00:05:12.930> that<00:05:13.200> circle<00:05:13.770> go

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
the main thing is to get that circle go

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:15.260 
the main thing is to get that circle go
and<00:05:14.070> I<00:05:14.130> call<00:05:14.340> it<00:05:14.460> a<00:05:14.490> circle<00:05:14.850> because<00:05:15.000> it<00:05:15.090> goes

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
and I call it a circle because it goes

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.939 
and I call it a circle because it goes
hide<00:05:16.050> it<00:05:16.200> down<00:05:16.380> like<00:05:16.680> this

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:24.039 

now<00:05:21.949> the<00:05:22.009> last<00:05:22.309> part<00:05:22.489> of<00:05:22.849> it<00:05:23.029> which<00:05:23.599> I<00:05:23.749> just

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:24.049 
now the last part of it which I just

00:05:24.049 --> 00:05:28.029 
now the last part of it which I just
