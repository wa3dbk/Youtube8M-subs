00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:06.310
 In order to reduce the incidence of traffic accidents, m &amp; a 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.079
 We've been recommending drivers. 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:12.079
 Women are better drivers than men 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:14.379
 Less than 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:16.259
 I want to put women's drivers on public transportation 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:19.460
 The Metro Manila Development Bureau 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.460
 to vice-president Tolentino of mmda 

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:26.809
 Tolentino on the radio program at mmda 

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:31.489
 The employment of female drivers against bus companies in ltfrb 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.670
 I'm planning to request it. 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.290
 A large traffic accident record for a female driver on a highway 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.290
 For example, the case is not recorded 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.510
 As instructed by ltfrb, bus companies will promptly 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.200
 Hire female bus drivers 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.230
 I will strongly urge you to put it on the scene quickly 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.430
 Then I said I would watch. 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.000
 Women drivers are more secure. 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.280
 Because the male provision itself is aggressive 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.780
 It's easier to get up on the road 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.540
 As a result of scientific research in the United States 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.700
 Women are less aggressive than men and more lawful 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.070
 It's a statement based on the fact that you can adhere to it and believe it. 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.070
 Plantino added 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.070
 He also 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.090
 In the case of buses, men should be able to work as deputy 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.300
 I suggested. 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.570
 When the plan is realized, 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.540
 The injured and injured person in the traffic accident 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.840
 Number of deaths 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.840
 We expect to see a decline on the contrary 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.820
 The largest number of traffic accidents currently in Metro Manila 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.460
 Happening 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.110

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.290
 Marco is in this life. 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.079
 As a general strike of a bus company on November 15 last year 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.660
 Thousands of people are experiencing discomfort 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.510
 The investigation results for 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.620
 Mmda struck that it will be announced soon 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.999
 mmda was the last of the four bus companies 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:15.759
 Your list has been submitted 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:18.819
 According to data from mmda after the general strike 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:23.779
 A total of 3,455 buses pass through the Ambassador in a day. 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:25.809
 That's it. 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:28.739
 During the general strike on November 15 last year 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.309
 There are about 620 buses, about 18% 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.730
 More than 8000 public transport passengers 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.819
 I became isolated phenomenon. 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.309
 This general strike 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:44.519
 Bus No. 4 Bus drivers and companies following disciplinary action 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.069
 It was meant to be a complaint. 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.069
 Currently, 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:52.019
 Diesel price increase 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.439
 Bus fare to the government due to toll charges increase 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.559
 I'm still asking for an impression. 

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:01.169
 I asserted that there will be no bus fare hikes.
