 the question is at 537 and we are a 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.490
 new video of el maitÃ©n this time in my 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.380

 Where is your house my chip? 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.190
 Well they caught me, they have not done it yet 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.870
 is that he has no positions of 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.550
 invisibility nor was there a rain of 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.070
 criterion has not yet done it because I 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.900
 I went directly into action and I got 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.510
 my pitcher to me or everything yesterday did not 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:49.020
 I have also it stung me and it stung me of 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.670
 diamond and good the rest the rest no longer 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.170
 it matters but we're not here to 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.800
 this is to talk about a resource 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.660
 favorite I'll tell you why 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.000
 to me what I like about what a 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.570
 summary I know it does not change much what it is 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.700
 this materials the tools or 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.619
 have a nice look today and 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.840
 a zombie is going to see me of the company 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.500
 and good what it is I am going to give you a 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.360
 example of what is the contest that is 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.930
 very famous and good I said why not 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.940
 prove it 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.040
 so when I download it, 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.080
 understood the materials because everything 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.920
 it was different everything in him a simple 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.920
 stick the hunger 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.010
 and also to give an example you 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.040
 will know what is the time series of 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.250
 adventure 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.030
 I mean that if good is not it 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.030
 but the truth 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:49.810
 but good and is that something that we give 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.899
 much together to what it is to do is your 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.659
 what her color is that everything 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.850
 I did not want the characters it's nice 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.950
 the colors are nice the 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.890
 characters are nice even is 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.689
 there are things that you love and that you do not 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.429
 it made no sense but good 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.569
 I'm also going to tell you other things very 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:12.459
 important of what is 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:15.230
 and it is that it reduces you a lot in the now 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.599
 right now I have what is the optician and 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.900
 I'm in version 1.7 points 5 view 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:23.810
 that suddenly goes to 8 fps is 3 fp that 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.719
 is and 30 fps I usually go like 50 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.420
 60 fps but it's recording because 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:31.939
 record is a good thing what is 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.669
 unites the t but it reduces you a lot and 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:36.409
 good good and so will you approach me and 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:38.900
 now let's see what all this looks like 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:41.239
 with the texture so I'm going to leave them 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.040
 here what is the camera and suddenly 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.799
 they're going to see how it goes up with and well we're 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.090
 back has has something not thrown away 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:52.090
 with this style of cooking 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.090
 word 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.600
 I realized it was armor and good 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.989
 see with all that is the drawings 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.210
 They are very pleasing to the eye and see 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:15.110
 they went as far as prosthetics 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.970
 31 pps is that between 23 36 or this is 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.430
 It is normal for me to walk. 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.890
 suddenly in the environment of 8 months and here 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.010
 does not fall below 30 fps and shocks 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.070
 they increased a lot now right down 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.130
 8 times but it's a little meeting 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:38.590
 good also in which it is reduced and 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:38.590
 optimizes what it is because the servers 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:50.360
 it's called is motive for the 1.7 is 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:56.620
 from 1.5 up to the 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.620
 point is not for all versions 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.540
 then 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.330
 is not very different 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.660
 I love this texture is just my 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.950

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.479
 10 mega parties and I have almost next door 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.879
 modem so I hope it's not very 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:30.460
 problem I'm almost next to what it is 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:35.740
 I mude so that for this to be more 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:39.250
 fast good mega right now 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:42.520
 about this and now you see that it only weighs 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:45.930
 8.3 meters we are going to double in our 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.930
 computer is starting 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:54.319
 Y 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:57.130
 I've been here five seconds four to not 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:57.130
 is what is missing 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:03.129
 91 to anticipate that I was going to put the 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:03.660
 curse of the toy 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:06.210
 7 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.500
 and well here is there one leaves between 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.620
 thirty six because I already had it 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.770
 thanks antivirus and then what are we going to 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.340
 do is put windows 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.020
 run 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.970
 we are not going to give you what the symbol is 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.060
 of windows is going super slow 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:25.240
 computers thanks to the recording to 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:28.330
 execute put courts for sentence 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.580
 that raises that we can accept 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.220
 we waited a while and here we get to 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.930
 what is the point in the world mark that 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.639
 we are going to get into what is three 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.770
 Packs and parents resolution courses 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:41.039
 let's put directly the reason is 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:44.080
 no need of what is this 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:45.470
 extract it here because that's how it will work 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.950
 perfectly 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.600
 and I hope we will use only this tutorial 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.860
