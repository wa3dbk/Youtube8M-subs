00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.270
 hello youtube friends like I do not wait 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.560
 that very well today we are going to see how 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:38.040
 download the game flatout 2 portable 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.360
 and before I start I want to tell you something 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.650
 the game 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.070
 yes no 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.100
 It is not complete because if you 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.160
 enter 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.809
 to see that the music is not there or not 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.809
 there are the background images in the menu 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.210
 that means that the game is not 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.850
 full 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.369
 but if it has all the functionalities 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.650
 who has the complete game for example 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.040
 it's not a demo has all the tournaments 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.590
 has all all types of career 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.200
 has the bid has has everything that does not 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.240
 has is the music and the images of 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.409
 Background on the menu so it is not 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.710
 complete because if that is missing obviously 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:27.050
 well it's not complete so it's good 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.570
 that was to begin with so let's go 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.520
 to start with the video the first thing that 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.960
 they have to do they already know is 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.880
 download it from mega 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.320
 I'm going to leave this child in the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.760
 description of the video as I said in the 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.619
 last video 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.440
 I will not upload more videos sorry 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.450
 files to the later and find it started 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.840
 to come up here because it seems like a way 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.800
 more comfortable it is still possible to 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.660
 positive 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.720
 so good when I get in this 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.610
 lean page to download to your computer 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.450
 but I have in Spanish but has clarified 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.510
 appear this you give the red button and you 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.650
 going to start good starts and it's going to 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:13.710
 start downloading the weird file yo 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:17.290
 I'm going to pause it because I need it 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.930
 good when you have 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.300
 I have downloaded this rar file that you see 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.220
 here 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.940
 what you have to do is click 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:30.070
 right to extract here 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.070
 here he will ask for a password 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.500
 if it was left in the description of 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:39.080
 video also give you enter or accept 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:44.240
 and it's going to happen to unzip the game 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:47.930
 the game weighs a giga 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:52.129
 just right on follow a follow 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:57.739
 as 2 mb as it should be but keep it that way 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:03:00.220
 that weighs a lot this this game I 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:05.170
 I'm going to pause the video 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.960
 and good now in three more minutes or 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.050
 less than I calculate that it will take a 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.530
 I did 12 13 minutes but it's never exact 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.570
 those that time so I'm going to spend the 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.560
 video to go back when you have 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.670
 finished 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.920
 well finally we came back and as we see here 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.730
 we have the folder made with the game 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.910
 inside we enter and we will be able to see that 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.000
 here is another folder we go through and 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:39.870
 here is the game 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.870
 the game in this case would be this one here 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.770
 Well now I'm going to teach you 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.890
 to solve a problem that almost all 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:52.670
 they have that is that when they want to start 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:55.480
 a race any career the 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:04:00.560
 screen looks black and you only see 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:02.980
 the map remains in the area below 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.980
 and to the left 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.520
 you only see that speed is seen 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.790
 but you do not see 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.740
 in the path that you are doing that is 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.810
 you do not see anything, you only see those things 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.950
 I know what it has to be is to go 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.970
 start 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.970
 all programs 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.230
 or better we can not is something else let's 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.230
 go to each folder 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:31.199
 Y 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.410
 let's go into the folder is here 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.180
 and we are going to click here 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.060
 setup 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.370
 we went to put this and here we get 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.000
 this box 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.790
 here what we have to do 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.460
 to see that this resolution is the will 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.070
 put by default or 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.230
 when you enter here they will see 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:59.920
 these things so what has to be 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:03.640
 first is the screen mode change it 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.540
 at 1024 x 600 x 32 or the last 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.770
 resolution of all 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:11.180
 after having done that 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.180
 they take out prosecutions 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.120
 and well it ends well I told you in the language 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.610
 that you want 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.460
 they give him to accept 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.330
 or 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:27.500
 and the game when you enter them is going 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:30.630
 to walk well you will see the whole race 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.060
 so to speak so well nothing 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:36.110
 friends, I hope you liked it 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:40.669
 also the below I leave the link of 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:43.430
 torrent of the game that that is complete 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:45.200
 obviously it will take a little longer 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.840
 but 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.910
 well I was told this one and told him the 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.340
 doctor rum because there are some that 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:55.040
 surely they will download the torrent 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.810
 because it is the complete game the sense 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.130
 I also want a little bit full but 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.090
 but good I leave you this and the torrent 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:05.180
 so nothing friends I hope you have them 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.510
 I liked to write to my channel he 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.980
 remember that comments can 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.020

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:16.490
