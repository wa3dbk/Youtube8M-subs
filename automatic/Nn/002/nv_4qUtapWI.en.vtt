from<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.260> back<00:01:13.580> and<00:01:14.580> he<00:01:14.700> batting<00:01:15.060> zero<00:01:15.270> back

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
from the back and he batting zero back

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.740 
from the back and he batting zero back
since<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.990> company<00:01:16.439> he<00:01:16.710> did<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.850> held<00:01:18.150> him<00:01:18.360> on

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
since a company he did and held him on

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.140 
since a company he did and held him on
his<00:01:19.380> chest<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.860> that's<00:01:20.280> past<00:01:20.520> right<00:01:20.909> shows<00:01:21.119> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
his chest and that's past right shows a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.749 
his chest and that's past right shows a
lot<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.450> power

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
lot of power

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.130 
lot of power
I<00:01:23.759> think<00:01:24.090> jurors<00:01:24.390> can<00:01:24.600> take<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> bit<00:01:25.110> longer

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
I think jurors can take a bit longer

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.840 
I think jurors can take a bit longer
because<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:25.979> not<00:01:26.130> like<00:01:26.280> with<00:01:26.430> forwards<00:01:26.759> is

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
because it's not like with forwards is

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.100 
because it's not like with forwards is
not<00:01:26.970> are<00:01:27.090> they<00:01:27.180> getting<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.420> ball<00:01:27.600> like<00:01:27.810> because

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
not are they getting a ball like because

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.870 
not are they getting a ball like because
all's<00:01:28.439> gonna<00:01:28.619> get<00:01:28.799> under<00:01:29.070> touches<00:01:29.520> how<00:01:29.729> many
