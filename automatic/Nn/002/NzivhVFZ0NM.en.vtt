00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.219
 hello friends welcome to the analyzes 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.710
 of trail running review dotcom today 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.950
 from the 2013 author fair in germany 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.930
 to present exclusively this new 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.380
 model of the French house Solomon as 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.080
 you are seeing called ix tours inside 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.670
 of the city trail collection within 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.790
 this new collection of the French house 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.580
 who wanted to distance himself a little from 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.850
 the most difficult terrains more technical 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.760
 to go down to land something more more 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.839
 easy is especially this shoe the 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.510
 ix tours is intended for people who 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:47.059
 is on these grounds to the best that 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.420
 he wants to start trying this on the trail 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.190
 running and that for example will run to 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.550
 forest tracks we will start to see 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.829
 this shoe by the sole fixes that 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.960
 they have very little is left alone in the 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.749
 part of here outside the central part 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.470
 and part of the back side look how 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:08.150
 It is a typical taco of the French house 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.280
 oriented in this front part to 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.270
 favor displacement and in the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.159
 part 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.939
 will be to prevent skidding in 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.490
 down but all the part over where 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:23.810
 really traction to fix that almost 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.240
 there is no taco no doubt because the shoe 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.060
 is and this is destined to land 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.280
 very easy has also been incorporated into 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.860
 the tendon as you see here but it's a 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.130
 tendon of a softer material than in 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.610
 other occasions and fix a very flex 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.409
 easy or relatively easy and very 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.069
 progressive 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.700
 as you can see let's see the average 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:52.299
 sole fix what 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.759
 there is no excessive profile there is no excessive 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:02:00.399
 thickness everything and that there is enough but not 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:02.289
 are the profiles of other models and a 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.280
 fall backwards forward we could 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:10.390
 qualify as a medium I think it can 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.760
 go around 8 or 12 millimeters is 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.120
 this back drop forward this is a 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.190
 slipper ladix tour as you see it follows 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.220
 using these fringes of the house 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.970
 typical french but in all the upper 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.090
 is in thermosealed as you are seeing 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.250
 they are giving equal this consistency 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:34.090
 but there is no seam in this 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.579
 part of the as you can see in this six 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.970
 shift technology has been used 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:42.420
 sensitive this technology that is more 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.910
 elastic in this front part but 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:50.110
 that goes all with these thermosealed as 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.710
 you see traditional laces that cost 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.160
 enough to run 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:58.550
 of thinking you have to go step by step to 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.770
 think a pretty tongue 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.280
 simple without any protection 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:07.040
 for the entrance of earth or stones 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.240
 look now I'm going to show you the part 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.790
 from within 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.880
 look like you do not get to appreciate but 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.000
 there is no sewing since everything is a 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.980
 thermos sealed in the upper 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.160
 back the heel quite 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.250
 padded as you can see and also 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.900
 pretty curve to catch the foot well 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.330
 now I'm going to show you the template 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.510
 fix a super simple template of 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.400
 the French house practically 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.280
 the minimum expression in terms of 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.799
 templates since it does not give any form to 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:45.209
 foot is limited a little to cover the 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:48.239
 seams of the base of the shoe by 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.660
 so we have this one from the ex model 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:54.020
 tour a model 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.840
 simple a model maybe for good 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.600
 to start on the running train for 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.180
 very easy terrains and that also 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.830
 we can take for example by the city 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.200
 without any problems since it is 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.520
 a fairly simple model and that with 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.100
 these we have sealed has also been 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.170
 saved enough weight therefore 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.810
 friends you have the healthy monster 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.760
 tours analyzed by bringing running 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.850
 review dotcom see you in the next 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.850
 analysis
