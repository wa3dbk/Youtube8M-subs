this clay color and that gave me this

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.050 
this clay color and that gave me this
white<00:01:17.140> chalky<00:01:18.140> gray<00:01:18.920> color<00:01:19.490> for<00:01:19.759> the<00:01:19.850> rail

rust<00:01:27.530> for<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:28.190> rail<00:01:28.369> so<00:01:28.610> what<00:01:28.729> you<00:01:29.090> do<00:01:29.240> is<00:01:29.420> you

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
rust for the rail so what you do is you

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.840 
rust for the rail so what you do is you
get<00:01:30.170> it<00:01:30.259> going<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.590> little<00:01:30.800> bit

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.469 
and you can see just get the applicator
going<00:01:35.010> and<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.520> comes<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.790> different<00:01:35.820> sizes

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479

great product what you do is you want to

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.340 
great product what you do is you want to
stick<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.729> rails<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.690> are<00:01:48.810> not<00:01:48.990> going<00:01:49.290> to

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
stick to the rails that are not going to

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.010 
stick to the rails that are not going to
be<00:01:49.440> used<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.010> would<00:01:50.130> be<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.369> outside<00:01:51.020> of

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
be used so it would be the outside of

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.219 
be used so it would be the outside of
the<00:01:52.170> rails<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:53.009> what<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.250> do<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.880> take<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
the rails so what I do is I take the

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.770 
the rails so what I do is I take the
applicator<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.530> all<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.610> do<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.759> just

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
applicator and all you do is just

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.380 
applicator and all you do is just
run<00:01:59.350> it<00:01:59.440> along

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
run it along

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.510

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
know and then you go over the top of the

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.960 
know and then you go over the top of the
rail<00:02:15.890> so<00:02:16.040> I'm<00:02:16.130> just<00:02:16.250> using<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.610> actually

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
rail so I'm just using the actually

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.970 
rail so I'm just using the actually
toilet<00:02:17.960> paper<00:02:18.140> because<00:02:18.440> that's<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.650> closest

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
toilet paper because that's the closest

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.920 
toilet paper because that's the closest
thing<00:02:19.100> I<00:02:19.190> had<00:02:19.370> was<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.700> fresh<00:02:20.510> roll<00:02:20.690> of<00:02:20.840> toilet

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.990 
thing I had was a fresh roll of toilet
paper<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:23.720> when<00:02:23.840> it<00:02:23.930> dries<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.790> only<00:02:25.790> get

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
paper and and when it dries you only get

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.250 
paper and and when it dries you only get
the<00:02:26.120> look<00:02:26.300> that<00:02:26.330> you<00:02:26.540> see<00:02:26.810> throughout<00:02:27.080> the

previously what happens is I'm using the

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.460 
previously what happens is I'm using the
code<00:03:00.590> eighty<00:03:00.920> track<00:03:01.340> if<00:03:01.880> you<00:03:02.270> use<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.690> code<00:03:02.840> 55

how<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:03.860> system<00:03:04.340> works<00:03:04.610> is<00:03:05.019> there<00:03:06.019> is<00:03:06.290> a

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
how the system works is there is a

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.530 
how the system works is there is a
disk<00:03:08.630> a<00:03:08.990> special<00:03:09.590> disk<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.670> I<00:03:11.210> don't<00:03:11.390> know<00:03:11.450> if

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
disk a special disk and I don't know if

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.070 
disk a special disk and I don't know if
you<00:03:11.660> can<00:03:11.780> tell<00:03:11.960> but<00:03:12.020> there's<00:03:12.460> foam<00:03:13.460> disc<00:03:14.080> right

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
you can tell but there's foam disc right

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.990 
you can tell but there's foam disc right
about<00:03:15.470> there<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.130> there's<00:03:16.610> two<00:03:16.640> plastic

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
about there and there's two plastic

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.780 
about there and there's two plastic
discs<00:03:17.600> on<00:03:17.720> each<00:03:17.840> side<00:03:18.110> if<00:03:18.410> you<00:03:18.950> use<00:03:19.040> in<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.430> the

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
discs on each side if you use in the the

discs on each side if you use in the the
code<00:03:20.390> 55<00:03:20.960> track<00:03:21.350> you<00:03:22.010> wouldn't<00:03:22.280> use<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.580> foam

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
code 55 track you wouldn't use the foam

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.710 
code 55 track you wouldn't use the foam
you<00:03:22.850> just<00:03:23.270> use<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:24.459> disk<00:03:25.459> by<00:03:26.120> itself<00:03:26.510> the

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
you just use the disk by itself the

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.620 
you just use the disk by itself the
plastic<00:03:27.080> disk<00:03:27.320> because<00:03:27.580> it's<00:03:28.580> probably<00:03:29.510> see

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
plastic disk because it's probably see

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.180 
plastic disk because it's probably see
that<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:30.230> rails<00:03:30.440> are<00:03:30.590> a<00:03:30.650> lot<00:03:30.830> lower<00:03:31.010> in

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
that the rails are a lot lower in

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.170 
that the rails are a lot lower in
profile<00:03:31.670> and<00:03:31.910> close<00:03:32.240> to<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.480> thighs<00:03:33.910> it<00:03:34.910> is

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
profile and close to the thighs it is

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.740 
profile and close to the thighs it is
made<00:03:35.950> doing<00:03:36.950> track<00:03:37.250> weather<00:03:37.550> and<00:03:37.760> track<00:03:37.970> so

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
made doing track weather and track so

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.930 
made doing track weather and track so
easy<00:03:39.110> I<00:03:39.500> did<00:03:40.040> a<00:03:40.070> majority<00:03:40.280> of<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:40.820> track

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
easy I did a majority of the track

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.000 
easy I did a majority of the track
little<00:03:43.940> faster<00:03:44.300> of<00:03:44.420> any<00:03:44.540> year<00:03:44.660> going<00:03:45.050> I<00:03:45.380> did<00:03:45.980> a

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
little faster of any year going I did a

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.540 
little faster of any year going I did a
lot<00:03:46.250> of<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.459> track<00:03:46.730> in<00:03:47.480> one<00:03:48.320> evening<00:03:48.550> actually

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
lot of the track in one evening actually

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.490 
lot of the track in one evening actually
not<00:03:49.760> even<00:03:49.850> one<00:03:50.060> evening<00:03:50.330> one<00:03:50.450> afternoon<00:03:50.750> my

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
not even one evening one afternoon my

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.840 
not even one evening one afternoon my
wife<00:03:51.680> went<00:03:51.890> upstairs<00:03:52.130> to<00:03:52.310> do<00:03:52.430> some<00:03:52.610> sewing

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
wife went upstairs to do some sewing

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.630

what<00:03:53.600> have<00:03:53.750> you<00:03:53.930> and<00:03:54.320> I<00:03:54.500> see<00:03:54.739> downstairs<00:03:55.220> and<00:03:55.520> I

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
what have you and I see downstairs and I

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.420 
what have you and I see downstairs and I
think<00:03:56.000> I<00:03:56.090> had<00:03:56.270> on<00:03:56.420> a<00:03:57.050> little<00:03:57.890> of<00:03:57.980> a<00:03:58.010> basketball

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
think I had on a little of a basketball

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.810 
think I had on a little of a basketball
game<00:03:58.700> and<00:04:02.170> that's<00:04:03.170> it<00:04:03.440> so<00:04:04.010> basically<00:04:04.370> you<00:04:04.700> let

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
game and that's it so basically you let

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.850 
game and that's it so basically you let
this<00:04:04.970> dry<00:04:05.270> and<00:04:05.570> if<00:04:05.870> it<00:04:05.989> gets<00:04:06.140> on<00:04:06.200> the<00:04:06.320> round<00:04:06.470> so

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
this dry and if it gets on the round so

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.910 
this dry and if it gets on the round so

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
could have stopped the trains under here

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.870 
could have stopped the trains under here
I<00:05:41.190> put<00:05:41.550> two<00:05:41.700> Rock<00:05:41.940> castings<00:05:42.540> so<00:05:43.700> I'm<00:05:44.700> gonna

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
I put two Rock castings so I'm gonna

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.900 
I put two Rock castings so I'm gonna
modify<00:05:45.540> them<00:05:45.870> Oh<00:05:46.080> probably<00:05:46.920> a<00:05:47.070> lot<00:05:47.280> more<00:05:47.310> maybe

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
modify them Oh probably a lot more maybe

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.140 
modify them Oh probably a lot more maybe
a<00:05:48.030> little<00:05:48.150> bit<00:05:49.070> to<00:05:50.070> give<00:05:50.520> a<00:05:50.550> little<00:05:50.700> more<00:05:50.850> space

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
a little bit to give a little more space

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.150 
a little bit to give a little more space
the<00:05:51.390> trains<00:05:51.660> do<00:05:51.840> fit<00:05:52.110> I<00:05:52.140> did<00:05:52.470> check<00:05:52.680> that<00:05:52.920> they

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
the trains do fit I did check that they

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.920 
the trains do fit I did check that they
do<00:05:53.220> fit<00:05:53.520> underneath<00:05:53.910> and<00:05:54.240> they<00:05:54.540> have<00:05:54.690> side

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
do fit underneath and they have side

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.140 
do fit underneath and they have side
clearance<00:05:55.230> not<00:05:55.950> much<00:05:56.190> so<00:05:56.490> I'd<00:05:56.640> probably<00:05:56.790> grind

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
clearance not much so I'd probably grind

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.360 
clearance not much so I'd probably grind
