 ignatieff for us it's nice you're an anthropologist and you have 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.750
 studied the case of a famous philippe healer years old called 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.790
 alex orbis early as a spiritual healer 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.430

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.910
 believe treated by appeared moved you tell that for a few moments 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.910
 and finally the doctor thierry on stage 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.510
 good evening I psychotherapist the author including the disease does it make sense 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.990
 recently his yard choices 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.460
 and you have a course we can say 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.010
 really atypical place at age 33 you were at the top of a career we're going 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.540
 say 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.380
 of traditional medicine in belgium if one day I decided to 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.060
 close all 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.220
 to stop everything a few years later you went to the usa 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.200
 in a healing school snow towards you have healed you 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.630
 For the 100 th best album but Caesar, do you find yourself 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.739
 in what you heard 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.169
 but I find myself a little I find myself a little time 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:25.469
 in the sense that 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:26.439
 it is necessary 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:29.779
 we must tell people that actually an official medicine 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:33.779
 evoking the Tunisian site in complement and that never 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:35.059
 substitutes tiff 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:39.229
 on the other hand from my adolescence I wanted to become a doctor I am 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:42.259
 grandson of doctors and life has decided otherwise 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:45.329
 and as a result of that I experienced a number of phenomena 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.309
 you are hard during the year of humility 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:50.309
 which was examined by researchers in universities years in 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:51.639
 parapsychology 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:55.159
 and then as a result of this experience but I would say that naturally I have 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:56.269
 take the plunge 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.489
 it's for place 2 doing experiments that was in the realm of 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.359
 loose telekinesis continue what does the flower of hope mean on the 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:07.099
 matter move objects we hold objects laughs room stéphane 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.319
 adding that the road order the objects 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.909
 in this you happen this morning the daily press but stéphane liz had 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.089
 witnessed 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:17.099
 just 2% married the gall that has twisted 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:20.789
 a spoon so it sounds completely louisette these years it 

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:23.660
 is said that I know that jean-marie does not reduce his activity to that much 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.020
 it's true it was after an experiment that we have the staff to 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.259
 are completely something else 

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:30.259
 and at the end of the experience then understand 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.029
 the day in a course fork to throw a few players have for my 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:38.099
 marriage like that without spending the comforter his pocket playing that I 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.839
 revisit this every day of the club at the bottom 

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:43.029
 from the german stock market in my living room at home my wife after the flower 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:45.899
 fork thereafter he continued to continue to complain while 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:47.829
 I did not exert any pressure on them 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.909
 it's pretty impressive it's used for that watch 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.349
 in my opinion the abilities that exists beyond 2 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.379
 dishes 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.180
 an idea that what can be applied here is on the human body 6 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.810
 he is able to have an action 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.380
 the charges have been proven in the laboratory many times so 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.359
 it's not something that 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.339
 we come out of hat if they have something solid 

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:12.350
 it will show that we can have a concrete action on them shops 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.529
 on the subject 

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:16.199
 sas asked to test wages 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.949
 attests in particular the lawns distance did we learn yesterday the action of 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:21.419
 meditation by this research announcement that worries many to 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.039
 United States a little bit in France today 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.270
 two states myxyty very very impressive 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.729
 while jean-marie le gall you wrote including contact 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.570
 with the afterlife a media testify to me 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.520
 so how could the reportage how long to see me 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.520
 2 the return of moms 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.669
 and almost guided by year 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.590
 finally gulli by someone so many questions as to the thesis that it's 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.710
 like that you also have to someone who who you say 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.530
 absolutely 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.469
 in the sense that 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:48.719
 when people are lying on me on my table 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:52.709
 e there is true an intention of prayer but not dogmatic I 

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:56.599
 precise and then I would say that I'm kind of I say it with 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:00.460
 a lot of completely remote control humility I get a little closer to 

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:04.490
 this relief move called from but what's going on in the philippines 

00:05:04.489 --> 00:05:06.039
 but rather Brazilian 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.620
 what would be called psychic interventions 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.689
 actually I feel 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:12.860
 in a manner 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.189
 very concrete as if tomorrow 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:17.719
 hat to position themselves are mine 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:22.210
 and if I stayed during the whole gives more the duration of two years the sitting 

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:25.439
 that last about 20 to 25 minutes I mean in autopilot 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:27.639
 and it is necessary to end 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.499
 from that period jj and I appreciate 

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:34.210
 only if his hands gently laid over Bienne withdraws 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.339
 if I go back 

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:40.019
 I would say in a situation quite normal do you that that 

00:05:40.019 --> 00:05:42.889
 we happen to have been called by doctors jean-marie le gall or by 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:43.700
 people 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.439
 the rest of western europe traditional 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:50.089
 yes ten years when I exercised on paris or then on the Dijon region 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:54.849
 for the recognition in their corporation there are a lot of charlatans m what I 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:58.209
 is unfortunate is that unfortunately% with serious people 

00:05:58.209 --> 00:06:01.819
 we do not know laboratory experiments marie le gall so% with 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:03.210

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.330
 witness the dollar picks up some killings that could help you a little 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.380
 little with laughs 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.500
