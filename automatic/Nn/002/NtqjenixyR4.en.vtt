 hello everyone how are you here 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.470
 to continue with the online workshop 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.640
 novel today I bring you the third video 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.260
 about character archetypes 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.759
 timeless for those who have not seen 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.590
 the previous videos I'm trying 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.730
 collect a series of archetypes that 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.080
 they can use practically in 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.539
 any context so if you think 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.519
 We begin right away 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.160
 first of all I listed the 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:39.960
 archetypes of which we are going to talk today 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:45.850
 the masochist the rebel the researcher 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:50.309
 the flatterer the prankster the tyrant the 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.720
 victim the villain and the helpless 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.670
 after meeting all of you 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.890
 I will propose a new exercise that 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.309
 we will call change of alignment to your 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.309
 character 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.990
 I hope you are responds have been 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.390
 clear and we passed the explanation we're going to 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.040
 go on to describe the archetypes of 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.610
 character that we have selected for 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.229
 this workshop the first one is the masochist 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.360
 this is a character that wallows in 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.400
 your own suffering a good example 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.930
 would be the wing of pont du lac of the 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.600
 vampiric chronicles deÃ¡n wright 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.850
 the rebel is about that character 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.740
 that opposes the established order and 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.000
 fight for the cause in which you believe as 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.580
 tyler of the fight club ' 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.950
 the researcher is the classic character 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.900
 that investigates and resolves cases like 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.650
 hercules poirot the detective who appears 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.410
 in several novels by Agatha Christie 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.510
 the flatterer is about the typical 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.860
 person who makes the ball for 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.200
 get the favor of others more 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.409
 powerful and a very classic example would be 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.020
 It's my peter pan 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.539
 the joker this is the typical character 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.159
 that brings humor points and looks 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.420
 always the funny side of things 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.869
 as they are 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.659
 Fred and George Weasley at Harry Potter the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.280
 Tyrant is about a character that is 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.039
 obsessed with always keeping the 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.660
 control of the whole waleran bishop of the 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.720
 pillars of the earth 'would embody very 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.720
 well this archetype 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.640
 the victim the main characteristic 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.340
 of this character is the fear that has 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.740
 to be hurt or to suffer a good example 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.040
 could be naoko from the novel 'tokyo 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.310
 blues' 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.409
 the villain as you know this is a 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.659
 character that we oppose to the hero and 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:33.390
 that seeks its destruction we could put 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.350
 thousand examples Lord Voldemort to say 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.020
 one 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.510
 the helpless is the character that appears 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.370
 innocent and weak and often his 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.310
 survival is based on the compassion of 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.720
 the others this archetype reminds me 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.520
 much to the personality that they have given 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.130
 to the queen gin in the mists of 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.460
 abalo or also sancha de la saga 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.080
 song of ice and fire these are all 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.510
 the archetypes we had for this 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.060
 workshop and we are going with the proposal that 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.310
 was done before it changes alignment to your 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.810
 character 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.849
 surely as you have seen the 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.400
 different archetypes of character has 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.459
 known almost automatically who 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.220
 they were the good guys and who were the bad guys 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.870
 my proposal is that in order to give you more 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.319
 wealth to the profile of this character 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.510
 change its alignment ie until the 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.400
 bad good good bad or decide to 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.099
 create characters that I like in life 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.920
 real sometimes you do bad things and sometimes 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:32.349
 do good things think for example in 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.140
 the researcher is supposed to be good 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:38.019
 true but and if it was not because 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.879
 what would be considered the possibilities that 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.010
 this can give your character and 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:44.409
 also remember to substantiate this rarity 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.019
 this unexpected alignment and you'll have a 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:49.470
 original different character and more 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.470
 realistic 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.980
 and this is all for today I hope that these 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.690
 last archetypes have been found 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.760
 useful and that you can use them in 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.230
 your novels or in your stories and 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.490
 good as always, misfortunes to see me 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.840
 and I encourage you to continue in the networks 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.890
 social and I hope to see you all in a 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.890
 next video see you later
