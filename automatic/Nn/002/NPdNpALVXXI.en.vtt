One m9 comes in in 157 grams which is
also<00:01:09.420> maybe<00:01:10.140> because<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.740> mean<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:11.189> have<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.640> real

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
also maybe because I mean we have a real

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.359 
also maybe because I mean we have a real
metal<00:01:12.150> body<00:01:12.479> here<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.470> HTC<00:01:13.950> One<00:01:14.760> m9<00:01:16.369> let's

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
metal body here on the HTC One m9 let's

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.620 
metal body here on the HTC One m9 let's
talk<00:01:17.820> about<00:01:18.380> thickness<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.560> these<00:01:19.740> devices<00:01:20.130> so

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
talk about thickness of these devices so

about<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.380> cameras<00:03:02.890> this<00:03:03.550> is<00:03:03.700> quite

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
about the cameras this is quite

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.320 
about the cameras this is quite
interesting<00:03:04.210> because<00:03:04.900> here<00:03:05.620> on<00:03:05.770> the<00:03:05.890> LG<00:03:06.280> g3<00:03:06.490> we

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
interesting because here on the LG g3 we

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.900 
interesting because here on the LG g3 we
have<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.480> 13<00:03:08.290> megapixel<00:03:08.470> camera<00:03:08.950> on<00:03:09.460> the<00:03:09.550> back

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
have a 13 megapixel camera on the back

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.880 
have a 13 megapixel camera on the back
but<00:03:10.480> this<00:03:10.660> one<00:03:10.870> also<00:03:11.230> sports<00:03:13.590> an<00:03:14.590> image

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
but this one also sports an image

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.130 
but this one also sports an image
stabilizer<00:03:15.130> an<00:03:15.730> optical<00:03:16.300> image<00:03:16.480> stabilizer

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
stabilizer an optical image stabilizer

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.340 
stabilizer an optical image stabilizer
which<00:03:17.770> is<00:03:18.010> really<00:03:18.580> cool<00:03:18.790> if<00:03:19.150> he<00:03:19.180> just<00:03:20.020> want<00:03:20.230> to

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
which is really cool if he just want to

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.520 
which is really cool if he just want to
take<00:03:20.860> videos<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.580> pictures<00:03:22.570> in<00:03:22.990> a<00:03:23.080> low<00:03:23.260> light

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
take videos and pictures in a low light

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.980 
take videos and pictures in a low light
environment<00:03:24.250> over<00:03:24.790> here<00:03:24.940> on<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.180> HTC<00:03:25.660> One<00:03:25.840> m9

front-facing<00:03:34.480> camera<00:03:35.050> on<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.650> HTC<00:03:36.130> One<00:03:36.940> m9

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
front-facing camera on the HTC One m9

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.410 
front-facing camera on the HTC One m9
and<00:03:38.140> it<00:03:38.620> comes<00:03:38.920> also<00:03:39.190> with<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:39.970> wide-angle

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
and it comes also with the wide-angle

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.900 
and it comes also with the wide-angle
lens<00:03:40.840> so<00:03:41.260> this<00:03:41.470> is<00:03:41.620> just<00:03:41.830> perfect<00:03:42.310> for<00:03:42.340> selfies

the g3 sports a 2.1 megapixel camera on

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.870 
the g3 sports a 2.1 megapixel camera on
the<00:03:46.840> front<00:03:47.140> so<00:03:47.800> let's<00:03:48.070> switch<00:03:48.280> on<00:03:48.640> both

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
the front so let's switch on both

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.720 
the front so let's switch on both
devices<00:03:49.620> as<00:03:50.620> you<00:03:50.740> can<00:03:50.950> tell<00:03:51.250> there's<00:03:51.550> also

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
devices as you can tell there's also

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.790 
devices as you can tell there's also
quite<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.150> difference<00:03:52.570> here<00:03:52.840> on<00:03:52.990> the<00:03:53.350> g3

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
quite a difference here on the g3

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.280 
quite a difference here on the g3
because<00:03:54.070> it<00:03:54.160> has<00:03:54.250> all<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:55.630> buttons<00:03:55.960> on<00:03:56.170> the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
because it has all the buttons on the

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.290 
because it has all the buttons on the
back<00:03:56.440> so<00:03:56.620> there's<00:03:56.800> a<00:03:56.860> power<00:03:57.070> button<00:03:57.400> and<00:03:57.790> you

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
back so there's a power button and you

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.060 
back so there's a power button and you
have<00:03:58.390> a<00:03:58.450> volume<00:03:58.690> control<00:03:58.960> over<00:03:59.560> here<00:03:59.770> just

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
have a volume control over here just

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.440 
have a volume control over here just
kind<00:04:00.250> of<00:04:00.280> neat<00:04:00.520> and<00:04:00.700> you're<00:04:00.790> getting<00:04:01.030> used<00:04:01.330> to

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
kind of neat and you're getting used to

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.240 
kind of neat and you're getting used to
it<00:04:01.630> very<00:04:01.660> very<00:04:01.990> quickly<00:04:02.230> but<00:04:02.740> I<00:04:02.770> just<00:04:03.100> prefer

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
it very very quickly but I just prefer
