00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
using a really crap build this is the

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.319 
using a really crap build this is the
character<00:00:47.920> I<00:00:47.949> made<00:00:48.129> on<00:00:48.309> my<00:00:48.339> first<00:00:48.729> playthrough

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
roll now why did I do that anyone can

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.459 
roll now why did I do that anyone can
tell<00:00:57.460> you<00:00:57.519> that's<00:00:58.059> a<00:00:58.149> win<00:00:58.300> in<00:00:58.390> PvP<00:00:58.839> you<00:00:59.289> need<00:00:59.410> to

tell you that's a win in PvP you need to

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.139 
tell you that's a win in PvP you need to
be<00:00:59.559> able<00:00:59.620> to<00:00:59.769> move<00:00:59.920> as<00:01:00.100> fast<00:01:00.160> as<00:01:00.550> possible<00:01:01.000> and

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
be able to move as fast as possible and

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.060 
be able to move as fast as possible and
have<00:01:01.300> as<00:01:01.329> much<00:01:01.600> mobility<00:01:01.809> as<00:01:02.199> you<00:01:02.320> can<00:01:02.559> right

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
have as much mobility as you can right

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.850 
have as much mobility as you can right
in<00:01:03.429> fact<00:01:03.999> my<00:01:04.570> build<00:01:04.780> isn't<00:01:04.960> optimized<00:01:05.470> at<00:01:05.649> all

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
in fact my build isn't optimized at all

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.889 
in fact my build isn't optimized at all
the<00:01:06.460> stats<00:01:06.700> are<00:01:06.850> all<00:01:06.970> wrong<00:01:07.270> for<00:01:07.479> a<00:01:07.509> build<00:01:07.720> like

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
the stats are all wrong for a build like

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.050 
the stats are all wrong for a build like
this<00:01:08.140> and<00:01:08.380> my<00:01:08.800> armor<00:01:09.130> isn't<00:01:09.460> even<00:01:09.670> upgraded

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
this and my armor isn't even upgraded

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.210 
this and my armor isn't even upgraded
the<00:01:10.869> reason<00:01:11.259> for<00:01:11.350> this<00:01:11.470> is<00:01:11.679> that's<00:01:11.830> my<00:01:12.009> first

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
the reason for this is that's my first

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.490 
the reason for this is that's my first
build<00:01:12.580> I<00:01:12.850> was<00:01:13.090> having<00:01:13.330> fun<00:01:13.539> I<00:01:13.750> thought<00:01:14.289> I<00:01:14.320> would

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
build I was having fun I thought I would

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.620 
build I was having fun I thought I would
put<00:01:14.649> whatever<00:01:14.800> stats<00:01:15.130> I<00:01:15.250> wanted<00:01:15.670> higher<00:01:16.149> if<00:01:16.450> I

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
put whatever stats I wanted higher if I

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.899 
put whatever stats I wanted higher if I
felt<00:01:16.840> like<00:01:16.960> it<00:01:17.140> because<00:01:17.470> I<00:01:17.500> could<00:01:17.770> I<00:01:17.979> did<00:01:18.819> not

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
felt like it because I could I did not

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.510 
felt like it because I could I did not
use<00:01:19.060> a<00:01:19.090> guide<00:01:19.390> or<00:01:19.600> a<00:01:20.050> PvP<00:01:20.590> planner<00:01:20.920> to<00:01:21.250> create<00:01:21.490> a

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
use a guide or a PvP planner to create a

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.819 
use a guide or a PvP planner to create a
fully<00:01:21.789> optimized<00:01:22.240> hex<00:01:22.479> build<00:01:22.840> because<00:01:23.649> I<00:01:23.680> know

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
fully optimized hex build because I know

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:25.109 
fully optimized hex build because I know
something<00:01:24.220> that<00:01:24.369> everyone<00:01:24.670> seems<00:01:24.880> to<00:01:25.000> have

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
something that everyone seems to have

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.719 
something that everyone seems to have
forgotten<00:01:25.240> and<00:01:25.720> that<00:01:26.380> is<00:01:26.590> you<00:01:27.220> can<00:01:27.369> have<00:01:27.490> fun

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
forgotten and that is you can have fun

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.819 
forgotten and that is you can have fun
playing<00:01:27.759> the<00:01:28.119> way<00:01:28.360> you<00:01:28.780> want<00:01:29.079> to<00:01:29.140> play<00:01:29.409> and

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
playing the way you want to play and

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.859 
playing the way you want to play and
winning<00:01:30.490> is<00:01:30.640> not<00:01:30.670> important<00:01:31.390> in<00:01:31.540> that<00:01:31.659> regard

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
winning is not important in that regard

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.740 
winning is not important in that regard
there's<00:01:32.799> another<00:01:33.009> reason<00:01:33.220> for<00:01:33.369> it<00:01:33.670> I<00:01:33.790> wanted

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
there's another reason for it I wanted

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.959 
there's another reason for it I wanted
to<00:01:34.810> restrict<00:01:35.110> myself<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:36.430> like<00:01:36.579> I<00:01:36.700> used<00:01:36.729> to

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
to restrict myself just like I used to

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:39.569 
to restrict myself just like I used to
do<00:01:37.060> in<00:01:37.180> Dark<00:01:37.360> Souls<00:01:37.390> 1<00:01:37.750> all<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.259> time<00:01:38.340> as<00:01:39.340> soon

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
do in Dark Souls 1 all the time as soon

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:40.980 
do in Dark Souls 1 all the time as soon
as<00:01:39.700> I<00:01:39.759> heard<00:01:39.909> people<00:01:40.119> saying<00:01:40.479> that<00:01:40.840> it's

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
as I heard people saying that it's

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.450 
as I heard people saying that it's
impossible<00:01:41.259> to<00:01:41.560> use<00:01:41.649> strength<00:01:41.950> weapons<00:01:42.340> in

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
impossible to use strength weapons in

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.520 
impossible to use strength weapons in
Dark<00:01:42.640> Souls<00:01:42.850> 2<00:01:42.909> because<00:01:43.570> poise<00:01:43.810> doesn't<00:01:43.840> exist

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
Dark Souls 2 because poise doesn't exist

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.590 
Dark Souls 2 because poise doesn't exist
anymore<00:01:44.799> I<00:01:45.100> made<00:01:45.520> a<00:01:45.579> strength<00:01:45.939> build<00:01:46.210> and<00:01:46.420> I

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600
