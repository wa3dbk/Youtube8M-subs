00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
JPEG file in the same folder so next to

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.370 
JPEG file in the same folder so next to
your<00:03:36.520> pods<00:03:36.700> down<00:03:36.910> folder<00:03:37.239> so<00:03:37.420> in<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:38.110> same

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
your pods down folder so in that same

you can select it there earlier looking

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.990 
you can select it there earlier looking
in<00:03:43.870> one<00:03:44.110> folder<00:03:44.380> you<00:03:44.590> can't<00:03:44.830> browse<00:03:45.489> around<00:03:45.700> or

earlier but really tedious technical
reasons<00:04:11.019> it<00:04:11.860> will<00:04:12.100> forget<00:04:12.430> what<00:04:12.700> the<00:04:12.940> author

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
reasons it will forget what the author

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
path and preview image is so you have to

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.570 
path and preview image is so you have to
fill<00:04:16.959> them<00:04:17.080> out<00:04:17.140> again<00:04:17.260> again<00:04:18.130> I've<00:04:18.250> forgotten

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
fill them out again again I've forgotten

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.330 
fill them out again again I've forgotten
that<00:04:18.760> stupid<00:04:19.209> image<00:04:19.450> so<00:04:19.750> I<00:04:20.019> I<00:04:20.830> can't<00:04:21.130> actually

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
that stupid image so I I can't actually

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.730 
that stupid image so I I can't actually
select<00:04:21.940> something<00:04:22.120> there

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
select something there

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.230 
select something there
and<00:04:22.919> then<00:04:23.400> when<00:04:23.520> you've<00:04:23.639> done<00:04:23.729> that<00:04:23.789> click<00:04:23.940> on

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
and then when you've done that click on

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.680 
and then when you've done that click on
submit<00:04:24.569> update<00:04:24.990> their<00:04:25.470> will<00:04:25.590> then<00:04:25.710> be<00:04:25.830> a<00:04:25.860> delay

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690

while<00:04:27.690> it<00:04:27.990> actually<00:04:28.440> upload<00:04:29.130> it<00:04:29.280> to<00:04:29.400> steam<00:04:29.639> and

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
while it actually upload it to steam and

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:31.600 
while it actually upload it to steam and
then<00:04:29.970> it<00:04:30.060> will<00:04:30.150> open<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.509> steam<00:04:30.750> overlay<00:04:31.139> and

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
then it will open the steam overlay and

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.790 
then it will open the steam overlay and
you'll<00:04:32.610> be<00:04:32.819> able<00:04:32.910> to<00:04:33.060> see<00:04:33.330> it<00:04:33.479> the<00:04:34.259> heaven<00:04:34.590> and

you'll be able to see it the heaven and

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.309 
you'll be able to see it the heaven and
people<00:04:35.580> can<00:04:35.729> grab<00:04:35.910> it<00:04:35.940> so<00:04:36.780> it<00:04:37.050> should<00:04:37.289> be

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:37.319 
people can grab it so it should be

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:41.330 
people can grab it so it should be
pretty<00:04:37.440> simple<00:04:38.280> really<00:04:39.919> the<00:04:40.919> hard<00:04:41.130> bit<00:04:41.310> is

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
pretty simple really the hard bit is

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.730 
pretty simple really the hard bit is
actually<00:04:41.639> obviously<00:04:41.970> creating<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:43.259> mod<00:04:43.470> and
