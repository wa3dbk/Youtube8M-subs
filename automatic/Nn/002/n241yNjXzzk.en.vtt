00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.859
 welcome to babies already in this movie 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:07.080
 we see how we see the old frames 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.090
 professional dismantling and the new 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.350
 frame chosen by you and expertly 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.000
 place 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.280
 about six weeks ago the 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.529
 window frames measured and now on 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.449
 Custom produced for that assembly 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.439
 all old window frames begin 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.509
 disassembled 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.439
 we start removing the 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.029
 glass battens 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:32.670
 so that it looks easy out of it 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:34.470
 frame can be removed all old 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:38.120
 materials are for the customer 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.120
 cleaned up and disposed of 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.760
 belisol works with so-called 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.500
 adjustable frames for precise and 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.180
 proper assembly 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.460
 these adjusting frames are made of 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.199
 waterproof plywood and be too 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.829
 provided with a plastic film layer 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.510
 for a long service life and is the 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.280
 frame frames are on site 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.140
 measured and sawn 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.970
 This is a painstaking task in 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.539
 namely, it must be later 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.280
 plastic frame seamless compass 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:15.119
 with style images being the smallest 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.119
 differences 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.490
 the exchange rates are provided with one 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.259
 special rubber 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.330
 the plastic frames that year later 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.929
 placed close it seamlessly 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.240
 to 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:27.569
 this way a perfectly tight connection becomes 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.569
 created 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.799
 The new window frames will be your home 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.659
 perfectly insulated 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.880
 the façade parts must therefore also be provided 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.399
 be insulated 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.100
 because many old homes have degree of insulation 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:46.600
 three babies are already here also insulation 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.460
 you because the time elite façade sections 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.950
 every 30 centimeters 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.180
 it is screwed in additionally it holds 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.579
 applied angel work 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.770
 the once elite can sound so later 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.299
 be confirmed 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.880
 we use water-resistant for this 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:04.439
 impregnated wood this is going to be a life 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.439
 last just like the frame 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.579
 before the façade parts are placed 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.200
 first becomes a special vapor-permeable 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:12.910
 foil applied 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.739
 This foil ensures that it is moisture 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.459
 can go outside from the inside 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.459
 be disposed of 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.060
 this type of home is wooden 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.560
 partitions between the façade sections 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.270
 these partitions are replaced by 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.860
 aluminum plates 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.020
 these plates have the same structure 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.220
 if they have new plastic frames like that 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.220
 it becomes a beautiful whole 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.910
 as stated, use belisol exclusively 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.950
 the mounting method with stamp frame 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.790
 that guarantees maximum precision and 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.790
 lifespan 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:03:02.960
 the new frames are now in the 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:03:04.550
 frame frames placed on the 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.070
 inside of the frame becomes one 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.080
 so-called swelling tape applied 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.230
 this to finish the last track 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.230
 ban it 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.070
 the frames can now be mounted 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.070
 this is a real precision job 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.830
 even now comes the expertise of babies 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.079
 again useful with a commodity 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.489
 carpenter's eye short smallest rub 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.110
 corrected 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.909
 a small measuring difference is possible 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.700
 have far-reaching consequences for good ones 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:57.290
 closing windows and doors 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.299
 the frames are fixed with 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.159
 special top chef screws 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.810
 without head pulling a lump of the 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:04.730
 window frames 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.739
 an ordinary screw would be a dent 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.099
 in frame when the frame goes 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.099
 to work 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.540
 pelisson uses three 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.520
 dimensionally to set hinges 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:25.450
 this way, every window or door can function optimally 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:27.160
 all the hinges and locks are adjusted 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.570
 is of course provided with it 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.190
 police mark 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.190
 this way your safety is guaranteed 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.920
 The new windows will be baby 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.120
 almost always supplied with hr plus 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.700
 plus glass 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.380
 this glass is very sound insulating 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.430
 In addition, the gas bill will be a piece 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.720
 be lower 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.720
 due to the great insulating effect 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.070
 in the summer the h &amp; r plusbus holds glass 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.200
 the warmth of the sun outside and in the 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.530
 the winter is pleasantly warm inside 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.530
 taken into account 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:08.419
 the balcony door the signs of a 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:09.979
 stainless steel sill provided 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.980
 this is not only beautiful but also very 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.620
 firm 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.200
 The times elite façade sections are in each 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.000
 desired ral color available 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.650
 and just like the plastic frames 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.060
 This also features a beautiful likes 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.520
 more structure 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.410
 so the whole fits nicely together 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.180
 panels are made with stainless steel 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.180
 screws to the wall 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.140
 for the bottom of the bow part 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.910
 a rock panel is used 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.470
 rockpanel is a maintenance 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.690
 sheet material made from 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.640
 spun stone it is in various 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.080
 obtain colors and has the good ones 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.930
 advantages compared to, for example 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.190
 trespa it is then permeable and move 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.200
 almost not out 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.040
 so it can almost seamlessly against each other 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.040
 be attached 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.990
 the customer chose at the front door 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.850
 for a hard stone sill 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.160
 this fits nicely with the style of the house 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.030
 the threshold is placed in a concrete bed 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.890
 laid 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.660
 this too is a precision work where one 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.660
 carpenter's eye comes in handy 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:39.080
 the interior finish is also on site 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.669
 made to measure and assembled 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.470
 for this , mdf becomes plate material 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:43.940
 twisted that has a 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.949
 plastic film 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.020
 It is completely maintenance free so you 

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:50.509
 no need to paint 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.060
 the window sills are made of plastic 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:54.470
 is also cross and maintenance free 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.300
 Moreover, the coolest banks 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.400
 insensitive to flowerpot printing or 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.569
 cleaning agents and do not discolour them 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.569
 by the action of the sun 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:09.569
 clean up everything now and then 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.340
 broom clean leave 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:13.930
 Yes 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.479
 the on life list will be with the 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.610
 customer 

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:20.620
 now it's just enjoying 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.629
 the new perfectly insulating plastic 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.129
 frames and façade parts 

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:26.319
 it could still happen 

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:28.060
 belisol gives a 10 year full warranty 

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:30.819
 on his frames 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:33.370
 the mounting glazing and all the hangings 

00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:36.099
 and locks and that in combination with 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.719
 over 35 years experience of babies already 

00:07:36.099 --> 00:07:40.449
 that a guarantee for a lot of living pleasure 

00:07:37.719 --> 00:07:43.379
 and high comfort while the energy bill 

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:43.379
 goes down 

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.749
 Hey 

00:07:46.689 --> 00:07:48.749
 Hey
