based around the blues scale which I'm
sure<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.590> all<00:00:34.710> know<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.039> second<00:00:35.489> position<00:00:35.879> so

sure you all know in second position so

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:37.939 
sure you all know in second position so
I'm<00:00:36.179> playing<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.719> harmonica<00:00:37.019> in<00:00:37.379> the<00:00:37.440> key<00:00:37.589> of<00:00:37.710> C

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
I'm playing a harmonica in the key of C

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.220 
I'm playing a harmonica in the key of C
playing<00:00:38.699> in<00:00:38.819> 2nd<00:00:39.210> position<00:00:39.329> I'll<00:00:40.079> just

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
playing in 2nd position I'll just

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.750 
playing in 2nd position I'll just
quickly<00:00:40.409> play<00:00:40.679> you<00:00:40.739> through<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.429> blues<00:00:41.609> scale

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
quickly play you through the blues scale

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.819 
quickly play you through the blues scale
just<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.210> case<00:00:42.359> you<00:00:42.479> don't<00:00:42.600> know<00:00:42.749> it<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.710> it'll

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
just in case you don't know it so it'll

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.899 
just in case you don't know it so it'll
be

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:50.909 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.569 

okay<00:00:51.909> so<00:00:52.570> to<00:00:52.989> start<00:00:53.050> with<00:00:53.440> I<00:00:53.769> play<00:00:54.100> that<00:00:54.280> scale

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
okay so to start with I play that scale

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.599 
okay so to start with I play that scale
up<00:00:54.820> and<00:00:55.179> down<00:00:55.269> using<00:00:56.109> quarter<00:00:56.589> notes<00:00:56.679> so<00:00:57.579> a

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
up and down using quarter notes so a

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.340 
up and down using quarter notes so a
quarter<00:00:58.059> note<00:00:58.210> is<00:00:58.359> when<00:00:58.659> you're<00:00:58.780> playing<00:00:59.019> a

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
quarter note is when you're playing a

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.399 
quarter note is when you're playing a
note<00:00:59.710> per<00:01:00.309> beat<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:01.420> I'll<00:01:01.600> give<00:01:01.870> myself<00:01:02.049> some

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
note per beat so I'll give myself some

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:22.200 
note per beat so I'll give myself some
kind<00:01:02.589> of<00:01:02.739> beat<00:01:02.920> like<00:01:03.190> this<00:01:03.390> 1<00:01:04.390> 2<00:01:05.259> 3<00:01:06.210> 4<00:01:07.210> ok<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.820> the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
kind of beat like this 1 2 3 4 ok so the

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.639 
kind of beat like this 1 2 3 4 ok so the
goal<00:01:22.420> is<00:01:22.570> to<00:01:22.600> make<00:01:22.840> sure<00:01:22.869> that<00:01:23.110> that<00:01:23.229> sounds

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
goal is to make sure that that sounds

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.039 
goal is to make sure that that sounds
nice<00:01:23.979> and<00:01:24.280> clean<00:01:24.610> all<00:01:25.149> your<00:01:25.450> bends<00:01:25.869> are

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
nice and clean all your bends are

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.130 
nice and clean all your bends are
accurate<00:01:26.649> and<00:01:26.860> as<00:01:27.520> they<00:01:27.789> should<00:01:27.850> be<00:01:28.240> so<00:01:29.020> I'll

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
accurate and as they should be so I'll

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.830 
accurate and as they should be so I'll
play<00:01:29.289> that<00:01:29.440> five<00:01:30.130> or<00:01:30.280> six<00:01:30.459> times<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:30.970> then<00:01:31.600> I

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
play that five or six times and then I

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.559 
play that five or six times and then I
will<00:01:31.990> move<00:01:32.140> on<00:01:32.350> to<00:01:32.649> playing<00:01:33.100> eighth<00:01:33.610> notes<00:01:33.640> so

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:34.569 
will move on to playing eighth notes so

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:38.039 
will move on to playing eighth notes so
an<00:01:34.899> eighth<00:01:35.200> note<00:01:35.500> is<00:01:35.770> when<00:01:36.580> you<00:01:36.909> play<00:01:37.179> a<00:01:37.479> note

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
an eighth note is when you play a note

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.380 
an eighth note is when you play a note
that<00:01:38.289> lasts<00:01:38.619> for<00:01:38.830> half<00:01:38.860> a<00:01:39.190> bit<00:01:39.369> so<00:01:40.090> that<00:01:40.209> means

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
that lasts for half a bit so that means

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.570 
that lasts for half a bit so that means
that<00:01:40.509> you'd<00:01:40.630> be<00:01:40.750> counting<00:01:41.229> it<00:01:41.409> 1<00:01:42.100> &amp;<00:01:42.429> 2<00:01:43.090> &amp;<00:01:43.450> 3<00:01:43.479> &amp;<00:01:44.380> 4

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
that you'd be counting it 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:53.060 
that you'd be counting it 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4
and

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.010 

okay<00:01:54.070> so<00:01:54.640> I'll<00:01:54.700> do<00:01:54.820> that<00:01:54.850> five<00:01:55.420> or<00:01:55.570> six<00:01:55.750> times

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
okay so I'll do that five or six times

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.110 
okay so I'll do that five or six times
and<00:01:56.350> then<00:01:57.250> we'll<00:01:57.610> move<00:01:57.700> on<00:01:57.850> to<00:01:57.880> doing

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
and then we'll move on to doing

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.160 
and then we'll move on to doing
something<00:01:58.240> a<00:01:58.360> little<00:01:58.390> bit<00:01:58.570> more<00:01:58.659> interesting

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
something a little bit more interesting

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.160 
something a little bit more interesting
we'll<00:01:59.260> do<00:01:59.409> triplets<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:01.119> if<00:02:01.720> you<00:02:01.840> didn't<00:02:02.110> know

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
we'll do triplets so if you didn't know

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.440 
we'll do triplets so if you didn't know
what<00:02:02.260> a<00:02:02.320> triplet<00:02:02.650> was<00:02:02.830> as<00:02:03.159> its<00:02:03.970> name<00:02:04.180> suggests

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
what a triplet was as its name suggests

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.240 
what a triplet was as its name suggests
it<00:02:04.869> means<00:02:05.050> that<00:02:05.200> you<00:02:05.290> are<00:02:05.440> splitting<00:02:05.710> a<00:02:06.040> beat

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
it means that you are splitting a beat

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.359 
it means that you are splitting a beat
into<00:02:06.850> three<00:02:07.210> equal<00:02:07.479> parts<00:02:07.930> so<00:02:08.830> every<00:02:09.190> note

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
into three equal parts so every note

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.889 
into three equal parts so every note
that<00:02:09.550> you<00:02:09.610> play<00:02:09.850> is<00:02:10.030> going<00:02:10.209> to<00:02:10.300> last<00:02:10.570> for<00:02:10.840> a

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
that you play is going to last for a

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.810 
that you play is going to last for a
third<00:02:11.200> of<00:02:11.350> a<00:02:11.440> beat<00:02:11.620> so<00:02:12.459> that'll<00:02:12.910> be

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
third of a beat so that'll be

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:25.170 
third of a beat so that'll be
1-2-3-2-2-3-3-2-3-4-2-3<00:02:23.880> I'll<00:02:24.880> do<00:02:25.060> that

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
1-2-3-2-2-3-3-2-3-4-2-3 I'll do that

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.990 
1-2-3-2-2-3-3-2-3-4-2-3 I'll do that
five<00:02:25.660> over<00:02:25.810> six<00:02:26.020> times<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.650> then<00:02:27.400> finally

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
five over six times and then finally

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.220 
five over six times and then finally
I'll<00:02:28.209> do<00:02:28.390> something<00:02:28.630> that<00:02:28.900> I've<00:02:28.989> shown<00:02:29.170> you

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
I'll do something that I've shown you

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.840 
I'll do something that I've shown you
before<00:02:29.320> which<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.190> whole<00:02:30.430> skipping

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
before which is the whole skipping

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.190 
before which is the whole skipping
exercise<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:32.340> that'll<00:02:33.340> just<00:02:33.519> be<00:02:34.200> eighth

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
exercise and that'll just be eighth

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.250 
exercise and that'll just be eighth
notes<00:02:36.030> or<00:02:37.030> quarter<00:02:37.420> notes<00:02:37.600> whatever<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:38.050> feel

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
notes or quarter notes whatever you feel

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.170 
notes or quarter notes whatever you feel
more<00:02:38.440> comfortable<00:02:38.620> with<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.640> that's<00:02:39.880> just

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
more comfortable with and that's just

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:55.259 
more comfortable with and that's just
this<00:02:52.890> okay<00:02:53.890> so<00:02:54.250> that<00:02:54.430> as<00:02:54.760> well<00:02:54.970> you're<00:02:55.180> gonna

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
this okay so that as well you're gonna
