all the options from the catalog person

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.200 
all the options from the catalog person
like<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.830> best<00:00:22.980> possible<00:00:23.430> care<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.820> we<00:00:24.000> can

like the best possible care that we can

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.769

give<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:25.109> just<00:00:25.650> palliative<00:00:26.220> care<00:00:26.519> which

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
give to just palliative care which

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.300 
give to just palliative care which
sometimes<00:00:27.779> can<00:00:27.960> be<00:00:28.170> more<00:00:28.710> appropriate

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
sometimes can be more appropriate

and<00:00:33.989> are<00:00:34.079> very<00:00:34.320> debilitated<00:00:35.309> we<00:00:36.270> really<00:00:36.570> can

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
and are very debilitated we really can

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.770 
and are very debilitated we really can
do<00:00:37.160> almost<00:00:38.160> anything<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.540> available

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
do almost anything that is available

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.780

right<00:00:40.050> now<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.410> veterinary<00:00:41.190> medicine<00:00:41.250> to

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
right now in veterinary medicine to

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.000 
right now in veterinary medicine to
treat<00:00:42.000> cancer<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.020> luckily<00:00:43.469> we<00:00:43.649> have<00:00:43.800> four

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
treat cancer and luckily we have four

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.810 
treat cancer and luckily we have four
excellent<00:00:44.340> surgeons<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.620> they<00:00:46.620> all<00:00:47.309> have<00:00:47.789> a

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
excellent surgeons and they all have a

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.779 
excellent surgeons and they all have a
strong<00:00:48.390> interest<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:49.110> oncology<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.800> we

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
strong interest in oncology and we

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.639 
strong interest in oncology and we
always<00:00:50.940> say<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> chance<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.870> care<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.230> chance

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
always say a chance to care is a chance

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.400 
always say a chance to care is a chance
to<00:00:52.800> cure<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.309> anytime<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.210> get<00:00:54.420> rid<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.660> a

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
to cure so anytime we can get rid of a

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.330 
to cure so anytime we can get rid of a
tumor<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.920> way<00:00:56.750> that's<00:00:57.750> what<00:00:57.899> we<00:00:58.050> prefer<00:00:58.340> we

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
tumor that way that's what we prefer we

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.330 
tumor that way that's what we prefer we
have<00:00:59.930> extremely<00:01:00.930> nice<00:01:01.230> linear<00:01:01.559> accelerators

we<00:01:29.330> will<00:01:29.479> try<00:01:29.689> to<00:01:29.720> be<00:01:29.960> more<00:01:30.259> aggressive<00:01:31.360> also

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
we will try to be more aggressive also

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.999 
we will try to be more aggressive also
for<00:01:32.539> animals<00:01:32.899> that<00:01:32.960> are<00:01:33.140> younger<00:01:33.440> and<00:01:33.830> that

we<00:01:36.440> we<00:01:37.159> usually<00:01:37.580> will<00:01:37.729> try<00:01:37.939> to<00:01:37.970> do<00:01:38.840> therapies

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
we we usually will try to do therapies

we we usually will try to do therapies
that<00:01:39.380> are<00:01:39.439> more<00:01:39.710> intense<00:01:40.100> either<00:01:40.549> a<00:01:40.939> longer

chemotherapy treatment to try to help
them<00:01:47.420> as<00:01:47.569> much<00:01:47.750> as<00:01:47.990> we<00:01:48.110> can<00:01:48.319> for<00:01:48.530> a<00:01:48.590> long<00:01:48.830> time

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
them as much as we can for a long time

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.430 
them as much as we can for a long time
as<00:01:49.490> far<00:01:49.670> as<00:01:49.819> chemotherapy<00:01:50.000> we<00:01:50.690> really<00:01:51.200> used

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
as far as chemotherapy we really used

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.940 
as far as chemotherapy we really used
very<00:01:52.310> similar<00:01:52.729> or<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.030> same<00:01:53.240> drugs<00:01:53.600> in<00:01:54.470> humans

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
very similar or the same drugs in humans

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.460 
very similar or the same drugs in humans
for<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.340> same<00:01:55.520> types<00:01:55.789> of<00:01:55.940> cancer<00:01:56.420> but<00:01:57.140> the

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
for the same types of cancer but the

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.070 
for the same types of cancer but the
doses<00:01:57.799> are<00:01:57.920> much<00:01:58.159> lower<00:01:58.909> because<00:01:59.690> side

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
doses are much lower because side

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.550 
doses are much lower because side
effects<00:02:00.380> are<00:02:00.530> usually<00:02:00.740> related<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.729> dose

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
effects are usually related to the dose

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.260 
effects are usually related to the dose
most<00:02:03.560> dogs<00:02:03.890> really<00:02:04.190> have<00:02:04.490> no<00:02:04.789> idea<00:02:05.090> that

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
most dogs really have no idea that

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.090 
most dogs really have no idea that
they're<00:02:05.450> going<00:02:05.659> through<00:02:05.750> chemotherapy<00:02:06.319> he

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
they're going through chemotherapy he

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.300 
they're going through chemotherapy he
really<00:02:07.399> never<00:02:07.640> got<00:02:07.909> sick<00:02:08.299> with<00:02:08.569> chemo<00:02:09.310> he

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
really never got sick with chemo he

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.270 
really never got sick with chemo he
never<00:02:10.610> lost<00:02:11.000> his<00:02:11.299> hair<00:02:11.840> obviously<00:02:12.680> the

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
never lost his hair obviously the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.220 
never lost his hair obviously the
radiation<00:02:14.470> hurt<00:02:15.470> him<00:02:15.860> but<00:02:16.730> they<00:02:17.540> said<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:18.049> me

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
radiation hurt him but they said to me

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.199

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
weeks to the day that you could tell

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.300 
weeks to the day that you could tell
that<00:02:26.450> he<00:02:26.540> was<00:02:26.570> coming<00:02:27.019> out<00:02:27.109> of<00:02:27.170> out<00:02:27.769> of<00:02:27.829> pain

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
and the chemo never really affected it

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.690 
and the chemo never really affected it
much<00:02:31.670> at<00:02:31.850> all<00:02:31.970> I<00:02:32.329> never<00:02:33.290> really<00:02:33.769> ever<00:02:34.010> noticed

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
that the care and the quality life that

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.010 
that the care and the quality life that
he<00:02:46.730> had<00:02:46.970> far<00:02:47.660> outweighed<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:49.400> if<00:02:49.970> it<00:02:50.209> were<00:02:50.390> my
