00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
before you run out of room oh yeah did I

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.830 
before you run out of room oh yeah did I
mention<00:03:39.430> that<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.910> wall<00:03:40.060> moves<00:03:40.329> forward<00:03:40.720> each

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
mention that the wall moves forward each

mention that the wall moves forward each
cycle<00:03:41.200> of<00:03:41.260> mechanics<00:03:41.709> how<00:03:41.980> awesome<00:03:42.459> is<00:03:42.609> that

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
cycle of mechanics how awesome is that

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.690 
cycle of mechanics how awesome is that
so<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.349> first<00:03:44.590> thing<00:03:44.829> to<00:03:44.859> watch<00:03:45.099> it<00:03:45.280> for<00:03:45.489> is

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
so the first thing to watch it for is

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.580 
so the first thing to watch it for is
the<00:03:45.910> void<00:03:46.120> zone<00:03:46.389> segments<00:03:46.989> of<00:03:47.109> the<00:03:47.349> ground

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
the void zone segments of the ground

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.650 
the void zone segments of the ground
these<00:03:48.250> always<00:03:48.579> come<00:03:48.910> in<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.120> same<00:03:49.299> fixed

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
these always come in the same fixed

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.089 
these always come in the same fixed
pattern<00:03:49.959> so<00:03:50.139> once<00:03:50.319> you<00:03:50.440> learn<00:03:50.620> it<00:03:50.680> it'll<00:03:51.040> be

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
pattern so once you learn it it'll be

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.550 
pattern so once you learn it it'll be
easy<00:03:51.280> to<00:03:51.430> expect<00:03:51.880> first<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:53.139> middle<00:03:53.319> will

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
easy to expect first the middle will

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.530 
easy to expect first the middle will
become<00:03:53.799> a<00:03:53.829> void<00:03:54.069> zone<00:03:54.310> then<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:54.940> two<00:03:55.120> outsides

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
become a void zone then the two outsides

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.390 
become a void zone then the two outsides
positioning<00:03:56.379> yourself<00:03:56.470> on<00:03:56.889> the<00:03:57.010> outer<00:03:57.160> edge

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
positioning yourself on the outer edge

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.129

of<00:03:57.549> the<00:03:57.669> middle<00:03:57.970> section<00:03:58.180> will<00:03:58.629> allow<00:03:58.840> for<00:03:58.900> the

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
of the middle section will allow for the

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:00.960 
of the middle section will allow for the
least<00:03:59.410> necessary<00:03:59.650> movement<00:04:00.459> while<00:04:00.579> dancing

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
least necessary movement while dancing

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:01.650 
least necessary movement while dancing
between

the wall will begin to move forward you
can<00:04:31.580> think<00:04:31.730> of<00:04:31.820> this<00:04:31.940> as<00:04:32.120> one<00:04:32.270> mechanic<00:04:32.720> cycle

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.350 
can think of this as one mechanic cycle
after<00:04:34.280> the<00:04:34.400> second<00:04:34.730> time<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.060> group<00:04:35.240> is

after the second time the group is
punted<00:04:35.690> backwards<00:04:36.080> you'll<00:04:36.290> notice<00:04:36.620> that<00:04:36.740> the
