 let's ask a question and answer 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.880
 but that this case like this time is going to 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.960
 be a little indifferent since a 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.789
 As I go answering the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.470
 questions I 'll go playing here in gta 5 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.969
 So, well, let's start with the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.280
 ask the first question 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.980
 mister david and ask me why I never 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.390
 enter the money from in gt5 online in the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.710
 good bank I asked myself why not 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.300
 income for example the money that this one 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.260
 loses just right up in 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.640
 the bank the good is not the case because 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.879
 of income simply because 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.760
 clear to enter if I can have it in 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.020
 the hand and what difference and not yes yes I know 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.579
 you have to enter then you have to have 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.840
 the controls to be able to buy different 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.760
 books and I do not know how to do it 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.989
 but when things that gave me that look 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.580
 that is that every time I get hydro 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.450
 then enter it and basically because 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.390
 is why 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.399
 the car is open active madrid and it 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.270

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.170
 I know already the magician of the saints is very 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.700
 inspected we've seen it already a whole 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.289
 lots of times and you see that grind that 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.880
 They gave me something a little different 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.319
 like the city of northampton and that 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.569
 put in there is a bank catches the work that 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.799

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.130
 Well, yes, I'd love to be shot 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:16.540

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.620
 take the car 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.740
 yellow they ask me and you would like 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.900
 there would be a nudist beach in gta 5 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.040
 online x health from murcia a 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.750
 bracelet also for the people of 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.220
 murcia and well, yes I would like 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.980
 discover a nudist beach in gt5 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.210
 online, the truth is obviously 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.980
 I would not like you to see a beach 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.810
 nudist in style plan like the village 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.610
 this the altruistic sect knew that you know 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.370
 what this kind of sect we can 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.070
 find by this area of ​​the map see was 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.400
 around here if I remember correctly was 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.200
 right here and I do not remember badly I do not 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.730
 agreement very not here was not good I did not 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.080
 I agreed that in this area I think to be 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.630
 down here but there's a kind of 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.370
 town in which it is spent all 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.540
 world goes naked the bad thing is that people 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.580
 that is inside town, they are 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.870
 old and are not 20 years old to see 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.070
 so the truth is that I'm going 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.410
 activities in beaches of seen I hope 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.090
 that were flat and in current plans 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.470
 knows how the central tourist that was 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.330
 a little more different you already know what 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.930
 I mean like people ask me 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.220
 the lord rectitude success uncle my mother and 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.990
 Danny tells me when it comes out 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.550
 the new coach will bring it is the channel 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.530
 health from the Canary Islands when 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.620
 canary here is one hour more or one hour 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.090
 minute I do not know now I stay white 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.710
 he asks me if I upload the new one with the 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.580
 new call of duty rather the 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.140
 captain 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.510
 advanced warfare to do to be a 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.710
 little more accurate because the main channel 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.170
 the truth that if there are to leave to day 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.520
 today your target 2 the cost and leave it 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.230
 of going up a long time ago because 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.930
 You know I do not like anything but nothing 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.820
 nothing nothing so do not know if the truth 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.990
 I have quite clear progress and if 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.820
 mola centuries 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.860
 we want it to be cool because how they turn it 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.330
 to be like the game is that god 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.040
 I go to the Troy office and what 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.510
 I blow everything but when I 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.040
 I would love it to be a call of duty that 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.620
 will engage and study enough 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.790
 similar to if he talks cotton and I do not know if I 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.530
 like what you are going to have from the 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.700
 first day in the channel and the wta that in 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.950
 As soon as I get out of the first thing 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.510
 pretty cane detracting all and here is 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.400
 of salt and all that because sometimes 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.140
 broth time I like a lot but 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.550
 as you can highlight tutti cous 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.260
 I liked nothing going to works that the 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.520
 white button is a little outdated like this 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.650
 that left the caudillo a little aside 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.150
 a second for that sport asks and if 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.709
 keep going up is that the new heat last 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.660
 is with the following question from the legends 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.730
 and you tell me you would like it to be possible 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.730
 buy the fighter greeting from my house 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:33.340
 Alcázar because the truth is that it would be 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.199
 very very very handsome as me 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.810
 I honestly get a lot of stick to have to 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.949
 always go to what is the military base to 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.130
 for a fighter every time I want 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.630
 driving it is the best plane by 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.599
 Excellence, no uncle labyrinth, please 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:50.740
 please uncle oysters to get back the 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:52.930
 car this here is the car and that's not 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.970
 I can dist 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:05:01.289
 madrid - lad's position for my mother uncle 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.289
 a minigame of them in cars 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:10.750
 We are in the disco and he asks me if 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.310
 I like that you could buy this 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.599
 house is par excellence the best action 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.460
 of the game since it is the fastest the most 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.349
 manageable et cetera etcetera and 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.699
 honestly as I said before they are 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:20.770
 many fucking pigeons of people who 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:22.479
 there is here having to go buy the good 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.120
 not have to always the military base 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:25.960
 every time we want to use it so 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.120
 if I will love that in the future 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.260
 put in a use a new one yet 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.330
 new option or something like that to be able to catch 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.160
 it would be a sting on the part of rockstar 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.110
 so let's hope they listen to us and 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.400
 final they make it dynastic because it has had 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.450
 the question says goodbye to me here there is one 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.880

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.580
