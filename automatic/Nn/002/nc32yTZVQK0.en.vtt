 from the barbie sky right in the head 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:02.250

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:28.099
 extremely successful marketing campaign 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:30.359

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:32.190
 presents and that ignites and comes good 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.400
 Never before had there been such a thing 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.400
 given 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.220
 The sales figures shoot up 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.680
 mattel comes with the order from 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.690
 Barely 20,000 barbies per week 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.700
 and the daring ruth with the fine 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.440
 A sense of innovation should come again 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.000

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.740
 the same for a complete year 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.420
 she uses her advertising placement 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.610
 not to the parents but directly 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.380
 to the children so to their target group 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.450
 mattel manages with this strategy 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.060
 within a short time under the top 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.830

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.770
 the whole world 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.570
 But as so often, great success is also 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.550
 with great sorrow and many attacks 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.350
 connected the model dimensions of pretty 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.690
 barbie lead from the beginning to 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.970
 Educational conflicts while unstrut 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.370

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.800
 the barbie stature is grumbling 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.630
 probably something for the daddy as for the 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.640
 young daughter little girl would from 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.200

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.850
 defeated her again at the 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.890

 Do not take your goods enthusiastically 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.980
 to advertise yourself and thus many 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.570
 women with similar destiny 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.520

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.620
 the barbie only colorful toys for me 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.419
 or female objectification for her 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.800
