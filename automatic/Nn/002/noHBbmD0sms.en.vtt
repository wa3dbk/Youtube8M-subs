00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.059
 11,000 kilometers to the test 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.400
 gerhard plattner from the polar circle to the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.779
 westernmost of africa 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.140
 Hammerfest the northernmost city 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.109
 Europe to Dakar with the new t5 of 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.189
 from the frozen lake in norway to 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.189
 in the sand of the Sahara 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.370
 the ferry will ferry the vw from denmark 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.230
 the german highways 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.500
 Gerhard Plattner can do a lot here 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.680
 save time the t5 controls with 160 km / h 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.230
 heading south to switzerland 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.030
 alpine passes up to 1800 meters above sea level 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.790
 then it goes to france 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.530
 the t5 is a slightly modified one 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.730
 Series vehicle with all-wheel drive only the 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:03.790
 Underrun protection became increasingly short 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:06.250
 stop in monaco then to spain in 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.470
 spanish tarifa rolls the t5 on the 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.640
 Ferry to africa and then it is 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:15.369
 first over with paved roads 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.860
 The political situation in Morocco has changed 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.740
 very strong in recent years 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:25.080
 improved and it is still like that today 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.220
 that you can see the last 100 kilometers of 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.590
 Moroccan borders very good 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.110
 be careful that one does not of the 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.119
 marked runway because the 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.119
 internet still from the polisario 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.540
 minefields are by no means the 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.760
 single driven as the drive 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.650
 could make a sudden end when in 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.080
 a sandstorm come in the inside 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.660
 Piste misplaced then it can be quite 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.240
 that you get stuck there for two days 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.210
 and neither come forward nor come back and all 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.620
 paradoxically it sounds like you have to wait until 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.740
 in the Sahara 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.840
 the snowplow is just coming in 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.210
 Sahara becomes satellite navigation 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.260
 faithful friend or not the one 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.000
 shifting dunes 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.310
 and there are many in the area 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.170
 constantly changing as her and the 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.120
 you have in the navigation system in the 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.490
 cards can not take it into account 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.010
 nevertheless to keep the orientation 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.200
 only one thing helps a local guide 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.240
 He has to even state-of-the-art technology 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.220
 can not do a genuine lukas kout 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.060
 replace 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:31.250
 He knows exactly what he needs to do 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.400
 one always navigates a puzzle 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.400
 stay 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.140
 The company lasts several weeks 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.760
 now already the sand of sahara 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.450
 do not want to end 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.430
 Variation is always welcome 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.400
 Away from us have a number of 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.810
 indigenous women stopped and 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.940
 wanted to have water 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.310
 a photographer who was with the 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.580
 digital camera the women photographed 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:05.190
 and show you the display the photo 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:07.170
 have passed before enjoying short 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.099
 meetings on the edge of a 11,000 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.099
 miles of travel 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.760
 the most important thing in all this is the technology 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.590
 the t5 keeps bigger glitches out 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.000
 even if choosing the right route 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.000
 is often a matter of luck 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.260
 Often decide a few inches 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.300
 come through or right or left over 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.819
 stay stuck until it gets to the 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.280
 the finish line goes to the long sandy beach 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.510
 from senegal the last meters to dakar 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.040
 time for a small resume 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.580
 it's easy to satisfy 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.740
 when you hear them at home or 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.920
 the only activity is that 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:57.540
 you come out talking's and does 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.540
 on the way back home
