without any branding so let's bring in

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.880 
without any branding so let's bring in
the<00:00:44.670> grey<00:00:45.059> one<00:00:45.660> here<00:00:45.870> we<00:00:46.140> could<00:00:46.320> check<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.680> look

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the grey one here we could check a look

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.819 
the grey one here we could check a look
at<00:00:47.100> some<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.239> differences<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:49.379> first

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
at some of the differences so first

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.389 
at some of the differences so first
obviously<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:50.670> black<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.160> see<00:00:53.370> that

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
obviously it's black so you can see that

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.520 
obviously it's black so you can see that
the<00:00:53.610> speaker<00:00:53.910> grill<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.390> less<00:00:54.660> defined<00:00:55.230> all

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the speaker grill is less defined all

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.990 
the speaker grill is less defined all
the<00:00:55.649> sensors<00:00:56.010> are<00:00:56.129> kind<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.370> less<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.640> find<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
the sensors are kind of less to find the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.970 
the sensors are kind of less to find the
speaker<00:00:57.270> grill<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.690> bottom<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.620> combine

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
speaker grill on the bottom that combine

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.189 
speaker grill on the bottom that combine
to<00:00:59.160> make<00:00:59.250> boomsound<00:00:59.850> are<00:01:00.570> also<00:01:00.780> served<00:01:01.050> less

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
to make boomsound are also served less

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.740 
to make boomsound are also served less
pronounced<00:01:01.710> than<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.309> grey<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:03.300> material

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
pronounced than on the grey the material

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.600 
pronounced than on the grey the material
and<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.930> feels<00:01:04.320> almost<00:01:04.559> exactly<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.309> same<00:01:05.400> so

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
and it feels almost exactly the same so

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.700 
and it feels almost exactly the same so
it<00:01:05.670> still<00:01:05.820> has<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.090> aluminum<00:01:06.630> feel<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.560> it

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
it still has that aluminum feel to it it

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.649 
it still has that aluminum feel to it it
looks<00:01:07.860> like<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.130> soft<00:01:08.340> touch<00:01:08.520> but<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.390> not

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
looks like it's soft touch but it is not

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.179 
looks like it's soft touch but it is not
I<00:01:09.960> will<00:01:10.350> say<00:01:10.500> though<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.920> I've<00:01:11.010> got

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189
