roof line that real classic American

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.260 
roof line that real classic American
look<00:00:31.650> if<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.399> want<00:00:32.550> your<00:00:32.669> home<00:00:32.880> or<00:00:33.090> building

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
look if you want your home or building

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.729 
look if you want your home or building
to<00:00:33.540> look<00:00:33.660> like<00:00:33.870> say<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.829> home<00:00:35.040> alone<00:00:35.370> house

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
to look like say the home alone house

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:46.520 
to look like say the home alone house
here<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:40.550> an<00:00:41.550> LED<00:00:42.030> one<00:00:45.140> now<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> difference

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
here is an LED one now the difference

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.299 
here is an LED one now the difference
between<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.670> two<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:49.079> LED<00:00:49.469> bulb<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.890> one

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
between the two is the LED bulb is one

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.000 
between the two is the LED bulb is one
watt<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:51.239> regular<00:00:51.600> filament<00:00:52.020> bulb<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.410> 15

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
watt the regular filament bulb is 15

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.680 
watt the regular filament bulb is 15
watts<00:00:53.809> so<00:00:54.809> basically<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:56.070> bulb<00:00:56.399> cost<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.270> 15

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
watts so basically this bulb cost you 15

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.349 
watts so basically this bulb cost you 15
times<00:00:58.050> more<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.469> energy<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.010> run<00:00:59.190> this<00:01:00.000> bulb

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
times more the energy to run this bulb

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.170 
times more the energy to run this bulb
will<00:01:01.170> also<00:01:01.530> last<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.129> for<00:01:02.309> around<00:01:02.520> about<00:01:02.579> 5<00:01:02.969> to

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
will also last you for around about 5 to

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.910 
will also last you for around about 5 to
10<00:01:03.239> years<00:01:03.449> where<00:01:03.989> these<00:01:04.170> bulbs<00:01:04.439> will<00:01:04.650> need<00:01:04.799> to

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
10 years where these bulbs will need to

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.190 
10 years where these bulbs will need to
be<00:01:04.979> replaced<00:01:05.159> every<00:01:05.640> year<00:01:06.060> these<00:01:06.659> balls<00:01:06.960> here

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
be replaced every year these balls here

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.140 
be replaced every year these balls here
though<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:08.220> regular<00:01:08.610> filaments<00:01:09.030> are

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
though in regular filaments are

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.170 
though in regular filaments are
considerably<00:01:10.049> cheaper<00:01:10.790> okay<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:11.939> just<00:01:11.970> to

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
considerably cheaper okay and just to

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.300 
considerably cheaper okay and just to
show<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.390> another<00:01:12.630> advantage<00:01:13.200> if<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:14.189> all

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
show you another advantage if we all

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.370 
show you another advantage if we all
screw<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.090> LED<00:01:15.509> bulb<00:01:17.810> bang<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.990> on<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.110> desk

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
screw the LED bulb bang it on a desk

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.320 
screw the LED bulb bang it on a desk
you'll<00:01:19.650> see<00:01:19.860> because<00:01:20.009> it's<00:01:20.250> made<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.729> plastic

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
you'll see because it's made of plastic

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.100 
you'll see because it's made of plastic
with<00:01:22.020> six<00:01:22.409> tiny<00:01:22.710> LED<00:01:23.070> lights<00:01:23.430> inside<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.180> very

with six tiny LED lights inside it very

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.539 
with six tiny LED lights inside it very
very<00:01:25.350> durable<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.070> pretty<00:01:26.310> much

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
very durable the pretty much

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.340 
very durable the pretty much
indestructible<00:01:26.990> that<00:01:27.990> ball<00:01:28.290> will<00:01:29.220> still<00:01:29.549> work

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
indestructible that ball will still work

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.420 
indestructible that ball will still work
okay<00:01:31.820> now<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.329> show<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.540> another<00:01:33.869> sample

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
okay now just to show you another sample

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.649 
okay now just to show you another sample
of<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.850> regular<00:01:36.659> filament<00:01:37.290> bulb

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.969 

okay<00:01:42.659> if<00:01:42.720> we<00:01:42.840> all<00:01:42.930> screw<00:01:43.260> that<00:01:43.470> now<00:01:45.200> desk<00:01:46.200> and

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
okay if we all screw that now desk and

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.640 
okay if we all screw that now desk and
screw<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.340> back<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:49.940> you'll<00:01:50.940> see<00:01:51.229> that<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.440> no

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
screw it back in you'll see that that no

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.850 
screw it back in you'll see that that no
longer<00:01:52.830> works<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.729> LED<00:01:54.360> bulbs<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.990> huge

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
longer works so LED bulbs a huge

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.520 
longer works so LED bulbs a huge
advantage<00:01:56.430> over<00:01:56.780> regular<00:01:57.780> filament<00:01:58.170> bulbs

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
advantage over regular filament bulbs

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.230 
advantage over regular filament bulbs
although<00:01:59.490> they<00:01:59.640> are<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.759> little<00:01:59.909> bit<00:02:00.090> more

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
although they are a little bit more

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.630 
although they are a little bit more
expensive<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.110> first<00:02:01.350> place<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.890> are

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
expensive in the first place that are

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.990 
expensive in the first place that are
better<00:02:02.759> investment<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.780> long<00:02:03.810> run
