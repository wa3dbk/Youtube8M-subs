00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.889

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.090
 present 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.370
 So I would like to introduce you to the faber 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.710
 castell polycom made of pens and the ground 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.110
 why i ordered them is because of that 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.129
 just have a very large variety of colors 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.540
 you can read now 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:45.610
 there are 120 different pens and the 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.579
 Price for the individual pen too 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:53.070
 relatively cheap so from 80 cents to 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:57.100
 about 150 you can the individual pen 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.229
 Buy it then we'll pack that 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.680
 Look out and see what to do 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:19.630
 for me that is also very close then 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:27.280
 I'll take this knife then let's see 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:29.579
 what we expected ok with a cd would have 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:35.429
 I did not expect it now 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.429
 is on it creative 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.520
 if you are interested in what is on the cd 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.590
 then I will see it all 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.790
 definitely report on facebook 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.360
 but this is now a interesting 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:55.710
 us what can one recognize yes on each one 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.190
 case, no pins 120 on the sides has 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.520
 They are so rubbery that you can not do it 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.770
 and that's why you recognize it below 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.979
 other donors and there is one more 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:13.110
 Third range where you can find the legal 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:15.570
 So you can see stifter as you can see 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.690
 there are a lot of different sounds on 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.310
 blue green 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.870
 That was also the reason why I want 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.570
 that this foundation or because of it 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.840
 this color variety and I wanted you 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.540
 but schonmal or at the bayern like 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.890
 as mike platz kowski von von manz ag 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.800
 I wanted to draw you yet 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.230
 show how to use such pictures without 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.820
 draw humor brand in 3d optics 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.520
 and that's why it's so important 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.269
 to have variety 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.430
 Of course you do not have to 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.290
 buy everything at once here comes that 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.650
 piece by piece as I said the price is 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.560
 not really expensive for crayons clear 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:03:11.540
 are very high quality therefore only 80 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:14.540
 cent to 1 euro 50 and probably so 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.540
 application techniques 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:26.380
 interesting about the company yes what 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:37.090
 is so special about these pens now 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:38.860
 I can show you shortly so for 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:46.380
 Crayons can be very opaque 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:46.380
 work and very nice instead of him 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.230
 it is much more time consuming 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.500
 as strikingly as with felt-tip ball 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.870
 be applied 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.330
 many foundations where you need 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.050
 You definitely have a lot of time to get there 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.000
 invest much more time but more 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.990
 i will definitely do that for you 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.700
 show next video 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:17.470
 that was the unboxing of the color 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:22.320
 kastel poly kronos in 120 stifter box
