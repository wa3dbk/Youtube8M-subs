00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.040 
hi everyone this is my 390 I had a

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.330 
hi everyone this is my 390 I had a
little<00:00:10.700> crash<00:00:11.120> just<00:00:11.540> recently<00:00:12.260> and<00:00:12.530> I<00:00:12.920> felt

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
little crash just recently and I felt

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.490 
little crash just recently and I felt
that<00:00:13.459> was<00:00:13.580> important<00:00:14.059> to<00:00:14.270> communicate<00:00:15.200> my

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
that was important to communicate my

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.429 
that was important to communicate my
experience<00:00:16.009> with<00:00:16.160> you<00:00:16.279> guys<00:00:16.840> in<00:00:17.840> two<00:00:18.080> parts

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
experience with you guys in two parts

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.100 
experience with you guys in two parts
the<00:00:18.590> first<00:00:18.740> part<00:00:19.040> is<00:00:19.369> the<00:00:19.759> damage<00:00:20.420> that<00:00:20.450> was

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
the first part is the damage that was

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.810 
the first part is the damage that was
done<00:00:21.170> or<00:00:21.529> more<00:00:21.860> importantly<00:00:22.310> was<00:00:22.460> not<00:00:22.610> done

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
done or more importantly was not done

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.820 
done or more importantly was not done
and<00:00:23.600> secondly<00:00:25.180> to<00:00:26.199> highlight<00:00:27.199> a<00:00:27.439> particular

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
and secondly to highlight a particular

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.560 
and secondly to highlight a particular
issue<00:00:28.430> with<00:00:28.939> the<00:00:29.269> KTM<00:00:29.869> Duke<00:00:30.560> 390<00:00:31.130> that<00:00:31.820> I<00:00:31.849> feel

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
issue with the KTM Duke 390 that I feel

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.990 
issue with the KTM Duke 390 that I feel
should<00:00:33.050> be<00:00:33.110> I<00:00:33.290> feel<00:00:33.440> very<00:00:33.680> strongly<00:00:34.100> actually

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
should be I feel very strongly actually

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.470 
should be I feel very strongly actually
should<00:00:35.210> be<00:00:36.460> telecasted<00:00:37.460> made<00:00:37.640> aware<00:00:37.910> to

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
should be telecasted made aware to

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.960 
should be telecasted made aware to
people<00:00:38.930> all<00:00:39.229> around<00:00:39.530> who<00:00:39.890> owned<00:00:40.220> one<00:00:40.580> of<00:00:40.610> these

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
people all around who owned one of these

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:41.979 
people all around who owned one of these
the<00:00:41.600> bikes

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
the bikes

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.530 
the bikes
either<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:42.769> 390<00:00:43.339> or<00:00:43.489> the<00:00:43.580> 200<00:00:44.059> or<00:00:44.150> even<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:44.390> 1

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
either the 390 or the 200 or even the 1

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.450 
either the 390 or the 200 or even the 1
to<00:00:44.720> 5<00:00:44.960> I<00:00:44.989> understand<00:00:45.530> they're<00:00:46.190> all<00:00:46.339> identical

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
to 5 I understand they're all identical

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.820 
to 5 I understand they're all identical
but<00:00:47.000> that<00:00:47.120> will<00:00:47.269> be<00:00:47.299> in<00:00:47.449> part<00:00:47.900> two<00:00:48.170> so<00:00:48.440> for<00:00:48.650> part

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
but that will be in part two so for part

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.630 
but that will be in part two so for part
one<00:00:49.040> I<00:00:49.250> just<00:00:50.030> like<00:00:50.210> to<00:00:50.420> run<00:00:51.199> through<00:00:51.589> what<00:00:52.460> has

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
one I just like to run through what has

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.149 
one I just like to run through what has
occurred<00:00:53.000> so<00:00:53.299> I<00:00:53.780> had<00:00:54.110> what<00:00:54.320> I<00:00:54.350> would<00:00:54.680> call<00:00:54.890> a

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:55.159 
occurred so I had what I would call a

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.530 
occurred so I had what I would call a
mini<00:00:55.699> or<00:00:56.030> a<00:00:56.150> semi<00:00:56.629> high<00:00:56.930> side<00:00:57.640> and<00:00:58.640> the

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
mini or a semi high side and the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.039 
mini or a semi high side and the
culmination<00:01:00.140> of<00:01:00.650> that<00:01:00.920> was<00:01:01.729> that<00:01:02.119> my<00:01:02.780> bike

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
culmination of that was that my bike

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.460 
culmination of that was that my bike
landed<00:01:03.530> on<00:01:03.650> the<00:01:03.739> left-hand<00:01:04.190> side<00:01:04.780> of<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:06.170> of

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
landed on the left-hand side of the of

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.580 
landed on the left-hand side of the of
of<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.220> bike<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:07.790> and<00:01:08.119> downhill<00:01:09.049> so<00:01:09.439> the

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
of the bike and and downhill so the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.800 
of the bike and and downhill so the
backbone<00:01:09.799> of<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.250> bike<00:01:10.460> was<00:01:10.820> sort<00:01:11.660> of<00:01:11.690> at

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
backbone of the bike was sort of at

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.560 
backbone of the bike was sort of at
perpendicular<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:12.620> the<00:01:12.860> road<00:01:13.010> direction<00:01:13.570> and

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
perpendicular to the road direction and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.410 
perpendicular to the road direction and
sliding<00:01:15.140> downhill<00:01:15.550> and<00:01:16.550> I<00:01:16.640> have<00:01:16.790> to<00:01:16.910> say<00:01:17.090> I<00:01:17.120> was

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
sliding downhill and I have to say I was

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.070 
sliding downhill and I have to say I was
astounded<00:01:18.110> with<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:19.130> lack<00:01:19.400> of<00:01:19.870> damage<00:01:20.870> that

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
astounded with the lack of damage that

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.820 
astounded with the lack of damage that
was<00:01:21.230> done<00:01:21.460> when<00:01:22.460> I<00:01:23.030> mean<00:01:23.480> I<00:01:23.750> had<00:01:24.380> a<00:01:24.410> couple<00:01:24.710> of

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
was done when I mean I had a couple of

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.680 
was done when I mean I had a couple of
broken<00:01:25.010> ribs<00:01:25.190> out<00:01:25.550> of<00:01:25.670> this<00:01:25.790> it<00:01:26.210> was<00:01:26.390> not

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
broken ribs out of this it was not

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.020 
broken ribs out of this it was not
something<00:01:26.960> that<00:01:27.140> was<00:01:27.410> a<00:01:27.740> minor<00:01:28.130> thing<00:01:28.460> the

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
something that was a minor thing the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.750 
something that was a minor thing the
bike<00:01:29.240> landed<00:01:29.450> really<00:01:29.930> hard<00:01:30.220> as<00:01:31.220> I<00:01:31.280> said<00:01:31.550> it<00:01:31.670> was

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
bike landed really hard as I said it was

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.790 
bike landed really hard as I said it was
downhill<00:01:32.000> was<00:01:32.450> down<00:01:32.600> a<00:01:32.630> fairly<00:01:32.990> steep<00:01:33.230> hill<00:01:33.470> so

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
downhill was down a fairly steep hill so

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.670 
downhill was down a fairly steep hill so
that<00:01:34.400> made<00:01:34.640> a<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:35.000> know<00:01:35.090> an<00:01:35.180> extra<00:01:35.570> 30<00:01:36.320> or<00:01:36.530> 60

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
that made a you know an extra 30 or 60

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.860 
that made a you know an extra 30 or 60
centimeters<00:01:37.340> of<00:01:37.490> drop<00:01:37.700> length<00:01:38.150> as<00:01:38.390> well<00:01:38.600> on

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
centimeters of drop length as well on

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.500 
centimeters of drop length as well on
that<00:01:39.440> flip<00:01:39.740> from<00:01:40.550> from<00:01:40.820> one<00:01:40.970> side<00:01:41.240> to<00:01:41.270> the

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
that flip from from one side to the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.240 
that flip from from one side to the
other<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:41.990> eventually<00:01:42.470> landing<00:01:43.100> on<00:01:43.190> the

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
other and eventually landing on the

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.330 
other and eventually landing on the
left-hand<00:01:43.610> side<00:01:43.640> so<00:01:44.140> and<00:01:45.140> what<00:01:45.470> I<00:01:45.500> think<00:01:45.770> was<00:01:46.310> a

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
left-hand side so and what I think was a

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.780 
left-hand side so and what I think was a
significant<00:01:47.330> major<00:01:48.260> part<00:01:49.100> of<00:01:49.250> saving<00:01:49.700> the

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
significant major part of saving the

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.410 
significant major part of saving the
bike<00:01:49.970> was<00:01:50.750> these<00:01:51.320> little<00:01:51.680> things<00:01:51.950> here<00:01:52.420> this

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
bike was these little things here this

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.140 
bike was these little things here this
is<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.750> Ebert<00:01:54.200> X<00:01:54.500> slider<00:01:54.830> and<00:01:55.220> I'd<00:01:55.880> fitted

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
is the Ebert X slider and I'd fitted

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.240 
is the Ebert X slider and I'd fitted
that<00:01:56.330> or<00:01:57.110> fitted<00:01:57.380> them<00:01:57.560> a<00:01:57.590> couple<00:01:57.920> of<00:01:58.070> weeks

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
that or fitted them a couple of weeks

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.830 
that or fitted them a couple of weeks
beforehand<00:01:58.820> and<00:01:58.970> thought<00:01:59.180> this<00:01:59.510> is<00:01:59.659> really

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
beforehand and thought this is really

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.980 
beforehand and thought this is really
where<00:02:00.140> they<00:02:00.320> stick<00:02:00.560> out<00:02:01.090> strangely<00:02:02.090> and

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
where they stick out strangely and

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.240 
where they stick out strangely and
and<00:02:04.299> what<00:02:05.299> would<00:02:05.450> they<00:02:05.600> really<00:02:05.899> do<00:02:06.140> they<00:02:07.040> do<00:02:07.100> a

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
and what would they really do they do a

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.050 
and what would they really do they do a
lot<00:02:07.750> as<00:02:08.750> it<00:02:09.020> turns<00:02:09.259> out<00:02:09.500> now<00:02:10.160> just<00:02:10.759> to<00:02:10.849> point

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
lot as it turns out now just to point

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.820 
lot as it turns out now just to point
out<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.890> damage<00:02:13.280> that<00:02:13.310> occurred<00:02:14.500> we<00:02:15.500> have

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
out the damage that occurred we have

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.250

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
this is my first video so I'm getting

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.729 
this is my first video so I'm getting
used<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.540> how<00:02:24.019> this<00:02:24.200> works

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
used to how this works

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.290 
used to how this works
bars<00:02:25.280> are<00:02:25.459> slightly<00:02:25.670> bent<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.060> can't

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
bars are slightly bent you can't

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.180 
bars are slightly bent you can't
actually<00:02:26.420> see<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:26.959> but<00:02:27.200> they<00:02:27.830> are<00:02:27.860> slightly

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
actually see that but they are slightly

actually see that but they are slightly
bent<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:30.400> bar<00:02:31.400> end<00:02:31.700> here

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
bent the bar end here

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.590 
bent the bar end here
it's<00:02:32.660> like<00:02:32.900> praise<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:34.550> clutch<00:02:34.880> lever<00:02:34.910> also

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
it's like praise the clutch lever also

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
had a this like graze as well but I've

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.000 
had a this like graze as well but I've
since<00:02:37.519> changed<00:02:37.580> them<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.120> shorty<00:02:38.660> leavers<00:02:39.010> the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
since changed them to shorty leavers the

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.559 
since changed them to shorty leavers the
particular<00:02:40.280> reason<00:02:40.730> which<00:02:40.850> I'll<00:02:41.030> get<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.209> in

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
particular reason which I'll get to in

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.680 
particular reason which I'll get to in
the<00:02:41.750> second<00:02:42.080> video<00:02:43.150> moving<00:02:44.150> down<00:02:44.330> there<00:02:44.569> was

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
the second video moving down there was

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.220 
the second video moving down there was
no<00:02:45.040> further<00:02:46.040> damage<00:02:46.370> on<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:47.600> left<00:02:47.810> hand<00:02:47.989> side

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
no further damage on the left hand side

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.720 
no further damage on the left hand side
of<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:48.380> bike<00:02:49.330> except<00:02:50.330> for<00:02:50.660> here<00:02:51.470> which<00:02:52.370> is<00:02:52.549> on

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
of the bike except for here which is on

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.370 
of the bike except for here which is on
that<00:02:52.940> cover<00:02:53.209> that<00:02:53.480> someone<00:02:53.959> shook<00:02:54.140> you<00:02:54.260> can

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
that cover that someone shook you can

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.479 
that cover that someone shook you can
see<00:02:54.530> that<00:02:54.680> clearly<00:02:54.830> but<00:02:55.130> it's<00:02:55.250> actually

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
see that clearly but it's actually

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:56.890 
see that clearly but it's actually
relatively<00:02:55.850> minor<00:02:56.180> damage<00:02:56.600> there's<00:02:56.780> no

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
relatively minor damage there's no

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.140 
relatively minor damage there's no
cracks<00:02:57.230> or<00:02:57.410> splits<00:02:57.530> or<00:02:58.010> holes<00:02:58.700> or<00:02:58.970> anything

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
cracks or splits or holes or anything

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.759 
cracks or splits or holes or anything
like<00:02:59.510> that

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
like that

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.410 
like that
and<00:03:01.010> then<00:03:01.580> back<00:03:02.299> to<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:02.900> gear<00:03:03.440> lever<00:03:03.940> I<00:03:04.940> think

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
and then back to the gear lever I think

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.560 
and then back to the gear lever I think
you<00:03:05.540> can<00:03:05.690> see<00:03:05.959> that<00:03:05.989> it's<00:03:06.290> twisted<00:03:06.709> up

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
you can see that it's twisted up

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.750 
you can see that it's twisted up
slightly<00:03:08.570> but<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.200> ductility<00:03:09.769> in<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.400> in<00:03:10.670> the

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
slightly but the ductility in the in the

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.520 
slightly but the ductility in the in the
metal<00:03:11.030> I'm<00:03:11.150> really<00:03:11.510> surprised<00:03:11.900> with<00:03:12.140> because

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
metal I'm really surprised with because

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.440 
metal I'm really surprised with because
it<00:03:12.650> didn't<00:03:12.890> break<00:03:13.100> off<00:03:13.310> they<00:03:13.820> just<00:03:13.850> bend<00:03:14.269> up

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
it didn't break off they just bend up

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.449 
it didn't break off they just bend up
and<00:03:14.660> took<00:03:15.140> quite<00:03:15.380> a<00:03:15.440> pounding<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.980> bit<00:03:16.310> of<00:03:16.400> a

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
and took quite a pounding a bit of a

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.210 
and took quite a pounding a bit of a
grind<00:03:16.780> here<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:19.010> foot<00:03:19.190> peg<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:21.680> if<00:03:21.920> you<00:03:22.070> can

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
grind here the foot peg and if you can

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.039 
grind here the foot peg and if you can
see<00:03:22.489> there<00:03:22.760> but<00:03:22.940> as<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.239> bike<00:03:23.420> fell<00:03:23.660> over<00:03:23.930> this

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
see there but as the bike fell over this

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.410 
see there but as the bike fell over this
foot<00:03:24.380> peg<00:03:24.560> folded<00:03:24.950> up<00:03:25.040> obviously<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:26.269> can

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
foot peg folded up obviously and you can

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.740 
foot peg folded up obviously and you can
see<00:03:26.630> the<00:03:26.780> grinding<00:03:27.579> there<00:03:28.579> and<00:03:29.269> then<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.540> side

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
see the grinding there and then the side

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.740 
see the grinding there and then the side
stand<00:03:30.109> as<00:03:30.320> well<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:32.150> then<00:03:32.299> the<00:03:32.390> other<00:03:32.420> place

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
stand as well and then the other place

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.170 
stand as well and then the other place
we<00:03:32.989> touched<00:03:33.230> down<00:03:33.350> was<00:03:33.799> here<00:03:34.700> on<00:03:34.880> that<00:03:35.000> rear

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
we touched down was here on that rear

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.340 
we touched down was here on that rear
bobbin<00:03:35.569> which<00:03:36.230> I<00:03:36.380> hope<00:03:36.560> you<00:03:36.739> can<00:03:36.920> see<00:03:38.019> as<00:03:39.019> well

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
bobbin which I hope you can see as well

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.289 
bobbin which I hope you can see as well
and<00:03:39.760> that's<00:03:40.760> it<00:03:40.989> so<00:03:41.989> I<00:03:42.760> guess<00:03:43.760> in<00:03:43.910> summary<00:03:44.150> a

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
and that's it so I guess in summary a

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:45.309 
and that's it so I guess in summary a
couple<00:03:44.569> of<00:03:44.630> things<00:03:44.780> first<00:03:44.959> of<00:03:45.109> all<00:03:45.200> I'm<00:03:45.260> really

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
couple of things first of all I'm really

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.309 
couple of things first of all I'm really
surprised<00:03:45.889> with<00:03:46.420> how<00:03:47.420> well<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:47.810> bike<00:03:47.989> feared

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
surprised with how well the bike feared

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.629 
surprised with how well the bike feared
given<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.040> circumstances<00:03:49.760> but<00:03:50.600> secondly<00:03:51.049> how

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
given the circumstances but secondly how

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:55.830 
given the circumstances but secondly how
well<00:03:52.639> there's<00:03:53.600> this<00:03:54.170> particular<00:03:54.620> bobbin

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
well there's this particular bobbin

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.180 
well there's this particular bobbin
performed<00:03:56.840> there's<00:03:57.799> a<00:03:57.889> number<00:03:58.010> of<00:03:58.100> different

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
performed there's a number of different

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.030 
performed there's a number of different
designs<00:03:58.700> around<00:03:58.880> they're<00:03:59.630> mostly<00:04:00.410> emanating

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
designs around they're mostly emanating

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.099 
designs around they're mostly emanating
from<00:04:01.130> that<00:04:01.280> position<00:04:01.430> on<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.790> bike<00:04:02.109> obviously

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
from that position on the bike obviously

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.840 
from that position on the bike obviously
there's<00:04:03.290> been<00:04:03.319> some<00:04:03.769> homework<00:04:04.250> done<00:04:04.489> by<00:04:04.639> some
