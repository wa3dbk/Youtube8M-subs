00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.299
 there guys I'm here to try to help 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.510
 you with mechanical ax actions 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.309
 sleep well 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.490
 basically it works for two 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.710
 shapes or ax 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.510
 you randomly ax 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:22.140
 I'm hanging out there 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.590
 or you command that the ax goes in 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.330
 direction randomly I mean 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.310
 that when you go knocking, you'll prepare the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.680
 men and more prepared highlighted 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.870
 ax loaded you ax fell only 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.930
 says that just right upon you 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.000
 if you give a hit walk then 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.160
 ax the direction you your doll 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.670
 was turned 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.039
 ie it is a hit and still down one 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.170
 call that the sedan version hit the target 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.120
 to key up the team won the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.440
 reading that the new right ax 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.750
 Believe and so will 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:03.300
 it does not change that has not to this 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.710
 mechanics are you going to hit a floor 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.479
 story if you want I'll show 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.229
 How exactly does it work? 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.360
 I hit the car on the right or 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.020
 on the left, what matters is that 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.600
 will fall into a random form my 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.040
 side around me but never goes behind 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.729
 front always on the left side 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.729
 right 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.259
 I stopped for a beating of the lion's palm 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.689
 for me to hit the car on top of me 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.670
 beauty but I want to change it, of course 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.610
 You want to change it, why is it still going? 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.090
 to be compared to it you will be great 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.090
 chance 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.549
 you will get easier is focused to take 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.480
 it is certain that doing 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:57.230
 I carry a relaxed ax knocks and both 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.460
 debate and part walking there because I 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.470
 I'll beat the floor because when you 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.420
 fight an ax anderson you 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.440
 Is he wanting his wife? 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.000
 it was agreed 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.650
 struck the left beaten enough for there 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.600
 beat behind which is basically 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.820
 this does not change 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.500
 sometimes you have a crisis in front of you 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.740
 very close to your bank will give a 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.840
 breach otherwise he will see him play will give 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.220
 a slight turn from nowhere and that will 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.160
 disrupt because of mismanagement 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.750
 discovery the turn then in a thousandth 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.150
 from second -table with the left and 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.190
 You on the right foot but took care of the left 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:36.830
 that launches function of this not to be hurt 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:40.100
 right-left think but how 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.990
 the best this expensive question is to train in the 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.390
 map 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.520
 When do you usually find a generation? 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.720
 What do you want to see, you said ax? 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.890
 this whole matter looks like you're going 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.840
 see the ax ax of the organization 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.080
 right now the ax for the 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.080
 selection 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.280
 remembering that when you take a 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.800
 ax you today's reservation 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.860
 so if you can always keep 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.080
 active axes or zoom 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.390
 You'll always be the same today and 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:16.670
 This greatly increases your playing style . 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:19.610
 the game is a lot about damage according to 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.100
 only problem with the following purple 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.520
 every time you activate the ranch 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.320
 ax will not be as fast as 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.900
 you 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.250
 so when you hit you walk usually 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.140
 Can you get an ax one? 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.770
 good and this will sometimes have the greatest 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.320
 stop but when you rush active 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.420
 You're going to have to take a bite that 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.970
 would be a great stop then you will 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.459
 have to stop right on top of the racing or 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.930
 indicator you will have to go back to 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.370
 get ax this is bad it is bad but 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.989
 this is the great grace knee 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.819
 how the stock market beat today 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.450
 look look the acc 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:01.099
 00 I did not get it right and I'm not going to get your 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.719
 luxury item I will never get a key 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.639
 stop sign 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:12.650
 unless it holds up or ahead of 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:20.739
 a slight detour hitting and making you 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:20.739
 stop or you come back I'll get you 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.360
 when you get a certain one does not arrive 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.210
 to hit pretty much especially 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.090
 with a void 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.419
 you can do it but it 's a bit difficult with 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.280
 The lack of this for sure you can 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:52.490
 give two attacks instead of walking at a 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:56.750
 late two attacks find increases greatly 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:59.030
 of psfs hit twice and goes and goes with 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.039
 ax reject will hit twice 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.009
 believe but that's how it works 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:08.960
 when it is thought that a point 37 fit 1.4 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:10.520
 that doing this is a little tricky 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.250
 how much more peaceful and 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.610
 such a goal quite and that is the ideal you 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.710
 gives two attacks 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.780
 yana picked ax well if I hope 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:24.259
 not as enlightening I know but the mechanics 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.699
 is simple in the soya stainless steel theoretical view is 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:27.440
 a little complicated on your thigh already 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:30.470
 Practic you will have to divert skills 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.139
 of the course of art fight and this is sometimes 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.969
 complicated this gives me of fight then 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:39.209
 this difficulty 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:41.999
 and we'll have begging axes and dps 

00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:42.919
 A lot then you have to get good at it. 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:47.729
 not 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:48.719
 you 'll never be one of them ever and 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:50.009
 Baby 

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:52.409
 luckily or unfortunately the game 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:54.839
 aggressive so the idea is that you 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:06:02.189
 all the time all the time 

00:05:54.839 --> 00:06:05.369
 Like sponges to be able to hit the 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:06.779
 face you fix if you are one you 

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:10.259
 can beat garcia ax the time 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:13.499
 all you will have all the time 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:15.389
 two active styles classes had the 

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:18.809
 axes in the human cost carlos ipegue 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:20.669
 Today's game will always be outside the 

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:22.919
 channel for you to use both to escape 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:24.599
 with a carpet and she has always been 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:28.199
 Up because that's what I get. 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:31.699
 fall in love with what I feel good I hope 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:36.049
 It has helped any doubt, it's just 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:36.049
 get in touch do not drown everything
