00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
it gets to the next level this can

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.490 
it gets to the next level this can
really<00:03:39.880> confirm<00:03:40.330> seventh<00:03:40.660> generation<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:41.320> it

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
really confirm seventh generation and it

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.470 
really confirm seventh generation and it
can<00:03:41.650> convert<00:03:41.830> something<00:03:42.280> crazy<00:03:42.670> so<00:03:43.270> what<00:03:43.390> I

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
can convert something crazy so what I

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.090 
can convert something crazy so what I
was<00:03:43.630> thinking<00:03:44.050> is<00:03:44.170> even<00:03:44.739> though<00:03:44.830> this<00:03:44.890> is<00:03:45.070> a

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
was thinking is even though this is a

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.800 
was thinking is even though this is a
bright<00:03:45.580> green<00:03:45.820> blob<00:03:46.120> I<00:03:46.239> keep<00:03:46.420> like<00:03:46.540> clicking

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
bright green blob I keep like clicking

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.600 
bright green blob I keep like clicking
on<00:03:47.020> and<00:03:47.170> off<00:03:47.290> this<00:03:47.709> is<00:03:47.830> a<00:03:47.860> bright<00:03:48.130> green<00:03:48.310> blob

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
on and off this is a bright green blob

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.510 
on and off this is a bright green blob
if<00:03:48.820> it<00:03:49.150> in<00:03:49.270> fact<00:03:49.300> has<00:03:50.110> 1i<00:03:50.530> like<00:03:51.040> most<00:03:51.250> of<00:03:51.400> these

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
if it in fact has 1i like most of these

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.940 
if it in fact has 1i like most of these
drawings<00:03:52.120> suggest<00:03:52.600> and<00:03:52.780> it<00:03:52.840> has<00:03:52.989> some<00:03:53.620> kind<00:03:53.800> of

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
something like that I'm thinking baby

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.420 
something like that I'm thinking baby
pokemon<00:04:03.489> for<00:04:04.360> Duskull<00:04:05.020> but<00:04:05.830> how<00:04:06.160> could<00:04:06.310> that

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
pokemon for Duskull but how could that

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.680 
pokemon for Duskull but how could that
be<00:04:06.489> that<00:04:06.760> means<00:04:06.970> we're<00:04:07.060> going<00:04:07.150> to<00:04:07.209> have<00:04:07.270> a<00:04:07.390> 4

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
be that means we're going to have a 4

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.170 
be that means we're going to have a 4
chain<00:04:07.959> evolution<00:04:08.560> in<00:04:08.680> Pokemon<00:04:09.100> well<00:04:09.580> I<00:04:09.610> feel

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
chain evolution in Pokemon well I feel

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.660 
chain evolution in Pokemon well I feel
that<00:04:10.720> there's<00:04:10.870> only<00:04:11.020> like<00:04:11.110> 11<00:04:11.890> I<00:04:11.920> pokemon<00:04:12.280> with

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
that there's only like 11 I pokemon with

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.430 
that there's only like 11 I pokemon with
two<00:04:12.850> slots<00:04:13.150> for<00:04:13.390> an<00:04:13.510> eye<00:04:13.630> and<00:04:13.930> that's<00:04:14.170> going<00:04:14.380> to

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
two slots for an eye and that's going to

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.960 
two slots for an eye and that's going to
be<00:04:14.530> dust<00:04:14.709> cool<00:04:14.950> so<00:04:15.340> that<00:04:15.489> means<00:04:15.640> this<00:04:15.730> could<00:04:15.910> be

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
be dust cool so that means this could be

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.120 
be dust cool so that means this could be
a<00:04:16.000> baby<00:04:16.239> Pokemon<00:04:16.750> which<00:04:17.200> means<00:04:17.500> if<00:04:17.709> it<00:04:17.799> is<00:04:17.859> a

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
a baby Pokemon which means if it is a

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.729 
a baby Pokemon which means if it is a
baby<00:04:18.520> Pokemon<00:04:19.090> now<00:04:19.660> we're<00:04:20.260> dealing<00:04:20.590> with

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
baby Pokemon now we're dealing with

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.860 
baby Pokemon now we're dealing with
potential<00:04:21.310> evolutions<00:04:22.150> that's<00:04:22.600> going<00:04:22.750> to<00:04:22.810> be

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
potential evolutions that's going to be

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.750 
potential evolutions that's going to be
like<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.050> fortune<00:04:23.440> ever<00:04:23.590> all<00:04:24.070> over<00:04:24.490> again

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
like the fortune ever all over again

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.900 
like the fortune ever all over again
maybe<00:04:24.940> like<00:04:25.180> that<00:04:25.360> would<00:04:25.510> be

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
maybe like that would be

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.070 
maybe like that would be
well<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.210> greatest<00:04:26.390> things<00:04:26.660> for<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:26.840> seventh

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
well the greatest things for the seventh

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.450 
well the greatest things for the seventh
generation<00:04:27.200> we<00:04:27.560> get<00:04:27.680> a<00:04:27.710> nice<00:04:27.890> batch<00:04:28.160> of<00:04:28.340> new

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
generation we get a nice batch of new

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.160 
generation we get a nice batch of new
pokemon<00:04:28.880> and<00:04:29.120> then<00:04:29.390> we<00:04:29.450> also<00:04:29.600> get<00:04:29.810> some<00:04:29.960> old

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
pokemon and then we also get some old

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.020 
pokemon and then we also get some old
pokemon<00:04:30.350> getting<00:04:30.950> baby<00:04:31.430> forms<00:04:31.850> those

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
pokemon getting baby forms those

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.970 
pokemon getting baby forms those
improving<00:04:32.630> their<00:04:32.780> story<00:04:33.200> they're<00:04:33.770> like

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
improving their story they're like

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.320 
improving their story they're like
evolution<00:04:34.340> tree<00:04:34.670> and<00:04:35.030> then<00:04:35.150> we<00:04:35.210> get

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
evolution tree and then we get

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.690 
evolution tree and then we get
evolutions<00:04:36.110> for<00:04:36.650> existing<00:04:37.010> Pokemon<00:04:37.430> I'm

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
evolutions for existing Pokemon I'm

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.640 
evolutions for existing Pokemon I'm
waiting<00:04:38.060> for<00:04:38.120> that<00:04:38.300> Dunsparce<00:04:38.840> so<00:04:39.320> maybe<00:04:39.500> it

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
waiting for that Dunsparce so maybe it

well<00:05:01.040> my<00:05:01.190> thought<00:05:01.460> is<00:05:01.670> that<00:05:01.730> in<00:05:02.390> cartoons

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
well my thought is that in cartoons

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.160 
well my thought is that in cartoons
generally<00:05:03.710> ectoplasm<00:05:04.460> is<00:05:04.760> like<00:05:05.450> a<00:05:05.480> glowy

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
generally ectoplasm is like a glowy

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.260 
generally ectoplasm is like a glowy
green<00:05:06.590> substance<00:05:07.250> even<00:05:07.760> though<00:05:07.850> like<00:05:08.090> the

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
green substance even though like the

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.000 
green substance even though like the
actual<00:05:08.600> things<00:05:08.780> behind<00:05:08.990> ectoplasm<00:05:09.470> go

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
actual things behind ectoplasm go

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.680 
actual things behind ectoplasm go
anywhere<00:05:10.310> from<00:05:10.460> like<00:05:10.550> a<00:05:10.670> creamy<00:05:11.000> white<00:05:11.270> to

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
anywhere from like a creamy white to

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.230 
anywhere from like a creamy white to
black<00:05:12.230> depending<00:05:12.740> on<00:05:13.070> whatever<00:05:13.610> series<00:05:14.120> is

black depending on whatever series is

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.300 
black depending on whatever series is
going<00:05:14.390> on<00:05:14.540> but<00:05:14.720> in<00:05:14.840> cartoons<00:05:15.320> or<00:05:15.680> something

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
going on but in cartoons or something

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.920

like<00:05:16.490> even<00:05:16.790> with<00:05:16.850> ghostbusters<00:05:17.480> know<00:05:17.660> it<00:05:17.810> was

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
like even with ghostbusters know it was

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.170 
like even with ghostbusters know it was
kind<00:05:18.110> of<00:05:18.170> coined<00:05:18.470> as<00:05:18.710> this<00:05:19.190> bright<00:05:19.640> green

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
kind of coined as this bright green

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.720 
kind of coined as this bright green
slime<00:05:21.110> kind<00:05:21.650> of<00:05:21.710> idea<00:05:21.920> so<00:05:22.100> this<00:05:22.310> pokémons

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
slime kind of idea so this pokémons

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.610 
slime kind of idea so this pokémons
bright<00:05:22.940> green<00:05:23.210> it<00:05:23.420> might<00:05:23.930> be<00:05:24.080> an<00:05:24.170> ectoplasmic

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
bright green it might be an ectoplasmic

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.130 
bright green it might be an ectoplasmic
Pokemon<00:05:25.460> which<00:05:25.970> means<00:05:26.270> that<00:05:26.450> it<00:05:26.570> still<00:05:26.930> makes

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
Pokemon which means that it still makes

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.290 
Pokemon which means that it still makes
sense<00:05:27.440> to<00:05:27.620> be<00:05:27.710> a<00:05:27.740> pre<00:05:27.950> evolution<00:05:28.340> of<00:05:28.430> dust<00:05:29.060> goal

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
sense to be a pre evolution of dust goal

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.870 
sense to be a pre evolution of dust goal
it's<00:05:29.480> just<00:05:29.690> a<00:05:29.810> blob<00:05:30.200> of<00:05:30.230> green<00:05:30.920> mists<00:05:31.460> and<00:05:31.490> then

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
it's just a blob of green mists and then

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.000 
it's just a blob of green mists and then
it<00:05:32.030> it<00:05:32.450> becomes<00:05:32.900> Duskull<00:05:33.500> and<00:05:33.680> then<00:05:33.800> now<00:05:33.950> we

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
it it becomes Duskull and then now we

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.220 
it it becomes Duskull and then now we
have<00:05:34.190> a<00:05:34.220> 14<00:05:34.520> evolution<00:05:35.270> in<00:05:35.360> Pokemon<00:05:35.720> which

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.230 
have a 14 evolution in Pokemon which

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.200 
have a 14 evolution in Pokemon which
might<00:05:36.470> be<00:05:36.500> the<00:05:36.770> biggest<00:05:36.890> upset<00:05:37.430> possible<00:05:38.000> and

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
might be the biggest upset possible and

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.150 
might be the biggest upset possible and
it<00:05:38.510> could<00:05:38.750> be<00:05:38.960> a<00:05:38.990> really<00:05:39.380> great<00:05:39.590> thing<00:05:39.920> for<00:05:39.950> the

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
it could be a really great thing for the

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.180 
it could be a really great thing for the
series<00:05:40.490> now<00:05:41.240> the<00:05:41.300> only<00:05:41.750> other<00:05:42.110> crazy<00:05:42.680> thing<00:05:43.040> I

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
series now the only other crazy thing I

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.950 
series now the only other crazy thing I
can<00:05:43.370> think<00:05:43.400> about<00:05:43.640> this<00:05:43.880> being<00:05:44.120> is<00:05:44.360> that<00:05:44.390> maybe

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
can think about this being is that maybe

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.260 
can think about this being is that maybe
it's<00:05:45.620> kind<00:05:45.800> of<00:05:45.919> like<00:05:46.010> a<00:05:46.070> tour<00:05:46.340> tyro<00:05:46.880> kind<00:05:47.180> of

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
it's kind of like a tour tyro kind of

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.330 
it's kind of like a tour tyro kind of
deal<00:05:47.419> then<00:05:47.810> it<00:05:47.900> can<00:05:48.020> either<00:05:48.230> evolve<00:05:48.650> into<00:05:49.070> dust

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
deal then it can either evolve into dust

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.940 
deal then it can either evolve into dust
goal<00:05:49.640> or<00:05:49.880> maybe<00:05:50.570> it's<00:05:50.810> shove<00:05:51.140> it<00:05:51.320> that<00:05:51.770> there

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:51.950 
goal or maybe it's shove it that there

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.560 
goal or maybe it's shove it that there
are<00:05:52.100> a<00:05:52.160> lot<00:05:52.310> of<00:05:52.340> similarities<00:05:52.910> to<00:05:53.090> shop<00:05:53.330> it<00:05:53.480> as

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
are a lot of similarities to shop it as

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.670 
are a lot of similarities to shop it as
well<00:05:53.750> especially<00:05:53.990> a<00:05:54.260> lot<00:05:54.350> of<00:05:54.410> people<00:05:54.590> like

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
it's just a green shop it it's kind of

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.210 
it's just a green shop it it's kind of
the<00:05:56.720> idea<00:05:56.750> that<00:05:56.990> people<00:05:57.140> coming<00:05:57.500> up<00:05:57.620> with<00:05:57.770> so

the idea that people coming up with so
the<00:05:58.400> 1i<00:05:58.640> means<00:05:59.419> that<00:05:59.690> it<00:05:59.810> has<00:05:59.840> dusko

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
the 1i means that it has dusko

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.570 
the 1i means that it has dusko
capabilities<00:06:00.800> but<00:06:00.919> it's<00:06:01.100> two<00:06:01.220> eyes<00:06:01.370> that

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
capabilities but it's two eyes that

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.220 
capabilities but it's two eyes that
could<00:06:01.700> be<00:06:01.790> shove<00:06:02.030> it<00:06:02.210> it<00:06:02.480> looks<00:06:02.720> like<00:06:02.840> its<00:06:02.990> face

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.230 
could be shove it it looks like its face

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.380 
could be shove it it looks like its face
just<00:06:03.560> kind<00:06:03.740> of<00:06:03.830> blurs<00:06:04.460> and<00:06:04.490> changes<00:06:05.210> around

just kind of blurs and changes around

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.970 
just kind of blurs and changes around
however<00:06:05.660> from<00:06:06.050> these<00:06:06.200> other<00:06:06.410> drawings<00:06:06.830> that

however from these other drawings that
we<00:06:07.070> have<00:06:07.280> but<00:06:07.880> I'm<00:06:08.180> looking<00:06:08.870> at<00:06:08.990> this<00:06:09.080> maybe<00:06:09.440> if

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
we have but I'm looking at this maybe if

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.230 
we have but I'm looking at this maybe if
it<00:06:09.800> is<00:06:09.950> like<00:06:10.220> maybe<00:06:10.550> it<00:06:10.669> could<00:06:10.820> be<00:06:10.940> like<00:06:11.060> that

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
it is like maybe it could be like that

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.850 
it is like maybe it could be like that
it's<00:06:11.390> still<00:06:11.570> a<00:06:11.630> baby<00:06:11.870> Pokemon<00:06:12.350> but<00:06:12.740> as

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
it's still a baby Pokemon but as

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.250 
it's still a baby Pokemon but as
relation<00:06:13.310> to<00:06:13.460> both<00:06:13.580> Duskull<00:06:14.090> and<00:06:14.390> shop<00:06:14.720> it<00:06:14.870> now

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
relation to both Duskull and shop it now

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.840 
relation to both Duskull and shop it now
that<00:06:15.440> would<00:06:15.620> really<00:06:15.830> mess<00:06:16.040> up<00:06:16.250> with<00:06:16.430> beignet

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:16.850 
that would really mess up with beignet

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.400 
that would really mess up with beignet
being<00:06:17.090> just<00:06:17.330> a<00:06:17.390> possessed<00:06:17.690> doll<00:06:17.990> kind<00:06:18.290> of

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.410 
being just a possessed doll kind of

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.080 
being just a possessed doll kind of
theory<00:06:18.710> but<00:06:18.980> that's<00:06:19.130> that's<00:06:19.580> something<00:06:19.940> else

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
theory but that's that's something else

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.880 
theory but that's that's something else
so<00:06:20.300> maybe<00:06:20.540> this<00:06:21.110> could<00:06:21.290> have<00:06:21.470> something<00:06:21.620> to<00:06:21.800> do

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:21.890 
so maybe this could have something to do

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.430 
so maybe this could have something to do
with<00:06:21.980> that<00:06:22.010> but<00:06:22.280> overall<00:06:22.550> baby<00:06:23.270> Pokemon<00:06:23.810> could

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
with that but overall baby Pokemon could

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.290 
with that but overall baby Pokemon could
be<00:06:24.680> real<00:06:24.919> if<00:06:25.280> this<00:06:25.430> does<00:06:25.669> have<00:06:25.820> relation<00:06:26.180> to

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
be real if this does have relation to

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.120 
be real if this does have relation to
either<00:06:26.390> of<00:06:26.600> them<00:06:26.780> and<00:06:26.990> that's<00:06:27.440> my<00:06:27.590> story<00:06:27.830> I'm

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
either of them and that's my story I'm

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.670 
either of them and that's my story I'm
sticking<00:06:28.190> to<00:06:28.760> it<00:06:28.880> so<00:06:29.540> that's<00:06:29.870> my<00:06:30.080> speculation

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
sticking to it so that's my speculation

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.680 
sticking to it so that's my speculation
that's<00:06:30.830> my<00:06:30.950> news<00:06:31.100> I'm<00:06:31.430> going<00:06:32.150> beyond<00:06:32.419> on<00:06:32.570> this
