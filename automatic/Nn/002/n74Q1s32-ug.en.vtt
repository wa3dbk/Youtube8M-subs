experts<00:02:21.340> on<00:02:21.489> this<00:02:21.670> topic<00:02:21.909> I<00:02:22.150> think<00:02:22.720> again

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
experts on this topic I think again

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.210 
experts on this topic I think again
that's<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.170> mistake<00:02:23.319> people<00:02:23.620> make<00:02:23.769> some<00:02:24.129> of

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
that's a mistake people make some of

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.229 
that's a mistake people make some of
them<00:02:24.310> you<00:02:24.459> know<00:02:24.549> very<00:02:24.730> knowledgeable

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
them you know very knowledgeable

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.080 
them you know very knowledgeable
obviously<00:02:25.629> but<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.049> this<00:02:26.470> is<00:02:26.530> older<00:02:27.090> numbers

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
obviously but and this is older numbers

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.670 
obviously but and this is older numbers
I<00:02:28.120> think<00:02:28.659> things<00:02:28.840> are<00:02:28.900> probably<00:02:29.109> improve<00:02:29.560> but

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
I think things are probably improve but

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.020 
I think things are probably improve but
the<00:02:29.739> last<00:02:29.890> time<00:02:30.069> I<00:02:30.129> looked<00:02:30.459> into<00:02:30.609> this<00:02:30.819> which

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
the last time I looked into this which

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.860 
the last time I looked into this which
was<00:02:31.150> a<00:02:31.180> few<00:02:31.390> years<00:02:31.540> ago<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.280> 129<00:02:34.269> medical

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
was a few years ago of the 129 medical

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.589 
was a few years ago of the 129 medical
schools<00:02:35.170> less<00:02:35.590> than<00:02:35.769> a<00:02:35.950> dozen<00:02:36.370> required<00:02:37.090> one

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
schools less than a dozen required one

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.500 
schools less than a dozen required one
course<00:02:37.989> nutrition<00:02:38.879> okay<00:02:39.879> so<00:02:40.180> that<00:02:40.480> should

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
course nutrition okay so that should

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.809 
course nutrition okay so that should
tell<00:02:40.689> you<00:02:40.810> something<00:02:41.310> again<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.340> think<00:02:42.459> things

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
tell you something again I think things

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.180 
tell you something again I think things
have<00:02:42.909> improved<00:02:43.260> since<00:02:44.260> then<00:02:44.349> and<00:02:44.769> no<00:02:44.980> doubt

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
have improved since then and no doubt

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.869 
have improved since then and no doubt
again<00:02:45.940> if<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.889> medical<00:02:47.889> doctor<00:02:48.069> is<00:02:48.430> interested

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
again if a medical doctor is interested

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.520 
again if a medical doctor is interested
in<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.000> topic<00:02:49.180> they<00:02:49.599> will<00:02:49.750> often<00:02:50.049> take<00:02:50.230> their

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
in the topic they will often take their

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.390 
in the topic they will often take their
own<00:02:50.680> time<00:02:50.709> to<00:02:51.930> research<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.200> you<00:02:53.889> know<00:02:53.980> topic

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
give very valuable information but

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.289
