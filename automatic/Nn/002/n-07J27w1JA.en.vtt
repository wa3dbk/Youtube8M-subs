00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.299
 that is to make a little angel in eva rubber 

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:07.359
 although it can also be made in cardboard 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:09.429
 in the description you have the address of 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.990
 our blog where I have put the pattern or 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:13.059
 the mold so you can trim and 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.459
 make it good because we have cut it 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.870
 first a paper and once what 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.490
 we have it on paper because we 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.070
 we are going to do in rubber eva we pass it to 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.270
 rubber eva to do it in rubber eva 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.160
 only thing we have to do is every 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.490
 piece that we have already cut into paper or 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.310
 paperboard 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.500
 we put it on rubber eva and we 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.029
 we use a mechanical pencil of which we have 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.000
 put in the tip but you can 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.850
 use what you want we mark not us 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.680
 like with a marker or pen to mark up 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.019
 of the eva rubber because then when cutting it 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.269
 may be worth it then we mark and 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.250
 we cut and so we are cutting the 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:47.840
 different pieces in rubber eva some in 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.350
 white others in flesh color and others in 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.350
 yellow 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.900
 well then now when we already have all 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.370
 the pieces cut out what we're going to 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.230
 do is start with the ones that you have to 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.970
 paint to dry they're going to 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.430
 start with the wings that are both 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.570
 yellow hearts we are going to paint them 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.040
 we have painted them with a dye 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.860
 golden but you can have put them 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.900
 also white glue and glitter or 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.060
 even white tail and cotton that 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.980
 they are also very cool now 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.780
 we keep painting the head for that what 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.180
 first thing we do is use a pencil for 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.580
 if we were wrong to erase and mark 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.450
 over the rubber eva as we want it 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.450
 be the little face 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.399
 Well, more or less, we imagine ourselves as 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.720
 we want the face and now what we 're going 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.539
 to do is paint 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.009
 we started painting with acrylic paint 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.020
 the white eyes 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.200
 you can also paint with markers 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.000
 we paint the eyes or the white part 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.039
 of the eye and let it dry while 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.229
 dry what we can do is go putting 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.280
 in the hair we put the hair of nuditos 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.570
 that we have seen how it was done in the 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.750
 previous video you have it in the 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.520
 description of this video well let's 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.229
 sticking a hot glue the 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.360
 different nudity to our head 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.490
 we will also take advantage to put 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.319
 glitter to our star for that 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.780
 we put white glue and on top we put 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:06.080
 glitter and we let you know we're going to 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.690
 also stick the hands to the sleeves 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.430
 we stick them 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.590
 on the back so on the part of 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.390
 forward, you see how it is, we do what 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.370
 same with the other sleeve and the other hand 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.720
 you could have done too little fingers 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.900
 but we do not like it 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.600
 complicate us excessively once 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.370
 the white acrylic paint dries 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.810
 what we do is with a marker 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.330
 we could have used acrylic paint 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.800
 Hey 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:36.980
 we painted the part of the pupil 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.530
 and we have also painted the black of the eye 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.330
 and the mouth now we make the cone what 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.830
 is the tunic that we stick by the part of 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.380
 behind 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.200
 and cut to be stable to the 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.210
 put it flat you have to be careful and 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.920
 leave a little higher part of 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.470
 ahead because we're going to stick there the 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.060
 feet 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.290
 but we also go to the wings at 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.290
 that we have put glitter 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.370
 we stick the wings in the position that 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.680
 we like it and now we stick the arms that 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.099
 we already had our hands on 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.099
 sides 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.409
 one on each side 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.760
 we just have to hit his feet and 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.860
 put a crown 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.989
 so let's put the feet putting a little 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.560
 of hot glue like half of the 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.689
 foot and we had it inside 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.239
 so that it is like the feet a bit 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:33.239
 barefoot and now we stick the other side 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.860
 well the crown we could have put 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.140
 a wire in gold and it was already 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.270
 well we have picked up some cotton what 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.280
 we have stopped and we put it around 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.050
 of the head because it is already sticking the 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.450
 star and that's how our 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.680
 angel you can put it on the tree or 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.680
 give it away I hope you like it
