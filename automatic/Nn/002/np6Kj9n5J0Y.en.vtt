00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.910 
and five dollars an ounce and so I'm
actually<00:04:05.690> I<00:04:05.959> only<00:04:06.230> got<00:04:06.410> some<00:04:06.739> of<00:04:06.829> the

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
actually I only got some of the

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.130 
actually I only got some of the
ingredients<00:04:07.489> and<00:04:07.870> some<00:04:08.870> more<00:04:08.989> the

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.759 
buy next month so I guess that's how you
know<00:04:13.760> you're<00:04:13.910> on<00:04:14.000> a<00:04:14.060> budget<00:04:14.209> when<00:04:14.900> a<00:04:15.109> Pinterest

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
know you're on a budget when a Pinterest

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.810 
know you're on a budget when a Pinterest
meal<00:04:16.220> takes<00:04:16.850> to<00:04:17.840> two<00:04:18.769> months<00:04:19.039> to<00:04:19.250> assemble

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
meal takes to two months to assemble

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.150 
meal takes to two months to assemble
Pinterest<00:04:20.660> project<00:04:21.019> and<00:04:21.169> then<00:04:21.739> when<00:04:21.950> I<00:04:21.979> went

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
Pinterest project and then when I went

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.159 
Pinterest project and then when I went
to<00:04:22.280> the<00:04:22.430> store<00:04:22.700> I<00:04:23.030> went<00:04:23.389> to<00:04:23.479> Dollar<00:04:23.690> Tree<00:04:23.780> first

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
to the store I went to Dollar Tree first

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.290 
to the store I went to Dollar Tree first
because<00:04:24.830> I<00:04:25.310> always<00:04:25.760> want<00:04:25.940> to<00:04:25.970> get<00:04:26.060> things

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
because I always want to get things

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.300 
because I always want to get things
there<00:04:26.630> like<00:04:27.380> I<00:04:27.440> was<00:04:27.560> hoping<00:04:27.800> they'd<00:04:27.950> have<00:04:28.130> some

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
there like I was hoping they'd have some

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.750

of<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.460> spice

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
of the spice

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.310
