00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
turtle icons going to flash and it's

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.760 
turtle icons going to flash and it's
going<00:05:06.800> to<00:05:06.860> go<00:05:06.980> away<00:05:07.900> won't<00:05:08.900> go<00:05:09.080> away<00:05:09.200> all<00:05:09.620> right

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
oh and we try not to destroy everything

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.330 
oh and we try not to destroy everything
a<00:05:14.860> slight<00:05:15.860> touches<00:05:16.490> all<00:05:16.670> it<00:05:16.820> takes<00:05:17.620> Wow<00:05:18.620> okay

hey<00:05:20.180> I<00:05:20.210> said<00:05:20.510> I<00:05:20.780> wanted<00:05:20.990> to<00:05:21.230> go<00:05:21.350> faster<00:05:21.860> we're

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
hey I said I wanted to go faster we're

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.090 
hey I said I wanted to go faster we're
in<00:05:22.130> fast<00:05:22.370> mode<00:05:23.620> we<00:05:24.620> now<00:05:24.770> have<00:05:24.980> the<00:05:25.070> capability

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
in fast mode we now have the capability

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.630 
in fast mode we now have the capability
to<00:05:25.730> go<00:05:25.970> 12<00:05:26.330> miles<00:05:26.660> per<00:05:27.080> hour<00:05:27.320> and<00:05:27.800> the<00:05:27.830> change

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
to go 12 miles per hour and the change

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.270 
to go 12 miles per hour and the change
in<00:05:28.820> speed<00:05:29.120> was<00:05:29.480> definitely<00:05:30.080> obvious<00:05:30.530> but<00:05:31.160> the

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
in speed was definitely obvious but the

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.970 
in speed was definitely obvious but the
operating<00:05:31.790> principles<00:05:32.330> were<00:05:32.630> the<00:05:32.900> same<00:05:33.140> to

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
operating principles were the same to

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.920 
operating principles were the same to
set<00:05:34.250> the<00:05:34.370> Segway<00:05:34.730> in<00:05:34.910> motion<00:05:35.390> you<00:05:35.660> lean

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
set the Segway in motion you lean

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.230 
set the Segway in motion you lean
forward<00:05:36.170> and<00:05:36.770> the<00:05:37.100> force<00:05:37.340> of<00:05:37.520> your<00:05:37.580> lean<00:05:37.910> will

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
forward and the force of your lean will

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.180 
forward and the force of your lean will
control<00:05:38.630> your<00:05:38.840> speed<00:05:39.080> it's<00:05:39.830> the<00:05:40.010> same

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
control your speed it's the same

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.520 
control your speed it's the same
principle<00:05:40.670> for<00:05:40.850> going<00:05:41.150> in<00:05:41.270> Reverse<00:05:41.600> leaning

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
principle for going in Reverse leaning

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.590 
principle for going in Reverse leaning
backwards<00:05:43.070> will<00:05:43.400> put<00:05:43.730> you<00:05:43.850> in<00:05:44.060> a<00:05:44.150> backwards

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
backwards will put you in a backwards

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.520 
backwards will put you in a backwards
motion<00:05:46.000> even<00:05:47.000> with<00:05:47.180> our<00:05:47.210> faster<00:05:47.810> speed<00:05:48.200> we

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
motion even with our faster speed we

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.470 
motion even with our faster speed we
still<00:05:48.860> took<00:05:49.100> in<00:05:49.310> the<00:05:49.340> sights<00:05:49.490> of<00:05:49.850> the<00:05:49.910> city<00:05:50.030> I

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
still took in the sights of the city I

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.780 
still took in the sights of the city I
want<00:05:51.470> you<00:05:51.530> to<00:05:51.620> notice<00:05:51.770> when<00:05:51.920> we<00:05:52.040> pass<00:05:52.220> by<00:05:52.250> stuff

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
want you to notice when we pass by stuff

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.010 
want you to notice when we pass by stuff
look<00:05:52.970> at<00:05:53.060> the<00:05:53.180> architecture<00:05:53.480> when<00:05:53.900> we're

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
look at the architecture when we're

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.720 
look at the architecture when we're
driving<00:05:54.170> down<00:05:54.380> the<00:05:54.650> streets<00:05:55.010> you<00:05:55.550> don't

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:55.730 
driving down the streets you don't

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.690 
driving down the streets you don't
really<00:05:55.820> get<00:05:55.970> to<00:05:56.030> pay<00:05:56.210> attention<00:05:56.300> to<00:05:56.780> it<00:05:56.900> I<00:05:57.700> even

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:58.700 
really get to pay attention to it I even

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.340 
really get to pay attention to it I even
slowed<00:05:59.060> down<00:05:59.270> for<00:05:59.660> the<00:05:59.750> sites<00:06:00.080> in<00:06:00.230> the

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
slowed down for the sites in the

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.460 
slowed down for the sites in the
storefronts<00:06:01.010> I<00:06:01.190> think<00:06:01.760> it's<00:06:01.880> cute<00:06:02.180> low<00:06:03.110> window

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
storefronts I think it's cute low window

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.990 
storefronts I think it's cute low window
shop<00:06:03.880> after<00:06:04.880> three<00:06:05.180> hours<00:06:05.210> our<00:06:05.810> tour<00:06:06.200> was<00:06:06.530> over

agree<00:06:10.700> there's<00:06:11.630> just<00:06:11.960> something<00:06:12.500> about

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
agree there's just something about

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:26.629 
agree there's just something about
riding<00:06:13.190> around<00:06:13.550> the<00:06:13.760> city<00:06:13.790> on<00:06:14.390> a<00:06:14.450> Segway

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:31.270 

you<00:06:26.999> can<00:06:27.240> turn<00:06:27.479> the<00:06:27.900> world<00:06:28.110> on<00:06:28.530> with<00:06:29.039> her

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
you can turn the world on with her

00:06:31.280 --> 00:07:05.890 
you can turn the world on with her
Oh

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:05.900
