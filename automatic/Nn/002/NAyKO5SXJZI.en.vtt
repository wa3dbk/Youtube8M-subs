00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.280
 is special 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.420
 birthday 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.870
 is today 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.370
 that we feel like 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.370
 we begin with the without merit 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.559
 we will need as 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.930
 two sachets of cookies or about five 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.760
 blades 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.079
 of unflavored gelatine 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.470
 we are also going to need 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.700
 you are welcome 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.760
 about 50 grams of butter 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.570
 sugar if you can have it 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.150
 showers 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.200
 tÃ©lam 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.930
 and we enter 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.590
 and two cheese chains here I have a 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.590
 but what do you know? 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.880
 200 grams with that we have enough 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.790
 for do 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.480
 we will start by opening the cookie 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.530
 and removing the cream 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.450
 this cream we will set it apart 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.190
 well we will do with package and a half of the 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.020
 full 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.720
 once we have removed the creampie 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.159
 of the cookies we are going to make them in 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.829
 smaller pieces 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.229
 because what we want is to make a powder 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.159
 to do the base then also 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.390
 we have here 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.390
 shred we will have 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.440
 if we see that there is much grace 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.750
 Well, very easy, we keep putting a 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.460
 little more butter until 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.460
 let's have the consistency 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.220
 I have already put in a bowl 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.090
 There are 400 accords that are two boxes 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.710
 type philadelphia or mascarpone too 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.380
 could be 202 that day in 400 gr 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.880
 now we are going to add the creampie 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.880
 of cream that had the cookies 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.120
 well then we have the creampie we're going 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.900
 to go to the cold while we do the 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.090
 following 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.310
 the next very simple step we are going to 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.970
 take three tablespoons of cream 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.970
 only 3 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:51.490
 we will warm this goal and here 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.490
 dark circles back gelatin 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.680
 the next step will be to assemble the cream 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.430
 we have chopped the rest of the cookies 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.829
 oreo we had left and this will be for 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.150
 the padding of the table and now we're going to 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:24.640
 put all the ingredients in one 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.280
 and we go to systems the next we're going to 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.110
 put here we have the cream and here 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.500
 we have the creampie we had made 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.390
 before with cheese and with sugar what 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.090
 let's go putting like peppers 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.020
 envelopes 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.020
 so that we are not going to stay 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.840
 here comes a piece of cake 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.300
 incredible but that the goal of that post 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.910
 it's small we 'll give you one more 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.680
 tiny 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.890
 Well, we have to mix everything 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.890
 all right 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.470
 as I told you 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.720
 to put 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.390
 the pieces of biscuit oreo minced 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:22.520
 the half pack we had left that what 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.520
 we have chopped to put pepper 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.300
 let's go putting ourselves 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.139
 and with enveloping movements 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.139
 we will integrate everything 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.750
 and a very important thing gelatin 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.880
 Do not get cold 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.590
 to be aware of her is also 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.770
 It recommended that instead of the 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.690
 step second you do in the last step 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.150
 because I have rushed a bit but 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.249
 I had to be free so that I do not know 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.150
 me 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:58.860
 it solidifies 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.900
 well, this 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.940
 to incorporate everything 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.669
 and once we have put the whole cookie 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.900
 incorporated here well mobile and is all 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:08.900
 then we will put the gelatin 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.910
 we already have here 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.590
 the vessel that as I said to you I think 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.169
 that I have fallen short is a little 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:22.590
 small but good 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:22.590
 we are going to put it little by little 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:30.090
 You see how I said good, well, that's how it is 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.490
 enough 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.320
 we will have this in the first one as 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.930
 3 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.870
 Once we have it cold, unmold it 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:42.169
 we will talk to others free of charge 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.630
 Oreo cookie 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:46.260
 well only that we are doing well 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.260
 a little kiss
