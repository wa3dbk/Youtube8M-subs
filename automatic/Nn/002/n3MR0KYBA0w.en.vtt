00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.049
 Hi everyone and welcome to 01net tv 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.970
 welcome to paris at the book fair 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.380
 it's very important living room to live a 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.230
 Thursday in Cannes and of course big 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.970
 make an appointment and it smells 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.590
 the ibook jÃ©rÃ´me without the ibook d'en 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.660
 enjoy to make a point just 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.400
 on the news announced in terms of 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.400
 of ibuki if he has not told the goat stinks 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.610
 for now I feel that old 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:39.149
 lille let me scented to look looks 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.070
 on the left 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.320
 it smells of ibook and that's it 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.790
 we are on the pocket book stand 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.699
 oh yes it looks good it looks good 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.460
 and interesting news at pocket 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.079
 book with the cua the coi that carries well 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.970
 his big what 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.260
 and yes since it is the first reader 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.510
 in any case that's what we are told here 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.159
 the first reading light is at stake 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.350
 incredible we are not thinking about 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.450
 bruay yet obviously it takes everything 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.100
 its meaning since you take away her at the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.050
 beach at the edge of the pool etc 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.149
 it can fall into the water a reading light 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.399
 so it's not just a rumor 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.440
 franÃ§ois actually looks 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.789
 demonstration to the rain she resists 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.220
 in the water it resists water 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:21.179
 resists the hostel always the ip57 that 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.520
 means you can energy 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:25.590
 up to one meter of water for one hour 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.409
 it resists microparticles so 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.869
 you can 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.240
 the sand ferrari you can throw a 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.890
 bucket terrab on it has no worries 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.649
 and so it's a very, very good idea 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.210
 and here it comes out these days these are 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.240
 for the rest is a classic reading light 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.530
 we will say so hiroshi with the wifi a 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.630
 dollar and so it allows you to 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.340
 download the books directly 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.560
 association with a system that 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.270
 is called tea t2a which allows you so 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.530
 to buy all the books you 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.750
 want there are more than 140 thousand titles 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.409
 that are available and it costs a 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.509
 hundred euros 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:00.250
 this is another interesting novelty 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.020
 discovery here at the book fair 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.520
 look at this is a smartphone 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.590
 obviously in addition to that there you the 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.509
 know these galaxy s 4g the galaxy 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.929
 s 4 but as you can see and 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.430
 well this little one folds here is a 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.310
 screen a reading lights screen 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.739
 so how does it work bah you in 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.810
 drag the phone into this 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.120
 little protective heir leaves 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.579
 also you said an electronic screen 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.079
 with electronic ink and you 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.390
 go download an application that will 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.760
 allow you to display on the screen 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.380
 electronic content that you will have 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.209
 downloaded on this application here 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.880
 their typically a book in epub format 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.329
 for example but also a pdf a 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.359
 E-mail 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:43.120
 in fact a very large number of contents 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:45.099
 writings no video obviously no 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.290
 photos either and why 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.579
 serves and well the French interest come and 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.030
 it's about saving the battery while 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.819
 simply 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.500
 while you are watching on the screen 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.090
 electronic in any case of the inked 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.500
 electronic you do not use 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.630
 the screen of galaxy s 4 goes out 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.790
 automatically so you keep yourself 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.440
 gain in autonomy quite skilled and that 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.480
 reminds us of another smartphone that 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.040
 does it in a native way that 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.780
 is called the yacht aphone we have it 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.510
 already shown on 01net tv 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.209
 iphone yacht with apple iphone and 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.859
 screen came from the other so that's 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.209
 not perfect because for example this 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.950
 is not compatible with all 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.209
 apps it's true we could very 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.359
 well for example download an app 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.049
 news like 01net.com and look at all 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.090
 the articles 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.769
 through nanoro ink 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.629
 electronic it does not work it takes 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.099
 that the application is developed for 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.239
 this screen it's a shame 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.190
 and it does not work for now 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.470
 than with the galaxy s May 4 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.910
 we are told here that it is under study 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.340
 for other models of phones and 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:46.930
 especially the iphone and the price yes 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:48.970
 about 80 euros and will increase 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.410
 now one of the most 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.210
 big of this living room it's 8 inches 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.410
 and his labs that we are on the 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.780
 booking stand and it's there bookeen 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.580
 oceans and elect push these great for 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.620
 a reader because looking at what is 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.850
 usual and well it's this little 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.930
 format that is convenient because we can 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.000
 put it in the coat pocket 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.410
 but it's more complicated that's true 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 it's a bit more complicated despite 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.980
 everything is still on with a 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.750
 very very compact and very fine product 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.170
 that a delicious and finer of the 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.270
 world 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.700
 in fact one has the finesse of almost a 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.739
 touch pad here is the meadow is to 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.609
 pretty much 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.319
 7 mm so here so wifi with a 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.330
 frontline system that is to say that 

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:26.069
 you will be able to watch very very 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.389
 easily and read very easily without 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:29.699
 disturb your companion when 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.990
 when he sleeps when he gets ready to 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.940
 to sleep advantage of the inked 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.229
 electronics and then autonomy etc. 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.840
 so we know about reading lights 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.860
 why a large reading light and 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.590
 well because apparently there was a 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.840
 need from readers who 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.069
 want more space for maybe not 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.270
 look at the pictures because good bah 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.310
 the pictures is still in mono greece 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.050
 it's good even if it's possible 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.580
 display mojitos but 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.720
 especially for a bigger a better 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.400
 reading comfort and then maybe 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.169
 other types of books even while 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.949
 done and then especially interest is 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.050
 we are getting closer 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:01.500
 if you want beyond the dimension of a 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.630
 real book so we have pretty much the page 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.190
 of a real freedom that we leaf through here from 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.680
 electronically and it can be 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.380
 nice and it's like we say french 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.090
 good it will cost around 180 euros and 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.740
 it's coming out in two months and that's it 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.240
 for these few novelties in 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.560
 e-readers then the 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.490
 reading lights that goes that remains a market 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.229
 rather dynamic 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.300
 yes dynamic why because there is 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:23.880
 more and more choices you have to know 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.409
 than about the 100 novelties that are 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.650
 currently available in bookstores 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:31.440
 well 90 pretty much are downloadable 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.789
 on electronics named then and then a 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.680
 e-book not a reader that 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:38.250
 can also be used for other things to 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.759
 read documents from pdf documents 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.590
 course work that I know it's 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:44.880
 open enough and especially it's 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.289
 magical with this autonomy of a 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.090
 week for each reader but here 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:49.020
 same flea sometimes a week a it's 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.400
 it is good with the inked 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.949
 chronicles so what can we regret 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.590
 it is nevertheless the slowness of the 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:58.409
 change in publishing and books 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.110
 you have to know that here we are going to pay 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:02.669
 maybe between 15 to 30% cheaper one 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.690
 e-book compared to his 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.340
 paper version which is still a 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.539
 little scandalous when we know that there are 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.759
 no paper there is no printing 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:10.319
 no transportation and it is even 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:11.940
 cheaper yes but we should have 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:14.310
 even cheaper and then after when a 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.380
 book goes into pocket sometimes it's 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.759
 more expensive in electronic version than in 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.210
 paper version which klaus him a 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:19.289
 problem 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.520
 and then you know there are always some 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:23.620
 drm that prevents 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.660
 on ebooks it's this 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.400
 who existed before on the music on 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.379
 my bench happily it's gone 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.449
 not to hack more easily 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:33.099
 but to be able to transfer and 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:34.569
 pass documents for example within 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:37.000
 a good family even easier 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:38.530
 Jerome happened it's promised I 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.960
 I'm going to offer you the whole universe version 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.979
 away version that will remind me of 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.750
 chronic it will be nice 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:47.039
 and then we find ourselves very quickly on 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.039
 01net seniors hi to all
