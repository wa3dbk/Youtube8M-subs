like<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:35.040> there's<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.460> bit<00:00:35.640> confusing

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
like this there's a bit confusing

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.810 
like this there's a bit confusing
because<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.450> saw<00:00:36.750> yeah<00:00:37.680> scrunch<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.520> up<00:00:38.579> but

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
because I saw yeah scrunch it up but

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.580 
because I saw yeah scrunch it up but
it's<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.540> craft<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.140> got<00:00:40.200> anything

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
it's a craft it you so you got anything

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.139 
it's a craft it you so you got anything
at<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> bottom<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.370> got<00:00:41.489> coal<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.910> middle

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.299 
at the bottom it got coal in the middle
and<00:00:42.329> then<00:00:42.510> create<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> top<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.739> then<00:00:43.860> want<00:00:44.070> to

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
and then create a top and then want to

and then create a top and then want to
the<00:00:44.430> left<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:44.940> will<00:00:45.059> give<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.360> one

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
the left and that will give you one

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.869 
the left and that will give you one
engine<00:00:46.079> now<00:00:46.649> let<00:00:46.890> something<00:00:47.129> scrap<00:00:47.579> yourself

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
engine now let something scrap yourself

there so it's doing something then to
below<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.750> then<00:01:06.960> you'll<00:01:07.080> get<00:01:07.229> yourself

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
below that and then you'll get yourself

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.859 
below that and then you'll get yourself
dear<00:01:07.860> back<00:01:08.010> for<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.270> there's<00:01:09.750> only

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
which is only the change in different

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.230 
which is only the change in different
things<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.860> thought<00:01:56.070> my<00:01:56.250> idea<00:01:56.490> use<00:01:56.670> yellow<00:01:56.939> dye

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
things I thought my idea use yellow dye

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.600 
things I thought my idea use yellow dye
but<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.229> called<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.530> gold<00:01:58.920> debate<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.549> I

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
but it's called the gold debate so I

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.040 
but it's called the gold debate so I
guess<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.689> we've

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
guess so we've

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.560 
guess so we've
we<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:01.830> don't<00:02:02.040> change<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.640> alien<00:02:03.000> with<00:02:03.300> gold

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
we just don't change the alien with gold

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.630 
we just don't change the alien with gold
and<00:02:03.810> then<00:02:03.990> just<00:02:04.260> leave<00:02:04.470> that<00:02:04.710> way<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.340> put<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
and then just leave that way you put the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.130 
and then just leave that way you put the
dad<00:02:05.820> just<00:02:05.850> blank<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.660> then<00:02:06.720> you'll<00:02:06.900> get<00:02:07.020> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140
