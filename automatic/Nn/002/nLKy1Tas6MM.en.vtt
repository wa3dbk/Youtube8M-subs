there are times when I thought this one

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.840 
there are times when I thought this one
is<00:03:38.260> definitely<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:39.010> prince<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:39.609> then<00:03:39.760> the

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
is definitely the prince and then the

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.789 
is definitely the prince and then the
other<00:03:40.000> times<00:03:40.239> I'd<00:03:40.420> be<00:03:40.540> like<00:03:40.720> wait<00:03:41.319> those

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
characteristics and that in that

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.559 
characteristics and that in that
narrative<00:03:44.019> sort<00:03:44.680> of<00:03:44.829> fit<00:03:45.130> with<00:03:45.489> the<00:03:45.880> assassin

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
narrative sort of fit with the assassin

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.990 
narrative sort of fit with the assassin
so<00:03:47.109> this<00:03:47.590> is<00:03:47.799> this<00:03:48.160> guy's<00:03:48.400> Academy<00:03:48.880> the

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.090 
one I'll have to wait until next year
and<00:05:55.450> what<00:05:55.870> made<00:05:56.020> it<00:05:56.050> really<00:05:56.170> really<00:05:56.500> enjoyable

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
and what made it really really enjoyable

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.150 
and what made it really really enjoyable
for<00:05:57.220> me<00:05:57.400> was<00:05:58.090> the<00:05:58.600> point<00:05:59.590> of<00:05:59.740> views<00:05:59.890> of

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
for me was the point of views of

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.780 
for me was the point of views of
different<00:06:00.400> chapters<00:06:01.090> while<00:06:01.830> lies<00:06:02.830> is<00:06:03.430> very

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
different chapters while lies is very

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.780 
different chapters while lies is very
obvious<00:06:04.510> like<00:06:05.020> yeah<00:06:05.530> some<00:06:06.100> chapters<00:06:06.340> would<00:06:06.670> be

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
obvious like yeah some chapters would be

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.400 
obvious like yeah some chapters would be
titled<00:06:07.090> the<00:06:07.210> prince<00:06:07.510> some<00:06:07.750> would<00:06:07.900> be<00:06:07.990> titled

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
titled the prince some would be titled

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.530 
titled the prince some would be titled
lay<00:06:08.830> assassin<00:06:09.370> and<00:06:09.580> some<00:06:10.090> of<00:06:10.210> them<00:06:10.300> would<00:06:10.420> be

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:10.540 
lay assassin and some of them would be

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.490 
lay assassin and some of them would be
titled<00:06:10.780> Caden<00:06:11.290> or<00:06:11.500> Raffy<00:06:11.950> and<00:06:12.130> that<00:06:13.320> was<00:06:14.320> so

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
titled Caden or Raffy and that was so

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.470 
titled Caden or Raffy and that was so
stressful<00:06:14.830> in<00:06:15.280> a<00:06:15.370> good<00:06:15.550> way<00:06:15.700> in<00:06:15.940> a<00:06:16.000> very<00:06:16.030> good

stressful in a good way in a very good

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.970 
stressful in a good way in a very good
way<00:06:16.660> because<00:06:16.840> you're<00:06:17.140> just<00:06:17.320> trying<00:06:17.620> to<00:06:17.710> figure

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
out who is who and that is probably 80%

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.090

why<00:06:21.940> I<00:06:21.970> love<00:06:22.330> this<00:06:22.510> book<00:06:22.570> because<00:06:22.920> it<00:06:23.920> was<00:06:24.070> a

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:24.100 
why I love this book because it was a

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.130 
why I love this book because it was a
guessing<00:06:24.580> game<00:06:24.610> and<00:06:25.000> I<00:06:25.360> liked<00:06:25.600> going<00:06:25.930> into

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.140 
guessing game and I liked going into

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.230 
guessing game and I liked going into
this<00:06:26.260> book<00:06:26.470> not<00:06:27.070> knowing<00:06:27.490> the<00:06:27.640> outcome<00:06:27.670> and

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
this book not knowing the outcome and

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.359 
this book not knowing the outcome and
all<00:06:28.360> can<00:06:28.600> kind<00:06:28.840> of<00:06:28.900> be<00:06:29.020> seen<00:06:29.200> as<00:06:29.350> a<00:06:29.380> love<00:06:29.620> try

all can kind of be seen as a love try

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:33.809 
all can kind of be seen as a love try
but<00:06:30.699> because<00:06:31.119> we<00:06:31.389> don't<00:06:31.689> know<00:06:31.900> which<00:06:32.819> which

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:33.819 
but because we don't know which which

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 
triangle very interesting and not very

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:43.469 
triangle very interesting and not very
of<00:06:40.809> the<00:06:41.169> norm<00:06:41.439> and<00:06:41.800> I<00:06:42.279> can<00:06:42.550> honestly<00:06:42.819> say<00:06:43.449> I

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:43.479

like both Rafi and Kayden equally after

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:50.309 
like both Rafi and Kayden equally after
reading<00:06:47.800> this<00:06:48.180> it's<00:06:49.180> gonna<00:06:49.300> be<00:06:49.449> very<00:06:49.809> hard<00:06:50.110> for

reading this it's gonna be very hard for

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:52.109

I really like both of them I scare ik
ters<00:06:56.409> and<00:06:56.649> I<00:06:56.710> think<00:06:57.009> I<00:06:57.129> wouldn't<00:06:57.399> have<00:06:57.550> liked

00:06:57.779 --> 00:06:57.789 
ters and I think I wouldn't have liked

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:00.269 
ters and I think I wouldn't have liked
that<00:06:57.939> as<00:06:58.149> much<00:06:58.389> if<00:06:58.930> I<00:06:59.080> would<00:06:59.229> have<00:06:59.349> known<00:06:59.559> which

00:07:00.269 --> 00:07:00.279 
that as much if I would have known which

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:03.389 
that as much if I would have known which
title<00:07:00.819> each<00:07:01.509> guy<00:07:01.869> held<00:07:02.289> going<00:07:02.919> into<00:07:03.129> the<00:07:03.219> book

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:03.399 
title each guy held going into the book

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:06.029 
title each guy held going into the book
so<00:07:03.729> it<00:07:04.270> was<00:07:04.360> very<00:07:04.509> refreshing<00:07:05.020> learning<00:07:05.830> about

them<00:07:06.279> that<00:07:06.490> way<00:07:06.729> then<00:07:07.419> knowing<00:07:08.349> what<00:07:08.499> their

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:08.649
