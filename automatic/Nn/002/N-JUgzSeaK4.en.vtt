 is 50 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:12.270
 amplifiers 60 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:20.670
 if I take a 68 way I can 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:26.070
 buy in a business 813 dollars a 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:29.660
 Germanic country and a complex neighborhood 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.660
 now and without buts 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.369
 two 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.920
 obsolete technology and it is not achieved in 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.920
 the electronics house 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.019
 switches for plates 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.890
 and the dvd then these come by 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.890
 so much 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.620
 as slippers 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.010
 and all the things happen and they make 20 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.480
 dollars per month 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.480
 then it is not an industry 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.960
 This is a piece of craft 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.420
 almost like making a mate without waiting 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.220
 this compares his right foot do with 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.049
 the behavior imported by the left 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.250
 soldier with a click in the kitchen of the 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.250

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.440
 in million leaders 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.750
 the experience 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:10.880
 European that the types correct because 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:13.890
 the sides in part then those that 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.860
 after separate lives they leave it 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.080
 ride the eternal mountain range return to 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.430
 every year and the best then of 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.490
 suddenly we're going to hear this compared

 in this case 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.860
 Well now let's compare then 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.430
 let's tell what is national with 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.010
 the national with the two imported things 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.360
 what abysmal and incredible differences 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.970
 tonal we listen 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.620
 first lcd 1 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.610
 that one 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.610
 ah 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.560
 ok and ok subscribe 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.239
 an audio mantis 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.009
 why 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.250
 the first one to listen to the

 good music tell me present the 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.560
 agreement of own shares 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.560
 say what it looks like 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.360
 yes 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:00.940
 after a center the center of your

 dollars you have to wait for one and what 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.680
 do it alfonso hermida

 factory 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:21.860
 ndrive is the best 

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:24.499
 the audio hue is a replica of the 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.989
 centennial we made a comparison between 

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:30.189
 on Tuesday and the central blindly and in 

00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:30.189
 equations define one from the other 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.650
 but comparing the nuance to what is a 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.650
 central 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:46.950
 that is not 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:49.170
 or there is no difference between those who do not 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:52.110
 they are within the same family 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:55.230
 if there is a minimum variation instead of 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:58.070
 be yellow duckling is yellow taxi 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.070
 but it's yellow 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:06.529
 since we are ruined from the 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:10.999
 head because we believe companies 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:16.309
 we believe the companies to win the 

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:16.309
 same pedal with the happy blue says he

 cigars ivÃ¡n chaves 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.860
 and in the same crap 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.080
 he has a friend who is an engineer because 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:31.310
 Everything is made knowing how to win 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:35.539
 that encourages the type the level beast 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:39.560
 brain engineering and we investigate the 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:43.639
 plans of his crimes and of debuting in 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:49.120
 all sides and they are almost identical they change 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:49.120
 a couple of values and that's
