00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
when it comes to networking it's just I

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.590

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
kind of can see the organic fit between

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.499 
kind of can see the organic fit between
you<00:01:13.350> know<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> brand<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.100> artists<00:01:14.580> just

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.980 
between like-minded people you know what
I'm<00:01:17.490> saying<00:01:17.700> there's<00:01:18.119> an<00:01:18.240> intersection<00:01:18.479> of

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
I'm saying there's an intersection of

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.790 
I'm saying there's an intersection of
you<00:01:19.590> read<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.979> commonality

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
you read of commonality

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.610 
you read of commonality
then<00:01:21.920> you<00:01:22.420> exploit<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:23.990> know<00:01:24.080> I<00:01:24.110> like<00:01:24.410> to

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
then you exploit you know I like to

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.580 
then you exploit you know I like to
enhance<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:26.270> presentation<00:01:27.050> of<00:01:27.170> everything

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
enhance the presentation of everything

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.090 
enhance the presentation of everything
if<00:01:28.100> I<00:01:28.280> take<00:01:28.490> something<00:01:28.670> that<00:01:28.790> looks<00:01:29.060> good<00:01:29.330> and

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
if I take something that looks good and

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.020 
if I take something that looks good and
bring<00:01:31.100> something<00:01:31.910> musically<00:01:32.720> to<00:01:33.020> it<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:33.320> I

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
bring something musically to it and I

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.250 
bring something musically to it and I
think<00:01:35.030> what's<00:01:35.240> cool<00:01:35.390> about<00:01:35.450> what<00:01:35.750> you<00:01:35.900> do<00:01:36.080> is

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
think what's cool about what you do is

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.140 
think what's cool about what you do is

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
and all the diamond does in general is

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.210 
and all the diamond does in general is
it's<00:01:38.960> not<00:01:39.140> just<00:01:40.030> free<00:01:41.030> closed<00:01:41.330> to<00:01:41.690> rappers
