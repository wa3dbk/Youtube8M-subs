00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:56.289
 the months pass 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.299
 and decide to go to the maritain town 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.799

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.849
 hi hahaha 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.519
 but what happened it happened that you were wrong to communicate the 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.189
 camera the temperature that to the light on the ducks the settings of the 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.310
 white that you find on the cameras are usually these 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.870

 be acknowledged comedian 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:47.299
 a special night-time setting here we find ourselves struggling with a beast 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.760
 invincible indeed as I said the last lesson 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.579
 when I can't do it, I suffer from the size of the city 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.690
 the wine and the amount of light that reaches it then 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.799
 when there is no light 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.569
 your fringe movie 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.720
 hopelessly to even be 4 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.489
 tubes because the camera digitally increases the brightness 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.469
 but the few data that have arrived are therefore not enough digital manipulation 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:15.119
 albacete 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:18.429
 for this reason I thought to show you how to eat without 

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:21.669
 own a professional lamp 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:22.739
 I need 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.449
 a morning 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:26.609
 with a white enamelled interior 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.559
 but you want to put up with 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:31.729
 a lamp holder it 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:34.529
 an electrical outlet is a light bulb 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:38.059
 now spread plenty of vinyl glue hey hey 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:41.399
 no sorry I have the wrong TV program but 

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:44.299
 let alone dangerous things 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.900
 instead we take a simple lamp 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.520
 which can be found at home 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.230
 and see how it can be used but first let's look at something else 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.940
 we look at my face as it approaches the camera as I do 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.920
 I get closer my vote always remains enlightened 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:03.459
 small kitchen if at home 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.119
 this is the same shot without additional bulbs I have also positioned 

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:09.179
 calcolatrica 

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:12.179
 here it is our criminal 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:14.450
 little 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.049
 20 watts only 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.109
 it's very convenient we go back to our house lamp now I have entered one 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.150
 energy saving light bulb and lighting on my face and though 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.710
 the lamp is very close 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.060
 without very soft shadows 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.500
 now I have replaced the light bulb by putting a trust in it we turn on the 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.319
 as you can see the brightness is quite similar 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.580
 but it creates shadows 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.349
 wall on the chair what 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:43.960
 as you say 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.570
 aces I smart because it is with internal bulbs but we go around 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.690
 let's go down the street like we do when we are on the street 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.170
 of the vallo 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.930

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.930
 that I will present you here with a light bulb because I am inter you 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.020
 use a nice white polystyrene 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.439
 and make the light bounce 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:09.780
 on it in such a way that 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.520
 they are widespread 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.669
 in a homogeneous way 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.319
 on the face of the character who 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:18.639
 winter s bone 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:21.659
 but what if I take it off 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:22.949
 there is no more. 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.930
 if I put it 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.680
 you could also say but if you put the light bulb 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.009
 now I'll show you what happens with the light bulb 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:35.009
 if I put the light bulb that I am a lot 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.760
 and this one here 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.159

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:41.539
 I realize that in recent weeks they are not regular 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.289
