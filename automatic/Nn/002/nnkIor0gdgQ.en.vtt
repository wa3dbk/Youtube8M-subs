first<00:00:04.750> start<00:00:05.020> out<00:00:05.140> by<00:00:05.350> stepping<00:00:05.740> one<00:00:05.920> foot

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:05.950 
first start out by stepping one foot

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.789 
first start out by stepping one foot
forward<00:00:06.810> it<00:00:07.810> doesn't<00:00:07.870> matter<00:00:08.320> which<00:00:08.590> foot

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:08.799 
forward it doesn't matter which foot

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:11.369 
forward it doesn't matter which foot
because<00:00:09.360> eventually<00:00:10.360> we<00:00:10.510> will<00:00:10.690> be<00:00:10.870> shifting

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:11.379 
because eventually we will be shifting

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.570 
because eventually we will be shifting
our<00:00:11.709> feet<00:00:11.980> so<00:00:12.639> just<00:00:12.850> step<00:00:13.150> one<00:00:13.180> foot<00:00:13.629> forward

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
our feet so just step one foot forward

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.480 
our feet so just step one foot forward
slightly<00:00:15.580> bend<00:00:15.789> the<00:00:15.850> knees<00:00:16.090> and<00:00:17.369> begin<00:00:18.369> to

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
slightly bend the knees and begin to

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.040 
slightly bend the knees and begin to
push<00:00:18.699> throwing<00:00:19.119> him<00:00:19.240> back<00:00:19.420> from<00:00:19.630> the<00:00:19.780> middle

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
push throwing him back from the middle

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.870 
push throwing him back from the middle
of<00:00:20.140> your<00:00:20.200> body<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:22.660> oftentimes<00:00:23.550> hula<00:00:24.550> hooping

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
of your body so oftentimes hula hooping

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.580 
of your body so oftentimes hula hooping
is<00:00:25.030> associated<00:00:25.780> with<00:00:25.960> the<00:00:26.080> movement<00:00:26.289> that

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
is associated with the movement that

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.180 
is associated with the movement that
looks<00:00:26.800> sort<00:00:27.039> of<00:00:27.100> like<00:00:27.190> this<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:29.650> notice<00:00:30.010> the

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 
looks sort of like this so notice the

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.819 
looks sort of like this so notice the
difference<00:00:30.220> of<00:00:30.910> that<00:00:31.450> movement<00:00:31.780> compared<00:00:32.500> to

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
difference of that movement compared to

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.020 
difference of that movement compared to
pushing<00:00:33.789> from<00:00:34.120> the<00:00:34.300> center<00:00:34.629> of<00:00:34.750> the<00:00:34.840> body

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
pushing from the center of the body

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.080 
pushing from the center of the body
forward<00:00:37.030> and<00:00:37.120> back<00:00:37.390> throwing<00:00:38.140> back<00:00:38.970> if<00:00:39.970> you

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
forward and back throwing back if you

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.479 
forward and back throwing back if you
feel<00:00:40.270> looking<00:00:40.570> fine<00:00:41.040> push<00:00:42.040> a<00:00:42.070> little<00:00:42.399> bit

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
feel looking fine push a little bit

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.420 
feel looking fine push a little bit
faster<00:00:42.989> that's<00:00:43.989> an<00:00:44.140> indication<00:00:44.530> that<00:00:44.739> nervous

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
faster that's an indication that nervous

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.299 
faster that's an indication that nervous
slowing<00:00:45.790> down<00:00:46.030> as<00:00:46.360> you<00:00:46.540> need<00:00:46.750> to<00:00:46.870> just<00:00:47.309> put

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
slowing down as you need to just put

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.340 
slowing down as you need to just put
more<00:00:48.489> speed<00:00:48.790> into<00:00:48.970> it<00:00:49.270> by<00:00:49.510> pushing<00:00:50.020> a<00:00:50.230> little

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
more speed into it by pushing a little

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.430 
more speed into it by pushing a little
faster<00:00:50.920> if<00:00:51.790> you<00:00:52.000> still<00:00:52.270> feel<00:00:52.480> looking<00:00:52.840> fine

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
faster if you still feel looking fine
