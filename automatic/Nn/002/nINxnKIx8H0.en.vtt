00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.030
Today I will be making baingan bharta.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.540
It's an eggplant mashed with tomato gravy.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.860
This is a very popular dish in the state of Punjab.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.440
And served with roti.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.980
This recipe will serve 3-4.

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.390
We need:

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.740
1 medium sized eggplant

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.500
About 1/4 cup of chopped red bell pepper.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.460
1 green chilli, which I have already seeded.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.620
Small piece of ginger

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.539
2 medium sized tomatoes

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.640
1 teaspoon salt

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.000
1 teaspoon cumin seeds

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.940
Pinch of asafoetida

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.620
1/4 spoon of red chilli

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.600
1 teaspoon of coriander powder

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.900
1/4 spoon of turmeric

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.409
1/4 spoon of garam masala

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.100
And 3 tablespoons of oil.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.580
Cilantro to garnish.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.560
So we will put the eggplant for about 8 minutes in microwave.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.680
I already have one which I have started before.

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:31.699
So this is ready and as you see it is all cooked.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.000
And it has taken about 8 minutes to do it.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.100
So first we are going to cut off the top.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.220
And then peel the skin off slowly.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.640
So as you see it's very easy to peel off.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.160
Now chop the eggplant into small pieces.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.840
This looks ready.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.160
And now we are going to puree the tomatoes

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.620
with the green chilli and ginger.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.380
So next I am going to blend the tomatoes which I have chopped,

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.680
green chillies and ginger together.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.500
This looks great.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.940
Now first I am going to roast the bell pepper.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.800
Just for couple of minutes so they are little bit tender.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.740
So heat is on, medium high.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.610
Add the oil

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.440
and let oil get little bit hot.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.240
Oil is hot.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.940
I am going to first stir fry the bell pepper.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.780
Just for a minute so they are little bit tender.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.320
They look good and I am going to take them out.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.560
And we are going to use the same oil.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.320
Heat little bit more before we will add the cumin seeds and asafoetida.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.300
Oil is ready.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.500
So we are going to use the asafoetida.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.180
Cumin seeds

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.860
And as you see cumin seeds are cracking.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.600
We are going to add the tomatoes.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.740
As you see tomatoes are cooking.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.840
They are almost ready.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.920
It's time to add the coriander powder.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.480
Chilli powder

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.540
Turmeric

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.660
Garam masala, I will add it later.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.280
Garam masala I never like to use it before.

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:17.989
I don't like to cook with it.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.740
It's always added towards the end.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.060
So still it gives a very nice flavour and it leaves a very nice aroma.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.510
So after this cooks down to about half

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.980
which will take about 3-4 minutes.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.460
Then we will add the eggplant.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.340
Tomatoes are ready.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.860
As you can see all the oil is separating with
the spices.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.120
And it's time to add the eggplant.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.840
And salt.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.100
Salt you adjust to your taste.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.100
And we have to keep pressing this while we are cooking this.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.840
So it gets all mashed while we are cooking.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.700
We have to keep mixing and pressing the eggplant at the same time.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.460
See it looks really nice.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.520
It has a very nice color from tomatoes and white eggplant.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.100
This process should take about 7-8 minutes.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.240
As you see this is looking really good.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.740
And it's almost ready.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.449
Just few more minutes to go

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:55.289
and I have been pressing this while cooking but occasionally.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.220
And it has been already about 7 minutes.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.760
This looks ready.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:06.200
It's time to add the bell pepper which we have stir fried before.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.380
And this just gives a nice color and a light crunch

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.020
because eggplant is very soft.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.500
I am going to add the garam masala.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.520
And cilantro.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.380
Eggplant bharta is ready.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.890
Baingan bharta smells and looks really good.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.320
You can serve baingan bharta with roti or paratha.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.960
And these recipes are already on my website.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.540
I hope you will enjoy this as much as my family does.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.500
Thank you.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.580
I will see you again with a new recipe.
