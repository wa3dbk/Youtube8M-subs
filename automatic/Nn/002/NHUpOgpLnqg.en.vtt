00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.330
 usually when a female model is very busy or is located in 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.770
 an area surrounded by mountains 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.280
 the procedure used is the denner arc type 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.660
 This procedure exists to standardize the flow of aircraft from 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.300
 various sectors in order to circumvent in a neighborhood of muca a distance 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.389
 constant to intercept the final approximation 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.009
 watch 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.829
 the runway in use of the guava airport in victory of the spirit 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:34.470
 santo is 23 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.800
 procedure is possible to rdm air 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.120
 and let's consider that we are approaching the aerosol by radio 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.490
 outdoor daycare 03 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.250
 course or number 2 3 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.550
 our goal in this maneuver 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.440
 is to keep the old and the recipe at right through a constant distance of 10 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.720
 miles 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.170
 note that pain from 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.340
 gravel rock 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.409
 josana 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:02.370
 enemies 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.100
 are terminal area limits 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.480
 each of these fixed from different airways 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.560
 that converge to victory 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.880
 also note that the letter imposes minimum altitude limits in 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.120
 certain sectors of the arch 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.039
 the orbit executed on the fixed 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:25.410
 which is nine miles down duvel and the net win 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.800
 and is dialed by radio and the 05 8 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.520
 or course 2 3 8 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.670
 note that the orthogonal distance leg is also 0 5 8 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.060
 however we can not say that it is the Austrian radio the 5 8 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.390
 because if we extend the leg of separation, we will not have to 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.760
 will pass through the vel r therefore so as all other departures is only 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.759
 street of the new world will be 5 8 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.240
 Let's start the procedure. 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.950
 we are coming by the heroic course the number 2 3 indication you and we will bend 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.350
 left entering the arc 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.100
 to enter the arch we should make a left turn keeping 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.100
 minimum altitude of 4 thousand feet in this sector 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:20.439
 so that we can keep constant the distance of the old ro rr we must 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:25.119
 imagine the direction of I always always perpendicular to the course to hear or r 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.279
 our goal is to start a curve for a prosthesis ninety degrees lower 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:35.720
 than the straight stroke for your erp if the arc is clockwise 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:41.319
 if the arc is in the direction of the radius the curve would be for a theft 90 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.569
 degrees higher than the direct stroke for your r 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.019
 note that sometimes we have in the same procedure the arcus clockwise 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.279
 on time 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:55.299
 let's go to the procedure 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.680
 the distance from which we start the curve 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.129
 depends on the speed of our heroin 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.139
 we will enter the arc using the standard curve ratio of 3 degrees per 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:08.229
 second 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:11.049
 to start the curve at the right point 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.889
 so as not to invade our arc boundary 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.629
 let's do the following 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.680
 let's subtract 40 from our arrival 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.689
 and divide all percent 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:25.159
 we must add the value of the radius of the arc 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.989
 suppose then that we are approaching so we must 

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:33.249
 always 40's equals 60 

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:36.889
 divided by percent is equal to zero points 6 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:40.549
 which added to 10 is equal to 10 points 6 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.969
 then we should start the 90 degree curve to get back to ten 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:48.049
 points six miles duvel r 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.049
 in order to maintain the arc of ten days 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:57.039
 the maneuver must start with the value readjusted for the course or 2 3 

00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:00.039
 and cdi centered all 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.829
 when our aircraft hit ten points six miles we should start 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:12.069
 turn left on three degrees per second tilt on a heading 90 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.069
 degrees less than 1 2 3 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:21.130
 when we are close to heading 03 three plus or minus 5 degrees before 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.639
 We can start undoing the curve. 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.659
 note that the course number 2 3 is on the right 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:30.199
 now 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.129
 our goal being to keep a / centered through the obi 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:37.540
 make small adjustments in abs 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.259
 in order to keep the cdc always centered 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:45.669
 I figured our course should always be 90 degrees lower 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.039
 Of course if the bow was right 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.490
 should be 90 degrees higher 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.000
 if distance falls and below 10 miles 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.449
 reduce the curve ratio 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:00.330
 if the distance increases 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.849
 increase the curve ratio 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:04.029
 remember if 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:07.520
 the closer we are to dove world 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.960
 or how much faster are you 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.800
 the greater the lateral-direct slope should be 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.309
 stay in the arc until you cross the radio and the 05 08 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:23.729
 it is what we call levin radial 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:29.370
 when crossing there adjust the curve so that it intercepts the course 2 3 8 that 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.719
 would lead to the final approach 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:34.010
 or if the controller requests 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.719
 start orbit 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:41.580
 the downward profile represents our trajectory laterally. 

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:43.949
 after the living and I play 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:45.490
 now see 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.759
 the descent profile shows shalit on the malta cross 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.210
 if the controller requests wait 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.160
 note that the profile has and elongation to the end of the withdrawal penalty and 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.360
 start of the approach leg 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.979
 for later only 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:03.509
 to get sarney 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:04.790
 parallel 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.879
 at the end of the removal penalty 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:10.650
 we should start the descent to 3700 pecs 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.650
 and proceeded to the clean room 3 thousand stones 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:20.790
 going forward in course 2 3 8 we must observe the altitude limits 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.490
 both 3 and 2 points 2 miles duvel r 

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:30.169
 then we should level in the mba of 500 feet until we have the track 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:34.849
 note that if we need to move 'to land 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:39.529
 each category of aircraft has specific values ​​of near 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:42.529
 Visibility and he from there 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:48.610
 an approximation provided is not as accurate as an approximation because 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:49.589
 he is seven 

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:50.600
 therefore 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.869
 it is possible that when we enter the final approximation in course 2 3 8 

00:06:55.869 --> 00:06:58.869
 the track is slightly misaligned 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.789
 this is because unlike the ims 

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:06.090
 value e is not aligned to the opposite head 

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:08.319
 the commander came back
