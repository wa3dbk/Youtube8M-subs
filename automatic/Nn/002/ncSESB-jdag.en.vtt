00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
thing you've got to be careful with

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.950 
thing you've got to be careful with
these<00:01:47.430> designs<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.180> fits<00:01:48.570> nicely

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
these designs is that it fits nicely

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.210 
these designs is that it fits nicely
onto<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.440> side<00:01:49.620> of<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.770> truck<00:01:49.979> cause<00:01:50.100> you

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
onto the side of the truck cause you

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.530 
onto the side of the truck cause you
have<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.640> window<00:01:50.970> cut<00:01:51.120> out<00:01:51.300> and<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.479> think

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
have that window cut out and I think

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.719 
have that window cut out and I think
that's<00:01:51.750> snowman<00:01:52.290> actually<00:01:53.130> does<00:01:53.250> really<00:01:53.460> well

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
that's snowman actually does really well

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.760 
that's snowman actually does really well
it<00:01:53.940> starts<00:01:54.360> thin<00:01:54.659> at<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.840> top<00:01:54.900> where<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
it starts thin at the top where the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.050 
it starts thin at the top where the
window<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.280> then<00:01:56.370> gets<00:01:56.580> fatter<00:01:56.820> at<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
window is and then gets fatter at the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.370 
window is and then gets fatter at the
bottom<00:01:57.330> where<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.570> window<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.810> not<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.290> it

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
bottom where the window is not so it

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.000 
bottom where the window is not so it
makes<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.680> really<00:01:58.979> good<00:01:59.310> use<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.990> space<00:02:01.110> so

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
makes a really good use of the space so

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.680 
makes a really good use of the space so
a<00:02:02.070> nice<00:02:02.250> kind<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.490> cheesy<00:02:02.670> one<00:02:02.850> there<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.270> then

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
a nice kind of cheesy one there and then

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.120 
a nice kind of cheesy one there and then
perhaps<00:02:03.870> one<00:02:04.229> that's<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.560> bit<00:02:04.680> more<00:02:04.799> kind<00:02:05.040> of

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
perhaps one that's a bit more kind of

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.670 
perhaps one that's a bit more kind of

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
squiggle and not much on the back but I

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.979 
squiggle and not much on the back but I
guess<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.299> spend<00:02:24.510> most<00:02:24.570> of<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.750> time<00:02:24.870> with

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
guess you spend most of the time with

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.289 
guess you spend most of the time with
the<00:02:25.049> trailer<00:02:25.260> on<00:02:25.440> anyway<00:02:25.920> but<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:26.790> very<00:02:26.970> kind<00:02:27.209> of

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
the trailer on anyway but I very kind of

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.729 
the trailer on anyway but I very kind of
cool<00:02:27.540> design<00:02:27.720> there<00:02:28.049> perhaps<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.470> could<00:02:28.530> see

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
cool design there perhaps I could see

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.920 
cool design there perhaps I could see
myself<00:02:28.920> using<00:02:29.730> even<00:02:30.150> outside<00:02:30.299> Christmas

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
myself using even outside Christmas

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.780 
myself using even outside Christmas
although<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.290> trees<00:02:31.650> are<00:02:31.920> snowy<00:02:32.190> some<00:02:32.489> maybe

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
although the trees are snowy some maybe

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.300 
although the trees are snowy some maybe
not<00:02:33.239> but<00:02:33.570> I<00:02:33.780> do<00:02:34.350> think<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.650> it's<00:02:34.830> another

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
not but I do think that it's another

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.830 
not but I do think that it's another

a<00:03:03.040> blue<00:03:03.310> theme<00:03:03.549> but<00:03:03.670> it's<00:03:03.790> different<00:03:04.030> kind<00:03:04.150> of

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
a blue theme but it's different kind of

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.849 
a blue theme but it's different kind of
blue<00:03:04.390> house<00:03:04.540> it's<00:03:04.750> looked<00:03:05.019> kind<00:03:05.379> of<00:03:05.470> slightly

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
blue house it's looked kind of slightly

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
closer to kind of turquoise and I guess

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.750 
closer to kind of turquoise and I guess
it's<00:03:08.650> called<00:03:08.769> cold<00:03:09.040> mystery<00:03:09.280> anything<00:03:09.609> is<00:03:09.730> a

it's called cold mystery anything is a

it's called cold mystery anything is a
colder<00:03:10.420> blue<00:03:10.659> this<00:03:10.840> one<00:03:11.069> you've<00:03:12.069> got<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.250> very

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
colder blue this one you've got a very

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.550 
colder blue this one you've got a very
dark<00:03:12.700> blue<00:03:12.939> up<00:03:13.540> on<00:03:13.689> the<00:03:13.810> roof<00:03:13.989> then<00:03:14.260> gradient

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
dark blue up on the roof then gradient

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.050 
dark blue up on the roof then gradient
going<00:03:14.859> to<00:03:14.950> light<00:03:15.129> blue<00:03:15.219> on<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.489> sides<00:03:15.760> and

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
going to light blue on the sides and

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.879 
going to light blue on the sides and
they<00:03:16.480> kind<00:03:16.629> of<00:03:16.659> like<00:03:16.810> caves<00:03:17.200> with<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.590> light

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
they kind of like caves with a light

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:19.349 
they kind of like caves with a light
shining<00:03:18.280> through<00:03:18.489> and<00:03:18.879> I<00:03:18.970> think<00:03:19.150> that<00:03:19.239> might

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
shining through and I think that might

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:20.399 
shining through and I think that might
one<00:03:19.420> of<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.569> ones<00:03:19.720> you're<00:03:19.810> morphicon<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.260> see

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
one of the ones you're morphicon to see

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.110 
one of the ones you're morphicon to see

outside in the daylight - can I get the

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.250 
outside in the daylight - can I get the
full<00:03:22.329> impact<00:03:22.450> of<00:03:22.689> the<00:03:22.780> haunting<00:03:23.049> looks<00:03:23.200> a

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
full impact of the haunting looks a

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.770 
full impact of the haunting looks a
little<00:03:23.349> bit<00:03:23.620> dull<00:03:23.859> in<00:03:24.819> here<00:03:25.269> not<00:03:25.419> not<00:03:25.569> dull

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
little bit dull in here not not dull

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.179 
little bit dull in here not not dull
isn't<00:03:25.959> boring<00:03:26.260> but<00:03:26.439> like<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.709> covers<00:03:27.010> look<00:03:27.159> a

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:27.189 
isn't boring but like the covers look a
