00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.560
 Russian transport experts 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.719
 Education offer issue 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.630
 citizens driving 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.509
 certificates 16 years similar practice 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.010
 existed during Soviet times 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.539
 why experts advise to let 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.520
 the steering wheel of teenagers and will not because 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:28.710
 this more accidents our learned 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:30.840
 Correspondents may start in Russia 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.640
 issue a driver's license from the age of 16 with 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.840
 such an initiative was taken by members of the council for 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.969
 professional transport 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.530
 Education at the Ministry of Transport 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.300
 experts first of all refers 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.989
 on the experience of germany where already allowed 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.850
 get behind the wheel 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.440
 it is at this age the truth is up 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.480
 the majority of the young driver must 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.890
 accompany adult German practice 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.840
 shows that teens are faster 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.300
 study and follow the road well 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.100
 Krasnoyarsk experts agree that 16 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.489
 summer drivers will fall less into 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.949
 an accident 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.609
 if people really control here 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.280
 car from 16 years old here is this youthful 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.019
 maximalism he will probably allow more 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.030
 carefully study the rules of the road 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.070
 movement and more demanding 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.840
 treat themselves experts also 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.460
 remind that in Soviet times in our 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.710
 the country already had such a notion 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.689
 like youthful right having been trained in 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.369
 driving schools you can get them in 16 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.200
 years but at the same time as now in Germany 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.820
 the young driver to get behind the wheel only 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.689
 accompanied by an adult with experience not 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.549
 less than 3 years 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.860
 Now in Russia, you can also study at 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.600
 Driving school on category b since 16 but 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.759
 the exam is allowed to pass only after 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.500
 18 but on the Russian roads 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.079
 there are also younger drivers 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.430
 and on a perfectly legitimate basis I 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.619
 I think that is against the law 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.960
 there will not be any since 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.790
 today we have in the rules already 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.189
 there is a reservation about what to manage 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.740
 motorcycle can be from 16 years with this people 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.049
 drive on public roads 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.700
 this is what i mean and motorcycle and 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.320
 car are transport 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.979
 means however experts do 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.079
 reservation 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.460
 before issuing rights from 16 years you need 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.469
 significantly improve the quality of training 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.509
 drivers due to sin in the legislation 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.219
 in our country there is no clear and tough 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.899
 requirements for driving schools their instructor 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.290
 examiner and test programs 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.290
 assignment 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.709
 It is obvious that to give a driver 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.540
 certificates of 16 years in Russia will not start 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.200
 Soon after all, clean up in driving schools 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.200
 not easy
