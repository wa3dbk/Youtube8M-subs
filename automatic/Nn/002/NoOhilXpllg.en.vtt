unleash firepower upon it and in in turn

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.560 
unleash firepower upon it and in in turn
it<00:02:40.590> will<00:02:40.740> turn<00:02:40.980> into<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.400> black<00:02:41.640> hole<00:02:41.700> which<00:02:42.180> you

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
it will turn into a black hole which you

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.690 
it will turn into a black hole which you
can<00:02:42.810> enter<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.620> on<00:02:43.770> a<00:02:43.800> side<00:02:44.100> note<00:02:44.130> this<00:02:44.490> may

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
can enter and on a side note this may

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.610 
can enter and on a side note this may
take<00:02:44.970> several<00:02:45.270> attempts<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.840> accomplish<00:02:46.410> this

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
take several attempts to accomplish this

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.530 
take several attempts to accomplish this
and<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.100> best<00:02:47.310> way<00:02:47.460> I<00:02:47.490> have<00:02:47.730> found<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:48.180> do<00:02:48.390> it

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
and the best way I have found to do it

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.660 
and the best way I have found to do it
would<00:02:48.690> be<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.990> be<00:02:49.110> in<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.320> cockpit<00:02:49.560> mode<00:02:50.010> when

this<00:03:40.110> is<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.680> out<00:03:40.890> of<00:03:41.190> this<00:03:41.370> dimension<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.360> in

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
this is the out of this dimension and in

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.420 
this is the out of this dimension and in
order<00:03:42.989> to<00:03:43.020> unlock<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:43.590> you'll<00:03:43.770> need<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.160> travel

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
order to unlock it you'll need to travel

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.340 
order to unlock it you'll need to travel
along<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.910> bottom<00:03:45.150> course<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:45.840> once<00:03:46.200> again

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
along the bottom course and once again

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.590 
along the bottom course and once again
take<00:03:46.800> on<00:03:46.980> from<00:03:47.160> area<00:03:47.550> which<00:03:48.150> is<00:03:48.330> slightly

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
take on from area which is slightly

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.180 
take on from area which is slightly
harder<00:03:49.020> this<00:03:49.170> time<00:03:49.440> but<00:03:49.680> once<00:03:49.890> you<00:03:50.010> have

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
harder this time but once you have

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.810 
harder this time but once you have
conquered<00:03:50.520> it

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
conquered it

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.090 
conquered it
you'll<00:03:51.090> head<00:03:51.420> on<00:03:51.540> over<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.200> asteroid<00:03:52.620> belt

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
you'll head on over to the asteroid belt

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.699 
you'll head on over to the asteroid belt
once<00:03:53.340> again<00:03:53.610> roughly<00:03:54.180> 45<00:03:54.810> seconds<00:03:55.380> into<00:03:55.500> that

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
once again roughly 45 seconds into that

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.590 
once again roughly 45 seconds into that
asteroid<00:03:56.190> belt<00:03:56.400> you<00:03:56.580> will<00:03:56.730> encounter<00:03:57.090> two

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
asteroid belt you will encounter two

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.530

past you a few seconds later on the
right<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:05.400> it's<00:04:05.700> this<00:04:06.030> very<00:04:06.360> one<00:04:06.660> which<00:04:06.870> is

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
right and it's this very one which is

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.890 
right and it's this very one which is
important<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:07.739> you<00:04:08.160> need<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:08.640> blast<00:04:08.880> upon<00:04:09.720> it

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
important and you need to blast upon it

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.080 
important and you need to blast upon it
and<00:04:10.230> if<00:04:10.530> you<00:04:10.620> hit<00:04:10.769> it<00:04:10.920> enough<00:04:11.190> times<00:04:11.519> a<00:04:11.820> large

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
large bird which will fly towards you

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.960 
large bird which will fly towards you
and<00:04:18.600> now<00:04:18.720> in<00:04:18.930> order<00:04:19.260> to<00:04:19.530> walk<00:04:19.799> to<00:04:20.130> that<00:04:20.160> out<00:04:20.640> of

and now in order to walk to that out of
this<00:04:21.120> dimension<00:04:21.359> you<00:04:22.200> need<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.740> touch<00:04:23.010> the

this dimension you need to touch the

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.370 
this dimension you need to touch the
bird<00:04:23.550> once<00:04:24.060> you<00:04:24.180> have<00:04:24.419> you'll<00:04:24.660> be<00:04:24.840> walked<00:04:25.140> out

defeated the fruit machines the credit

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.129 
defeated the fruit machines the credit
will<00:05:05.279> roll<00:05:05.520> as<00:05:05.969> if<00:05:06.180> you<00:05:06.300> have<00:05:06.449> completed<00:05:06.900> the

game and afterwards the words the end

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:11.809 
game and afterwards the words the end
appear<00:05:10.199> which<00:05:10.740> can<00:05:10.919> be<00:05:11.009> short<00:05:11.279> out<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:11.669> be

appear which can be short out to be

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:13.879 
appear which can be short out to be
rearranged<00:05:12.719> and<00:05:12.990> you<00:05:13.139> would<00:05:13.289> think<00:05:13.319> once<00:05:13.770> you

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
rearranged and you would think once you

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.499 
rearranged and you would think once you
have<00:05:14.009> done<00:05:14.189> so<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:14.610> game<00:05:14.849> would<00:05:15.090> end<00:05:15.210> and

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:15.509 
have done so the game would end and

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:17.779 
have done so the game would end and

restart however it turns out you are
stuck<00:05:18.240> here<00:05:18.479> for<00:05:18.750> eternity

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:19.529 
stuck here for eternity

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:21.890 
stuck here for eternity
and<00:05:19.620> I<00:05:20.039> guess<00:05:20.310> with<00:05:20.460> that<00:05:20.490> Andrus<00:05:21.300> takes<00:05:21.539> over

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
and I guess with that Andrus takes over

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.010 
and I guess with that Andrus takes over
the<00:05:22.020> lylat<00:05:22.349> system<00:05:22.379> and<00:05:23.069> also<00:05:23.580> this<00:05:24.000> is<00:05:24.810> the

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
the lylat system and also this is the

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:34.240 
the lylat system and also this is the
Easter<00:05:25.409> Egg<00:05:25.560> hunter<00:05:26.270> breaking<00:05:27.270> out
