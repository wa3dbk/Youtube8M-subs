00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.160 
so you can kind of get your ear round it
and<00:02:26.909> then<00:02:27.209> we'll<00:02:27.360> break<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.690> down<00:02:27.720> take<00:02:28.140> it

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
and then we'll break it down take it

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.050 
and then we'll break it down take it
slow<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.799> you<00:02:28.950> can<00:02:29.069> have<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.519> chance<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.879> work

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
slow and you can have a chance to work

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.030 
slow and you can have a chance to work
on<00:02:30.269> it<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:30.690> here's<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.049> blues<00:02:31.290> lick<00:02:31.530> using<00:02:31.950> the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
on it so here's the blues lick using the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.199 
on it so here's the blues lick using the
a<00:02:32.250> blues<00:02:32.879> scale<00:02:36.980> okay<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.610> here<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:38.879> what<00:02:39.090> it

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
a blues scale okay and here is what it

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.850 
a blues scale okay and here is what it
is<00:02:39.269> broken<00:02:39.599> down<00:02:39.900> we're<00:02:40.200> going<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.409> start<00:02:40.650> out

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
is broken down we're going to start out

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.979 
is broken down we're going to start out
with<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.069> nice<00:02:41.310> Bend<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.000> when<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.120> do<00:02:42.209> my<00:02:42.420> Benz<00:02:42.720> I

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
with a nice Bend and when I do my Benz I

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.020 
with a nice Bend and when I do my Benz I
try<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.290> do<00:02:43.560> them<00:02:43.739> not<00:02:43.950> using<00:02:44.340> just<00:02:44.489> one<00:02:44.700> finger

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
try to do them not using just one finger

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.390 
try to do them not using just one finger
I<00:02:45.360> usually<00:02:45.989> have<00:02:46.079> another<00:02:46.319> finger<00:02:46.709> behind<00:02:46.890> it

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
I usually have another finger behind it

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.130 
I usually have another finger behind it
so<00:02:47.879> we<00:02:47.970> can<00:02:48.090> give<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.329> good<00:02:48.450> strength<00:02:48.930> behind

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
so we can give it a good strength behind

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.869 
so we can give it a good strength behind
there<00:02:49.409> should<00:02:49.560> we<00:02:49.590> notice<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.040> first<00:02:50.519> Bend

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
there should we notice that first Bend

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.729 
there should we notice that first Bend
is<00:02:51.120> on<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.510> g<00:02:51.989> string<00:02:52.019> on<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:53.069> 7th<00:02:53.609> fret<00:02:53.819> I

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
is on the g string on the 7th fret I

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.050 
is on the g string on the 7th fret I

with a bend in the seventh fret and then

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.160 
with a bend in the seventh fret and then
55<00:03:38.430> from<00:03:39.430> there<00:03:39.760> we're<00:03:40.330> gonna<00:03:40.420> do<00:03:40.660> a<00:03:40.690> pull<00:03:40.990> off

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
55 from there we're gonna do a pull off

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.050 
55 from there we're gonna do a pull off
now<00:03:43.860> pull<00:03:44.860> off<00:03:45.040> is<00:03:45.190> going<00:03:45.310> to<00:03:45.370> happen<00:03:45.610> all<00:03:45.850> on

now pull off is going to happen all on

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.060 
now pull off is going to happen all on
the<00:03:46.150> B<00:03:46.300> string<00:03:46.360> and<00:03:46.900> it's<00:03:47.500> going<00:03:47.620> to<00:03:47.710> be<00:03:47.860> from

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
the B string and it's going to be from

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.010 
the B string and it's going to be from
the<00:03:48.190> 8th<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:48.460> the<00:03:48.730> five<00:03:49.090> again<00:03:49.720> you<00:03:49.810> notice

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
the 8th to the five again you notice

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.750 
the 8th to the five again you notice
we're<00:03:50.320> staying<00:03:50.560> completely<00:03:51.130> within<00:03:51.520> that

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
we're staying completely within that

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.060 
we're staying completely within that
same<00:03:52.030> pattern<00:03:52.540> that<00:03:52.660> I<00:03:52.750> showed<00:03:53.020> you<00:03:53.050> that<00:03:53.680> box

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
same pattern that I showed you that box

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.980 
same pattern that I showed you that box
pattern<00:03:54.460> of<00:03:54.520> the<00:03:54.580> blue<00:03:54.790> scale<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:55.480> putting

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
together that's that pull off on the

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.490 
together that's that pull off on the
eight<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.360> five<00:04:01.630> so<00:04:04.020> next<00:04:05.020> part<00:04:05.350> we're

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
eight and the five so next part we're

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.840 
eight and the five so next part we're
going<00:04:05.530> to<00:04:05.709> do<00:04:05.770> we're<00:04:05.890> going<00:04:06.040> to<00:04:06.100> add<00:04:06.250> that<00:04:06.280> blue
