00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.470 
see the TV is starting to dim a little
bit<00:02:31.540> when<00:02:31.660> I<00:02:31.720> go<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:31.900> maximum<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:33.580> what<00:02:34.360> is

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
bit when I go to maximum and what is

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.790 
bit when I go to maximum and what is
showing<00:02:34.720> here<00:02:34.990> is<00:02:35.080> how<00:02:35.230> much<00:02:35.410> I'm<00:02:35.590> actually

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
showing here is how much I'm actually

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.570 
showing here is how much I'm actually
saving<00:02:36.370> or<00:02:36.670> how<00:02:36.880> much<00:02:37.030> I'm<00:02:37.180> using<00:02:37.450> 40%<00:02:38.580> so

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
saving or how much I'm using 40% so

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.240 
saving or how much I'm using 40% so
going<00:02:39.820> back<00:02:40.030> here<00:02:40.330> if<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:40.480> go<00:02:40.660> to<00:02:40.720> medium<00:02:41.590> you

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
going back here if I go to medium you

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.490 
going back here if I go to medium you
see<00:02:42.490> it<00:02:42.580> goes<00:02:42.700> up<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:43.000> 60%<00:02:43.890> if<00:02:44.890> I<00:02:45.010> go<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:46.500> minimum

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
see it goes up to 60% if I go to minimum

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.310 
see it goes up to 60% if I go to minimum
so<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.490> goes<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.820> 80%<00:02:49.360> so<00:02:49.540> usually<00:02:50.080> when<00:02:50.200> I'm

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
so it goes to 80% so usually when I'm

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.540 
so it goes to 80% so usually when I'm
going<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.620> bed<00:02:50.830> or<00:02:50.980> something<00:02:51.160> like<00:02:51.340> that<00:02:51.520> I

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
going to bed or something like that I

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.540 
going to bed or something like that I
put<00:02:51.790> it<00:02:51.880> on<00:02:51.970> maximum<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:53.010> as<00:02:54.010> you<00:02:54.160> can<00:02:54.280> see<00:02:54.340> the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
put it on maximum and as you can see the

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.270 
put it on maximum and as you can see the
TV<00:02:54.760> did<00:02:55.000> dim<00:02:55.270> a<00:02:55.300> little<00:02:55.630> bit<00:02:55.750> there<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:57.010> it

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
TV did dim a little bit there and it

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.650 
TV did dim a little bit there and it
shows<00:02:57.459> how<00:02:57.700> much<00:02:57.850> energy

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
shows how much energy

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.979 
shows how much energy
I'm<00:02:58.990> saving<00:02:59.350> so<00:02:59.709> I<00:03:00.360> really<00:03:01.360> like<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.720> feature

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
I'm saving so I really like that feature

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.510 
I'm saving so I really like that feature
about<00:03:02.320> it<00:03:02.470> but<00:03:02.620> uh<00:03:02.650> something<00:03:03.220> else<00:03:03.340> that<00:03:03.459> I
