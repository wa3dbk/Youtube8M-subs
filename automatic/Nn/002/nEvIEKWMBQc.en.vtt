00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.220
 good day friends subscribers well in 

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:09.670
 this time we are going to postpone the club 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:13.120
 world mod recovery from our optimus lg 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.820
 or that many when they tried to install 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.919
 the first rum that I climbed could not 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.259
 this problem that they had not plagiarized 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:24.509
 another for mod they did not know how to do this 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.509
 occasion I will show 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.240
 first, all we need is 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.240
 download room manager 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.980
 what phrase the one that formed is not going to 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.040
 can download from the play store 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.040
 free with the name red room 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.380
 manager and ss 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.860
 and in this little program what is going 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.250
 to do 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.040
 apart from glacier the world mod 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.670
 recovery is that from there we can search 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.950
 roms compatible with our device 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.100
 but it can also become a 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.650
 problem because if you do something wrong with 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.750
 this road manager as for example 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.730
 save current romo which is the most 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.150
 Causes problems 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.500
 Your cell phone can have a brightness but it does not 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.760
 you worry because what I'm going to 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.860
 teaching now has no risk 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.440
 like that once the application already 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.150
 I'm installed that is very fast here 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.150
 is room manager we are going to execute 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.040
 and what we are going to do is give it in 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:49.620
 accept and then 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.620
 we are going to give you in recovery sectur 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.460
 well here inside the recovery sectur him 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.870
 let's say 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.600
 that we want to install the update 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.720
 of all recovery that is the first 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.720
 option 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.570
 and we confirm our model 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.280
 terminal here we are terminals but 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.630
 we also have in it and the optimal hop 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.910
 we will select it 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.440
 and in recovery where the yo says again 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.200
 that Moscow 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.940
 below says appreciate love world recovery 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:27.190
 you will give him till there 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.190
 for this small process 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.709
 now what we have left to do is wait 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.709
 to finish 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.360
 of downloading the thread by motorbike 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:48.110
 and we will allow the services of 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:51.850
 superuser we must allow and it is already 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.850
 faltering the recovery 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.850
 once finished this tells you that the 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:02.250
 flushing of recovery has been finished 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.670
 and may already be restarting cover 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.390
 to check if this happened 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.390
 correctly 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.300
 Here we see the logo of it 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:19.260
 and then we enter the recovery from 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.520
