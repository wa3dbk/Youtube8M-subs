00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.280
 pula auto began his wanderings in the microsoft console with his first 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.879
 part 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:12.219
 now it's the sony console that recover the license with a sequel 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:13.849
 for playstation 3 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.590
 basically pulau everything is concentrated on offering an arcade driving game 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:19.470
 in the style of parlament 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.940
 including weapons incorporated in the body as a differentiating element 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.339
 but despite the fact that the originality of the title can make us believe that 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:30.969
 is a game to keep in mind what is certain is that pula autonomous skate to 

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:33.140
 the time to get behind the wheel 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.570
 has elements that are remarkable but also has others that make this 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.090
 game is not as addictive as your xinhua 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.940
 The main bonds of 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.830
 career mode and battles 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.200
 where will we get our arsenal tips 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.260
 the sensation of speed is achieved although the skies in the 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.270
 driving are too forced 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.050
 and that's very spectacular to be an arcade, but one of the 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.780
 strengths will be the option to go back in time and is that as if 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.020
 of a prisoner but already it was treated we can tighten the euro 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.260
 and avoid crashing them against a wall or have been destroyed by a rival to make 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.910
 in front of the other cars the best will undoubtedly be the different weapons that 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.900
 we have at our disposal 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.100
 both the attack and the defense are rescued from the friendly 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.350
 character games applying a touch of game would be eternal where you lose 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.710
 all grace 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.610
 the biggest problem with this arsenal is its control as it seems difficult to squeeze 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.040
 so much 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.540
 accelerate ejidal shoot and handle the arsenal is something that costs 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.720
 Get used 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.880
 another option that we will have available is to press the writer made to shoot 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.550
 what we promote to spray 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.130
 which serves as a shortcut for the sequence of buttons to decrease 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.110
 they were all undoubtedly an atypical game 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.610
 revealed typical of 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.680
 but his proposal does not surprise you 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.960
 and the traditional 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.299
 therefore all the spectacular that get its good technical section 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.710
 by the road 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.740
 the design of the circuits is not too showy the elongated cars and 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.300
 the deformation of the camera when it is placed 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.950
 they do not help the gameplay 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.810
 while his other mixed skin of all the pretty eye-catching game 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.080
 itagüí could have taken more advantage of the fact of driving and aiming 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.139
 the time 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:15.839
 but the truth is that it is not so and the fulham auto 2008 in the first 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:19.309
 so if you're looking for an option in this genre to look for recent 

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:23.279
 pleisteichon 3 denise other alternatives that will give us more joy 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:26.719
 even though they just bought that console, it's more likely that she 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:26.939
 things
