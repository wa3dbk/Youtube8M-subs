think that is currently required since
it<00:03:23.520> only<00:03:23.640> requires<00:03:23.970> 15<00:03:29.090> but<00:03:30.090> there<00:03:30.390> is<00:03:30.630> your

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
it only requires 15 but there is your

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.300 
I'm going to add a tunnel that leads up
into<00:07:37.080> the<00:07:37.349> main<00:07:37.560> area<00:07:37.590> at<00:07:38.250> the<00:07:38.460> Great<00:07:38.639> Library

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:40.310 
into the main area at the Great Library

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.269 
into the main area at the Great Library
and<00:07:42.110> for<00:07:43.110> the<00:07:43.199> most<00:07:43.349> part<00:07:43.469> that's<00:07:43.860> it<00:07:44.099> that's

00:07:44.269 --> 00:07:44.279 
and for the most part that's it that's

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:48.110 
and for the most part that's it that's
the<00:07:45.229> quick<00:07:46.229> breakdown<00:07:46.620> of<00:07:47.130> the<00:07:47.250> new<00:07:47.729> wizard

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120 
the quick breakdown of the new wizard

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:54.529 
the quick breakdown of the new wizard
University<00:07:50.479> very<00:07:51.479> cool<00:07:51.810> nice
