I've<00:03:01.700> learn<00:03:01.970> work<00:03:02.150> with<00:03:02.330> him<00:03:02.510> that<00:03:02.660> it's

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
I've learn work with him that it's

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.839 
I've learn work with him that it's
possible<00:03:02.989> to<00:03:03.230> make<00:03:03.470> these<00:03:03.980> large<00:03:04.580> scope

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
possible to make these large scope

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.320 
possible to make these large scope
movies<00:03:05.239> but<00:03:05.420> retain<00:03:05.780> a<00:03:05.810> sense<00:03:06.379> of<00:03:06.530> character

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
movies but retain a sense of character

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.520 
movies but retain a sense of character
there<00:03:08.330> you<00:03:08.780> don't<00:03:08.959> have<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.319> lose<00:03:09.500> that

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
there you don't have to lose that

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.140 
there you don't have to lose that
because<00:03:10.010> that's<00:03:10.130> often<00:03:10.550> happens<00:03:10.880> in<00:03:11.030> these

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
because that's often happens in these

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.790 
because that's often happens in these
large<00:03:11.360> movies<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:11.959> just<00:03:12.170> becomes<00:03:12.410> about<00:03:12.680> the

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
large movies it just becomes about the

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.550 
large movies it just becomes about the
action<00:03:13.300> every<00:03:14.300> fight<00:03:14.510> sequence<00:03:14.959> must<00:03:15.230> not<00:03:15.410> be

just a fight week sequence for the sake
of<00:03:17.300> it<00:03:17.540> it<00:03:17.630> has<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.930> tell<00:03:18.110> you<00:03:18.230> something<00:03:18.590> about
