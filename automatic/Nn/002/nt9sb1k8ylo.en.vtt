00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.090 
alright this is me Jacob teaching you

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.610 
alright this is me Jacob teaching you
how<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:06.300> do<00:00:06.450> front<00:00:06.720> flips<00:00:06.960> and<00:00:07.050> backflips<00:00:07.529> on

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
how to do front flips and backflips on

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.650 
how to do front flips and backflips on
tony<00:00:07.890> hawk's<00:00:08.100> proving<00:00:08.519> grounds<00:00:08.820> first<00:00:09.420> we're

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
tony hawk's proving grounds first we're

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.180 
tony hawk's proving grounds first we're
gonna<00:00:09.750> start<00:00:09.990> with<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.140> front<00:00:10.320> flips<00:00:10.530> pretty

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
gonna start with the front flips pretty

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.280 
gonna start with the front flips pretty
easy<00:00:11.400> for<00:00:12.179> practice<00:00:12.570> I<00:00:12.690> would<00:00:12.839> suggest<00:00:12.960> going

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
easy for practice I would suggest going

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.640 
easy for practice I would suggest going
off<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.559> ramp<00:00:13.919> first<00:00:14.309> what<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.269> do<00:00:15.570> after<00:00:16.110> tries

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
off a ramp first what you do after tries

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.570 
off a ramp first what you do after tries
to<00:00:16.830> go<00:00:16.950> off<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.130> ramp<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:18.210> hold<00:00:18.510> down<00:00:19.020> our<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.770> l2

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
to go off a ramp you hold down our to l2

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.250 
to go off a ramp you hold down our to l2
and<00:00:20.850> then<00:00:20.970> push<00:00:21.180> forward<00:00:21.600> on<00:00:21.690> the<00:00:21.810> analog

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
and then push forward on the analog

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.640 
and then push forward on the analog
stick<00:00:22.290> and<00:00:23.720> they're<00:00:24.720> really<00:00:24.900> easy<00:00:25.020> to<00:00:25.500> do

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
stick and they're really easy to do

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.130 
stick and they're really easy to do
after<00:00:26.520> you<00:00:26.640> practice<00:00:26.850> getting<00:00:27.300> getting<00:00:27.930> them

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
after you practice getting getting them

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.320 
after you practice getting getting them
off<00:00:28.290> a<00:00:28.620> ramp<00:00:29.100> like<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.490> can<00:00:29.670> hit<00:00:30.090> them<00:00:30.180> almost

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
off a ramp like you can hit them almost

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330 
off a ramp like you can hit them almost
every<00:00:30.690> time<00:00:30.870> I<00:00:31.110> was<00:00:31.620> suggest<00:00:31.920> trying<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.250> do

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
every time I was suggest trying to do

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.020 
every time I was suggest trying to do
them<00:00:32.460> on<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.759> ground<00:00:33.030> like<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.739> yeah<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.700> now

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
them on the ground like that yeah so now

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.930 
them on the ground like that yeah so now
on<00:00:36.240> the<00:00:36.420> back<00:00:36.570> flips<00:00:37.160> they're<00:00:38.160> basically<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
on the back flips they're basically the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.230 
on the back flips they're basically the
same<00:00:39.120> thing<00:00:40.220> that<00:00:41.220> was<00:00:41.340> right<00:00:41.460> anyway<00:00:41.880> they're

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:42.240 
same thing that was right anyway they're

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.630 
same thing that was right anyway they're
basically<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.720> same<00:00:42.870> thing<00:00:43.350> except<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.430> hit

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
basically the same thing except you hit

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.220 
basically the same thing except you hit
r2<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:46.020> l2<00:00:46.550> analog<00:00:47.550> stick<00:00:47.910> backwards<00:00:48.890> um<00:00:49.890> I

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
r2 and l2 analog stick backwards um I

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.930 
r2 and l2 analog stick backwards um I
still<00:00:52.230> haven't<00:00:52.710> gotten<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.310> the<00:00:53.610> point<00:00:53.760> where

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
still haven't gotten to the point where

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.130 
still haven't gotten to the point where
I<00:00:54.060> can<00:00:54.329> do<00:00:54.540> them<00:00:54.750> on<00:00:54.870> land<00:00:55.200> but<00:00:56.090> a<00:00:57.090> kind<00:00:57.720> of<00:00:57.930> can

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
I can do them on land but a kind of can

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.040 
I can do them on land but a kind of can
but<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.530> pretty<00:00:58.800> hard<00:00:59.360> so<00:01:00.360> that's<00:01:00.720> going<00:01:00.989> to

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
but it's pretty hard so that's going to

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.069 
but it's pretty hard so that's going to
take<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.350> some<00:01:01.530> practice<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.600> backflips<00:01:03.600> you

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:04.079 
take you some practice and backflips you

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:05.929 
take you some practice and backflips you
can<00:01:04.259> also<00:01:04.379> turn<00:01:04.680> into<00:01:04.949> gainers<00:01:05.309> by<00:01:05.489> going<00:01:05.820> off

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
can also turn into gainers by going off

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.370 
can also turn into gainers by going off
a<00:01:05.970> cake<00:01:07.249> like<00:01:08.249> what<00:01:08.520> I'm<00:01:08.639> about<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.880> do<00:01:09.179> or<00:01:09.539> you

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
a cake like what I'm about to do or you

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.190 
a cake like what I'm about to do or you
can<00:01:10.499> also<00:01:10.679> do<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:10.950> with<00:01:11.159> rails<00:01:11.749> which<00:01:12.749> is<00:01:12.929> fun

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
can also do that with rails which is fun

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.700 
can also do that with rails which is fun
get<00:01:13.499> hopping<00:01:13.889> from<00:01:14.009> rail<00:01:14.219> rail<00:01:15.289> okay<00:01:16.289> now<00:01:16.469> on

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
get hopping from rail rail okay now on

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.359 
get hopping from rail rail okay now on
getting<00:01:17.249> points<00:01:18.259> okay<00:01:19.259> they<00:01:19.920> don't<00:01:20.130> count

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
getting points okay they don't count

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.230 
getting points okay they don't count
front<00:01:20.850> flips<00:01:21.090> back<00:01:21.450> flips<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.959> gainers<00:01:22.380> as

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
front flips back flips and gainers as

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.520 
front flips back flips and gainers as
tricks<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.539> they<00:01:24.630> don't<00:01:24.810> give<00:01:24.959> you<00:01:25.079> points

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
tricks so they don't give you points

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.919 
tricks so they don't give you points
what<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.520> was<00:01:26.880> suggest<00:01:27.270> doing<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.719> either

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 
what I was suggest doing is either

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:29.929 
what I was suggest doing is either
incorporating<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.889> twist<00:01:29.219> in<00:01:29.429> them<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:29.759> by

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
incorporating a twist in them just by

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.669 
incorporating a twist in them just by
moving<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.329> analog<00:01:30.689> stick<00:01:30.719> around<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.469> bunch

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
moving the analog stick around a bunch

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:39.080 
moving the analog stick around a bunch
or<00:01:33.799> right<00:01:34.799> as<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.130> land<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:36.450> always<00:01:36.859> hit<00:01:37.859> X<00:01:38.490> to

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
or right as you land I I always hit X to

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.340 
or right as you land I I always hit X to
do<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> foot<00:01:40.139> plant<00:01:40.969> which<00:01:41.969> gives<00:01:42.389> you<00:01:42.539> couple

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
do a foot plant which gives you couple

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.620 
do a foot plant which gives you couple
points<00:01:43.740> but<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.249> i<00:01:44.279> would<00:01:44.700> suggest<00:01:44.880> putting<00:01:45.479> a

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
points but so i would suggest putting a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.660 
points but so i would suggest putting a
twist<00:01:45.929> in<00:01:46.139> there<00:01:46.319> but<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:47.340> was<00:01:47.520> my<00:01:47.909> video<00:01:48.469> yep

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
twist in there but that was my video yep

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.989 
twist in there but that was my video yep
um<00:01:51.139> yeah<00:01:52.139> as<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.799> credits<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.310> all<00:01:53.579> credit<00:01:53.969> goes

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:53.999 
um yeah as the credits a all credit goes

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:56.179 
um yeah as the credits a all credit goes
to<00:01:54.149> brady<00:01:54.749> for<00:01:55.109> finding<00:01:55.469> out<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.619> front<00:01:55.979> flip

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
to brady for finding out the front flip

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.730 
to brady for finding out the front flip
but<00:01:57.090> i<00:01:57.119> found<00:01:57.539> out<00:01:57.749> the<00:01:57.869> backflip<00:01:58.259> on<00:01:58.409> my<00:01:58.560> own

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
but i found out the backflip on my own

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.209 
but i found out the backflip on my own
and<00:01:59.069> the<00:02:00.029> game
