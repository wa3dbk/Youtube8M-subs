players today and I saw out during
perhaps<00:00:13.159> the<00:00:13.339> overview<00:00:13.669> 1520<00:00:14.299> music<00:00:14.629> enter<00:00:14.900> of

perhaps the overview 1520 music enter of

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.110 
perhaps the overview 1520 music enter of
the<00:00:15.110> flying<00:00:15.349> yeah<00:00:16.100> now<00:00:16.309> I<00:00:16.340> said<00:00:16.610> it<00:00:16.730> so<00:00:17.000> that

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:17.120 
the flying yeah now I said it so that

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.430 
the flying yeah now I said it so that
off<00:00:17.210> time<00:00:17.480> I<00:00:17.510> think<00:00:17.750> we<00:00:17.810> paid<00:00:17.960> in<00:00:18.110> too<00:00:18.260> much

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.440 
off time I think we paid in too much

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.260 
off time I think we paid in too much
respect<00:00:18.770> early<00:00:19.220> on<00:00:19.280> the<00:00:19.400> game<00:00:19.580> obviously<00:00:20.030> any

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
respect early on the game obviously any

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.550 
respect early on the game obviously any
Arsenal<00:00:20.690> team<00:00:20.810> you<00:00:20.990> play<00:00:21.170> is<00:00:21.290> going<00:00:21.380> to<00:00:21.470> be

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
Arsenal team you play is going to be

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.950 
Arsenal team you play is going to be
technically<00:00:21.980> very<00:00:22.130> gifted<00:00:22.610> and<00:00:22.790> they<00:00:23.780> play

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
technically very gifted and they play

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.290 
technically very gifted and they play
certain<00:00:24.470> way<00:00:24.620> and<00:00:24.650> I<00:00:25.010> thought<00:00:25.250> we<00:00:25.400> give<00:00:26.240> them

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
certain way and I thought we give them

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.990 
certain way and I thought we give them
too<00:00:26.480> much<00:00:26.510> respect<00:00:27.110> well<00:00:28.010> then<00:00:28.190> after<00:00:28.520> that<00:00:28.670> we

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
too much respect well then after that we

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.690 
too much respect well then after that we
got<00:00:29.630> ourselves<00:00:29.780> into<00:00:30.170> the<00:00:30.320> gate<00:00:30.530> perhaps<00:00:31.490> the

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
got ourselves into the gate perhaps the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.010 
got ourselves into the gate perhaps the
capitalized<00:00:32.180> specially<00:00:32.599> the<00:00:32.750> end<00:00:32.870> of<00:00:32.960> the

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
capitalized specially the end of the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.450 
capitalized specially the end of the
first<00:00:33.200> off<00:00:33.470> with<00:00:33.620> a<00:00:33.680> couple<00:00:33.800> of<00:00:34.010> golden

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
first off with a couple of golden

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.950 
first off with a couple of golden
opportunities<00:00:35.090> where<00:00:35.270> we<00:00:35.300> didn't<00:00:35.600> take<00:00:35.720> their

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
opportunities where we didn't take their

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.020 
opportunities where we didn't take their
the<00:00:36.530> right<00:00:36.710> option<00:00:37.100> and<00:00:37.250> then<00:00:37.310> then<00:00:37.640> second

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
the right option and then then second

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.729 
the right option and then then second
off<00:00:38.150> for<00:00:38.329> me<00:00:38.450> I<00:00:38.480> thought<00:00:38.780> we<00:00:38.900> dominated<00:00:39.260> more

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
third is able to know if we often a duct

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.870 
third is able to know if we often a duct
and<00:01:18.010> pleasing<00:01:19.010> thing<00:01:19.040> for<00:01:19.460> me<00:01:19.549> after<00:01:19.820> the

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
and pleasing thing for me after the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.000 
and pleasing thing for me after the
initial<00:01:20.060> 20-25<00:01:20.869> minutes<00:01:21.140> readjusted<00:01:21.799> to<00:01:21.830> the

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
initial 20-25 minutes readjusted to the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.039 
initial 20-25 minutes readjusted to the
game<00:01:22.190> we<00:01:22.580> obviously<00:01:23.150> worked<00:01:23.540> on<00:01:23.659> a<00:01:23.720> different

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
game we obviously worked on a different

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.570 
game we obviously worked on a different
formation<00:01:24.530> to<00:01:24.680> start<00:01:24.950> with<00:01:25.130> because<00:01:25.310> that's

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
formation to start with because that's

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.090 
formation to start with because that's
who<00:01:26.450> were<00:01:26.600> playing<00:01:26.840> so<00:01:27.200> we<00:01:27.260> went<00:01:27.350> with<00:01:27.530> a<00:01:27.560> 4312

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
who were playing so we went with a 4312

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.399 
who were playing so we went with a 4312
to<00:01:28.640> start<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:28.970> game<00:01:29.000> and<00:01:29.450> try<00:01:29.869> to<00:01:29.900> press<00:01:30.200> high

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
to start the game and try to press high

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:31.990 
to start the game and try to press high
up<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.650> pitch<00:01:30.680> didn't<00:01:31.580> really<00:01:31.729> get<00:01:31.850> it<00:01:31.970> going

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
up the pitch didn't really get it going

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.570 
up the pitch didn't really get it going
for<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:32.960> first<00:01:33.170> 20<00:01:33.530> minutes<00:01:33.560> and<00:01:33.950> then<00:01:34.100> we<00:01:34.220> got

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
for the first 20 minutes and then we got

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.820 
for the first 20 minutes and then we got
into<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.909> game<00:01:35.119> and<00:01:35.600> we<00:01:35.750> changed<00:01:36.049> to<00:01:36.140> a<00:01:36.200> 442

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
into the game and we changed to a 442

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.800 
into the game and we changed to a 442
after<00:01:37.100> 60<00:01:37.430> minutes<00:01:37.610> to<00:01:38.000> mix<00:01:38.360> it<00:01:38.479> about<00:01:38.689> a<00:01:38.720> bit

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
after 60 minutes to mix it about a bit

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.450 
after 60 minutes to mix it about a bit
and<00:01:39.020> then<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.200> last<00:01:39.380> 15<00:01:39.770> we<00:01:39.890> went<00:01:40.040> to<00:01:40.159> a<00:01:40.189> three

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
and then the last 15 we went to a three

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.280 
and then the last 15 we went to a three
for<00:01:40.700> three<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.600> it's<00:01:41.720> that<00:01:41.869> adaptability

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
for three and it's that adaptability

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.899 
for three and it's that adaptability
that<00:01:42.710> I<00:01:42.799> like<00:01:42.950> to<00:01:43.070> see<00:01:43.220> from<00:01:43.369> the<00:01:43.549> players<00:01:43.790> and
