00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
there's a portion of the map that was

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.449 
there's a portion of the map that was
just<00:04:04.140> really<00:04:04.290> not<00:04:04.530> used<00:04:04.950> it<00:04:05.130> was<00:04:05.220> like<00:04:05.310> on<00:04:05.430> the

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
just really not used it was like on the

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.760 
just really not used it was like on the
lower<00:04:05.700> half<00:04:05.940> of<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.240> map<00:04:06.420> I<00:04:06.600> would<00:04:06.780> say<00:04:06.990> and<00:04:07.290> it

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
lower half of the map I would say and it

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.020 
lower half of the map I would say and it
just<00:04:07.890> wasn't<00:04:08.040> usually<00:04:08.459> for<00:04:08.610> anything<00:04:08.760> I

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
just wasn't usually for anything I

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.699 
just wasn't usually for anything I
remember<00:04:09.239> specifically<00:04:09.660> finding<00:04:10.170> like<00:04:10.320> a<00:04:10.350> bit

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
remember specifically finding like a bit

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.010 
remember specifically finding like a bit
of<00:04:10.860> flowers<00:04:11.459> down<00:04:11.790> there<00:04:12.090> right<00:04:12.330> I'll<00:04:12.750> be<00:04:12.900> good

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
of flowers down there right I'll be good

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.780 
of flowers down there right I'll be good
lay<00:04:13.230> in<00:04:13.440> that<00:04:13.470> bed<00:04:13.590> flowers<00:04:14.220> and<00:04:14.459> I<00:04:14.640> had<00:04:14.760> a

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
lay in that bed flowers and I had a

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.870 
lay in that bed flowers and I had a
perfect<00:04:15.360> shot<00:04:15.420> on<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.290> sniper<00:04:16.500> tower<00:04:16.859> on<00:04:17.700> that

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
perfect shot on the sniper tower on that

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.220 
perfect shot on the sniper tower on that
map<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.209> so<00:04:18.299> we<00:04:18.419> play<00:04:18.600> like<00:04:18.750> hardcore<00:04:18.959> team

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
map and so we play like hardcore team

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.020 
map and so we play like hardcore team
deathmatch<00:04:19.290> and<00:04:19.919> I<00:04:20.340> would<00:04:20.520> just<00:04:20.669> stay<00:04:20.850> there

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
deathmatch and I would just stay there

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.180 
deathmatch and I would just stay there
scoped<00:04:21.450> in<00:04:21.690> on<00:04:21.900> that<00:04:22.109> tower<00:04:22.350> the<00:04:22.620> entirety<00:04:23.160> of

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
scoped in on that tower the entirety of

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.159 
scoped in on that tower the entirety of
the<00:04:23.340> game<00:04:23.520> any<00:04:24.000> time<00:04:24.180> an<00:04:24.450> empire<00:04:24.600> walked

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
the game any time an empire walked

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.750 
the game any time an empire walked
through<00:04:25.320> that<00:04:25.500> tower<00:04:25.680> BAM<00:04:25.979> he<00:04:26.190> was<00:04:26.280> down

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
through that tower BAM he was down

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.580 
through that tower BAM he was down
and<00:04:27.150> that's<00:04:27.330> why<00:04:27.540> I<00:04:27.570> ended<00:04:27.780> up<00:04:27.840> doing<00:04:28.050> and<00:04:28.440> that

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
and that's why I ended up doing and that

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.110 
and that's why I ended up doing and that
worked<00:04:28.770> out<00:04:28.950> pretty<00:04:29.010> well<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.700> it<00:04:29.850> worked<00:04:30.000> out

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
worked out pretty well and it worked out

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.190 
worked out pretty well and it worked out
pretty<00:04:30.270> well<00:04:30.450> and<00:04:30.570> those<00:04:30.750> are<00:04:30.780> my<00:04:30.930> experiences

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
pretty well and those are my experiences

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.320 
pretty well and those are my experiences

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
out I start playing core that really

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.990 
out I start playing core that really

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
played much hardcore ever since then but

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.340 
played much hardcore ever since then but
this<00:04:36.120> nice<00:04:36.330> to<00:04:36.480> see<00:04:36.600> chem<00:04:36.810> strikes<00:04:37.050> like<00:04:37.200> this

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
this nice to see chem strikes like this

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.350 
this nice to see chem strikes like this
he<00:04:37.470> gameplay<00:04:37.800> sent<00:04:38.070> in<00:04:38.190> people<00:04:38.970> playing<00:04:39.120> hard

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
would be like on this game as I think

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.230 
would be like on this game as I think
about<00:04:42.720> it<00:04:42.930> because<00:04:43.110> hardcore<00:04:43.560> is<00:04:43.680> like<00:04:43.920> I<00:04:44.240> mean

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
about it because hardcore is like I mean

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
the quarter playlist feels like hardcore

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.260 
the quarter playlist feels like hardcore

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.340 
regardless in this game I can imagine
like<00:04:51.480> what's<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:51.750> difference<00:04:52.020> between<00:04:52.080> core

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
like what's the difference between core

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.230 
like what's the difference between core
and<00:04:52.380> hardcore<00:04:52.740> I<00:04:52.920> don't<00:04:53.070> know<00:04:53.220> but<00:04:54.000> I<00:04:54.030> could

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.410 
playing hardcore as compared to core
it's<00:05:30.600> very<00:05:30.930> very<00:05:31.200> minimal<00:05:31.650> so<00:05:31.860> I<00:05:31.890> would<00:05:32.100> assume

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.420

hardcore and you're chose kind of

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.350 
hardcore and you're chose kind of

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
exclusively hardcore but for the most

exclusively hardcore but for the most
parts<00:05:39.690> probably<00:05:39.900> not<00:05:40.230> and<00:05:40.640> maybe<00:05:41.640> it's<00:05:41.820> nice

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
parts probably not and maybe it's nice

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.280
