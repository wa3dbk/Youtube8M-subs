we're<00:02:02.100> not<00:02:02.310> getting<00:02:02.610> gas<00:02:02.820> like<00:02:03.210> these<00:02:03.360> other

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
we're not getting gas like these other

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.120 
we're not getting gas like these other
guys<00:02:03.690> were<00:02:04.050> cleaning<00:02:04.680> out<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.890> windshield

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
guys were cleaning out the windshield

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.010 
guys were cleaning out the windshield
now<00:02:05.910> we're<00:02:06.090> going<00:02:06.300> to<00:02:06.390> leave<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:06.750> gas

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
now we're going to leave this gas

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.410 
now we're going to leave this gas
station<00:02:07.050> we<00:02:07.590> got<00:02:07.710> 17<00:02:08.340> miles<00:02:09.300> on<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.560> odometer

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
station we got 17 miles on the odometer

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.660 
station we got 17 miles on the odometer
so<00:02:12.420> basically<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.680> know<00:02:13.800> we're<00:02:14.070> leaking<00:02:14.400> all

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
so basically you know we're leaking all

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.470 
so basically you know we're leaking all
the<00:02:14.790> way<00:02:14.910> home<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.830> if<00:02:16.830> we<00:02:16.890> were<00:02:17.220> evolved<00:02:17.790> we

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
the way home and if we were evolved we

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.960 
the way home and if we were evolved we
still<00:02:18.900> wouldn't<00:02:19.320> have<00:02:19.560> our<00:02:19.760> engines<00:02:20.760> are

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
still wouldn't have our engines are

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.449 
still wouldn't have our engines are
little<00:02:21.209> genset<00:02:22.110> on<00:02:22.290> our<00:02:22.590> engine<00:02:23.010> generator

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
little genset on our engine generator

00:02:23.459 --> 00:03:02.430 
little genset on our engine generator
would<00:02:23.640> not<00:02:23.880> be<00:02:24.090> on

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.860 

on<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.280> 91<00:03:03.670> freeway<00:03:03.820> west

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.530 

so<00:03:08.870> we<00:03:08.960> basically<00:03:09.110> done<00:03:09.500> you<00:03:09.890> know<00:03:10.060> 38.1<00:03:11.060> miles

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
so we basically done you know 38.1 miles

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.690 
so we basically done you know 38.1 miles
the<00:03:12.080> genset<00:03:12.560> didn't<00:03:12.860> come<00:03:13.070> on<00:03:13.250> if<00:03:13.490> we<00:03:13.610> were

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
the genset didn't come on if we were

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.070 
the genset didn't come on if we were
evolved<00:03:14.120> of<00:03:14.210> course<00:03:14.390> not<00:03:14.570> going<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.810> come<00:03:14.930> on

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
evolved of course not going to come on

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.170 
evolved of course not going to come on
in<00:03:15.230> a<00:03:15.320> real<00:03:15.500> electric<00:03:15.860> car<00:03:16.040> like<00:03:16.220> this<00:03:16.430> is

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
in a real electric car like this is

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.760 
in a real electric car like this is
we're<00:03:17.450> a<00:03:17.690> real<00:03:17.960> electric<00:03:18.320> car<00:03:18.530> with<00:03:18.560> an

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
we're a real electric car with an

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.980 
we're a real electric car with an
imaginary<00:03:19.220> jet<00:03:19.550> set<00:03:19.850> and<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.480> Volt<00:03:20.690> is<00:03:20.870> an

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
imaginary jet set and the Volt is an

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.380 
imaginary jet set and the Volt is an
imaginary<00:03:21.260> electric<00:03:21.920> car<00:03:22.100> with<00:03:22.130> a<00:03:22.490> proposed

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
imaginary electric car with a proposed

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.520 
imaginary electric car with a proposed
genset<00:03:24.520> so<00:03:25.520> we're<00:03:25.880> on<00:03:26.180> a<00:03:26.540> real<00:03:26.870> electric<00:03:27.320> car

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
genset so we're on a real electric car

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.380 
genset so we're on a real electric car
with<00:03:27.560> 100-mile<00:03:28.280> range<00:03:28.580> and<00:03:29.060> an<00:03:29.240> imaginary

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
with 100-mile range and an imaginary

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.480 
with 100-mile range and an imaginary
genset<00:03:30.170> so<00:03:30.320> we<00:03:30.440> would<00:03:30.590> not<00:03:30.800> even<00:03:31.010> have<00:03:31.160> used

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
genset so we would not even have used

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.710 
genset so we would not even have used
you<00:03:32.270> know<00:03:32.300> 40<00:03:33.020> miles<00:03:33.230> of<00:03:33.680> range<00:03:34.580> meaning<00:03:35.510> we

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
you know 40 miles of range meaning we

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.020 
you know 40 miles of range meaning we
still<00:03:36.050> have<00:03:36.320> over<00:03:36.530> 60<00:03:37.040> miles<00:03:37.220> of<00:03:37.430> range<00:03:37.670> left

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
still have over 60 miles of range left

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.430 
still have over 60 miles of range left
you<00:03:38.300> know<00:03:38.390> actually<00:03:38.600> we're<00:03:38.870> more<00:03:38.900> like<00:03:39.140> 80

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
you know actually we're more like 80

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.590 
you know actually we're more like 80
miles<00:03:39.770> of<00:03:40.010> range<00:03:40.220> left<00:03:40.550> we<00:03:41.270> did<00:03:41.420> pretty

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
miles of range left we did pretty

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.960 
miles of range left we did pretty
constant<00:03:42.170> speed<00:03:42.470> on<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:42.770> freeway<00:03:43.100> 75<00:03:43.730> miles

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
constant speed on the freeway 75 miles

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.330 
constant speed on the freeway 75 miles
an<00:03:44.180> hour<00:03:44.330> and<00:03:44.840> this<00:03:45.620> would<00:03:45.830> have<00:03:45.950> been<00:03:45.980> a<00:03:46.070> day's

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
an hour and this would have been a day's

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.550 
an hour and this would have been a day's
commute<00:03:46.790> 38<00:03:47.300> model<00:03:47.690> this<00:03:47.900> is<00:03:48.050> a<00:03:48.230> little<00:03:48.440> more

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
commute 38 model this is a little more

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.370 
commute 38 model this is a little more
than<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:48.890> average<00:03:49.130> daily<00:03:49.610> commute<00:03:50.150> and<00:03:50.390> we

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
than the average daily commute and we

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.410 
than the average daily commute and we
did<00:03:51.590> it<00:03:51.680> entirely<00:03:52.010> without<00:03:52.220> gasoline<00:03:52.670> we<00:03:53.209> went

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
did it entirely without gasoline we went

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.900 
did it entirely without gasoline we went
there<00:03:53.600> we<00:03:53.810> came<00:03:54.020> back<00:03:54.290> that<00:03:55.100> was<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.280> daily<00:03:55.550> run

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
there we came back that was a daily run

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.449 
there we came back that was a daily run
you<00:03:56.390> know<00:03:56.510> that<00:03:56.750> was<00:03:56.900> my<00:03:57.050> my<00:03:57.560> sort<00:03:57.890> of<00:03:57.980> run<00:03:58.160> for

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
you know that was my my sort of run for

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.510 
you know that was my my sort of run for
many<00:03:58.610> years<00:03:58.880> in<00:03:59.150> electric<00:03:59.510> car<00:03:59.750> say<00:04:00.530> wow<00:04:00.770> not

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
many years in electric car say wow not

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.390 
many years in electric car say wow not
only<00:04:01.730> do<00:04:02.030> I<00:04:02.090> have<00:04:02.630> enough<00:04:02.780> juice<00:04:02.930> but<00:04:03.560> I<00:04:03.800> have

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
only do I have enough juice but I have

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.550 
only do I have enough juice but I have
enough<00:04:04.820> to<00:04:05.000> do<00:04:05.150> two<00:04:05.450> or<00:04:05.630> three<00:04:05.900> days<00:04:06.110> runs

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
enough to do two or three days runs

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.490 
enough to do two or three days runs
without<00:04:07.310> charging<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.209> car<00:04:08.480> yet<00:04:08.780> so<00:04:09.290> why

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
without charging the car yet so why

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.199 
without charging the car yet so why
would<00:04:09.709> I<00:04:09.770> charge<00:04:10.100> the<00:04:10.340> car<00:04:10.550> now<00:04:10.820> in<00:04:11.120> the

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
would I charge the car now in the

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.870 
would I charge the car now in the
daytime<00:04:11.630> i<00:04:11.959> wouldn't<00:04:12.650> i'd<00:04:12.830> leave<00:04:13.430> it<00:04:13.580> until

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
daytime i wouldn't i'd leave it until

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.610 
daytime i wouldn't i'd leave it until
tonight<00:04:14.120> when<00:04:14.300> i<00:04:14.510> can<00:04:14.750> get<00:04:14.900> cheap<00:04:15.140> electric

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620
