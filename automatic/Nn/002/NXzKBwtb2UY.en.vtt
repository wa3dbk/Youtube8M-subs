very<00:00:55.960> high<00:00:56.170> speed<00:00:56.500> track<00:00:56.830> so<00:00:57.430> it<00:00:57.699> had<00:00:57.820> a<00:00:57.850> lot<00:00:58.030> of

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
very high speed track so it had a lot of

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.570 
very high speed track so it had a lot of
great<00:00:58.269> components<00:00:58.839> for<00:00:58.989> us<00:00:59.129> hockenheim<00:01:00.129> is<00:01:00.400> is

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
great components for us hockenheim is is

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.939 
great components for us hockenheim is is
very<00:01:01.089> different<00:01:01.540> from<00:01:01.720> the<00:01:01.930> Alps<00:01:02.290> it's<00:01:02.589> in<00:01:02.830> the

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
very different from the Alps it's in the

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.590 
very different from the Alps it's in the
middle<00:01:03.190> of<00:01:03.250> Germany<00:01:03.430> so<00:01:03.850> it's<00:01:04.299> one<00:01:04.449> of<00:01:04.540> the

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
middle of Germany so it's one of the

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.969 
middle of Germany so it's one of the
flattest<00:01:04.989> tracks<00:01:05.229> in<00:01:05.379> the<00:01:05.440> world<00:01:05.500> there

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
flattest tracks in the world there

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.100 
flattest tracks in the world there
really<00:01:06.130> isn't<00:01:06.430> any<00:01:06.760> elevation<00:01:07.240> change<00:01:07.659> to<00:01:07.990> the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
really isn't any elevation change to the

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.260 
really isn't any elevation change to the
track<00:01:08.320> itself<00:01:08.650> so<00:01:09.369> it<00:01:09.790> was<00:01:09.880> just<00:01:09.970> a<00:01:10.119> very

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
track itself so it was just a very

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.000 
track itself so it was just a very
different<00:01:10.479> experience<00:01:10.720> it's<00:01:11.470> completely

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
different experience it's completely

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.710 
different experience it's completely
surrounded<00:01:12.400> by<00:01:12.520> trees<00:01:12.820> almost<00:01:13.360> that<00:01:13.479> sort<00:01:13.659> of

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
surrounded by trees almost that sort of

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.780 
surrounded by trees almost that sort of
black<00:01:13.900> forest<00:01:14.290> field<00:01:14.590> so<00:01:14.950> that's<00:01:15.430> something

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
black forest field so that's something

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.810 
black forest field so that's something
that<00:01:16.060> we<00:01:16.150> try<00:01:16.330> to<00:01:16.390> keep<00:01:16.570> in<00:01:16.689> mind<00:01:16.900> as<00:01:17.110> well<00:01:17.820> last

techniques for capturing the track one

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.540 
techniques for capturing the track one
of<00:02:02.000> them<00:02:02.120> is<00:02:02.270> that<00:02:02.420> we<00:02:02.479> lay<00:02:02.780> down<00:02:02.960> GPS<00:02:03.440> lines<00:02:03.800> so

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
of them is that we lay down GPS lines so

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.370 
of them is that we lay down GPS lines so
we'll<00:02:04.970> actually<00:02:05.150> walk<00:02:05.540> or<00:02:05.780> drive<00:02:05.900> around<00:02:06.200> the

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
we'll actually walk or drive around the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.949 
we'll actually walk or drive around the
track<00:02:06.620> with<00:02:06.950> different<00:02:07.430> GPS<00:02:07.820> devices<00:02:08.179> so<00:02:08.780> that

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
track with different GPS devices so that

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.070 
track with different GPS devices so that
we<00:02:09.080> can<00:02:09.320> accurately<00:02:09.590> reproduce<00:02:10.429> the

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
we can accurately reproduce the

tracks

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.750 
tracks
they'll<00:02:48.769> be<00:02:48.890> slight<00:02:49.100> differences<00:02:49.550> between

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
they'll be slight differences between

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.060 
they'll be slight differences between
real<00:02:50.120> world<00:02:50.360> and<00:02:50.600> fictional<00:02:51.110> tracks<00:02:51.410> well<00:02:51.950> the

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
real world and fictional tracks well the

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.800 
real world and fictional tracks well the
first<00:02:52.280> thing<00:02:52.489> we<00:02:52.640> say<00:02:52.790> is<00:02:53.000> what<00:02:53.450> is<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.630> feel

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
first thing we say is what is the feel

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.060 
first thing we say is what is the feel
for<00:02:54.019> this<00:02:54.170> track<00:02:54.410> what<00:02:54.590> are<00:02:54.650> we<00:02:54.739> trying<00:02:54.950> to

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
for this track what are we trying to

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.040 
for this track what are we trying to
impart<00:02:55.610> to<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.910> player<00:02:56.120> when<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:56.600> comes<00:02:56.810> to

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
impart to the player when it comes to

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.540 
impart to the player when it comes to
real<00:02:57.410> world<00:02:57.590> tracks<00:02:57.890> we<00:02:58.100> want<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.310> make<00:02:58.430> them

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
real world tracks we want to make them

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.850 
real world tracks we want to make them
as<00:02:58.700> accurate<00:02:59.150> as<00:02:59.239> possible<00:02:59.530> how<00:03:00.530> can<00:03:00.560> I<00:03:00.769> have

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
as accurate as possible how can I have

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.560 
as accurate as possible how can I have
in<00:03:00.950> particular<00:03:01.489> that<00:03:01.670> comes<00:03:01.850> down<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.390> the

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
in particular that comes down to the

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.289 
in particular that comes down to the
Mercedes<00:03:03.560> grandstand<00:03:04.100> there's<00:03:04.489> a<00:03:04.610> grandstand

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
Mercedes grandstand there's a grandstand

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.030 
Mercedes grandstand there's a grandstand
there<00:03:05.480> that's<00:03:05.720> shaped<00:03:05.989> like<00:03:06.080> of<00:03:06.320> giant<00:03:06.650> C<00:03:06.769> and

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
there that's shaped like of giant C and

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.860 
there that's shaped like of giant C and
it<00:03:07.130> dominates<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.880> entire<00:03:08.000> track<00:03:08.660> it's

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
it dominates the entire track it's

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.259 
it dominates the entire track it's
almost<00:03:09.080> like<00:03:09.320> a<00:03:09.350> monument<00:03:10.220> to<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.940> area

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
almost like a monument to the area

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.550 
almost like a monument to the area
itself<00:03:11.600> so<00:03:12.049> we<00:03:12.799> put<00:03:13.010> a<00:03:13.040> lot<00:03:13.160> of<00:03:13.340> detail<00:03:13.700> into<00:03:13.910> it

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
itself so we put a lot of detail into it

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.530 
itself so we put a lot of detail into it
when<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.650> do<00:03:15.829> look<00:03:16.010> at<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.400> it<00:03:16.820> just<00:03:17.060> has<00:03:17.239> this

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
when you do look at it it just has this

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.860 
when you do look at it it just has this
sense<00:03:18.500> of<00:03:18.680> presence<00:03:19.269> when<00:03:20.269> we<00:03:20.360> feel<00:03:20.570> this<00:03:20.750> is

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
sense of presence when we feel this is

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.569 
sense of presence when we feel this is
really<00:03:21.170> solid<00:03:21.410> we<00:03:21.829> move<00:03:22.010> on<00:03:22.130> to<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.340> next

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
really solid we move on to the next

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.400 
really solid we move on to the next
stage<00:03:22.760> which<00:03:22.790> is<00:03:23.030> your<00:03:23.360> refine<00:03:23.720> face<00:03:24.019> when<00:03:24.320> we

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
stage which is your refine face when we

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.289 
stage which is your refine face when we
start<00:03:24.650> doing<00:03:24.799> our<00:03:25.010> textures<00:03:25.459> basically

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
start doing our textures basically

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.390 
start doing our textures basically
everything<00:03:26.750> is<00:03:26.900> there<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:27.709> a<00:03:27.739> level<00:03:28.220> that

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
everything is there and to a level that

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.759 
everything is there and to a level that
we<00:03:28.549> would<00:03:28.820> consider<00:03:29.060> shippable<00:03:29.690> but<00:03:30.260> may<00:03:30.620> not

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
we would consider shippable but may not

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.770 
we would consider shippable but may not
have<00:03:30.950> that<00:03:31.130> extra<00:03:31.489> level<00:03:31.670> of<00:03:31.820> sparkle<00:03:32.360> that<00:03:32.690> we

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
have that extra level of sparkle that we

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.600 
have that extra level of sparkle that we
want<00:03:33.019> it<00:03:33.140> to<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.560> then<00:03:33.920> we<00:03:34.010> take<00:03:34.160> it<00:03:34.220> into<00:03:34.519> the

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
want it to and then we take it into the

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.729 
want it to and then we take it into the
polish<00:03:35.030> phase<00:03:35.269> which<00:03:36.019> is<00:03:36.049> where<00:03:36.350> all<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.560> love

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
polish phase which is where all the love

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.680 
polish phase which is where all the love
comes<00:03:37.040> in<00:03:37.220> to<00:03:37.610> get<00:03:37.790> in<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.120> we<00:03:38.209> model<00:03:38.510> all<00:03:38.660> the

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
comes in to get in and we model all the

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.960 
comes in to get in and we model all the
little<00:03:39.019> details<00:03:39.440> so<00:03:39.620> we<00:03:39.890> try<00:03:40.100> and<00:03:40.250> say<00:03:40.400> okay<00:03:40.760> at

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
little details so we try and say okay at

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.520 
little details so we try and say okay at

use this brake marker this rubber strip
right<00:04:00.440> before<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:00.739> curving<00:04:01.070> on<00:04:01.160> this<00:04:01.280> and

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
right before the curving on this and

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.500 
right before the curving on this and
then<00:04:01.489> I<00:04:01.549> turn<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:01.940> this<00:04:02.030> seems<00:04:02.239> like<00:04:02.329> it's

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
then I turn and this seems like it's

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.909 
then I turn and this seems like it's
happening<00:04:02.780> just<00:04:02.870> a<00:04:02.989> little<00:04:03.140> bit<00:04:03.230> late<00:04:03.380> or<00:04:03.590> this

bump<00:04:04.160> isn't<00:04:04.370> quite<00:04:04.639> bad<00:04:04.820> enough<00:04:04.850> this<00:04:05.269> upsets

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
bump isn't quite bad enough this upsets

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.880 
bump isn't quite bad enough this upsets
my<00:04:05.750> car<00:04:05.959> when<00:04:06.139> I<00:04:06.169> go<00:04:06.320> in<00:04:06.410> over<00:04:06.590> here
