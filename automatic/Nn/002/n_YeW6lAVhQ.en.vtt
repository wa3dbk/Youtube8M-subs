00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.850
 welcome because the two cards 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.240
 my name is lauda i want you 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.070
 do not imagine the accent 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.200
 The mini kit has been built for this 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.140
 that he is a bit narrower one 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.430
 bit smaller than the cage and 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.830
 especially a bit easier 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.510
 as distinguished on the basis has 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.640
 the kids of fix in front a wider one 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.570
 basis has determined extra only this 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.330
 narrow legs 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.860
 this 20 is completely the same so this 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.710
 to fit the same length and they fit 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.809
 also from the same age about 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.460
 80 centimeters be made in some 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.210
 children sometimes but sooner 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.760
 usually about 80 centimeters 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.110
 you see the seat shell that is one 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.700
 you can do that with a seat 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.920
 buy he is not always there because 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.540
 many people the dax is only later 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.840
 buy and the children are already bigger 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.579
 that is why it is optionally available 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.680
 special on minikit and on the axes 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.899
 in general, the headrest is itself 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.539
 is set automatically with the same 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.330
 Loud when I solve the button here 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:10.330
 and make the straps loose then slips 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.590
 the headrest up here 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.910
 That's the name of the child and quickly 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.800
 The headrest slips into the top 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.240
 position and if I have the child then 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.500
 again , here he is five points 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.789
 He is then simply clicked one 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.050
 sees the pool was punishing 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:28.700
 and then when I get the headrest 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.380
 down to the height of the 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.179
 shoulder 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.649
 for little children is sometimes one 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:35.840
 a bit difficult that's really good 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.399
 holds and you consolidate the really good 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.030
 can pc external brake 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:43.039
 So you can then that would be a terrain 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.929
 the child is strapped in the button 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.340
 make direction stock and then that is 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:47.000
 Head rest firmly if I here now 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.509
 belt solve 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.009
 nothing happens anymore but it is 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.349
 so thought that the girth itself 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.140
 a little bit of punishment and that's why it is 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:02:02.940
 really really 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:05.090
 for small children thought the seat 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.320
 you can also exclude smaller then 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.979
 there is just the closing by 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.360
 plugged and then I show you the 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.840
 happy is the seat is when you 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.980
 really complete this now 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.350
 really from down here to here 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.209
 and that makes the ax kit so the ax 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.040
 tickle the minikit and the cage too 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:29.780
 sit the longest fit 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:32.370
 ever at all in our assortment 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.910
 the minikit also has several special ones 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.910
 disappeared 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.550
 that works down here there's 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.100
 Intervention can take this foot out 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.050
 There are several positions 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.580
 after how far stefan in there or 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.310
 outside is the mini goes then 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.320
 if less inclined or less willing 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.830
 Unicat also has the Swedish + test 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.830
 passed 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.840
 if you want to build the mini stone 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.840
 you need straps or extra 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:09.320
 the day before sketch this here that is called 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.950
 I have two such good ones in the car 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.530
 installed 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.740
 the actual straps are here 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.390
 on the side of the sitting edge in ours 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.010
 German cars are usually not 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.870
 evil you just hook it 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.770
 could split apart volvo da 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.510
 that can happen 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.610
 it's not the case with everyone else 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.020
 bad because you have two each 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.270
 and you need to get the seat in one 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.530
 car if you have a car 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.790
 was the installation of these good 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.800
 a bit hasty one can the 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.080
 Just buy twice if you often 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.770
 wants to change the evil in the 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.780
 separate cars 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.480
 there is also the possibility of such 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.370
 evil under the rails of the seats 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.269
 to screw so for example the 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.280
 children sits behind the 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.720
 passenger seat and under the rail of 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.880
 Passenger seat I can screw so loose 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.050
 They are available in our online shop 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.610
 You can not buy that with the 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.530
 Do it here but you need it 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:59.540
 which screwed but here so 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.820
 a small opening for a screw 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:08.260
 but then they are similar in nature 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:10.549
 This strap is about something in the footwell 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.709
 So either wrapped around at 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.450
 the rail from the passenger seat or around 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.280
 the joint between seat and rest 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.690
 seat then you just put it 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.019
 by hijacked the rum side 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.410
 sometimes there are others 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.780
 attachment possibilities under the 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.340
 Passenger seat then you put that 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.740
 simply through and after all the 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:32.270
 color markings are openings 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.500
 this good one can do that easily 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.760
 stuck through the loop 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.680
 For example, here is something 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.479
 between 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.090
 then you pull the fixed and can here 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.190
 one then this span belts here 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.380
 click 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.699
 Picture here already made it so 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.460
 I can show you once again am 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:50.050
 I'm going to fix it here it was 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.360
 the medicaid just put on it 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.919
 We make it easy to get out because in 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.110
 the most space is so that you can now 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.360
 make it as far as possible for you 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.650
 I would like a nice position for the child 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:06.160
 then that is set up there 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.300
 here two on each side just one and 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.729
 the strap will be over here right now 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.729
 guided over the seat 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.290
 You can also tie the strap under the train 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.360
 lead along 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.539
 but that does not matter it comes easy 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:41.630
 on what you like better 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:44.419
 not necessarily so good on 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:47.930
 the other side clicked on it 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:49.669
 pay attention that both places are open and 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.440
 then here on this page is the 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:53.840
 shoulder well released so on the 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.550
 side where the shoulder strap comes from above 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.889
 and where is not that closed until the 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.990
 shoulder is free on the other side 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:00.940
 Both are judged by the 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.010
 clamped 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:07.820
 Now it's solidified but waiting 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:10.449
 Of course, still on the ground, there are 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:14.449
 won against the fall france 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:22.550
 fail and the axel in long is to 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:26.889
 Other straps can be in length 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:31.479
 adjust and you can do it again here 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:33.740
 beautiful on this also fully automatic 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:38.289
 is that you do not have to pull yourself 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:41.810
 but that you just turn right 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:43.130
 and become firmer normally 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.620
 the street circuit is on and then 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.000
 Eventually you end with the words 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.909
 can always do that if not yet 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.639
 is enough and the upholstery gives that 

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:56.720
 then it just goes on and on 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:58.159
 to the so far so good installation 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.560
 actually everything and there it sits now 

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:02.780
 firm if you still have questions then 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.400
 just contact info at web.de 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.539
 or looks in the online shop 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.040
 maybe you 'll find that already 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:09.090
 answer 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.090
 to 1
