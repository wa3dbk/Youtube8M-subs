00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.079
 muscular 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.960
 Well, it's not all I hope you 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.610
 go well today 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.049
 little video on black ops 2 in league 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.010
 again I do not know what mode 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.199
 I do not know which rope since 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.020
 like just as you can the 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.920
 see on the small screen you were 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.110
 must the proud bayard to post again 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.220
 so it's gone in league and I wanted 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.129
 just okay I'll enjoy it for 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.350
 have amstrad it's not bad we're going 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.300
 give up pre-season match so that's 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.980
 wholesale training matches so I have 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.579
 just preceded something is that in this 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.620
 moment we will reduce a little in the month 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.730
 from July to June we go a little 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.590
 reduce the number of videos 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.210
 that is, do not expect to 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.440
 see four videos a week you have 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.970
 could see him last week and 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.710
 maybe two weeks ago where if I know 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.210
 more we will not turn anymore 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.190
 maybe take the joystick to more 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.620
 shot at one or two videos a week 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.160
 because that's not it's not 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.450
 obvious to make videos of the months I 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.640
 am taken enough the colleagues too are 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.780
 enough taken right now so that's okay 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.520
 not be obvious it's just for you 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.920
 prevent in August normally that 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.780
 should come back and then from the to 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.240
 from the month of August anyway that 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.429
 will come to him video and maybe end 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.100
 July we 'll see a little bit about it 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:23.359
 is happening and so there we are a little 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.359
 tract as I told you 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.640
 so yes also I discovered the little 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.289
 m 8 to 1 I think I think that's it 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.439
 go m mutineers so the little thorn the 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:39.240
 burst went frankly she is 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.549
 really good so do not play too much 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.869
 the melee fights you 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.850
 go see him I will stay at a distance 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.969
 enemies anyway because that's 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.469
 a good raphael weapon she can kill 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:52.020
 certainly for some she holds a 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:54.929
 burst for me for fraudulent mom 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.819
 of course with my connection of 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.439
 not going to say CEO connection that's nothing 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:59.939
 to do with the fact that we are not p2 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.899
 connection anyway it's not because 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.340
 you take a cock in the cloud 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.049
 such good connections not a good bah 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.069
 we are going to be very will do it 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.349
 on the other hand, enemies do what 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.720
 I would like to know a little vain 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:16.290

 ah ah yes it's marked on the right it's 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.040
 a good little remote weapon it's up to 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:36.840
 to say that she kills in the day was excluded 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.959
