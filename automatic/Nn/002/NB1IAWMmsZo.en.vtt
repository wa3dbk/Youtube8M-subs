you<00:03:22.790> have<00:03:22.910> to<00:03:23.030> do<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.390> then<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.570> top<00:03:23.750> portion

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
you have to do and then the top portion

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.310 
you have to do and then the top portion
of<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.799> s3<00:03:25.340> is<00:03:25.519> just<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:26.450> touchpad<00:03:26.900> and<00:03:26.959> that

of the s3 is just the touchpad and that

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.520 
of the s3 is just the touchpad and that
is<00:03:27.560> it<00:03:27.769> but<00:03:28.580> the<00:03:29.299> resemblance<00:03:30.110> is<00:03:30.230> almost

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
is it but the resemblance is almost

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.699 
is it but the resemblance is almost
uncanny<00:03:31.160> that<00:03:31.610> the<00:03:32.060> two<00:03:32.330> one<00:03:33.170> takes<00:03:33.530> the

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
uncanny that the two one takes the
