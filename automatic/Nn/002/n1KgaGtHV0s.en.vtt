00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.400
 m 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:20.270
 over the years was that the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.820
 black backgrounds is very difficult to do 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.419
 especially if you have a subject not on 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.230
 black background 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.939
 I tried to explain that I was coming 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:34.559
 in the months and put them back to black 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.270
 is enough he is a nice piece of cloth 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.860
 black 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:43.170
 I am wearing a black vest 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.039
 what do I have dollars g of nuts there 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.780
 will give in touch and that's black 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:52.190
 but is it black look when 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.190
 I move in the light 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:01:00.479
 look at it come shouting by publishing and 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.979
 a product drowns in a faithful 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.530
 soon i will show you 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:06.840
 how do I make a felt of these subjects 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.850
 but look against a black background 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:15.450
 it is black except for small 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.810
 shine that read the only ball to 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:23.040
 crates that sedunois black is the nail 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.340
 of an object and that they will have any language 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.010
 of visible room dante is that it's 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.160
 something coming out of goumbou but 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:35.310
 this is it the most by two 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.430
 photographers to use velvet from 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.030
 very good quality of velvet that I have 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.070
 always found very very expensive it's 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.300
 really not done because we can 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.150
 switch 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:52.800
 the direction as bruce josh bros 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:57.150
 depending on the direction of light 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:01.410
 that you see it's the bloodhound comes from 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.690
 brush removal in a way and if that 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.330
 comes from the other side we brush into the 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.750
 opposite 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:12.900
 it gives me a good black background 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.640
 finally compared to the redo box 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:20.200
 black or a piece of black cardboard 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:23.260
 that it's noah now we see 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.590
 this is proof that the management of 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.670
 light changes colors of these funds 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.800
 blacks or the tone is this enough for 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.070
 we need a fund where we can 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.640
 change direction of the surface for 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:42.250
 that it's going to reflect me otherwise it was 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.400
 the weed at risk and so in 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.820
 the next video in the next title I 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:53.610
 am going to buy a black subject on a black background 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.610
 and we'll see how I'm doing
