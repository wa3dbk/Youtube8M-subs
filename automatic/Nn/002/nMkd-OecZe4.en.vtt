00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:08.180
 hello good morning 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:10.670
 I am a lawyer the devil by July or 715 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.780
 the three accounts that I use and have made 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.980
 videos people already know me but little and 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.750
 the video that I'm going to do now more than 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.610
 nothing is to refer to these little caps 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.700
 in these helmets because I get the 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:28.540
 news that a play 4 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.540
 peripherals of brands that is this 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.570
 they were the pirates who simulated those of the 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.570
 play 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.250
 the others this does not look very good but 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.670
 they will not be compatible for play 4 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:51.760
 for me this is the same 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.030
 this is not the same for me at all but for 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.769
 because apart from anything worth a paste 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.719
 they work very well I explain to you to see 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.969
 the people who know what the story is about 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.289
 with connections to the best you can me and 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.429
 Well, yes, it does not go there, but 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.470
 well I will make a summary of what 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:07.630
 it's in the helmets, well, the micro is 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.490
 you can remove etcetera as well as everything 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.320
 many pieces that there may be 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.490
 micros now this one does not want to leave because 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.490
 he has never left we have never been 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.210
 well, you're not going to do it hard five 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.220
 speakers in each ear is super good 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.789
 quilted looks like they will be 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:28.659
 techniques is quite charged and the 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:33.189
 volume control in front 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.509
 back center subwoofer once fixed 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.520
 that has these that go very well here 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.990
 put xbox but I guess in the end I'll 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.040
 remove erasing because I'm ashamed 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.940
 I 'm here 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.710
 what has this this command is that if 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.300
 you want to silence someone is when 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.280
 with a friend and you want to start 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.900
 hit you do not have to go to the mute menu 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.490
 etc 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.130
 all are off but listen to something 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.840
 it's just a bit that you do not want to talk 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.410
 with nobody you do not have to touch any 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.790
 button on the console or configure anything 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.410
 you turn off children you hear nobody 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.200
 but if you see them regularly century 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:10.810
 you listen to them to do things or 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:15.250
 the inverse with half and this one 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:18.090
 and the volume of everything goes up or down if we 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.940
 we go up it will change color 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.110
 until the blue good these are fixed not 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.660
 I'm interested, let's go to the mess 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.120
 here we have the decoder that is 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.500
 that with these helmets you go where you 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.460
 go 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.250
 if you go with the encoder and the optician to 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.340
 your TV and you have a portable 5.1 that's why 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.830
 It bothers me that this does not work 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.900
 Of course I know that because of him 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.690
 by optical will work speech and 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.410
 4 that's for sure but what bothers me is the 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.810
 USB USB This is 2.0 on the console 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.620
 it's going to be 3.0 here it may be that it's no longer 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.050
 be compatible that what bothers me is 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.160
 that we have the like we have a theft 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.290
 the center the overall volume of all 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.850
 the stories on top if it is 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.860
 playing with other people you can 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.950
 plug another one next to it that is 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.300
 already done to play is just that 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.150
 what would bother me a lot that not 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.560
 worked in these helmets the steering wheel what 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.000
 big yes that's going to work why 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.200
 because granturismo is the jewel of 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.030
 playstation of all life and sure that 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.720
 this steering wheel that has been for years 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.990
 matusalÃ©n that is from playstation 2 now 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.640
 would be an equivalent to the gel 25 g 24 or 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.770
 be a bag without mortgage thousand 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.450
 wonders with the three to erase or that 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.940
 it does not work now for the 4 but it has 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.520
 a lot of money in more if it does not work 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.780
 command nor the helmets 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.630
 nor the steering wheel will come to me without a console 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:54.740
 the helmets and the steering wheel plus hard drives 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.630
 more everything all for 250 or 300 euros 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.700
 because the truth is a loss of 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.090
 time they are spending money is supposed 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.099
 that in theory 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.510
 in play 4 game pla and 4 well of 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.950
 great as great architecture has 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.010
 ordered as everything they do from 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.360
 then there will work but 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.780
 clear that money has been spent on 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.780
 do this 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.269
 I would have spent money, no, no, the 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.090
 I want to buy it 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.829
 what interests me is someone who has 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.419
 seen this video please tell me 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:29.110
 if the usb will be compatible with play 4 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:33.190
 Of course no one knows it in a certain way 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:35.919
 but maybe someone who is is in 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.509
 the subject can say hey look then this 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.220
 otherwise work is popping up 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.659
 codes of I do not know what I do not know how much is the 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.360
 typical stories of people who 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:46.539
 understand and thus we get rid of doubts 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.620
 because in the portal and in the forum of 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.870
 Play Station 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.479
 there's all playstation 4 so we 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.159
 I would be interested in good morning 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.840
 that goes well we liked the video 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:58.650
 rather you liked if not their 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.650
 interests or interests go well 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.650
 goodbye
