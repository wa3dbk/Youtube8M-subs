00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
really bad shape and he still had a

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.820 
really bad shape and he still had a
great<00:02:23.160> manager<00:02:23.400> CM<00:02:23.940> Punk<00:02:24.210> and<00:02:24.480> then<00:02:25.170> after

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
that of course he left for a year came

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.810 
that of course he left for a year came
back<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.530> then<00:02:28.650> had<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.890> match<00:02:29.460> to<00:02:29.640> Brock

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
back and then had a match to Brock

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.550 
back and then had a match to Brock
Lesnar<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.420> that's<00:02:30.600> when<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.810> streak<00:02:31.200> ended

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
Lesnar and that's when the streak ended

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.480 
Lesnar and that's when the streak ended
and<00:02:33.050> so<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:36.020> Undertaker's<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.440> all<00:02:38.190> think

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
and so it Undertaker's and all think

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.560 
and so it Undertaker's and all think
he's<00:02:38.610> in<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.820> best<00:02:39.000> shape<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.270> have<00:02:39.540> a

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
he's in the best shape to have a

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.150 
he's in the best shape to have a
mattress<00:02:39.870> thing<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.560> don't<00:02:40.770> see<00:02:40.980> this

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
mattress thing so I don't see this

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.740 
mattress thing so I don't see this
mattress<00:02:41.490> thing<00:02:41.850> happening<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:44.330> if<00:02:45.330> things

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
mattress thing happening and if things

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.170 
mattress thing happening and if things
ever<00:02:46.020> gonna<00:02:46.410> have<00:02:46.709> Russell<00:02:47.430> matching<00:02:47.760> WB

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
ever gonna have Russell matching WB

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.449 
ever gonna have Russell matching WB
which<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.540> do<00:02:48.600> think<00:02:48.959> he<00:02:49.080> will<00:02:49.350> it's<00:02:50.220> most

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
which I do think he will it's most

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.610 
which I do think he will it's most
likely<00:02:50.580> just<00:02:51.000> going<00:02:51.240> to<00:02:51.420> be<00:02:51.570> against<00:02:52.020> someone

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
likely just going to be against someone

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.870 
likely just going to be against someone
like<00:02:54.020> John<00:02:55.020> Cena<00:02:55.500> Randy<00:02:55.800> Orton<00:02:56.280> no<00:02:56.520> Roman

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
like John Cena Randy Orton no Roman

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.800 
like John Cena Randy Orton no Roman
reigns<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.750> know<00:02:57.870> just<00:02:58.200> um<00:02:58.500> maybe<00:02:59.630> give<00:03:00.630> them

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
reigns you know just um maybe give them

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.740 
reigns you know just um maybe give them
the<00:03:01.020> rub<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.860> know<00:03:01.980> by<00:03:02.540> protecting<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.570> match

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
the rub you know by protecting a match

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.810 
the rub you know by protecting a match
with<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.020> legend<00:03:04.500> but<00:03:05.130> yeah<00:03:05.310> that's<00:03:05.580> pretty

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
with the legend but yeah that's pretty

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.850 
with the legend but yeah that's pretty
much<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:07.700> only<00:03:08.700> thing<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:10.260> could<00:03:10.470> see

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
happening if sting were to have a match

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.780
