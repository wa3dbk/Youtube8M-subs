but<00:01:58.260> it<00:01:59.260> was<00:01:59.380> something<00:01:59.500> really<00:01:59.830> meaningful

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
but it was something really meaningful

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.210 
but it was something really meaningful
that<00:02:00.729> I<00:02:00.820> remembered<00:02:01.330> and<00:02:01.570> then<00:02:02.170> I<00:02:02.259> just<00:02:02.410> got

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
that I remembered and then I just got

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.350 
that I remembered and then I just got
addicted<00:02:03.759> to<00:02:03.970> it<00:02:04.060> so<00:02:05.020> I<00:02:05.050> bought<00:02:05.259> this<00:02:05.560> hoodie

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
addicted to it so I bought this hoodie

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.820 
addicted to it so I bought this hoodie
for<00:02:07.360> Tupac<00:02:07.690> not<00:02:08.350> like<00:02:08.470> for<00:02:08.740> Tupac<00:02:09.070> but<00:02:09.310> like
