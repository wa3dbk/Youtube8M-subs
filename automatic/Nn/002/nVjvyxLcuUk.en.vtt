00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
a small little Christmas bow or maybe

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.559 
a small little Christmas bow or maybe
just<00:02:08.700> some<00:02:08.970> red<00:02:09.179> ribbon<00:02:09.450> tied<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.259> knot

just some red ribbon tied in a knot

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.270 
just some red ribbon tied in a knot
so<00:02:10.749> that<00:02:10.899> it<00:02:11.049> isn't<00:02:11.200> so<00:02:11.409> obvious<00:02:11.980> that<00:02:12.010> they

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
so that it isn't so obvious that they

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.550 
so that it isn't so obvious that they
have<00:02:12.459> a<00:02:12.489> kick<00:02:12.790> or<00:02:12.939> horse<00:02:13.180> sometimes<00:02:14.109> people

are<00:02:14.680> embarrassed<00:02:14.980> by<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:15.459> I<00:02:15.909> think<00:02:16.659> that's<00:02:16.810> a

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
are embarrassed by that I think that's a

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.080 
are embarrassed by that I think that's a
tragedy<00:02:17.349> actually<00:02:17.829> because<00:02:18.159> maybe<00:02:18.579> they<00:02:18.819> just

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
tragedy actually because maybe they just

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.030 
tragedy actually because maybe they just
can't<00:02:19.299> help<00:02:19.480> their<00:02:19.719> horse<00:02:19.900> kicking<00:02:20.200> maybe

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
can't help their horse kicking maybe

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.369 
can't help their horse kicking maybe
their<00:02:21.219> horse<00:02:21.430> has<00:02:21.609> psychological<00:02:22.450> problems

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
their horse has psychological problems

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:24.599 
their horse has psychological problems
and<00:02:23.560> they<00:02:23.620> just<00:02:23.859> can't<00:02:24.069> afford<00:02:24.099> to<00:02:24.430> have

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:24.609 
and they just can't afford to have

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.550 
and they just can't afford to have
someone<00:02:24.939> like<00:02:25.180> me<00:02:25.329> fix<00:02:25.629> it<00:02:25.749> or<00:02:25.900> whatever<00:02:26.109> knows

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
someone like me fix it or whatever knows

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.289 
someone like me fix it or whatever knows
I<00:02:26.829> think<00:02:27.069> it's<00:02:27.189> more<00:02:27.400> about<00:02:27.489> safety

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
I think it's more about safety

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.819 
I think it's more about safety
I<00:02:28.329> think<00:02:28.780> safety<00:02:29.019> is<00:02:29.170> more<00:02:29.349> important<00:02:29.769> than

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
I think safety is more important than

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.860 
I think safety is more important than
someone's<00:02:30.280> pride<00:02:30.609> or<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.359> fact<00:02:31.599> that<00:02:31.689> they

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
someone's pride or the fact that they

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.660 
someone's pride or the fact that they
don't<00:02:32.079> want<00:02:32.290> anybody<00:02:32.769> to<00:02:33.099> think<00:02:33.159> they're<00:02:33.519> not

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
don't want anybody to think they're not

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.009 
don't want anybody to think they're not
a<00:02:33.700> good<00:02:33.909> horse<00:02:34.150> owner<00:02:34.389> because<00:02:34.689> that's<00:02:34.870> not

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
a good horse owner because that's not

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.899 
a good horse owner because that's not
the<00:02:35.200> case<00:02:35.409> what<00:02:36.099> you're<00:02:36.250> trying<00:02:36.489> to<00:02:36.579> do<00:02:36.730> is

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
the case what you're trying to do is

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.390 
the case what you're trying to do is
teach<00:02:37.269> people<00:02:37.599> and<00:02:37.989> show<00:02:38.260> people<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:39.189> your

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
teach people and show people that your

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.750 
teach people and show people that your

dangling<00:02:46.629> down<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.669> it<00:02:48.669> should<00:02:48.939> be<00:02:49.120> up<00:02:49.359> high
