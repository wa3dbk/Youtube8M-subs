anyway<00:01:45.979> but<00:01:46.979> i<00:01:47.009> would<00:01:47.220> recommend<00:01:47.700> doing<00:01:47.880> at

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
anyway but i would recommend doing at

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.590 
anyway but i would recommend doing at
least<00:01:48.720> at<00:01:49.020> least<00:01:49.110> 8<00:01:49.680> gigabytes<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.490> ram<00:01:50.729> with

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
least at least 8 gigabytes of ram with

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.010 
least at least 8 gigabytes of ram with
windows<00:01:52.140> seven<00:01:52.799> media<00:01:52.950> center<00:01:53.570> also<00:01:54.570> i<00:01:54.780> would

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
windows seven media center also i would

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.819 
windows seven media center also i would
recommend<00:01:55.439> doing<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:56.899> at<00:01:57.899> least<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.380> dual<00:01:58.530> core

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
recommend doing the at least a dual core

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.709 
recommend doing the at least a dual core
processor<00:01:58.860> but<00:01:59.700> if<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.939> can<00:02:00.060> get<00:02:00.210> like<00:02:00.329> an<00:02:00.509> eye

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
processor but if you can get like an eye

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.899 
processor but if you can get like an eye
processor<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.649> intel<00:02:02.009> i<00:02:02.070> processor<00:02:02.759> that

processor and intel i processor that

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.639 
processor and intel i processor that
would<00:02:03.060> be<00:02:03.149> great<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.570> really<00:02:03.869> does<00:02:04.079> tax<00:02:04.439> the

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
would be great it really does tax the

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.959 
would be great it really does tax the
system<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.159> you're<00:02:05.369> going<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.520> see<00:02:05.729> major

my my video processing in my unit is

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.430 
my my video processing in my unit is
just<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.030> standard<00:02:13.360> until<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:14.050> video

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
just the standard until a video

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.990 
just the standard until a video

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
onboard hdmi so I don't think it's

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.520 
onboard hdmi so I don't think it's
really<00:02:19.450> necessary<00:02:19.569> because<00:02:20.080> it's<00:02:20.379> not

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
really necessary because it's not

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.059 
really necessary because it's not

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519

like that it's really just displaying

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.140

going<00:02:28.959> to<00:02:29.019> end<00:02:29.110> up<00:02:29.140> using<00:02:29.380> is<00:02:30.150> compressed

going to end up using is compressed

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.729 
going to end up using is compressed
enough<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.569> the<00:02:31.660> point<00:02:31.690> that<00:02:31.989> it's<00:02:32.230> not<00:02:32.440> you

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
enough to the point that it's not you

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.559 
enough to the point that it's not you
know<00:02:33.340> it's<00:02:33.459> not<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.120> big<00:02:34.330> deal<00:02:34.360> anyway<00:02:35.319> so

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
know it's not a big deal anyway so

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.550 
know it's not a big deal anyway so
that's<00:02:37.569> the<00:02:37.780> equipment<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.200> you're<00:02:38.380> going

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
that's the equipment that you're going

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.930 
that's the equipment that you're going
to<00:02:38.620> need<00:02:38.799> of<00:02:39.010> course<00:02:39.370> you're<00:02:39.549> going<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.760> need<00:02:39.910> a

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
to need of course you're going to need a

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.190 
to need of course you're going to need a
TV<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:41.080> receives<00:02:41.500> your<00:02:41.680> HDMI<00:02:42.959> other<00:02:43.959> than

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
TV that receives your HDMI other than

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.570 
TV that receives your HDMI other than
that<00:02:44.319> that<00:02:44.890> should<00:02:45.010> be<00:02:45.069> everything<00:02:45.160> you<00:02:45.400> need

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
that that should be everything you need

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.800 
that that should be everything you need
so<00:02:45.849> this<00:02:46.000> is<00:02:46.150> how<00:02:46.269> you're<00:02:46.450> going<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.630> set<00:02:46.780> it

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
so this is how you're going to set it

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.160 
so this is how you're going to set it
all<00:02:46.959> up<00:02:47.700> you're<00:02:48.700> going<00:02:48.819> to<00:02:48.880> go<00:02:49.000> ahead<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.450> take

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
all up you're going to go ahead and take

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.530 
all up you're going to go ahead and take
your<00:02:50.200> antenna<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.310> you're<00:02:52.239> going<00:02:52.329> to<00:02:52.390> mount

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
your antenna and you're going to mount

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.240 
your antenna and you're going to mount
it<00:02:52.720> on<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.870> roof<00:02:52.989> of<00:02:53.110> your<00:02:53.140> house<00:02:53.349> and<00:02:53.709> before

it on the roof of your house and before

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.039 
it on the roof of your house and before
you<00:02:54.459> go<00:02:54.670> up<00:02:54.790> there<00:02:54.940> you're<00:02:55.239> going<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.720> get<00:02:55.989> a

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
you go up there you're going to get a

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.289 
you go up there you're going to get a
reference<00:02:56.260> from<00:02:56.560> aunt<00:02:56.920> Anna<00:02:57.190> web<00:02:57.430> org<00:02:57.940> and

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
antenna from my house I had to aim my

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.410 
antenna from my house I had to aim my
antenna<00:03:04.900> at<00:03:05.049> 205<00:03:05.650> degrees<00:03:06.099> southwest<00:03:06.430> so

antenna at 205 degrees southwest so

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.550 
antenna at 205 degrees southwest so
you're<00:03:07.630> going<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:07.780> go<00:03:07.870> up<00:03:08.019> on<00:03:08.200> top<00:03:08.349> of<00:03:08.470> your

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
you're going to go up on top of your

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.589 
you're going to go up on top of your
roof<00:03:08.709> with<00:03:08.980> your<00:03:09.130> compass<00:03:09.489> and<00:03:09.670> you're<00:03:10.360> going

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
roof with your compass and you're going

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.280 
roof with your compass and you're going
to<00:03:10.720> position<00:03:11.470> your<00:03:11.650> antenna<00:03:12.040> properly<00:03:12.549> and

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
to position your antenna properly and

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.270 
to position your antenna properly and
you're<00:03:14.290> going<00:03:14.500> to<00:03:14.560> mount<00:03:14.709> it<00:03:14.889> so<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:15.190> it

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
you're going to mount it so that it

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.059 
you're going to mount it so that it
doesn't<00:03:15.459> wiggle<00:03:16.350> when<00:03:17.350> you've<00:03:17.500> aimed<00:03:17.829> your

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
doesn't wiggle when you've aimed your

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.830 
doesn't wiggle when you've aimed your
your<00:03:18.489> directional<00:03:18.970> antenna<00:03:19.090> like<00:03:19.510> that<00:03:19.690> it's

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
your directional antenna like that it's

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.240 
your directional antenna like that it's
going<00:03:19.989> to<00:03:20.049> receive<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.560> signal<00:03:20.950> directly

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
going to receive the signal directly

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.890 
going to receive the signal directly
from<00:03:21.549> the<00:03:21.730> tower<00:03:21.910> that<00:03:22.150> you're<00:03:22.299> pointing<00:03:22.750> at

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
from the tower that you're pointing at

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.720 
from the tower that you're pointing at
but<00:03:23.620> it's<00:03:23.739> not<00:03:23.889> going<00:03:24.100> to<00:03:24.220> receive<00:03:24.489> all<00:03:24.700> the

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
but it's not going to receive all the

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.729 
but it's not going to receive all the
ambient<00:03:25.329> crap<00:03:25.630> that's<00:03:25.900> outside<00:03:26.260> of<00:03:26.440> that<00:03:26.530> so

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
ambient crap that's outside of that so

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.300 
ambient crap that's outside of that so
you're<00:03:26.889> going<00:03:26.980> to<00:03:27.069> get<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.250> nice<00:03:27.430> clean<00:03:27.670> signal

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
you're going to get a nice clean signal

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.759 
you're going to get a nice clean signal
after<00:03:30.310> you've<00:03:30.459> mounted<00:03:30.790> your<00:03:31.120> antenna<00:03:31.769> you're

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
after you've mounted your antenna you're

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.289 
after you've mounted your antenna you're
going<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:32.980> give<00:03:33.340> yourself<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.790> couple<00:03:34.090> feet<00:03:34.269> of

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
going to give yourself a couple feet of

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.289 
going to give yourself a couple feet of
coax<00:03:34.600> coming<00:03:35.079> off<00:03:35.230> of<00:03:35.260> it<00:03:35.500> maybe<00:03:35.970> two<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.120> five

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
coax coming off of it maybe two to five

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.390 
coax coming off of it maybe two to five
feet<00:03:37.540> of<00:03:37.690> coax<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:38.230> then<00:03:39.010> you're<00:03:39.160> going<00:03:39.310> to

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
feet of coax and then you're going to

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.879 
feet of coax and then you're going to
put<00:03:39.579> your<00:03:39.609> inline<00:03:40.060> amplifier<00:03:40.720> you<00:03:41.260> don't<00:03:41.530> want

to put an amplifier down there because
what's<00:03:50.680> going<00:03:50.889> to<00:03:50.980> happen<00:03:51.340> is<00:03:51.519> you're<00:03:51.730> going

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
what's going to happen is you're going

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.259 
what's going to happen is you're going
to<00:03:52.000> be<00:03:52.470> amplifying<00:03:53.470> a<00:03:53.709> crappy<00:03:54.220> signal<00:03:54.430> you

to be amplifying a crappy signal you

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.920 
to be amplifying a crappy signal you

cannot fix a broken TV signal however
you<00:03:59.410> can<00:03:59.440> amplify<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.250> good<00:04:00.579> one<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:01.090> then<00:04:01.810> it

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
you can amplify a good one and then it

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.699 
you can amplify a good one and then it
will<00:04:02.380> degrade<00:04:02.859> down<00:04:03.220> to<00:04:03.459> a<00:04:03.489> decent<00:04:04.030> signal<00:04:04.709> how
