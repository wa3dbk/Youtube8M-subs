00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
knowledge to us and there's a lot of

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.620 
knowledge to us and there's a lot of
very<00:02:29.920> good<00:02:30.040> scholarship<00:02:30.880> that's<00:02:31.030> proving

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
very good scholarship that's proving

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.510 
very good scholarship that's proving
that<00:02:32.170> there<00:02:32.350> has<00:02:32.590> been<00:02:32.800> some<00:02:33.070> sort<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.400> a

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
life-forms from out there well I think

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.090 
life-forms from out there well I think
it<00:02:37.690> could<00:02:37.810> be<00:02:37.840> proven<00:02:38.380> yes<00:02:38.530> but<00:02:38.770> how<00:02:39.040> would

it could be proven yes but how would

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.150 
it could be proven yes but how would

know what it looks like is we're right

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.020 
know what it looks like is we're right
at<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:28.510> threshold<00:03:28.750> of<00:03:29.440> realizing<00:03:30.310> that<00:03:30.820> we

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
at the threshold of realizing that we

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.830 
at the threshold of realizing that we

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
may be right here of this planet even

may be right here of this planet even
things<00:03:39.850> that<00:03:40.060> live<00:03:40.270> here<00:03:40.300> that<00:03:40.900> have<00:03:41.020> lived

how<00:03:43.600> does<00:03:43.660> it<00:03:43.840> fit<00:03:44.020> in<00:03:44.170> it's<00:03:45.040> problematic<00:03:45.870> if

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
how does it fit in it's problematic if

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.720 
how does it fit in it's problematic if
you<00:03:47.200> look<00:03:47.560> at<00:03:47.830> the<00:03:49.230> spread<00:03:50.230> of<00:03:50.520> opinion<00:03:51.520> about

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
you look at the spread of opinion about

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.420 
you look at the spread of opinion about
the<00:03:52.150> New<00:03:52.540> World<00:03:52.570> Order<00:03:53.170> there's<00:03:53.950> you<00:03:54.190> could

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
the New World Order there's you could

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.720 
the New World Order there's you could
say<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:55.200> politically<00:03:56.200> correct<00:03:56.380> view<00:03:56.980> held<00:03:57.610> by

say the politically correct view held by

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.180 
say the politically correct view held by
people<00:03:57.910> like<00:03:58.360> say<00:03:58.630> Henry<00:03:59.080> Kissinger<00:03:59.500> on<00:04:00.070> the

spread out from there that get more and

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.150 
spread out from there that get more and

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
example to apocalyptic Christianity and

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.690 
example to apocalyptic Christianity and
so<00:04:14.050> forth<00:04:14.440> now<00:04:14.860> I<00:04:15.100> I<00:04:15.610> have<00:04:16.090> decided<00:04:16.870> that<00:04:17.290> I<00:04:17.950> can

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
so forth now I I have decided that I can

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.120 
so forth now I I have decided that I can
only<00:04:18.880> speak<00:04:19.330> to<00:04:19.600> the<00:04:19.840> range<00:04:20.140> of<00:04:20.500> opinion<00:04:20.950> and

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
only speak to the range of opinion and

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.400 
only speak to the range of opinion and
cannot<00:04:21.520> this<00:04:21.940> and<00:04:22.240> cannot<00:04:22.480> say<00:04:22.720> right<00:04:23.170> there

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
cannot this and cannot say right there

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.200 
cannot this and cannot say right there
that<00:04:23.590> part<00:04:23.890> that's<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.400> right<00:04:24.580> part<00:04:24.970> right

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
that part that's the right part right

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.970 
that part that's the right part right
there<00:04:25.270> I<00:04:25.540> can't<00:04:25.930> do<00:04:26.080> that<00:04:26.290> and<00:04:26.620> I<00:04:26.800> don't<00:04:26.860> think

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
there I can't do that and I don't think

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.830 
there I can't do that and I don't think
it's<00:04:27.160> fair<00:04:27.400> to<00:04:27.430> do<00:04:27.640> that<00:04:27.820> because<00:04:28.090> we<00:04:28.420> have<00:04:28.630> a

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
it's fair to do that because we have a

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.160 
it's fair to do that because we have a
great<00:04:29.470> many<00:04:29.770> different<00:04:30.040> people<00:04:31.030> helping<00:04:31.990> us

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
great many different people helping us

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.830

paint<00:04:32.470> a<00:04:32.620> very<00:04:32.800> complex<00:04:33.340> picture<00:04:33.880> here<00:04:34.180> but

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
paint a very complex picture here but

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.040 
paint a very complex picture here but
generally<00:04:35.760> we're<00:04:36.760> faced<00:04:37.000> with

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
generally we're faced with

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.100 
generally we're faced with
two<00:04:38.379> are<00:04:38.979> a<00:04:39.039> number<00:04:39.460> of<00:04:39.580> different<00:04:39.909> problems

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
two are a number of different problems

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.570 
two are a number of different problems
problem<00:04:41.110> number<00:04:41.259> one<00:04:42.509> are<00:04:43.509> we<00:04:43.930> actually<00:04:44.590> in

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
problem number one are we actually in

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.779 
problem number one are we actually in
control<00:04:46.180> of<00:04:46.360> this<00:04:46.479> planet<00:04:46.930> or<00:04:47.110> not<00:04:47.490> alright

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
control of this planet or not alright

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.469 
control of this planet or not alright
and<00:04:49.210> I<00:04:49.810> believe<00:04:50.139> that<00:04:50.169> as<00:04:50.680> far<00:04:51.099> as<00:04:51.129> we

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
and I believe that as far as we

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
people of this planet that may turn out

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.170 
people of this planet that may turn out
to<00:04:55.750> be<00:04:55.870> the<00:04:56.169> fundamental<00:04:56.879> challenging<00:04:57.879> issue

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
to be the fundamental challenging issue

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.249 
to be the fundamental challenging issue
of<00:04:58.569> our<00:04:58.720> time

00:04:59.249 --> 00:04:59.259 
of our time
