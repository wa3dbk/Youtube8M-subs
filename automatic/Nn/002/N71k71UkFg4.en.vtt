00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.000 
hopeless they had so many options so
many<00:02:15.940> plays<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:16.600> now<00:02:17.290> I've<00:02:17.590> actually<00:02:17.800> been

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
many plays and now I've actually been

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.860

using them online recently and I've

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.270 
using them online recently and I've
found<00:02:20.110> them<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.500> just<00:02:20.680> be<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.860> bit

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
found them to just be a bit

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.160 
found them to just be a bit
underwhelming<00:02:22.000> I'm<00:02:22.510> starting<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:22.870> see<00:02:23.020> that

big what it just felt like it was kind
of<00:03:05.230> just<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.910> wasn't<00:03:07.240> it<00:03:07.480> was<00:03:07.630> just<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.840> really

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
of just it wasn't it was just a really

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.600 
of just it wasn't it was just a really
uphill<00:03:08.680> battle<00:03:09.010> if<00:03:09.070> you<00:03:09.190> weren't<00:03:09.460> actually

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
uphill battle if you weren't actually

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.400 
uphill battle if you weren't actually
like<00:03:09.940> using<00:03:10.510> them<00:03:10.720> doing<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.320> mere<00:03:11.560> match<00:03:12.990> now<00:03:13.990> I

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
like using them doing a mere match now I

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.350 
like using them doing a mere match now I
mean<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:14.890> know<00:03:14.950> Morel<00:03:15.310> takes<00:03:15.550> up<00:03:15.670> one<00:03:15.880> but<00:03:16.150> even

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
mean I know Morel takes up one but even

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.520 
mean I know Morel takes up one but even
before<00:03:16.480> Morel<00:03:16.840> took<00:03:16.870> went<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:17.230> one<00:03:17.380> it<00:03:17.500> just

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
before Morel took went to one it just

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.350 
before Morel took went to one it just
felt<00:03:17.800> like<00:03:17.830> hat<00:03:18.190> all<00:03:18.520> of<00:03:18.670> a<00:03:18.730> sudden<00:03:19.000> was<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.150> lot

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
felt like hat all of a sudden was a lot

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.720 
felt like hat all of a sudden was a lot
easier<00:03:19.600> to<00:03:19.990> beat<00:03:20.230> once<00:03:20.620> duel<00:03:21.130> Alliance<00:03:21.580> came

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
easier to beat once duel Alliance came

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.370 
easier to beat once duel Alliance came
out<00:03:21.850> even<00:03:22.150> if<00:03:22.210> you<00:03:22.360> weren't<00:03:22.720> actually<00:03:22.900> using

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
out even if you weren't actually using

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.930 
out even if you weren't actually using
one<00:03:23.530> of<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.680> big<00:03:23.890> deck<00:03:24.100> symbols<00:03:24.490> Alliance

one of the big deck symbols Alliance

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.820 
one of the big deck symbols Alliance
even<00:03:25.150> if<00:03:25.240> you<00:03:25.330> were<00:03:25.450> just<00:03:25.600> using<00:03:25.830> something

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
even if you were just using something

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:27.630 
even if you were just using something
like<00:03:27.010> you<00:03:27.310> know

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
like you know

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
felt like something they weren't really

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.920 
felt like something they weren't really
is<00:03:34.900> bad<00:03:35.260> sang<00:03:35.770> those<00:03:35.950> from<00:03:36.130> a<00:03:36.220> Dulce<00:03:36.670> who<00:03:37.480> never

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
suddenly got oh we're on the roaming

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.360 
suddenly got oh we're on the roaming
maybe<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.270> bet<00:03:43.420> is<00:03:43.720> a<00:03:43.750> mental<00:03:44.410> thing<00:03:44.440> maybe<00:03:44.980> it

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
maybe the bet is a mental thing maybe it

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.450 
maybe the bet is a mental thing maybe it
is<00:03:45.670> true<00:03:46.090> that<00:03:46.120> you<00:03:46.750> know<00:03:47.190> it's<00:03:48.190> something

is true that you know it's something

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.200 
is true that you know it's something
that's<00:03:48.640> just<00:03:48.970> kind<00:03:49.120> of<00:03:49.240> a<00:03:50.190> mental<00:03:51.190> block<00:03:51.910> that

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
that's just kind of a mental block that

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.640 
that's just kind of a mental block that
we<00:03:52.330> have<00:03:52.510> against<00:03:52.780> these<00:03:52.960> decks<00:03:53.230> because<00:03:53.500> in

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
we have against these decks because in

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.890 
we have against these decks because in
reality<00:03:53.800> all<00:03:54.430> of<00:03:54.640> these<00:03:54.790> decks<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.330> lot<00:03:55.600> of<00:03:55.720> top

reality all of these decks a lot of top

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.410 
reality all of these decks a lot of top
decks<00:03:56.140> do<00:03:56.470> have<00:03:56.740> weaknesses<00:03:57.280> I've<00:03:57.820> even<00:03:58.240> seen

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
decks do have weaknesses I've even seen

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.470 
decks do have weaknesses I've even seen
them<00:03:58.480> in<00:03:58.840> decks<00:03:59.230> like<00:03:59.410> burning<00:03:59.860> abyss

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480

a lot of traps and maybe only run like a

copies they're volatile they can kill
you<00:04:10.720> you<00:04:11.200> know<00:04:11.320> really<00:04:11.620> randomly<00:04:12.160> but<00:04:12.790> they

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
you you know really randomly but they

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.160 
you you know really randomly but they
can<00:04:13.120> also<00:04:13.270> fall<00:04:13.690> victim<00:04:14.170> to<00:04:15.750> their<00:04:16.750> own<00:04:16.930> little

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
can also fall victim to their own little

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.710 
can also fall victim to their own little
sort<00:04:17.440> of<00:04:17.470> subsets<00:04:17.950> of<00:04:17.980> problems<00:04:18.520> when<00:04:19.330> you<00:04:19.479> get

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
sort of subsets of problems when you get

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.999 
sort of subsets of problems when you get
out<00:04:19.840> certain<00:04:20.169> monsters

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:21.009 
out certain monsters

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:24.879 
out certain monsters
like<00:04:22.419> Yazzie<00:04:23.419> for<00:04:23.990> example<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:24.740> just

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
like Yazzie for example and you just

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.860 
like Yazzie for example and you just
summon<00:04:25.250> it<00:04:25.340> and<00:04:25.520> into<00:04:25.729> 26<00:04:26.240> and<00:04:26.479> can't<00:04:26.720> be

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
summon it and into 26 and can't be

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.600 
summon it and into 26 and can't be
targeted<00:04:27.319> so<00:04:27.350> it<00:04:27.620> can't<00:04:27.830> be<00:04:27.979> like<00:04:28.130> vanished<00:04:28.490> by

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
targeted so it can't be like vanished by

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.240 
targeted so it can't be like vanished by
farfa<00:04:29.120> and<00:04:29.500> virgil<00:04:30.500> can't<00:04:30.830> really<00:04:31.039> do

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
farfa and virgil can't really do

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.089 
farfa and virgil can't really do
anything<00:04:31.430> about<00:04:31.550> it<00:04:31.789> it<00:04:32.449> can<00:04:32.750> really<00:04:32.830> start<00:04:33.830> to

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:34.099 
anything about it it can really start to

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:39.969 
anything about it it can really start to
just<00:04:37.479> you<00:04:38.479> start<00:04:38.750> to<00:04:38.840> see<00:04:39.050> where<00:04:39.410> brain<00:04:39.710> Abyss

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
just you start to see where brain Abyss

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.830 
just you start to see where brain Abyss
can<00:04:40.250> have<00:04:40.460> some<00:04:40.639> struggles<00:04:40.910> and<00:04:41.270> they<00:04:41.389> do<00:04:41.449> have

be exposed as monsters with effects that

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.900 
be exposed as monsters with effects that

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
aren't all that meaningful I know part

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.520 
aren't all that meaningful I know part
of<00:04:59.000> it<00:04:59.120> has<00:04:59.240> to<00:04:59.270> do<00:04:59.479> with<00:04:59.750> the<00:04:59.990> power<00:05:00.139> creep

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
of it has to do with the power creep

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.350 
of it has to do with the power creep
part<00:05:00.740> of<00:05:00.830> it<00:05:00.919> is<00:05:01.099> just<00:05:01.130> the<00:05:01.280> fact<00:05:01.550> that<00:05:01.639> these

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
part of it is just the fact that these

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.150 
part of it is just the fact that these
new<00:05:02.419> cards<00:05:02.900> come<00:05:03.410> out<00:05:03.440> and<00:05:04.060> they<00:05:05.530> aren't<00:05:06.530> as

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
new cards come out and they aren't as

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.990 
new cards come out and they aren't as
good<00:05:07.970> I'm<00:05:08.630> a<00:05:08.990> good<00:05:09.139> example<00:05:09.699> those<00:05:10.699> videos

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
good I'm a good example those videos

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.399 
good I'm a good example those videos
kind<00:05:11.210> just<00:05:11.360> going<00:05:11.570> everywhere<00:05:11.690> but<00:05:12.139> a<00:05:12.169> good

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:12.409 
kind just going everywhere but a good

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:14.110 
kind just going everywhere but a good
example<00:05:12.710> is<00:05:12.949> actually<00:05:13.130> she<00:05:13.580> dolls

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
example is actually she dolls

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.180 
example is actually she dolls
um<00:05:14.539> which<00:05:14.930> a<00:05:15.020> lot<00:05:15.139> of<00:05:15.199> people<00:05:15.380> are<00:05:15.500> saying<00:05:15.770> just

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
um which a lot of people are saying just

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.879 
um which a lot of people are saying just
our<00:05:16.370> game<00:05:16.580> crept<00:05:16.849> out<00:05:17.030> and<00:05:17.440> they're<00:05:18.440> kind<00:05:18.830> of

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
our game crept out and they're kind of

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:20.770 
our game crept out and they're kind of
the<00:05:19.220> least<00:05:19.460> popular<00:05:20.120> deck<00:05:20.330> and<00:05:20.539> they<00:05:20.630> just

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
the least popular deck and they just

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.600 
the least popular deck and they just
they<00:05:21.050> can't<00:05:21.259> keep<00:05:21.409> up<00:05:21.650> now<00:05:22.190> this<00:05:22.340> is<00:05:22.400> an

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
they can't keep up now this is an

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.490 
they can't keep up now this is an
interesting<00:05:22.729> thought<00:05:23.060> to<00:05:23.240> me<00:05:23.389> I<00:05:23.630> disagree

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
interesting thought to me I disagree

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.450 
interesting thought to me I disagree
with<00:05:24.560> the<00:05:24.710> fact<00:05:24.860> that<00:05:25.070> they're<00:05:25.430> just

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
with the fact that they're just

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.570 
with the fact that they're just
arbitrarily<00:05:26.210> not<00:05:27.050> as<00:05:27.320> good<00:05:27.620> I<00:05:27.919> think<00:05:28.190> that's<00:05:28.460> a

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
arbitrarily not as good I think that's a

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.339 
arbitrarily not as good I think that's a
player<00:05:29.150> thing<00:05:29.570> where<00:05:29.720> players<00:05:29.930> just<00:05:30.139> kind<00:05:30.320> of

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:30.349 
player thing where players just kind of

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:31.899 
player thing where players just kind of
want<00:05:30.650> to<00:05:30.740> say<00:05:31.009> that<00:05:31.310> oh<00:05:31.460> you<00:05:31.610> should<00:05:31.759> all

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:31.909 
want to say that oh you should all

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:33.550 
want to say that oh you should all
aren't<00:05:32.120> good<00:05:32.300> anymore<00:05:32.389> maybe<00:05:33.169> just<00:05:33.409> in<00:05:33.500> the

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
aren't good anymore maybe just in the

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.409 
aren't good anymore maybe just in the
hope<00:05:33.770> that<00:05:33.800> people<00:05:34.099> won't<00:05:34.340> play<00:05:34.639> them<00:05:34.849> I<00:05:35.060> don't

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
hope that people won't play them I don't

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:37.270 
hope that people won't play them I don't
because<00:05:35.750> you<00:05:35.840> also<00:05:36.020> have<00:05:36.110> lost<00:05:36.590> anything<00:05:36.949> and

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
all fusions they're just as scary and

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.420 
all fusions they're just as scary and
just<00:05:46.550> as<00:05:46.699> threatening<00:05:47.270> as<00:05:47.539> before<00:05:47.900> but<00:05:48.860> it

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
just as threatening as before but it

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.730 
just as threatening as before but it
just<00:05:49.849> goes<00:05:50.090> to<00:05:50.210> show<00:05:50.240> that<00:05:50.449> like<00:05:51.020> when<00:05:51.289> players

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
just goes to show that like when players

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.089 
just goes to show that like when players
think<00:05:52.430> that<00:05:52.669> deck<00:05:52.969> can't<00:05:53.270> compete<00:05:53.810> a<00:05:54.169> deck

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
isn't really as good as it once was and

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.189

as<00:06:18.530> I'm<00:06:18.800> playing<00:06:19.099> with<00:06:19.849> that<00:06:20.030> mindset<00:06:20.570> I'm

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 
as I'm playing with that mindset I'm

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:22.959

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
easier I'm able to wear them out and run

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.320 
easier I'm able to wear them out and run
them<00:06:25.639> low<00:06:25.789> in<00:06:25.909> advantage<00:06:26.449> and

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
them low in advantage and

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.980 
them low in advantage and
just<00:06:27.720> kind<00:06:27.960> of<00:06:28.220> sweep<00:06:29.220> it<00:06:29.430> it's<00:06:30.240> weird

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
just kind of sweep it it's weird
