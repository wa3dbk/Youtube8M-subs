00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hello and welcome like that and me 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.830
 I'm finally back I know 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.450
 I've been waiting a long time and so have I. 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.250
 i have dsl connection and as 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.929
 First of all, I would like to have one 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.429
 Provide a little bit of clarity if you 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.049
 you should have asked where you were 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.940
 because he also commented here and 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.379
 I have uploaded nothing uploaded 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.760
 had fun again and had 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.109
 limited data limit that is 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.609
 I could not upload 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.960
 Meanwhile I have the dsl again 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.029
 connection and can videos again 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.289
 produce and upload and was today 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.939
 actually have a video planned that 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.619
 I discarded that is already high 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.210
 been charged that ever be 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.949
 Now it was down in the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.680
 principle why who is the winner of the 3 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.120
 playstation 4 or the xbox by and for 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.950
 I was that the playstation 4 off 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.210
 different reasons but hear yourself 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.440
 let's just take a look at it now 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.090
 from the video I'm up front again 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.710
 deleted here again a small one 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.690
 excerpt in the water, however 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.010
 bad thing is the online forced one 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.370
 Great thing I'm mostly online 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.809
 but what about playing that you own 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.399
 I was pretty pissed off and has 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.870
 after I uploaded the video 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.270
 I then read at the same time 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.520
 moment microsoft had something 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.719
 changed and you can now 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.129
 read up 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:08.400
 on the official xbox com page 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.650
 Comment by don mattrick president of 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.049
 interactive entertainment business at 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.320
 Microsoft and the has an update 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.880
 this is beside me right now 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.799
 Quote literally on the internet connection 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.610
 will not be required to play off line 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.400
 xbox from games and also says the trade 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.189
 inland received an trend disk based 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.659
 games just like you today what you as 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.979
 big revolution sold over 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.240
 sit down all the time you can 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.759
 used games on and on 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.950
 lend without having one that he still 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.810
 something must buy more online and 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.430
 offline game also play offline without 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.070
 to be online all the time 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.079
 So there is no 24 hours connection 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.759
 so that he comes every 24 hours with you 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.180
 the internet connect bistum play 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.920
 can 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.829
 that was canceled because of the 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.439
 Growing criticism and the title we 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.350
 have the power he was after 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.969
 the one who makes my fans the fans 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.640
 her or by the way also in the cool channel 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.259
 has link in the video description something 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.840
 He criticizes me for making the finals 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.060
 naked man hey my title would be out 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.520
 many respects I bullshit I read 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.540
 that request now before it 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.319
 Do not know that we certainly do 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.870
 then also see that 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.239
 video what he means to what I mean 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.159
 Wanted to say they have the power 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.139
 of course, microsoft is turning back 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.670
 did not happen just because we all 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.620
 have pissed off and he is told 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.290
 total shit no it is of course about 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.060
 There was not enough money 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.500
 Pre-orders for the xbox of strong 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.290
 behind the expectations of microsoft 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.480
 lagged behind and the wave of criticism 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.159
 was already devastating, however 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.650
 Interested for the first time often relatively 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:42.060
 little if we despite this criticism 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.189
 bought a console 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.439
 but as I said microsoft is running danger 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:47.819
 lose the consoles and fight 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:51.150
 that's why they had to react 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.069
 that means we already have that 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.900
 But that's the power somewhere 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.370
 not just with criticism of the 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.579
 to justify a console but really 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.590
 simply for commercial reasons because 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.609
 Microsoft runs the risk of this 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.049
 console becomes a flop 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:07.019
 I'll just read that 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.730
 Comment from my case bay macher 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.849
 the rest also in the bias 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.799
 he has produced the following 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.569
 turn around you and many deserve 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.519
 other a healthy competition one 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.590
 alternative and the fact that others 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.790
 consumers are not willing to 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.620
 let fuck in the ass 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.419
 have been hired microsoft was the 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.120
 The legal criticism of god was even with her 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:29.009
 planned there one had just sitting out 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.359
 Microsoft does not expect that sony 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:32.759
 spit turns because she always 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.349
 So somehow sluggish were sony 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:35.849
 created an alternative and the 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.569
 potential buyers are on it 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.060
 jump 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.620
 no wonder no such 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.810
 more powerful 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.129
 previous information after and still 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.959
 100 euros cheaper 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.269
 this is not an alternative that is a 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.590
 rocket launcher in microsofts face there 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.569
 so yes that has yet my 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.949
 signature underneath the microsoft 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.900
 should be ashamed with this concept 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:56.549
 ever on the stage at all 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.530
 to have dared to go to the stage anyway 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.079
 never still for the psv in the 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.819
 should hide dark corner sony has 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.949
 at that time paid the price and with the 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.629
 part of a flop put down in the absence 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:08.040
 However , there were more serious alternatives 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.659
 no such pressure as in both 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.789
 microsoft has in the xbox vonn 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.439
 microsoft did not have to act in it 

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:16.680
 interest of the consumers but with 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:17.789
 interest their sales figures here 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.590
 I put my signature under that 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.280
 is exactly what I mean 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.989
 opinion is 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.659
 microsoft is not like that right now 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.820
 generous and responds to us no it 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:29.310
 is really pure 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.630
 fear of bad sales figures it 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.580
 Just look at the pre-order 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.800
 to throw charts amazon.de hard and 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.990
 software charts playstation 4 space 3 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.650
 xbox from place 51 I think that says 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.630
 everything out 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.980
 consumer for us is the will gutmann 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.960
 but have to wait what in the 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.600
 still bring contention with it 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.310
 Exclusively it will fall because 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.800
 they often predict due to gm 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.090
 new features could be closed 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.840
 come that promises finally again 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.160
 to get exciting 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.530
 this competition is also one of 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.880
 reasons why not wrong in relation 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.710
 not on manufacturers and systems 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.890
 I can understand each one of the 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.350
 competition feels but some must 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.270
 a good lubricant, stock have 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.550
 much the slightly sarcastic comment 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.230
 from fans zero and I have that now 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.090
 simply representative 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.210
 taken for my opinion because I see 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.650
 the whole thing just as there is then 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.030
 today there was no collapse thursday 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.980
 the videos are a little different 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.210
 some as many thanks that he so 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.800

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.070
 thanks for over 4,000 subscribers i find 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.080
 Super 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.710
 Let's be honest for the many 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.180
 thanks to you and if so, too 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.740
 it is glad that the whole is now 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.270
 has changed and that is finally the 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.620
 Videos gives more thumbs up 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.840

 for month june then start the 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.950
 Of course, it will only be relatively short 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.100
 because in july then already the next one 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.480

 I'll do it! 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.690
 comments what do you want pascal and

 where does he need help? 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.780
 Let's write that down in the 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.160
 I may comment on that 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.290
