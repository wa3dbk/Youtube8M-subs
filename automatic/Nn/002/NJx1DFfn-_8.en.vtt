00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
mounted gun on the top now people would

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.320 
mounted gun on the top now people would
have<00:01:16.770> thought<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.100> would<00:01:17.220> look<00:01:17.400> like<00:01:17.520> an<00:01:17.670> ACP

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
have thought this would look like an ACP

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.320 
have thought this would look like an ACP
but<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.170> looks<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.619> an<00:01:19.860> actual<00:01:20.159> modify<00:01:20.640> SUV

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
but it looks like an actual modify SUV

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.870 
but it looks like an actual modify SUV
or<00:01:21.600> truck<00:01:21.659> looks<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.250> reminds<00:01:23.549> me<00:01:23.759> of

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
or truck looks like the it reminds me of

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.179 
or truck looks like the it reminds me of
the<00:01:24.060> kavik<00:01:24.420> late<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.900> new<00:01:25.049> kavik<00:01:25.409> late<00:01:25.590> but<00:01:26.040> it

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
the kavik late the new kavik late but it

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.789 
the kavik late the new kavik late but it
looks<00:01:26.400> more<00:01:26.840> awesomer<00:01:27.840> with<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.170> gun<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.409> top

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
looks more awesomer with the gun on top

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.060 
looks more awesomer with the gun on top
so<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:28.979> have<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.189> new<00:01:29.310> truck<00:01:29.610> with<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:31.070> gun
