00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.310 

one<00:00:01.680> of<00:00:01.829> the<00:00:01.950> things<00:00:02.160> I<00:00:02.370> learned<00:00:03.320> while

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:04.320 
one of the things I learned while

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.610 
one of the things I learned while
tackling<00:00:04.770> this<00:00:05.250> project<00:00:06.029> and<00:00:06.439> doing<00:00:07.439> my

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
tackling this project and doing my

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.249 
tackling this project and doing my
research<00:00:08.160> is<00:00:08.520> that<00:00:08.900> on<00:00:09.900> this<00:00:11.420> break<00:00:12.420> unit<00:00:12.870> here

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
research is that on this break unit here

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.810 
research is that on this break unit here
the<00:00:15.110> they<00:00:16.110> call<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.560> brake<00:00:16.800> control<00:00:17.340> unit

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
the they call it the brake control unit

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:26.290 
the they call it the brake control unit
or<00:00:17.940> whatever<00:00:18.450> it<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:21.170> the<00:00:22.170> motor<00:00:22.500> here<00:00:23.160> that

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:33.310 

spins<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.750> sends<00:00:28.680> various<00:00:31.580> brake<00:00:32.580> pressure

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
spins and sends various brake pressure

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.360 
spins and sends various brake pressure
signals<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.620> each<00:00:34.830> brake<00:00:36.230> tend<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.380> seize<00:00:38.040> up

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
signals to each brake tend to seize up

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.720 
signals to each brake tend to seize up
from<00:00:38.640> time<00:00:38.880> to<00:00:39.120> time<00:00:39.350> so<00:00:40.350> what<00:00:40.830> I've<00:00:40.980> done<00:00:41.250> what

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
from time to time so what I've done what

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.670 
from time to time so what I've done what
I've<00:00:41.880> heard<00:00:42.060> is<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.720> sometimes<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.650> good

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
I've heard is that sometimes it's a good

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.430 
I've heard is that sometimes it's a good
idea<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.490> cycle<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.300> motor<00:00:45.480> once<00:00:45.990> in<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.260> while

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
idea to cycle the motor once in a while

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.569 
idea to cycle the motor once in a while
because<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:47.490> not<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.880> constant<00:00:48.600> use<00:00:49.579> when

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
because it's not in constant use when

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.910 
because it's not in constant use when
you're<00:00:50.730> driving<00:00:51.150> the<00:00:51.270> car<00:00:51.410> unless<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.770> get

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
you're driving the car unless you get

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.970 
you're driving the car unless you get
into<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.360> problematic<00:00:54.360> situation<00:00:54.600> where<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
into a problematic situation where the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.650 
into a problematic situation where the
computer<00:00:56.430> has<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.790> take<00:00:56.970> over<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.630> make

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
computer has to take over and make

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.930 
computer has to take over and make
corrections<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.980> that's<00:00:59.460> what<00:00:59.700> this

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
corrections for you that's what this

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.039 
corrections for you that's what this
unit<00:01:00.390> will<00:01:00.570> do<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.250> motor<00:01:02.550> if<00:01:02.940> you're<00:01:03.840> if

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
unit will do and this motor if you're if

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.430 
unit will do and this motor if you're if
it's<00:01:04.290> not<00:01:04.580> in<00:01:05.580> such<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> state<00:01:06.990> all<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.229> time

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
it's not in such a state all the time

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.340 
it's not in such a state all the time
where<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.890> needs<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.310> be<00:01:08.400> initiated<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.960> you

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
where it needs to be initiated and you

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.040 
where it needs to be initiated and you
need<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:11.190> basically<00:01:11.880> will<00:01:12.150> seize<00:01:12.450> up<00:01:12.690> or<00:01:12.930> now

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
need it basically will seize up or now

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.570 
need it basically will seize up or now
actually<00:01:13.440> not<00:01:13.560> seize<00:01:13.830> up<00:01:14.010> but<00:01:14.190> come<00:01:14.550> up

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
actually not seize up but come up

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.880 
actually not seize up but come up
because<00:01:15.479> there's<00:01:15.720> actually<00:01:15.840> brake<00:01:16.290> fluid<00:01:16.770> in

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
because there's actually brake fluid in

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.010 
because there's actually brake fluid in
here<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.490> spins<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.150> create<00:01:18.420> pressure<00:01:18.720> to

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
here that it spins to create pressure to

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.070 
here that it spins to create pressure to
send<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.650> various<00:01:20.070> wheels<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.150> car<00:01:21.360> via

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
send the various wheels in the car via

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.190 
send the various wheels in the car via
these<00:01:22.650> holes<00:01:23.040> here<00:01:23.610> each<00:01:24.510> one<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.840> these<00:01:24.930> holes

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
these holes here each one of these holes

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.550 
these holes here each one of these holes
go<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.530> each<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:26.370> for<00:01:26.729> them<00:01:26.970> they<00:01:27.270> go<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.560> four

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
go to each is for them they go to four

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.850 
go to each is for them they go to four
of<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.710> brakes<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.990> guys<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:31.530> forum

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
of the brakes so the guys on the forum

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.520 
of the brakes so the guys on the forum
have<00:01:32.280> recommended<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.720> cycle<00:01:34.260> this

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
have recommended that you cycle this

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.600 
have recommended that you cycle this
motor<00:01:34.890> if<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.960> while<00:01:37.830> I'm<00:01:38.070> while<00:01:38.580> I

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
motor if you can and while I'm while I

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.010 
motor if you can and while I'm while I
have<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.000> apart<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.510> will<00:01:39.690> be<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> good

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
have it apart this will be a good

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.870 
have it apart this will be a good
opportunity<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.619> cycle<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.580> what<00:01:41.760> I've

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
opportunity to cycle it so what I've

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.300 
opportunity to cycle it so what I've
done<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.090> I've<00:01:42.479> hooked<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.229> up<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.460> a<00:01:44.460> 12<00:01:45.000> volt

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
done is I've hooked it up to a 12 volt

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.630 
done is I've hooked it up to a 12 volt
battery<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:48.710> basically<00:01:49.710> I'm<00:01:50.010> just<00:01:50.070> going<00:01:50.580> to

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
battery and basically I'm just going to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.450 
battery and basically I'm just going to
apply<00:01:50.760> 12<00:01:51.390> volts<00:01:51.840> directly<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> motor

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
apply 12 volts directly to the motor

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.780 
apply 12 volts directly to the motor
itself<00:01:53.970> not<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.840> electronics<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.130> because

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
itself not the electronics of it because

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.370 
itself not the electronics of it because
I<00:01:56.820> don't<00:01:56.880> want<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.240> fry<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.750> I'm<00:01:58.140> going<00:01:58.320> to

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
I don't want to fry that I'm going to

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:06.710 
I don't want to fry that I'm going to
send<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.950> motor<00:01:59.220> itself<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.740> here<00:02:01.740> goes

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.540 

and<00:02:07.720> see<00:02:07.870> that<00:02:07.900> motor<00:02:08.290> it's<00:02:08.650> functioning<00:02:09.369> it's

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
and see that motor it's functioning it's

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.340 
and see that motor it's functioning it's
spinning<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.410> doing<00:02:11.410> that<00:02:11.560> periodically

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
spinning and doing that periodically

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.260 
spinning and doing that periodically
well<00:02:14.760> ungawa<00:02:15.900> motor<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.320> speak<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:19.060> I've

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
well ungawa motor so to speak so I've

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.090 
well ungawa motor so to speak so I've
done<00:02:19.450> that<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.660> few<00:02:19.720> times<00:02:19.930> already<00:02:20.350> seems<00:02:20.950> to

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
done that a few times already seems to

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.580 
done that a few times already seems to
be<00:02:21.220> fine<00:02:21.520> there<00:02:21.850> so<00:02:22.600> that's<00:02:22.990> just<00:02:23.200> one<00:02:23.470> other

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
be fine there so that's just one other

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.470 
be fine there so that's just one other
thing<00:02:23.710> I<00:02:23.980> wanted<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.280> point<00:02:24.580> out<00:02:24.790> that<00:02:25.000> that

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
thing I wanted to point out that that

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.970 
thing I wanted to point out that that
was<00:02:26.230> useful<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.980> know<00:02:27.280> okay
