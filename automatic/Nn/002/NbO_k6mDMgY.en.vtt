00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.479 
code so what you want the gyro light to
be<00:03:09.849> doing<00:03:10.150> is<00:03:10.420> to<00:03:10.930> go<00:03:11.109> solid<00:03:11.500> red<00:03:11.859> and<00:03:12.160> then

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
be doing is to go solid red and then

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.210 
be doing is to go solid red and then
solid<00:03:12.940> blue<00:03:13.180> your<00:03:14.019> receiver<00:03:14.410> light<00:03:14.709> down<00:03:14.920> here

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
solid blue your receiver light down here

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.240

battery into the chopper and this should
go<00:03:30.819> solid<00:03:31.090> red<00:03:31.450> if<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:31.930> doesn't<00:03:32.410> I'm<00:03:32.590> going<00:03:32.950> to

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
go solid red if it doesn't I'm going to

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.920 
go solid red if it doesn't I'm going to
unplug<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.730> battery<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.269> replug<00:03:34.660> it<00:03:34.810> up
