00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
so okay now this next mode a little bit

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.479 
so okay now this next mode a little bit
tricky<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.010> get<00:03:08.220> into<00:03:09.620> this<00:03:10.620> next<00:03:10.890> mode<00:03:11.160> is<00:03:11.459> a

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
tricky to get into this next mode is a

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:17.150 
tricky to get into this next mode is a
repair<00:03:12.299> of<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.660> mode<00:03:15.350> all<00:03:16.350> these<00:03:16.590> take<00:03:16.980> these

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
repair of a mode all these take these

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.990 
repair of a mode all these take these
pieces<00:03:17.430> off<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:20.420> repair<00:03:21.420> Bay<00:03:22.109> mode<00:03:22.590> now<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.880> do

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
pieces off the repair Bay mode now to do

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.470 
pieces off the repair Bay mode now to do
this<00:03:24.410> what<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:25.560> have<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.769> do<00:03:25.920> is<00:03:26.850> bring<00:03:27.120> his

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
this what you have to do is bring his

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.819 
this what you have to do is bring his
look<00:03:28.549> receptor<00:03:29.549> kick<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:30.019> knew<00:03:31.019> I<00:03:31.049> fit<00:03:31.500> that<00:03:31.709> in

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
look receptor kick I knew I fit that in

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.069 
look receptor kick I knew I fit that in
somewhere<00:03:32.750> these<00:03:33.750> pieces<00:03:34.019> come<00:03:34.380> up<00:03:34.530> this<00:03:34.650> way

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
somewhere these pieces come up this way

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.940 
somewhere these pieces come up this way
like<00:03:37.079> so<00:03:38.720> these<00:03:39.720> pieces<00:03:40.079> here<00:03:40.530> are<00:03:40.680> going<00:03:40.859> to

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
like so these pieces here are going to

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.560 
like so these pieces here are going to
separate<00:03:41.519> and<00:03:41.790> fold<00:03:42.030> down<00:03:42.209> onto<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.870> sides

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
separate and fold down onto the sides

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.490 
separate and fold down onto the sides
the<00:03:45.570> ladder<00:03:45.780> comes<00:03:46.109> forward<00:03:46.470> like<00:03:46.769> so<00:03:48.320> we<00:03:49.320> have

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
the ladder comes forward like so we have

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.400 
the ladder comes forward like so we have
the<00:03:50.100> I'm<00:03:50.940> assuming<00:03:51.420> these<00:03:51.540> are<00:03:51.600> to<00:03:51.930> be<00:03:52.079> his

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
the I'm assuming these are to be his

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.059 
the I'm assuming these are to be his
cannons<00:03:53.340> as<00:03:53.670> water<00:03:53.910> part<00:03:54.390> of<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.540> water<00:03:54.750> cans

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
cannons as water part of the water cans

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.309 
cannons as water part of the water cans
really<00:03:56.069> not<00:03:56.190> sure<00:03:56.220> this<00:03:56.549> is<00:03:56.609> the<00:03:56.730> only<00:03:57.319> part

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
really not sure this is the only part

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.130 
really not sure this is the only part
that<00:03:58.650> these<00:03:59.250> are<00:03:59.790> the

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
that these are the

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.130 
that these are the
mode<00:04:00.560> that<00:04:00.800> these<00:04:01.010> are<00:04:01.130> shown<00:04:01.400> in<00:04:01.960> but<00:04:02.960> these

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
mode that these are shown in but these

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.980 
mode that these are shown in but these
go<00:04:03.380> on<00:04:03.590> they<00:04:04.340> attach<00:04:04.700> here<00:04:05.660> to<00:04:05.840> this<00:04:05.930> little

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
go on they attach here to this little

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:15.250 
go on they attach here to this little
hole<00:04:06.410> a<00:04:10.150> little<00:04:11.150> bit<00:04:11.480> difficult<00:04:11.830> but<00:04:14.140> there<00:04:15.140> we

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
hole a little bit difficult but there we

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.449 
hole a little bit difficult but there we
go<00:04:16.510> and<00:04:17.510> again<00:04:17.840> it<00:04:18.590> tells<00:04:18.829> you<00:04:18.980> to<00:04:19.100> put<00:04:19.280> these

go and again it tells you to put these

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:26.860 
go and again it tells you to put these
little<00:04:19.669> guys<00:04:19.850> in<00:04:25.390> and<00:04:26.390> they're<00:04:26.510> just<00:04:26.600> going<00:04:26.810> to
