00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
tank form i bought from him before and

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.090 
tank form i bought from him before and
he's<00:01:30.810> always<00:01:31.430> done<00:01:32.430> great<00:01:33.680> great<00:01:34.680> shrimps

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
this one is the crystal Reds believe

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.880 
this one is the crystal Reds believe
give<00:01:44.040> me<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> second<00:01:44.460> here<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.790> look<00:01:45.860> yeah<00:01:46.860> I

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
give me a second here and look yeah I

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.590 
give me a second here and look yeah I
think<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.280> these<00:01:47.490> are<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> lot<00:01:47.909> smaller<00:01:48.180> than<00:01:48.479> I

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
think so these are a lot smaller than I

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.560 
think so these are a lot smaller than I
thought<00:01:48.840> they<00:01:49.049> would<00:01:49.079> be<00:01:49.909> but<00:01:50.909> they're<00:01:51.450> all

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
thought they would be but they're all

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.120 
thought they would be but they're all
alive<00:01:51.810> there<00:01:52.200> are<00:01:52.290> just<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.590> lot<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.770> them<00:01:52.950> that

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
alive there are just a lot of them that

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.190 
alive there are just a lot of them that
are<00:01:53.159> running<00:01:53.430> around<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:54.030> still<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:55.049> was

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
are running around so still it was

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.420 
are running around so still it was
pretty<00:01:55.590> good<00:01:56.570> other<00:01:57.570> than<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.840> size<00:01:58.369> this<00:01:59.369> is
