00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.060 
best one of the best killstreaks i think
ever<00:03:17.280> is<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.519> Harrier<00:03:18.030> strike<00:03:18.380> I<00:03:19.380> mean<00:03:19.830> for

seven kills or six kills with hardline

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.050 
seven kills or six kills with hardline
you<00:03:22.890> get<00:03:23.100> an<00:03:23.730> air<00:03:24.420> strike<00:03:24.720> +<00:03:25.080> of<00:03:25.489> harrier<00:03:26.489> like

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
you get an air strike + of harrier like

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.690 
you get an air strike + of harrier like
that's<00:03:27.299> and<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.470> shoots<00:03:28.709> down<00:03:28.920> like

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
that's and and it shoots down like

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.360 
that's and and it shoots down like
chopper<00:03:30.090> gunners<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.709> pave<00:03:31.709> lows<00:03:31.950> I<00:03:32.190> mean

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
chopper gunners and pave lows I mean

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.300 
chopper gunners and pave lows I mean
that<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:34.049> Harrier<00:03:34.500> has<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.860> be<00:03:34.980> probably

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
just all sorts of different ways I

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.920 
just all sorts of different ways I

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
though I've never really tried and I

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.180 
though I've never really tried and I
frankly<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:55.019> think<00:03:55.230> would<00:03:55.440> be<00:03:55.560> too<00:03:55.680> frustrating

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
frankly I think would be too frustrating

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.670 
frankly I think would be too frustrating
with<00:03:56.250> all<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.489> new

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
with all the new

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.800 
with all the new
tubes<00:03:56.920> and<00:03:57.099> stuff<00:03:57.159> if<00:03:57.849> new<00:03:58.209> tubes<00:03:58.450> wasn't<00:03:58.750> in

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
tubes and stuff if new tubes wasn't in

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.209 
tubes and stuff if new tubes wasn't in
the<00:03:58.870> game<00:03:58.989> I<00:03:59.140> would<00:03:59.319> definitely<00:03:59.469> try<00:03:59.799> it<00:03:59.920> but

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:00.219 
the game I would definitely try it but

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:03.449 
the game I would definitely try it but
because<00:04:01.000> of<00:04:01.209> that<00:04:01.450> it's<00:04:02.230> pretty<00:04:02.560> much<00:04:02.680> a<00:04:03.040> no-go

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
because of that it's pretty much a no-go

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.789 
because of that it's pretty much a no-go
