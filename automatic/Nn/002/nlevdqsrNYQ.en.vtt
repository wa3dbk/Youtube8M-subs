to make a fabric eyeglass holder now I

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.930 
to make a fabric eyeglass holder now I
really<00:00:06.480> don't<00:00:07.350> like<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.980> hard<00:00:08.250> ones<00:00:08.580> you<00:00:08.790> get

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
really don't like the hard ones you get

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.089 
really don't like the hard ones you get
for<00:00:09.179> free<00:00:09.450> when<00:00:09.690> you<00:00:09.809> get<00:00:09.960> new<00:00:10.170> glasses<00:00:10.320> we're

really<00:00:11.280> any<00:00:11.519> hardcase<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:12.090> general<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:12.630> think

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
really any hardcase in general I think

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.930 
really any hardcase in general I think
they're<00:00:13.139> bulky<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.799> get<00:00:13.950> in<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.160> way<00:00:14.309> I'm

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
they're bulky and get in the way I'm

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.689 
they're bulky and get in the way I'm
much<00:00:15.299> more<00:00:15.570> like<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.350> fabric<00:00:16.619> ones<00:00:16.980> but<00:00:17.580> it's

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
much more like the fabric ones but it's

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.300 
much more like the fabric ones but it's
hard<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.000> find<00:00:18.359> ones<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:19.020> don't<00:00:19.320> scratch<00:00:20.070> up

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
hard to find ones that don't scratch up

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.490 
hard to find ones that don't scratch up
the<00:00:20.430> inside<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:20.910> your<00:00:21.119> glasses<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:21.689> for<00:00:22.410> this

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
one the aligning of this as you will see

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.880 
one the aligning of this as you will see
is<00:00:25.609> actually<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:27.060> screen<00:00:27.930> cleaning<00:00:28.650> wipe

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
is actually the screen cleaning wipe

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.919 
is actually the screen cleaning wipe
things<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.490> they<00:00:29.609> give<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.939> for<00:00:29.970> free

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
things that they give you for free

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.569 
things that they give you for free
where<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.650> can<00:00:31.830> get<00:00:32.040> at<00:00:32.279> pretty<00:00:32.520> much

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
where you can get at pretty much

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.920 
where you can get at pretty much
anywhere<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.120> get<00:00:33.270> glasses<00:00:33.420> or<00:00:33.719> sunglasses

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
anywhere you get glasses or sunglasses

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.920 
anywhere you get glasses or sunglasses
so<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.649> use<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.399> as<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.850> lining<00:00:36.149> for<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.719> to

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
so I use that as the lining for this to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.569 
so I use that as the lining for this to
keep<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.260> nice<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.469> protected<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
keep it nice and protected and on the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.760 
keep it nice and protected and on the
outside<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.780> use<00:00:39.899> any<00:00:40.020> fabric<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.559> want

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
outside you can use any fabric you want

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.380 
outside you can use any fabric you want
and<00:00:40.950> that's<00:00:41.190> pretty<00:00:41.489> much<00:00:41.640> all<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.120> need

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
and that's pretty much all you need

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.850 
and that's pretty much all you need
except<00:00:42.960> for<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.350> will<00:00:43.440> also<00:00:43.590> need<00:00:43.800> a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
except for you will also need a

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.369 
except for you will also need a
drawstring<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.670> used<00:00:44.910> ribbon<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.960> sewed

drawstring I used ribbon and I sewed
mine<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> machine<00:00:47.190> but<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.489> could

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
mine on a machine but you could

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.400 
mine on a machine but you could
definitely<00:00:47.879> do<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:48.539> with<00:00:48.780> hot<00:00:49.020> glue<00:00:49.140> or

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
definitely do this with hot glue or

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.990 
definitely do this with hot glue or
fabric<00:00:49.440> glue<00:00:49.829> or<00:00:50.250> hand<00:00:50.430> stitching<00:00:50.820> or

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
anything like that but it is super easy

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.040 
anything like that but it is super easy
and<00:00:53.070> here's<00:00:54.059> how<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.239> do<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.570> like<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.840> said<00:00:54.870> I

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
and here's how you do it like I said I

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.779

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
that you might want to keep in mind is

really<00:02:08.520> super<00:02:08.700> thin<00:02:09.119> frames<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:09.989> one

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
really super thin frames so one

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.400 
really super thin frames so one
cleaning<00:02:11.400> wipe<00:02:11.580> was<00:02:11.970> enough<00:02:12.360> for<00:02:12.570> me<00:02:12.720> but<00:02:13.170> if

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
cleaning wipe was enough for me but if

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.440 
cleaning wipe was enough for me but if
you<00:02:13.560> wear<00:02:13.770> wider<00:02:14.130> glasses<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:14.880> might<00:02:15.150> need<00:02:15.270> to

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
you wear wider glasses you might need to

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.330 
you wear wider glasses you might need to
get<00:02:15.570> two<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:16.020> them<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.500> make<00:02:16.650> two<00:02:16.800> panels<00:02:17.190> and

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
get two of them and make two panels and

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.620 
get two of them and make two panels and
sew<00:02:17.460> them<00:02:17.610> together<00:02:17.730> instead<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.510> just

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
sew them together instead of just

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.510 
sew them together instead of just
folding<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.320> in<00:02:19.410> half<00:02:19.440> but<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.070> should<00:02:20.310> work

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
folding it in half but this should work

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.850 
folding it in half but this should work
for<00:02:20.850> most<00:02:21.060> frames<00:02:21.480> even<00:02:21.930> this<00:02:22.200> one<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.470> could

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
for most frames even this one I could

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.530 
for most frames even this one I could
still<00:02:23.190> fit<00:02:23.400> something<00:02:23.610> bigger<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.240> so<00:02:24.420> it's

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
still fit something bigger in so it's

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.300 
still fit something bigger in so it's
only<00:02:24.690> if<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:24.930> have<00:02:25.050> super<00:02:25.500> wide<00:02:25.710> frames<00:02:26.130> that

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
only if you have super wide frames that

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.830 
only if you have super wide frames that
this<00:02:26.460> would<00:02:26.610> start<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.880> be<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.030> problem<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.660> you

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
this would start to be a problem and you

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.270
