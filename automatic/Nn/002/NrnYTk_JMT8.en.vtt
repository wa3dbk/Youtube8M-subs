those<00:01:51.479> are<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.780> two<00:01:51.899> classes<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.470> set<00:01:52.740> up

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
those are the two classes I have set up

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.249 
those are the two classes I have set up
for<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:53.220> um<00:01:53.490> those<00:01:54.329> are<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.720> main<00:01:54.899> ones<00:01:55.049> that

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
for you um those are the main ones that

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.929 
for you um those are the main ones that
I<00:01:55.290> use<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:56.009> they<00:01:56.189> work<00:01:56.340> out<00:01:56.460> pretty<00:01:56.729> good

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
I use and they work out pretty good

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.959 
I use and they work out pretty good
everytime<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.420> use<00:01:57.540> them<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.579> it's<00:01:59.579> not<00:01:59.640> really

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
everytime I use them so it's not really

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.190 
everytime I use them so it's not really
not<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.210> hard<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.420> make<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.630> troll<00:02:00.840> class<00:02:01.049> you

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
not that hard to make a troll class you

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.780 
not that hard to make a troll class you
probably<00:02:01.290> customize<00:02:01.860> these<00:02:01.950> classes<00:02:02.460> up<00:02:02.670> a

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
probably customize these classes up a

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.039 
probably customize these classes up a
little<00:02:02.939> bit<00:02:03.090> perks<00:02:03.420> really<00:02:03.600> don't<00:02:03.750> matter<00:02:03.840> to

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
little bit perks really don't matter to

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.109 
little bit perks really don't matter to
that<00:02:04.079> much<00:02:04.409> but<00:02:04.770> um<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.399> just<00:02:05.700> thought<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.030> would

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
that much but um I just thought I would

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.670 
that much but um I just thought I would
put<00:02:06.270> them<00:02:06.329> in<00:02:06.450> there<00:02:06.540> for<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.750> guys<00:02:06.869> anyway<00:02:07.170> so
