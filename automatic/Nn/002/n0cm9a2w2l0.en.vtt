exclusive levels in echo too I honestly

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.959 
exclusive levels in echo too I honestly
have<00:00:47.520> no<00:00:47.670> idea<00:00:47.700> why<00:00:48.180> they<00:00:48.450> did<00:00:48.680> but<00:00:49.969> while

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
have no idea why they did but while

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.540 
have no idea why they did but while
comparing<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.449> two<00:00:51.600> backgrounds<00:00:52.370> this<00:00:53.370> one

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
comparing the two backgrounds this one

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.189 
comparing the two backgrounds this one
fits<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.879> lot<00:00:54.030> better<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.420> with<00:00:54.570> echo<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.989> that

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
fits a lot better in with echo to that

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.110 
fits a lot better in with echo to that
it<00:00:55.320> does<00:00:55.469> any<00:00:55.649> echo<00:00:56.010> one<00:00:56.280> level<00:00:58.910> another<00:00:59.910> thing

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
it does any echo one level another thing

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.369 
it does any echo one level another thing
that<00:01:00.149> gives<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.600> level<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> lot<00:01:01.289> of

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
that gives this level a lot of

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.109 
that gives this level a lot of
similarities<00:01:01.859> echo<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.719> other<00:01:03.719> fake<00:01:04.049> walls

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
similarities echo to other fake walls

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.950 
similarities echo to other fake walls
seriously<00:01:06.119> how<00:01:06.270> are<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.479> meant<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.750> know<00:01:06.900> that

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
seriously how are you meant to know that

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.560 
seriously how are you meant to know that
doesn't<00:01:09.960> even<00:01:10.140> show<00:01:10.380> up<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.619> sonar<00:01:14.299> fake<00:01:15.299> walls

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
doesn't even show up on sonar fake walls

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.460 
doesn't even show up on sonar fake walls
are<00:01:16.020> pretty<00:01:16.740> prevalent<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.670> these<00:01:17.790> levels<00:01:19.400> and

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
are pretty prevalent in these levels and

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.840 
are pretty prevalent in these levels and
these<00:01:22.470> are<00:01:22.590> probably<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> most<00:01:23.100> puzzle<00:01:23.640> based

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
these are probably the most puzzle based

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:32.950 
these are probably the most puzzle based
of<00:01:24.060> any<00:01:24.210> level<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.840> game

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.410 

most<00:01:33.960> echo1<00:01:34.770> levels<00:01:35.189> aren't<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.180> one

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
most echo1 levels aren't like this one

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.639 
most echo1 levels aren't like this one
but<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:38.180> this<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.360> probably<00:01:39.659> well<00:01:40.350> as<00:01:40.439> i<00:01:40.619> said

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
but it this is probably well as i said

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.010 
but it this is probably well as i said
the<00:01:40.950> motor<00:01:41.130> got<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> most<00:01:41.670> echo<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.299> wish<00:01:42.689> of

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
the motor got a most echo to wish of

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.460 
the motor got a most echo to wish of
levels<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:44.210> fact<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.329> entire<00:01:45.450> tile<00:01:45.960> setters

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
levels in fact the entire tile setters

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:57.990 
levels in fact the entire tile setters
like<00:01:46.649> this

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.490 

here<00:01:59.000> is<00:01:59.240> where<00:01:59.390> I<00:01:59.450> tend<00:01:59.720> to<00:02:00.020> this<00:02:00.170> level

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
here is where I tend to this level

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.679 
here is where I tend to this level
up<00:02:03.369> basically<00:02:04.369> you<00:02:04.850> need<00:02:05.000> to<00:02:05.119> get<00:02:05.270> this<00:02:05.420> key

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
up basically you need to get this key

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.410 
up basically you need to get this key
glyph<00:02:05.990> here<00:02:06.549> and<00:02:07.549> can<00:02:07.729> do<00:02:07.789> either<00:02:07.909> two<00:02:08.119> things

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
glyph here and can do either two things

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.150 
glyph here and can do either two things
with<00:02:08.569> it<00:02:08.660> one<00:02:08.929> is<00:02:09.050> going<00:02:09.229> get<00:02:09.470> some

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
with it one is going get some

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.360 
with it one is going get some
desperately<00:02:10.610> needed<00:02:11.000> air<00:02:12.069> which<00:02:13.069> I<00:02:13.220> only

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
desperately needed air which I only

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.120 
desperately needed air which I only
sometimes<00:02:14.030> do<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:15.620> other<00:02:15.739> us<00:02:15.920> are<00:02:16.040> actually

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
sometimes do the other us are actually

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:44.599 
sometimes do the other us are actually
end<00:02:16.519> the<00:02:16.819> level

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.039 

I've<00:02:45.609> noticed<00:02:45.939> I'm<00:02:45.999> not<00:02:46.120> talking<00:02:46.510> as<00:02:46.629> much<00:02:46.659> in

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
I've noticed I'm not talking as much in

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.369 
I've noticed I'm not talking as much in
this<00:02:47.140> one<00:02:48.389> mostly<00:02:49.389> because<00:02:49.749> they<00:02:49.900> do<00:02:49.959> like<00:02:50.230> the

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
this one mostly because they do like the

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.280 
this one mostly because they do like the
music<00:02:50.739> and<00:02:50.950> also<00:02:51.760> because<00:02:52.030> i<00:02:52.060> hate<00:02:52.599> this<00:02:52.930> lever

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
music and also because i hate this lever

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.970 
music and also because i hate this lever
so<00:02:53.799> damn<00:02:54.249> much<00:02:55.439> here<00:02:56.439> we<00:02:56.530> get<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:56.829> west

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
so damn much here we get to the west

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.220 
so damn much here we get to the west
part<00:02:57.189> of<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.459> i<00:02:57.549> need<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:57.849> push<00:02:58.030> this<00:02:58.239> rock<00:02:58.569> up

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
part of it i need to push this rock up

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.440 
part of it i need to push this rock up
and<00:02:59.560> over<00:02:59.980> this<00:03:00.519> barrier<00:03:02.040> unfortunately

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
and over this barrier unfortunately

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.390 
and over this barrier unfortunately
unlike<00:03:04.450> rocks<00:03:04.750> in<00:03:04.930> Atlantis<00:03:05.650> which<00:03:06.010> are

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
unlike rocks in Atlantis which are

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.920 
unlike rocks in Atlantis which are
specifically<00:03:07.180> made<00:03:07.450> for<00:03:08.200> this<00:03:08.680> this<00:03:09.310> rock

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
specifically made for this this rock

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.289 
specifically made for this this rock
it's<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:11.230> very<00:03:12.010> difficult<00:03:12.400> one<00:03:12.790> I<00:03:12.819> do<00:03:13.030> want<00:03:13.269> to

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
it's a very difficult one I do want to

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:14.550 
it's a very difficult one I do want to
say<00:03:13.359> this<00:03:13.569> is<00:03:13.659> probably<00:03:13.749> the<00:03:13.989> hardest<00:03:14.079> block

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
say this is probably the hardest block

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.159 
say this is probably the hardest block
pushing<00:03:14.919> puzzle<00:03:15.189> in<00:03:15.249> the<00:03:15.280> entire<00:03:15.609> game

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:16.169 
pushing puzzle in the entire game

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.509 
pushing puzzle in the entire game
