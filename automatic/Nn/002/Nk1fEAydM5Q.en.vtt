00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 Hello everyone and today I will show you how 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.760
 make 3 0 and ladies' table or 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.080
 dressing table and I don't know call it 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:16.010
 want but the meaning of that well, you understand the meaning 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.699
 so for this i need beads 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:23.939
 well, beads and archers 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:26.660
 pencil ruler pofig well or and 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.449
 sandpaper without a difference 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:34.320
 Acrylic paint box 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.070
 In this case, I have glue for tea 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.629
 pva 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.149
 scissors cardboard and white paper now i'm 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.079
 I will explain the essence of what I need to do 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.690
 now i need to glue all this even 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.730
 for a start, do not glue it, and since 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.280
 You see me here is not exactly that is 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.020
 It was not flat and slightly rounded 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.480
 so if so put it will 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.410
 swing that's why i need 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.229
 I have to do these things and here 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.619
 this 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:09.860
 stick to the very top don't know in 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.960
 In general, you understand what you need to stick 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.680
 it doesn't matter on this side 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:22.790
 i take pva glue and itâ€™s all so 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.790
 I stick the topic close so to develop 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.860
 after this side stuck 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.850
 we do the same from this side i 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.299
 everything stuck it all done and now what are we 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.420
 need to glue and do not remove far and now 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.920
 we need a lot we need white paper 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.280
 in order to glue 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.520
 the whole box for what do we need it 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.799
 that since the surface is at least 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.750
 my box is very smooth and very 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.460
 sliding so i need to do so 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.860
 in order to acrylic well 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.700
 I went to bed so I tried 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.860
 practiced 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.319
 and as you see you need very, very much 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.340
 layers and I don't want so much 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:16.190
 bother so i will need 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:20.480
 white paper and now I absolutely 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.120
 completely and and pasted but so neatly 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.500
 in order to avoid bubbles and so 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.670
 as you see I am total 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:37.459
 pasted now I need it then 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:38.720
 I will need cardboard and what for? 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:44.450
 I will need this cardboard 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:47.810
 and I will do the threads of the box now we 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.890
 let's do something like that I do n't even know 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:55.519
 how many centimeters 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:03:03.130
 somewhere probably two centimeter yes now 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:06.519
 look and wide about 6 half 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:16.970
 now let's see how it will be 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:21.140
 somewhere so time two three 4 so means 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.900
 then there will be 4 drawers 3 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.180
 Well, I think it will be the norm means us 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.680
 only needed on these 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.519
 so not exactly here such here 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.799
 there are such stripes 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:40.579
 eight times two three 4 5 6 7 8 8 such 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:44.239
 cut out then we take these two here 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:46.160
 stripes glue them together and we 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.900
 these should make four like you 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.400
 see I have already made such of me 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:56.840
 turned out 4 but I had to cut not 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:58.280
 8 such sticks and 16 since I 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.590
 considered what if 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.920
 beat between themselves only 2 this is very 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.680
 Iâ€™m not very good at the end 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.959
 fastened at once four together such 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.680
 sticks and it turned out somehow more volume 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.209
 and I think it will be much somehow 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.800
 realistic realistic looks 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.680
 Now I do not care 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.680
 Well, or sandpaper just look 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.810
 I don't care a bit more gentle and start buffing what 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:29.750
 I am leveling as in general 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:33.160
 look there are bumps and I have them now 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.160
 I'll bake you clean 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:48.650
 Well, somehow I think it turned out more 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.140
 how are you so aligned neater and the same 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.810
 the most we do with the other three 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.440
 chopsticks after we are all from 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.880
 battery 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:01.570
 try on these thick stripes here 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.010
 and glue them to the very 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:07.340
 bolls then after we 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.990
 glue color I will paint in 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.870
 green light green 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.289
 that's what I got now we go 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.530
 glue the beads for a start I need 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.390
 mark up 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.390
 where will I glue differently 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.270
 In general, you want it turned out I hope you have 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.960
 it will turn out in the same way even better 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:06.169
 so thank you all for your attention 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.169
 until
