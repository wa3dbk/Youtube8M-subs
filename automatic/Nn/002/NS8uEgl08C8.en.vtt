 a telescopic stand that 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.440

 if you have an iphone 6 plus or 14 good 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.890

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.600
 problem let's go to the part here of 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.670
 back and well here we have some 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.470

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.680
 We found some specifications 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.380
 techniques has a rechargeable battery 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.680

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.340
 of the original control we have here a 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.380
 section of multimedia buttons and also 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.750
 we have in this part that opens up for 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.190
 can place our device the 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.960
 way in which we're going to light this 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.180
 gamepad is through this button that 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.800
 we have down here good friends then 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.960
 it was time to place our 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.420
 device to see how this works 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.040
 gamepad, good friends, we already have here 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.870
 configured in our gamepad with the 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.390
 game so I'm going to be the favor 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.950
 to play a game of asad so I 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.950
 when you want you can start 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.130
 they feel they move 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.610
 I really like the controls 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.380
 how they feel to touch is very good and 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.540
 reacts very well 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.100
 and I'm very sorry too is that 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.290
 We can use it not only with 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.960
 asphalt but can also be with another 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.080
 kind of games like trigger or also 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.640
 can be great phantom also the 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.650
 true that it is very good and also 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.380
 we can connect it with our 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.770
 computer the truth that is worth a lot 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.770
 the sorrow 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.830
 let's go to those times 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.100
 we left the curve 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.170
 and well we can also configure the 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.770
 control with the buttons that we want 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:02.520

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.990

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.240
 and with this we do not have for the liter 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.910
 also something that I liked a lot is 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.400
 that we can raise and lower the volume 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.860
 from here I the truth that is worth 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.330

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.790

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.470
 perfection and is super entertaining 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.540
