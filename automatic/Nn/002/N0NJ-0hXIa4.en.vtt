00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.210
 He has been making homemade pasta for a long time 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.749
 so in the end I found the one that 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.400
 moment for me is the perfect formula 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:15.030
 input is very important to think about 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.340
 Eggs I usually use eggs xl but 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.860
 they never weigh the same 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.450
 let's take exactly twice as much 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.450
 flour than the weight of the eggs 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.720
 and we take a teaspoon of salt 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.870
 and two tablespoons of olive oil 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.870
 extra virgin 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.550
 mix with the help of a spatula 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.489
 and now directly with your hands 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.880
 we knead for about 10 minutes until 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.369
 get a homogeneous paste as you see 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.880
 It is not sticky nor too much 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.880
 elastic 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.130
 we make a ball and cover with a paper 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.130
 wet kitchen so it does not dry 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.299
 in flour plus the surface where 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.310
 let's go put our dough cut 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.930
 small portions and we had them 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.030
 our machine 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.850
 we have to pass the mass by the option more 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.720
 thick roll we bend and go back to 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.690
 happen 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.730
 we lower the thickness and we fold again and 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.710
 pass the mass 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.990
 every two passes we have to reduce 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.100
 one step the roller teacher up 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.100
 get to the finest 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.769
 the size of the mass will depend on 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.450
 our taste I usually cut the 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:26.269
 same size to make lasagna that 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.269
 cannelloni I like long cannelloni 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.510
 we let the pasta dry for 10 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.510
 minutes 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.340
 we boil plenty of water with salt 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.530
 we toss the pasta one at a time so that 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.220
 do not stick, we add a trickle of 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.220
 olive oil 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.060
 we let cook for two minutes 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.770
 we take out and introduce immediately in 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.770
 ice water to cut the cooking 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.650
 we take out and let cool on a rag 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.689
 clean wet 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.120
 when you try homemade pasta never 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.769
 you go back to buy it, do not miss the 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.129
 rich recipes that we are going to prepare with 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.129
