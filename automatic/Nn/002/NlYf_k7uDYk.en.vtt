00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.490 

so<00:00:28.480> there's<00:00:28.690> a<00:00:28.780> couple<00:00:28.900> of<00:00:29.110> different<00:00:29.440> ways

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
so there's a couple of different ways

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.290 
so there's a couple of different ways
that<00:00:29.620> you<00:00:29.830> can<00:00:30.040> play<00:00:30.280> that<00:00:30.520> nine<00:00:30.790> lick<00:00:31.120> if

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
that you can play that nine lick if

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.600 
that you can play that nine lick if
you're<00:00:31.480> playing<00:00:31.810> a<00:00:32.200> group<00:00:32.650> of<00:00:32.860> six<00:00:33.190> notes<00:00:33.400> like

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
you're playing a group of six notes like

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:43.170 
you're playing a group of six notes like
I<00:00:33.760> was<00:00:33.970> before<00:00:41.370> well<00:00:42.370> then<00:00:42.520> you<00:00:42.640> can<00:00:42.790> just<00:00:42.940> add

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
I was before well then you can just add

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.700 
I was before well then you can just add
that<00:00:43.390> in<00:00:43.570> because<00:00:43.750> you're<00:00:44.020> already<00:00:44.230> playing

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
that in because you're already playing

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:55.590 
that in because you're already playing
sextuplets<00:00:45.489> so<00:00:45.850> you'd<00:00:46.000> go<00:00:54.120> okay<00:00:55.120> that's<00:00:55.360> one

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
sextuplets so you'd go okay that's one

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.390 
sextuplets so you'd go okay that's one
way<00:00:55.780> to<00:00:55.809> do<00:00:56.080> it<00:00:56.110> another<00:00:56.589> way<00:00:56.739> is<00:00:56.890> just<00:00:57.070> to<00:00:57.190> play

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
way to do it another way is just to play

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:11.859 
way to do it another way is just to play
in<00:00:57.640> a<00:00:57.730> regular<00:00:58.150> group<00:00:58.449> maybe<00:00:58.780> a<00:00:58.900> disco<00:00:59.260> proof

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.149 

ok<00:01:12.869> that's<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.200> couple<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.560> ways<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.950> can

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
ok that's a couple of ways that you can

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:51.470 
ok that's a couple of ways that you can
use<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.460> pattern

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.000 

you

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.310 

so<00:01:57.000> really<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.480> only<00:01:57.660> thing<00:01:58.050> that<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.290> have

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
so really the only thing that you have

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.200 
so really the only thing that you have
to<00:01:58.470> remember<00:01:58.890> once<00:01:59.250> you've<00:01:59.430> won't<00:01:59.730> that<00:01:59.940> call

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
to remember once you've won't that call

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.480 
to remember once you've won't that call
pattern<00:02:00.480> is<00:02:00.960> start<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.890> pattern<00:02:02.340> with<00:02:02.460> the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
pattern is start the pattern with the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.730 
pattern is start the pattern with the
left<00:02:02.820> hand<00:02:03.000> which<00:02:03.300> is<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.480> bit<00:02:03.720> unusual<00:02:03.870> usually

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
left hand which is a bit unusual usually

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.510 
left hand which is a bit unusual usually
we<00:02:05.130> start<00:02:05.400> everything<00:02:05.730> with<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.060> right<00:02:06.240> hand

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
we start everything with the right hand

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.370 
we start everything with the right hand
in<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:08.790> case<00:02:09.060> in<00:02:09.600> order<00:02:09.720> for<00:02:09.960> the<00:02:10.020> patent<00:02:10.260> to

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
in this case in order for the patent to

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.560 
in this case in order for the patent to
work<00:02:10.560> must<00:02:11.040> start<00:02:11.310> with<00:02:11.460> the<00:02:11.520> left<00:02:11.700> hand<00:02:11.880> okay

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
work must start with the left hand okay

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:34.780 
work must start with the left hand okay
so<00:02:12.900> up<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.260> speed<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.710> sounds<00:02:14.190> like<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:33.470> and

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
so up to speed it sounds like this and

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.820 
so up to speed it sounds like this and
like<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:36.060> just<00:02:36.120> did<00:02:36.330> then<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:36.810> can<00:02:37.170> go<00:02:37.380> in<00:02:37.680> and

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
like I just did then you can go in and

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.370 
like I just did then you can go in and
out<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.340> regular<00:02:38.550> shuffle<00:02:39.210> and<00:02:39.390> then<00:02:39.960> use

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
out of a regular shuffle and then use

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.290 
out of a regular shuffle and then use
that<00:02:40.410> Polly<00:02:40.830> with<00:02:41.010> me<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.220> idea<00:02:41.490> again<00:02:41.760> so

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
that Polly with me the idea again so

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.760 
that Polly with me the idea again so
that's<00:02:42.570> a<00:02:42.660> pretty<00:02:42.870> famous<00:02:43.140> dennis<00:02:43.590> chambers

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
that's a pretty famous dennis chambers

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.760 
that's a pretty famous dennis chambers
lit<00:02:44.130> there<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.990> that's<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.140> entire<00:02:46.440> pattern

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
lit there and that's the entire pattern

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.130 
lit there and that's the entire pattern
so<00:02:47.190> you've<00:02:47.370> got<00:02:47.400> two<00:02:47.910> bits<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:48.540> sixteenth

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
so you've got two bits of sixteenth

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.530 
so you've got two bits of sixteenth
notes<00:02:49.410> all<00:02:49.740> rim<00:02:50.280> shots<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.120> end<00:02:51.360> with<00:02:51.480> a

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
notes all rim shots and you end with a

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.480 
notes all rim shots and you end with a
flare<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.470> get<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:55.010> then<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.190> get<00:02:56.340> the

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
flare and you get and then you get the

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:03.790 
flare and you get and then you get the
eighth<00:02:56.670> notes<00:02:56.940> on<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.209> bass<00:02:57.360> drum<00:02:57.540> so<00:02:58.050> you<00:02:58.110> get

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.220 

ok<00:03:04.800> both<00:03:05.100> pedals<00:03:05.550> there<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:06.570> up<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.900> speed<00:03:07.110> it

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
ok both pedals there so up to speed it

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:18.340 
ok both pedals there so up to speed it
sounds<00:03:07.470> like<00:03:07.560> this

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.950 

and<00:03:19.350> a<00:03:19.470> little<00:03:19.709> bit<00:03:19.800> faster
