00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:08.210
 and what happens to fear and we're back 

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.589
 in the world of tests and good today 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.339
 I'm going to do a pretty concept 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:14.419
 interesting that is madonna 1.7 and it 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.520
 it's about what I'm going to teach you 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:17.789
 continuation who destroys it a little 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.279
 A) Yes 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.050
 good as you see here I have three 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.000
 passages 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.060
 which are filled to crystal like 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.420
 it's here I have several layers of glass 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.420
 black 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.560
 here I have several layers of gray glass 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.010
 and black crystal 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:40.610
 put together and here I have the same 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.440
 just that without walls or roof in this 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.940
 wall but gonzález 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:49.500
 and good because I want to show what good 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.540
 It could be said that they are book 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.730
 related to crystals 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.190
 colored crystals and is the next 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.620
 As you can see in this passage, it seems that 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:04.650
 there is nothing in the background that simply is 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:07.620
 a passageway that ends in wall and even 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.840
 but if I catch a painted glass gives 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.890
 same as it may also be of 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.410
 these combs will catch this because 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.840
 is the most transparent and he threw it as a 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.320
 item 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.909
 catán my god reveals a great 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.670
 secret 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.539
 good as you see in through these 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.799
 crystals 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:29.570
 if I throw any other kind of 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.850
 crystal 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.250
 in the crystals I do not know render behind 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.650
 of the items so I can see what 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.680
 which is at the bottom and good in this case in 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.200
 the bottom there are bright pumpkins the 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.020
 reason why we do not see them when there 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.789
 crystals 3 because 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.780
 just as officials that is is that 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.780
 if I'm going like this 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.820
 if they are the same color, not as I see it 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.030
 same way 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.130
 that does exactly the same 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.229
 I was not told 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.770
 but if they are different crystals 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:11.319
 colors or if there is a block that is not 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:15.099
 this among these products I put 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.799
 what is the pink that is a color 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.749
 different this as you see it is already going 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:23.950
 appreciating that every time it is done 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:26.230
 a less clear vision and if I tell you 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.030
 and I continue and I still need people and they are 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.319
 crystals with another invisible block 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.889
 counting air works so I'm ice 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.889
 for example 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.489
 As you can see, more and more 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.749
 dark and with air like it is every time 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.530
 it is getting darker is what I have 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:48.379
 made here I made several layers glass 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.590
 the air crystal air already reaches a point 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:54.310
 in which what was the background that I eat 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.310
 you have seen was 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.900
 to see that we see again 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.010
 as you can see they will be bright low face 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.099
 these as they say ya colán cannes 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.140
 so although those pumpkins shine light 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.170
 does not arrive until what is the 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.690
 aisle is shorter 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.460
 but in fact the cellars are there 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.650
 very close and still they do not look 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.960
 and we can uncover what is behind 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.430
 all these crystals 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:29.250
 with an item of any type 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.260
 because it's interesting with this too 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.490
 you can any invisible block created 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:39.380
 this all this 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.380
 and see what else invisible blocks 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:46.840
 something we do not try 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.840
 with this 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.010
 can not be good had to try 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.500
 good as you see here to do the 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.700
 proof that you do not need or have 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:04.280
 this so as not to see it as it is here to the 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.230
 inn and pumpkins and there are neither walls nor 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.159
 this but still gives for in room to 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.000
 the light does not come then that I have 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:14.750
 an internal 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.359
 well this does not just happen with crystals 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:21.060
 another block with which he would not surrender 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:25.880
 behind items is for example the 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.880
 posters or trunks as you see 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.300
 you will not understand either and the crankcase is that 

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:35.330
 there is also said here the are a test 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:38.770
 put several you take next to the others 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.550
 and as you can see you do not see 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.979
 and I 'm realizing that I'm in 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.129
 he just put it in graphics fans and not 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.129
 Too bad 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.610
 I do not know sometimes I put it that way 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.610
 heavy I suppose because in this world 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.190
 such or where I am now not also not 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.930
 things are good I've done the 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.350
 test with several other objects like 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:05.660
 you see all these look 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.660
 today I'm going to do a trick that is this 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.070
 well I do not have to throw I can not is for 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:14.570
 piss and with the portals either 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.570
 they see both this one and 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.500
 there's the legacy like this and good 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.100
 here is also the test with water and 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.740
 with nothing the base that is seen but the 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.440
 not water and good here is the test with 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.630
 ice to stay like ice 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.300
 normal is not seen but what would come to 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.910
 be the new full for what you give as 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.030
 He says 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.880
 in Spanish, you can see the crystals 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.460
 normal be this and this one that looks 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.780
 between the tints no longer 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.780
 as you see see below 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:55.290
 well done here a kind of weird thing 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.550
 as it is if I put glass blocks 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.550
 in any block over 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:06.040
 They would not give more glass and is 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.040
 a weird effect 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:12.279
 as if the layers were floating 

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:12.279
 the carpets 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:19.639
 well I have investigated with many blocks 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:21.110
 and I think these are all those that do not 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:23.720
 you can see what the trunks will come 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:27.090
 the crystals and the ice 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.669
 in cheste's and the posters 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:32.880
 well here I also tried it with 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:35.820
 crops to see how and with children 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.150
 unisys as they say 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.810
 now I have one 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.810
 that 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.900
 well so that has been everything is a 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.380
 pretty interesting concept can be 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.210
 use a map in the adventure or 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.419
 what do i know 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.100
 one funny thing would have been that 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:56.960
 example have a layer of crystals and 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.460
 background have a poster 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.969
 but that can not be done because the 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.540
 posters I do not know either 

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:04.590
 they are made 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.630
 what is bad 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.330
 so it 's true I hope it has been 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:13.370
 liked this concept and see you in the 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.370
 next video conversions soon what
