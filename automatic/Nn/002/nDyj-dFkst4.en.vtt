00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
up the truth is is that there is demand

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.289 
up the truth is is that there is demand
in<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.020> market<00:01:07.619> okay<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:09.150> been

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
in the market okay and it's been

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.120 
in the market okay and it's been
building<00:01:09.600> for<00:01:09.810> quite<00:01:10.200> some<00:01:10.470> time<00:01:10.500> okay<00:01:11.490> and

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
building for quite some time okay and

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.770 
building for quite some time okay and
gold<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.310> basically<00:01:14.850> going<00:01:15.090> through<00:01:15.479> its

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
gold is basically going through its

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.499 
gold is basically going through its
pattern<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.530> going<00:01:17.340> with<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.820> correction

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
pattern it's going with the correction

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.190 
pattern it's going with the correction
it<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:19.229> pretty<00:01:19.770> much<00:01:19.939> consolidated<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.200> even

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
it can pretty much consolidated and even

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.359 
it can pretty much consolidated and even
though<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.500> banks<00:01:22.829> are<00:01:22.950> trying<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.250> do

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
though the banks are trying to do

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.190 
though the banks are trying to do
everything<00:01:23.579> they<00:01:23.970> can<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.240> manipulate<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
everything they can to manipulate the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.139 
everything they can to manipulate the
market<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.799> smash<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.430> price<00:01:26.670> because

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
market and smash the price because

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.139 
market and smash the price because
that's<00:01:27.509> what<00:01:27.720> they<00:01:27.840> do<00:01:27.899> and<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:29.030> awaken<00:01:30.030> to

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
that's what they do and we awaken to

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.600 
that's what they do and we awaken to
that<00:01:30.360> fact<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:31.619> time<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> little<00:01:32.490> bit

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
that fact this time is a little bit

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.880 
that fact this time is a little bit
different<00:01:33.000> because<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.570> lot<00:01:34.110> more<00:01:34.350> people<00:01:34.710> know

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
different because a lot more people know

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.590 
different because a lot more people know
what's<00:01:35.130> going<00:01:35.460> on<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:35.850> every<00:01:36.090> time<00:01:36.119> they<00:01:36.540> try

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
what's going on so every time they try

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.230 
what's going on so every time they try
to<00:01:36.810> whack<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.409> price<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:38.579> go<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:38.969> pick<00:01:39.119> it

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
to whack on the price we go and pick it

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.130 
to whack on the price we go and pick it
up<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.570> say<00:01:39.719> thank<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:43.820> it<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.090> funny<00:01:45.450> man<00:01:45.750> it

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
up and say thank you it is funny man it

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.550 
up and say thank you it is funny man it
is<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.649> our<00:01:47.039> CDC<00:01:47.700> monkeys<00:01:48.270> out<00:01:48.450> there<00:01:48.560> trying

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
is so our CDC monkeys out there trying

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.830 
is so our CDC monkeys out there trying
to<00:01:49.619> frame<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.009> frame<00:01:50.789> the<00:01:50.939> argument<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
to frame it frame the argument that the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.569 
to frame it frame the argument that the
only<00:01:51.990> reason<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.500> gold<00:01:52.860> prices<00:01:53.130> are<00:01:53.430> going

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
only reason that gold prices are going

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.810 
only reason that gold prices are going
up<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.119> because<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.860> monetary<00:01:55.860> stimulus<00:01:56.280> and

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
up is because of monetary stimulus and

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.800 
up is because of monetary stimulus and
it's<00:01:57.479> not<00:01:57.719> necessarily<00:01:57.930> true<00:01:58.740> because<00:01:59.810> it's

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
it's not necessarily true because it's

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.950 
it's not necessarily true because it's
not<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.469> monetary<00:02:02.009> stimulus<00:02:02.659> where<00:02:03.659> it's

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
not the monetary stimulus where it's

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.580 
not the monetary stimulus where it's
really<00:02:04.590> about<00:02:05.810> expansion<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:07.109> the<00:02:07.200> balance

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
really about expansion of the balance

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.619 
really about expansion of the balance
sheet<00:02:07.770> it's<00:02:08.070> the<00:02:08.310> expansion<00:02:08.820> of<00:02:08.880> currency<00:02:09.450> is

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
sheet it's the expansion of currency is

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.660 
sheet it's the expansion of currency is
not<00:02:09.869> really<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.259> stimulus<00:02:10.709> construct<00:02:11.280> me<00:02:11.430> if<00:02:11.519> it

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
not really a stimulus construct me if it

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.200 
not really a stimulus construct me if it
was<00:02:11.790> really

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
was really

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.180 
was really
that<00:02:12.720> was<00:02:12.840> working<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.290> economy<00:02:13.800> will<00:02:13.980> be<00:02:14.040> a

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
that was working the economy will be a

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.490 
that was working the economy will be a
lot<00:02:14.460> better<00:02:14.640> right<00:02:14.790> now<00:02:15.150> there's<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.170> lot<00:02:16.440> of

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
lot better right now there's a lot of

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.950 
lot better right now there's a lot of
demand<00:02:16.950> for<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.280> metal<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:18.180> got<00:02:18.360> China's

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
demand for the metal you got China's

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.050 
demand for the metal you got China's
doing<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.440> quiet<00:02:19.740> accumulation<00:02:20.610> over<00:02:20.790> there

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
doing a quiet accumulation over there

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.880 
doing a quiet accumulation over there
and<00:02:21.390> every<00:02:21.690> once<00:02:21.930> in<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.110> while<00:02:22.290> they'll<00:02:22.620> tell

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
and every once in a while they'll tell

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.800 
and every once in a while they'll tell
you<00:02:23.040> what<00:02:23.190> they<00:02:23.340> had<00:02:23.550> some<00:02:23.820> years<00:02:24.090> ago<00:02:26.420> so<00:02:27.420> when

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
you what they had some years ago so when

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.440 
you what they had some years ago so when
I<00:02:27.840> see<00:02:28.170> these<00:02:28.230> reports<00:02:29.070> about<00:02:29.310> how<00:02:29.940> much<00:02:30.120> gold

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
I see these reports about how much gold

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.320 
I see these reports about how much gold
a<00:02:30.720> big<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.710> know<00:02:31.890> basically<00:02:32.550> sucked<00:02:32.940> up<00:02:33.150> all

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
a big you know basically sucked up all

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.080 
a big you know basically sucked up all
year<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:34.470> believe<00:02:35.040> you're<00:02:35.220> only<00:02:35.340> telling<00:02:35.640> us<00:02:35.910> a

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
year I believe you're only telling us a

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.540 
year I believe you're only telling us a
fraction<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:36.930> what<00:02:37.140> they<00:02:37.170> really<00:02:37.560> have<00:02:37.860> okay

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
fraction of what they really have okay

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.640 
fraction of what they really have okay
because<00:02:39.330> if<00:02:39.570> we<00:02:39.750> knew<00:02:39.930> how<00:02:40.170> much<00:02:40.350> they<00:02:40.590> were

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
because if we knew how much they were

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.610 
because if we knew how much they were
sucking<00:02:41.190> up<00:02:41.370> then<00:02:42.060> goal<00:02:43.050> would<00:02:43.200> be<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.380> lot

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
sucking up then goal would be a lot

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.430 
sucking up then goal would be a lot
higher<00:02:43.830> now<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.760> demand<00:02:45.450> is<00:02:45.600> there<00:02:45.660> the

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
higher now the demand is there the

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.860 
higher now the demand is there the
markets<00:02:46.920> wild-type<00:02:47.390> Silver's<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.630> same

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
markets wild-type Silver's in the same

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.230 
markets wild-type Silver's in the same
position<00:02:49.470> but<00:02:49.650> yet<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.430> sea<00:02:50.640> monkeys<00:02:51.060> are

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
position but yet the sea monkeys are

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.640 
position but yet the sea monkeys are
going<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.450> come<00:02:51.630> out<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.110> they're<00:02:52.410> going<00:02:52.590> to

going to come out and they're going to

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.620 
going to come out and they're going to
try<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:52.890> tell<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.280> everything<00:02:53.580> in<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.450> book

how all it doesn't pay a dividend or the

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.780 
how all it doesn't pay a dividend or the
classic<00:02:58.110> argument<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.620> like<00:02:58.830> this<00:02:59.010> one<00:02:59.070> goals

classic argument I like this one goals

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.420 
classic argument I like this one goals
in<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.210> bubble<00:03:00.630> because<00:03:00.810> it's<00:03:01.560> popular<00:03:01.950> and
