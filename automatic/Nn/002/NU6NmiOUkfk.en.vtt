asked should I put my Mac to sleep at

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.890 
asked should I put my Mac to sleep at
the<00:00:14.639> end<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.880> day<00:00:15.000> or<00:00:15.269> should<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.599> shut<00:00:15.870> it

the end of the day or should I shut it

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.140 
the end of the day or should I shut it
down<00:00:16.020> well<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:17.039> definitely<00:00:17.310> fall<00:00:17.640> on<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.970> side

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
down well I definitely fall on the side

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.849 
down well I definitely fall on the side
of<00:00:18.330> putting<00:00:18.690> her<00:00:18.779> Mac<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.080> sleep<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.529> never

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
of putting her Mac to sleep and never

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.500 
of putting her Mac to sleep and never
shutting<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.340> down<00:00:20.369> but<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.029> fact<00:00:21.119> recently

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
shutting it down but in fact recently

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.970 
shutting it down but in fact recently
I've<00:00:21.630> been<00:00:21.750> very<00:00:21.960> surprised<00:00:22.380> when<00:00:22.710> I've<00:00:22.830> heard

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
I've been very surprised when I've heard

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.830 
I've been very surprised when I've heard
some<00:00:23.160> experienced<00:00:23.550> Mac<00:00:23.699> users<00:00:24.060> actually<00:00:24.600> shut

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
some experienced Mac users actually shut

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.019 
some experienced Mac users actually shut
down<00:00:25.080> their<00:00:25.320> Mac's<00:00:25.500> all<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.980> time<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.460> don't

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
down their Mac's all the time and don't

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.890 
down their Mac's all the time and don't
use<00:00:27.240> sleep<00:00:27.539> mode

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
use sleep mode

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.839 
use sleep mode
I<00:00:27.930> think<00:00:28.410> majority<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.920> Mac<00:00:29.039> users<00:00:29.369> do<00:00:29.550> sleep

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
I think majority of Mac users do sleep

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.460 
I think majority of Mac users do sleep
mode<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.480> want<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.750> tell<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:30.929> why<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.109> think

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
mode and I want to tell you why I think

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.500 
mode and I want to tell you why I think
it's<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.710> best<00:00:31.830> option<00:00:32.120> well<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.329> first

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
it's the best option well the first

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.209 
it's the best option well the first
argument<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:34.020> favor<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.469> shutting<00:00:34.860> down<00:00:34.890> your

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
argument in favor of shutting down your

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.799 
argument in favor of shutting down your
Mac<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.550> energy<00:00:35.969> savings<00:00:36.329> your<00:00:36.660> Mac

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
Mac is energy savings your Mac

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.119 
Mac is energy savings your Mac
definitely<00:00:37.230> uses<00:00:37.440> less<00:00:37.620> power<00:00:37.649> when<00:00:38.010> it's

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
definitely uses less power when it's

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.590 
definitely uses less power when it's
completely<00:00:38.460> shut<00:00:38.610> down<00:00:38.670> then<00:00:39.390> when<00:00:39.480> it's

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
completely shut down then when it's

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.090 
completely shut down then when it's
sleeping<00:00:39.930> but<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.500> difference<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:40.920> actually

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
sleeping but the difference is actually

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.100 
sleeping but the difference is actually
very<00:00:41.640> little<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.120> then<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.570> have<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.899> waive

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
very little and then you have to waive

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.720 
very little and then you have to waive
against<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.710> fact<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.160> you're<00:00:44.520> using

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
against the fact that you're using

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.430 
against the fact that you're using
energy<00:00:45.149> when<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.390> shut<00:00:45.660> down<00:00:45.840> your<00:00:45.899> Mac<00:00:46.230> and

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
energy when you shut down your Mac and

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.160 
energy when you shut down your Mac and
when<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.520> boot<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.879> up<00:00:48.030> again<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:49.020> is

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
when you boot it up again and this is

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.299 
when you boot it up again and this is
time<00:00:49.320> when<00:00:49.469> you're<00:00:49.559> not<00:00:49.680> actually<00:00:49.860> doing

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
time when you're not actually doing

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.770 
time when you're not actually doing
anything<00:00:50.730> with<00:00:50.879> your<00:00:51.000> Mac<00:00:51.120> but<00:00:51.510> your<00:00:51.629> Mac's

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
anything with your Mac but your Mac's

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.630 
anything with your Mac but your Mac's
using<00:00:52.140> everything<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.739> fans<00:00:53.010> hard<00:00:53.370> drives

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
using everything in it fans hard drives

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.970 
using everything in it fans hard drives
the<00:00:53.969> works<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.840> how<00:00:55.230> much<00:00:55.350> more<00:00:55.530> energy<00:00:55.649> are

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
the works so how much more energy are

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.010 
the works so how much more energy are
using<00:00:56.520> during<00:00:57.000> those<00:00:57.180> times<00:00:57.510> compared<00:00:57.930> to

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
using during those times compared to

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.229 
using during those times compared to
simply<00:00:58.739> having<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.100> sleeping<00:00:59.460> for<00:00:59.670> say<00:00:59.940> eight

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
simply having it sleeping for say eight

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.349 
simply having it sleeping for say eight
or<00:01:00.480> twelve<00:01:00.989> hours<00:01:01.460> also<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.820> energy<00:01:03.180> side

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
or twelve hours also on the energy side

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.840 
or twelve hours also on the energy side
of<00:01:03.480> things<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.809> concern<00:01:04.650> about<00:01:04.890> batteries<00:01:05.700> in

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
of things is concern about batteries in

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.910 
of things is concern about batteries in
Mac<00:01:06.030> books<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.420> MacBook<00:01:06.540> Pros<00:01:06.990> well<00:01:07.740> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
Mac books and MacBook Pros well the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.469 
Mac books and MacBook Pros well the
truth<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.549> if<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.760> have<00:01:08.909> your<00:01:09.030> MacBook

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
truth is that if you have your MacBook

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.440 
truth is that if you have your MacBook
plugged<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:11.369> sleeping<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.270> not

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
plugged in and it's sleeping it's not

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.630 
plugged in and it's sleeping it's not
actually<00:01:12.689> using<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.049> battery<00:01:13.200> at<00:01:13.500> all<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.369> you

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
actually using the battery at all so you

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.310 
actually using the battery at all so you
don't<00:01:14.670> worry<00:01:15.060> about<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.450> now<00:01:15.869> if<00:01:16.110> you're

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
don't worry about that now if you're

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.109 
don't worry about that now if you're
actually<00:01:16.619> using<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.490> battery<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.000> don't

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
actually using the battery you don't

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.730 
actually using the battery you don't
have<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.270> plugged<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.689> putting<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.350> sleep<00:01:19.590> is

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
have a plugged in putting to sleep is

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.039 
have a plugged in putting to sleep is
actually<00:01:20.250> better<00:01:20.670> for<00:01:20.790> energy<00:01:21.720> savings

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
actually better for energy savings

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.530 
actually better for energy savings
because<00:01:22.650> if<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.130> need<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.400> wake<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.939> Mac<00:01:24.299> up

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
because if you need to wake the Mac up

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.200 
because if you need to wake the Mac up
it<00:01:24.869> takes<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.979> second<00:01:26.340> but<00:01:26.460> if<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.939> have<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
it takes a second but if you have to

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.850 
it takes a second but if you have to
boot<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.570> up<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.869> takes<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.200> long<00:01:28.409> time<00:01:28.439> use<00:01:28.829> a

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
boot it up it takes a long time use a

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.380 
boot it up it takes a long time use a
lot<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.040> battery<00:01:29.369> power<00:01:29.430> now<00:01:29.909> if<00:01:30.060> you're<00:01:30.210> going

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
lot of battery power now if you're going

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.940 
lot of battery power now if you're going
to<00:01:30.450> put<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.720> sleep<00:01:30.840> say<00:01:31.110> for<00:01:31.259> an<00:01:31.320> entire<00:01:31.500> day

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
to put it to sleep say for an entire day

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.710 
to put it to sleep say for an entire day
and<00:01:32.280> you're<00:01:32.700> using<00:01:32.820> battery<00:01:33.210> power<00:01:33.420> then

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
and you're using battery power then

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.999 
and you're using battery power then
maybe<00:01:33.990> shutting<00:01:34.350> down<00:01:34.470> might<00:01:34.650> be<00:01:34.740> about<00:01:34.890> our

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
maybe shutting down might be about our

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.010 
maybe shutting down might be about our
option<00:01:35.430> but<00:01:36.030> if<00:01:36.329> you're<00:01:36.540> just<00:01:36.659> doing<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.869> for<00:01:36.960> a

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
option but if you're just doing it for a

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.719 
option but if you're just doing it for a
few<00:01:37.200> hours<00:01:37.229> or<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.710> plane<00:01:38.009> flight<00:01:38.250> or<00:01:38.430> something

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
few hours or a plane flight or something

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.310 
few hours or a plane flight or something
then<00:01:39.119> definitely<00:01:39.360> want<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.720> put<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.049> sleep

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
then definitely want to put it to sleep

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.289 
then definitely want to put it to sleep
so<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.590> can<00:01:40.710> wake<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.920> up<00:01:40.950> instantly<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.759> save

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
so you can wake it up instantly and save

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.899 
so you can wake it up instantly and save
on<00:01:42.479> your<00:01:42.570> battery<00:01:43.009> now<00:01:44.009> some<00:01:44.310> people<00:01:44.549> argue

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
on your battery now some people argue

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.340 
on your battery now some people argue
that<00:01:44.939> by<00:01:45.270> shutting<00:01:45.570> down<00:01:45.750> you're<00:01:46.049> creating

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
that by shutting down you're creating

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.840 
that by shutting down you're creating
less<00:01:46.500> wear<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.740> tear<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.280> parts<00:01:47.610> inside

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
less wear and tear on the parts inside

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.910 
less wear and tear on the parts inside
your<00:01:48.030> bank<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.079> kind<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.710> true

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
your bank and this is kind of true

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.010 
your bank and this is kind of true
things<00:01:50.369> like<00:01:50.579> Ram<00:01:50.820> are<00:01:50.850> still<00:01:51.240> active<00:01:51.630> however

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
things like Ram are still active however

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.350 
things like Ram are still active however
lots<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.070> things<00:01:53.220> like<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.520> hard<00:01:53.759> drive<00:01:54.000> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
lots of things like the hard drive and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.969 
lots of things like the hard drive and
the<00:01:54.689> light<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:55.020> your<00:01:55.140> screen<00:01:55.380> things<00:01:55.770> like

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
the light on your screen things like

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.370 
the light on your screen things like
that<00:01:56.189> are<00:01:56.850> completely<00:01:57.450> shut<00:01:57.719> off<00:01:57.750> while<00:01:58.110> in

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
that are completely shut off while in

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.440 
that are completely shut off while in
sleep<00:01:58.680> mode<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.430> it's<00:01:59.759> not<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.000> very<00:02:00.270> good

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
sleep mode so it's not a very good

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.819 
sleep mode so it's not a very good
argument<00:02:00.689> as<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.170> matter<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.409> fact<00:02:01.619> you're

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
argument as a matter of fact you're

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:02.810 
argument as a matter of fact you're
creating<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> lot<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.189> wear<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.399> tear<00:02:02.640> by

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
creating a lot of wear and tear by

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.359 
creating a lot of wear and tear by
booting<00:02:03.149> up<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.479> shutting<00:02:03.840> down<00:02:04.049> as<00:02:04.350> well<00:02:04.680> so

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
booting up and shutting down as well so

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.300 
booting up and shutting down as well so
it's<00:02:05.729> probably<00:02:06.329> even<00:02:06.829> now<00:02:07.829> one<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.129> best

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
it's probably even now one of the best

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.490 
it's probably even now one of the best
arguments<00:02:08.819> for<00:02:09.060> sleep<00:02:09.569> mode<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.319> fact

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
arguments for sleep mode is the fact

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.020 
arguments for sleep mode is the fact
that<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.709> can<00:02:10.830> instantly<00:02:11.190> wake<00:02:11.430> your<00:02:11.610> Mac<00:02:11.760> up

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
that you can instantly wake your Mac up

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.850 
that you can instantly wake your Mac up
I<00:02:12.209> mean<00:02:12.599> why<00:02:13.020> spend<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.440> extra

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
I mean why spend that extra

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.770 
I mean why spend that extra
30<00:02:14.040> seconds<00:02:14.580> or<00:02:14.700> 2<00:02:14.880> minutes<00:02:15.060> booting<00:02:15.540> up<00:02:15.600> your

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
30 seconds or 2 minutes booting up your

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.600 
30 seconds or 2 minutes booting up your

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
machine every morning and even the extra

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.250 
machine every morning and even the extra
minute<00:02:17.880> making<00:02:18.120> sure<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:18.480> shuts<00:02:18.690> down<00:02:18.810> every

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
minute making sure it shuts down every

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.800 
minute making sure it shuts down every
evening<00:02:19.950> when<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.910> can<00:02:21.060> instantly<00:02:21.390> get<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:21.690> on

well<00:02:54.690> remember<00:02:55.230> exactly<00:02:55.740> what<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:55.980> were

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
well remember exactly what you were

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.560 
well remember exactly what you were
working<00:02:56.400> on<00:02:56.459> and<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.940> same<00:02:57.090> thing<00:02:57.300> then<00:02:57.480> the

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
working on and the same thing then the

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.480 
working on and the same thing then the
day<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:57.840> have<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.200> clean<00:02:58.410> everything<00:02:58.860> up<00:02:58.950> make

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
day you have to clean everything up make

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.920 
day you have to clean everything up make
sure<00:02:59.520> you<00:02:59.730> close<00:02:59.940> all<00:03:00.150> your<00:03:00.180> documents<00:03:00.870> and

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
sure you close all your documents and

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.180 
sure you close all your documents and
you're<00:03:01.050> good<00:03:01.230> stopping<00:03:01.620> points<00:03:01.890> just<00:03:02.040> shut

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
you're good stopping points just shut

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.190 
you're good stopping points just shut
down<00:03:02.220> but<00:03:02.940> putting<00:03:03.240> something<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.750> sleep<00:03:03.959> you

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
down but putting something to sleep you

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.380 
down but putting something to sleep you
can<00:03:04.350> do<00:03:04.440> that<00:03:04.590> in<00:03:04.800> an<00:03:04.920> instant<00:03:05.390> another

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
can do that in an instant another

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.970 
can do that in an instant another
advantage<00:03:06.720> of<00:03:06.959> sleep<00:03:07.290> mode<00:03:07.410> is<00:03:07.620> how<00:03:07.709> easily

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
advantage of sleep mode is how easily

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.890 
advantage of sleep mode is how easily
it's<00:03:08.250> reversible<00:03:08.820> so<00:03:09.270> say<00:03:09.510> you're<00:03:09.660> at<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.810> end

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
it's reversible so say you're at the end

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.570 
it's reversible so say you're at the end
of<00:03:09.990> the<00:03:10.080> day<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.590> decide<00:03:10.950> you're<00:03:11.160> done<00:03:11.310> and

sleep<00:04:14.970> rather<00:04:15.299> than<00:04:15.570> shut<00:04:15.840> down<00:04:16.019> I<00:04:16.229> suggest<00:04:16.769> if

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
sleep rather than shut down I suggest if

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:17.930 
sleep rather than shut down I suggest if
you're<00:04:17.010> one<00:04:17.130> of<00:04:17.160> those<00:04:17.310> people<00:04:17.459> that<00:04:17.609> likes

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
you're one of those people that likes

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.039 
you're one of those people that likes
just<00:04:18.120> shut<00:04:18.239> down<00:04:18.359> your<00:04:18.479> Mac<00:04:18.630> all<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.870> time

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
just shut down your Mac all the time

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.930 
just shut down your Mac all the time
that<00:04:19.410> perhaps<00:04:19.590> you<00:04:19.919> take<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.280> few<00:04:20.489> weeks<00:04:20.729> and

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
that perhaps you take a few weeks and

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.969 
that perhaps you take a few weeks and
switch<00:04:21.479> over<00:04:21.600> to<00:04:21.780> sleep<00:04:22.080> mode<00:04:22.229> and<00:04:22.470> see<00:04:22.800> if<00:04:22.860> you

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
switch over to sleep mode and see if you

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.469 
switch over to sleep mode and see if you
like<00:04:23.190> it<00:04:23.340> better<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:23.700> then<00:04:24.090> after<00:04:24.360> you've

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
like it better and then after you've

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.570 
like it better and then after you've
tried<00:04:24.660> both<00:04:25.140> sides<00:04:25.440> of<00:04:25.620> it<00:04:25.710> then<00:04:26.070> you<00:04:26.220> can<00:04:26.370> see

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
tried both sides of it then you can see

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.410 
tried both sides of it then you can see
which<00:04:26.910> one<00:04:27.120> you

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
which one you

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.360
