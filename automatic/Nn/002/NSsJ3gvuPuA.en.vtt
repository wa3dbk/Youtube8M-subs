00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.199
 saga cci rennes which is today I 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.809
 am here to introduce you my all 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.699
 again won on a nouma machine 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.550
 so you immediately see that 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:45.050
 it's rather a big gameplay but before 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:48.379
 to talk about that I'm going to thank the 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.510
 common zombie fr and coast cf 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.910
 because I'm going to send it back 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.690
 gameplay I thank them in advance at 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.789
 case where but he would give him so I 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.579
 played on china au nouma before 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:05.269
 several people shout tashi shit 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:09.170
 t is or not I have not quoted at all I 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.280
 did this video yesterday exactly and 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.619
 when you go to see the sleeves are 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.750
 super fast because I made this gameplay 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.070
 on world at war or how do you see 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.479
 the sleeve and we have to start there is 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.079
 not even 30 seconds and she's already 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.880
 over because on this moratorium for this 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:25.189
 that they do not know I think that the 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.640
 most know it but on some 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.259
 maps 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.700
 there is only a wave of zombies then 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.270
 there is a notice of the hotels and china rents 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.649
 at mas de rise and verrÃ¼ckt I do not know 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.450
 not but in any case china au nouma 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.140
 ennaji roads hotels are really 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.479
 simple on this world at war because the 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.969
 waves are really short 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.909
 thanks to that in fact that there is 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.469
 only one wave of leman are 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.049
 really short because there is only one 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:53.450
 wave of zombies lose by sleeve and 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.789
 it's rather nice because if 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.189
 I wanted to make a hundred and forty three 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.930
 sleeves on the hull so I will play 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.610
 more because serving themselves it's 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.950
 as much turn and everything but I would have put 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:12.060
 I think a good thirty hours 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:14.970
 while there I did 149 round in 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.430
 1h30 2h maximum 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:22.030
 so it's still relatively short 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.010
 but the little concern fine or if the little 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.930
 flat we will say that there is on this world 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.910
 at war is that you do not have the 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.470
 quick rivail so that they do not 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.760
 do not know what if that's the asset that 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.370
 allows you somehow from you 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.920
 resuscitate once you have fallen to the ground 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.560
 then solo savored at Nimes and 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.650
 many that allows you to revive 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.760
 your colleague faster but on 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.830
 this moratorium 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.310
 this asset is available but 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.200
 unfortunately solo it only serves to 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.610
 nothing you can buy but it you 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.900
 serves to revive your colleague more 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.880
 quickly but since you do not have 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.560
 colleagues there is no use ie 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.970
 that you buy it will not make you 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.470
 not if you fall and that at the beginning 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.920
 I did not understand so I did 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.300
 several parties like that where I did 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.459
 he had somehow because I 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.250
 did not understand I had bought it and I 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.720
 will die and I rally but not there was 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.280
 marked late game so I started 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.290
 to moan because I did not understand the 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.260
 everything that was actually happening why 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.299
 not why they were not working and 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.580
 down after a while I understood I 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.230
 said to me good actually it's that used to 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.410
 nothing at all and yes it is according to fathi 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.799
 no use at all on this on this world 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.470
 at war 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:36.209
 so here it is otherwise well listen to you I 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:39.370
 advise everyone to test this this 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.959
 order this map on this game so for 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.280
 those who do not have it but who have the 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.500
 game frankly I advise you to 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.739
 buy it because those voices there it costs 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.230
 the noma pack costs 800 microsoft 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.690
 points which amounts to 1.10 euro which 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.660
 does not come back very much good after if this 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.070
 pink tell me that there is soon black hawk 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.400
 from you and keep warm for back up 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.140
 I understand but personally 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.480
 I bought him there is now a 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.300
 week I think it's easter or two 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.790
 weeks 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.830
 and here I do not regret it and I will 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.020
 buy only because I learned 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.090
 that I did not know before but I 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.310
 learned that there was only one 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.140
 zombie wave by sleeve 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.580
 and if I thought it was 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.959
 the opportunity to finally overcome 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.870
 leaving less luck we forget because 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.020
 that my record in Zambia otherwise it was 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:29.240
 80 solo round on ascension and ben 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.580
 here I wanted to beat him and try to 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.310
 do the most and now bah listen 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.870
 it's managed to 147 round then 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.490
 maybe some will say yeah but 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.740
 it's not really hardcore there is only one 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.740
 alone or anything but it's 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:46.910
 still eat without finally dying 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:49.070
 149 sleeve without dying only once 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.800
 obviously goes to 149 so you have 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.900
 also see my death and that's it I need 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.640
 a little bit the balls of being dead 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.610
 like that I'll find it maybe a 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:02.390
 this time if I have the opportunity or if I have 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.830
 not the laziness we'll say but if not 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.930
 you ask me for rankings 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.330
 so I am very well ranked all of 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.010
 same but if I'm going to look in the 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.530
 game rankings that are totally 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.810
 fake you see guys who did 2 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.140
 millions of sleeves so that on the other hand 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.780
 did not believe them that's totally false the 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.270
 true record on this map legitimately 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.790
 which is on youtube so I put you 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.370
 not mine because judged me I the 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.260
 video I loved it I did not see them 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.910
 but hey it's a colleague of mine who tells me 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:37.400
 so said the real record and 201 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.720
 sorry thousand wave so a thousand wave 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.450
 it's pretty good anyway 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.550
 the guy he had to put a lot of time 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.310
 I pass I think at least a good 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.780
 ten or more hours 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.160
 finally do not actually at all because 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.660
 that I say because that and it's 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.669
 more and more no but no there is in which 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.930
 so change there as you see I'm 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:57.590
 get stuck in the corner just stupidly 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.870
 and I'm dying so here's listening to this in 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.000
 you who I hope this gameplay has you 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.460
 more thanking you next is done to zombie that 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.230
 mutate to if you wade me and to the 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.230
 next on my channel is holding
