00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.130 
I think when they ever designed the SG
they<00:04:04.310> didn't<00:04:04.580> have<00:04:04.790> his<00:04:05.690> style<00:04:05.990> of<00:04:06.080> guitar

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
not think of it at all I think about

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.340 
not think of it at all I think about
that<00:04:56.090> when<00:04:56.300> I<00:04:56.420> was<00:04:56.450> in<00:04:56.660> him<00:04:56.810> playing<00:04:57.050> and<00:04:57.320> I

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
that when I was in him playing and I

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:06.800 
that when I was in him playing and I
think<00:04:57.590> that's<00:04:57.740> so<00:04:57.950> interesting

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:13.930 

Oh

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.630 

I<00:05:14.300> think<00:05:14.690> Ozzy<00:05:14.870> was<00:05:15.410> a<00:05:15.440> huge<00:05:15.830> part<00:05:16.100> of<00:05:16.190> that<00:05:16.370> too

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
I think Ozzy was a huge part of that too

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.040 
I think Ozzy was a huge part of that too
as<00:05:16.970> a<00:05:17.690> frontman<00:05:18.560> as<00:05:18.800> a<00:05:18.830> character<00:05:19.490> he<00:05:19.760> was<00:05:20.690> this

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
as a frontman as a character he was this

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.610 
as a frontman as a character he was this
weird-ass<00:05:21.980> guy<00:05:22.540> who<00:05:23.540> was<00:05:24.110> just<00:05:24.140> really

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
interesting and bizarre and I think he

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.570 
interesting and bizarre and I think he
was<00:05:28.910> old<00:05:29.090> he<00:05:29.360> created<00:05:29.810> a<00:05:29.870> lot<00:05:30.050> of<00:05:30.080> the<00:05:30.470> cult<00:05:31.430> of
