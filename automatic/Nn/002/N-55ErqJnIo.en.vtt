 quickly how to add two contacts

 from two countries only on something very 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.530
 general for you to take the idea 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:55.960
 of how it should be done then first 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.969
 that everything returns here to whatsapp as 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.399
 you will see I do not have any contact if 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.110
 click here up in that envelope will tell me 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.269
 that I do not have any contact in the 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.039
 whatsapp contact then we go to 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.130
 add two other contacts first 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:10.720
 countries and this we must do first 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.640
 adding contacts to our 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.900
 addresses address then entering 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.790
 here by the telefonito 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.640
 in our case we go to the option of 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.580
 agenda being in the calendar option 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.490
 we click here where it says add to a 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.500
 face with a + and then we say here 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.480
 on the phone 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.230
 we give it a name in this case I'm going to 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.330
 add someone from brazil 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.970
 we are not going to enter the most important thing 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.620
 which is the phone here where most 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.480
 of people fail and that's why they do not 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.010
 it works does not add contacts of 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.570
 other countries and they write me and they give me 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.300
 comments like adding contacts from 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.520
 other countries 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.220
 and the problem since they commit two 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.690
 mistakes one if for example I am from 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.210
 Colombia and if I'm going to add someone from 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.280
 Colombia alone I just have to add the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.810
 cell phone number but if 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.070
 I will add a person from another country 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.520
 for example in this case that I'm going to 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.650
 add someone from Brazil to 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.510
 enter the easy call and first 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.390
 then the phone number on 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.360
 Brazil but before writing the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:17.880
 indicative brazil that I must enter 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:20.700
 the symbol plus the symbol plus 55 space 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.530
 and then there if the phone number in 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.530
 this case we add this I have here 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.850
 and we ready to save 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.700
 yahuar of one we are going to give back to us as 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.810
 will see if the contact exist 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.270
 I automatically get the option to 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.480
 Whatsapp 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.110
 then we are going to add another branch here 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.750
 plus 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.330
 we added another we had an equator for 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.400
 example here the player 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.000
 and again the phone as I said 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.640
 very important the symbol more because of 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.180
 another country followed the indicative of that 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.360
 country in this case indicative of colors 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:12.040
 593 space in this case the phone is 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:17.510
 98 5 48 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:20.209
 59 80 and this we confirm that the phone 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.740
 is well entered but is not going 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.470
 to work 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.800
 of love ready 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.230
 and ready here it's already automatically 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.870
 quickly the contact exists whatsapp 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.460
 and then I can get out completely 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.530
 I have two contacts in my notebook 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.450
 directions that is important not 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.470
 saved whatsapp but the notebook 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.780

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.650

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.900
