00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello dear friends my name is 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:09.200
 Dani disputes an obvious classic champion 2014 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.130
 I welcome you here at the club 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.460
 sport life 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.130
 we wo n't have him a couple of lessons I will give you 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.039
 I can show a couple of exercises to tell 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.070
 a couple of my secrets and i hope you this 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.240
 like and help thanks at first 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.510
 look it will look like 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.810
 normal exercise just roars the mushroom 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:36.899
 and craving for chest 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:41.430
 but this is generally another exercise this for 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:45.420
 these are exercises to refine your back on 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:49.320
 quality is no longer on extensions just 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:53.690
 look how i do it i will try 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:57.859
 show you how to do it right 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:02.899
 exercise to produce and at the bottom a little 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:08.119
 delayed for a couple of seconds to strain 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.119
 all the muscles that should work 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:51.560
 so only the back and biceps work 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:55.460
 at all the back is not strained exactly 9 below 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:01.730
 chest and it only works this part 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:03.580
 backs it for an attraction or for those 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.580
 who perform on stage very 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:11.660
 useful exercise 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:14.980
 the back becomes thicker and begins to divide 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:19.280
 everyone thinks this is a token exercise 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.200
 ironing is not true because if 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.930
 you pay him make them you on 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.760
 domolinka 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:32.560
 bend back and strain at all 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.750
 other muscles so I think by this 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.750
 exercise to achieve this quality on 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:43.190
 back the next very very good 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:49.760
 exercise for the back too lower back 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:53.330
 works like this simulator made i 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.780
 I don't know why he did that, but I think 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.570
 is not 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.970
 it's small it does not properly done because 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:05.900
 what if you follow it like this and 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.570
 pull as he designed you 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:13.880
 train more shoulders 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:16.980
 back delta so i do it so i 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:22.200
 stop right 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:27.000
 legs straight and try and well all backs 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:31.380
 this movement goes in a semicircle and 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:36.330
 it turns out again this part of the back 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.330
 I will pump you 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.570
 most importantly feel those muscles 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.790
 you want to pump 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.130
 it is very very important to achieve 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:30.610
 good progress 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:35.930
 always do four heavy approaches and 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.760
 always 10 to 12 reps it goes on 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:42.919
 quality 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:45.500
 on a set of muscles to a set of mass a if you 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.080
 do less than ten it only 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.990
 goes for strength and for mass 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:54.139
 so always ten or twelve 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:57.970
 generation is also very good exercise 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:02.760
 for rear deltas 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:06.240
 kinds i speak english and 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:10.590
 also 10 to 12 repetitions 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.590
 3 to 4 approaches I exercise this always 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:19.640
 doing in preparation 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:20.940
 I add it to normal training 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.480
 delta 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:28.980
 it's just to download it goes to 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.760
 delta on the original upper back and on 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.630
 trail 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:37.910
 very useful very good exercise 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:41.600
 helps these muscles share and 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.600
 rounder became 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:20.120
 yes for yourself 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.120
 when you do this exercise as 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:28.500
 control this weight and when you 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:33.170
 produce it don't just stand still 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:36.830
 see hands feel like when you 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.830
 remove weight 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.960
 lean back opi hold out 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:48.890
 form the engine your your body forward 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.390
 It turns out such pumping
