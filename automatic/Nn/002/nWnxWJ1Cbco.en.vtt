not a sample for me because I've had

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.750 
not a sample for me because I've had
this<00:05:10.110> before<00:05:10.350> not<00:05:10.800> in<00:05:10.860> full<00:05:11.220> size<00:05:11.430> but<00:05:11.730> a

smaller<00:05:12.480> sampled<00:05:13.230> in<00:05:13.350> this<00:05:13.530> and<00:05:13.770> with<00:05:14.400> that

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
smaller sampled in this and with that

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.700 
smaller sampled in this and with that
really<00:05:14.970> tiny<00:05:15.150> example<00:05:15.690> I<00:05:15.780> used<00:05:16.050> it<00:05:16.200> about<00:05:16.410> five

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
really tiny example I used it about five

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.350 
really tiny example I used it about five
times<00:05:16.950> and<00:05:17.310> I'm<00:05:17.520> still<00:05:17.880> working<00:05:18.240> on<00:05:18.300> it

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
times and I'm still working on it

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.630 
times and I'm still working on it
there's<00:05:19.050> still<00:05:19.380> a<00:05:19.410> lot<00:05:19.620> inside<00:05:19.890> I<00:05:20.220> could<00:05:20.520> still

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
there's still a lot inside I could still

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.120 
there's still a lot inside I could still
use<00:05:20.760> it<00:05:21.090> so<00:05:21.810> that<00:05:22.020> means<00:05:22.260> that<00:05:22.500> this<00:05:22.740> product

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
use it so that means that this product

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.400 
use it so that means that this product
being<00:05:23.940> a<00:05:24.120> little<00:05:24.360> bigger<00:05:24.600> than<00:05:24.780> that<00:05:24.840> is<00:05:25.170> going

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
being a little bigger than that is going

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.170 
being a little bigger than that is going
to<00:05:25.470> go<00:05:25.560> away<00:05:25.650> longer<00:05:26.040> way<00:05:26.400> because<00:05:26.940> a<00:05:26.970> little

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
to go away longer way because a little

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.510 
to go away longer way because a little
goes<00:05:27.330> a<00:05:27.450> long<00:05:27.540> way<00:05:27.810> with<00:05:27.960> this<00:05:28.020> its<00:05:28.860> oil<00:05:29.130> free

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
goes a long way with this its oil free

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.900 
goes a long way with this its oil free
and<00:05:29.790> i<00:05:29.880> believe<00:05:30.270> it<00:05:30.540> is<00:05:30.570> also<00:05:30.930> water<00:05:31.890> based<00:05:32.310> so

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
and i believe it is also water based so

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.490 
and i believe it is also water based so
that's<00:05:33.060> really<00:05:33.360> good<00:05:33.690> because<00:05:36.350> it's<00:05:37.350> not

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
that's really good because it's not

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.120 
that's really good because it's not
silicon-based<00:05:38.310> it's<00:05:38.730> water-based<00:05:40.130> anything

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
silicon-based it's water-based anything

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.390 
silicon-based it's water-based anything
that's<00:05:41.310> better<00:05:41.490> for<00:05:41.760> your<00:05:41.850> skin<00:05:42.180> and<00:05:43.070> I<00:05:44.070> really
