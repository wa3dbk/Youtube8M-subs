00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
know also this hair is flat iron safe I

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.840 
know also this hair is flat iron safe I
flat<00:05:24.810> iron<00:05:25.050> this<00:05:25.200> hair<00:05:25.500> um<00:05:26.010> I<00:05:26.310> wouldn't<00:05:26.520> say<00:05:26.669> go

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
flat iron this hair um I wouldn't say go

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.150 
flat iron this hair um I wouldn't say go
over<00:05:27.150> 400°<00:05:27.840> though<00:05:28.320> because<00:05:28.620> you<00:05:28.680> might<00:05:28.860> burn

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
over 400° though because you might burn

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:35.330 
over 400° though because you might burn
it<00:05:29.400> because<00:05:29.700> it<00:05:29.940> is<00:05:31.070> it<00:05:32.070> is<00:05:32.720> 100%<00:05:34.280> human<00:05:35.280> hair

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
it because it is it is 100% human hair

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.030 
it because it is it is 100% human hair
style<00:05:35.970> mix<00:05:36.360> so<00:05:36.870> it's<00:05:37.080> not<00:05:37.320> all<00:05:37.620> the<00:05:37.770> way<00:05:37.800> with

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
style mix so it's not all the way with

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.400 
style mix so it's not all the way with
his<00:05:38.190> percent<00:05:38.610> human<00:05:38.880> hair<00:05:38.940> it<00:05:39.600> is<00:05:40.050> synthetic

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
his percent human hair it is synthetic

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:45.590 
his percent human hair it is synthetic
fibers<00:05:41.280> in<00:05:41.700> here<00:05:42.229> so<00:05:43.820> when<00:05:44.820> I<00:05:44.850> flattened<00:05:45.450> I

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
fibers in here so when I flattened I

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.540 
fibers in here so when I flattened I
just<00:05:45.810> bumped<00:05:46.320> it<00:05:46.410> a<00:05:46.530> little<00:05:46.800> bit<00:05:46.919> because

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
just bumped it a little bit because

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.550 
just bumped it a little bit because
since<00:05:47.940> it<00:05:48.060> is<00:05:48.150> a<00:05:48.180> straight<00:05:48.600> look<00:05:48.840> I<00:05:49.050> wanted<00:05:49.440> it

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
since it is a straight look I wanted it

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.370 
since it is a straight look I wanted it
to<00:05:49.680> be<00:05:49.830> straight<00:05:50.190> and<00:05:50.490> chic<00:05:50.850> so<00:05:51.630> I<00:05:51.660> did<00:05:52.020> bump

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
to be straight and chic so I did bump

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.650 
to be straight and chic so I did bump
the<00:05:52.530> ends<00:05:52.740> a<00:05:53.250> little<00:05:53.400> bit<00:05:53.550> and<00:05:54.030> I<00:05:54.210> bumped<00:05:54.450> my
