00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
cartridges because even after I try to

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.670 
cartridges because even after I try to
clean<00:00:16.139> them<00:00:16.609> it<00:00:17.609> just<00:00:17.640> seems<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.900> when<00:00:19.590> I've

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.689 
clean them it just seems to when I've
every<00:00:19.859> whenever<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.130> try<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.340> clean<00:00:20.580> the

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.010 
every whenever I try to clean the
printhead<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.270> seems<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.570> make<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.840> situation

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
printhead it seems to make the situation

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.400 
printhead it seems to make the situation
worse<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:23.330> clean<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.539> heads<00:00:24.810> like<00:00:25.019> three<00:00:25.289> or

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
worse I clean the heads like three or

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.240 
worse I clean the heads like three or
four<00:00:25.439> times<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.160> then<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.699> stopped<00:00:27.000> printing

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
four times and then it stopped printing

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.450 
four times and then it stopped printing
so<00:00:29.250> then<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.519> tried<00:00:29.849> using<00:00:30.800> chug<00:00:31.800> wiping<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
so then I tried using chug wiping the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.650 
so then I tried using chug wiping the
print<00:00:32.850> heads<00:00:33.469> which<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.590> was<00:00:34.710> told<00:00:34.890> not<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.660> but

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
print heads which I was told not to but

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.110 
print heads which I was told not to but
I<00:00:36.989> was<00:00:37.530> able<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.890> get<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.309> work<00:00:38.460> by<00:00:38.910> wiping

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
I was able to get it to work by wiping

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.360 
I was able to get it to work by wiping
it<00:00:40.010> so<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.040> just<00:00:41.370> wanted<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.730> show<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.090> what<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
it so I just wanted to show you what the

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:51.260 
it so I just wanted to show you what the
cartridge<00:00:44.370> looks<00:00:44.550> like

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.290 

this<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.960> what<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.320> cartridge<00:00:52.740> is<00:00:56.300> sold

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
this is what the cartridge is sold

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.040 
this is what the cartridge is sold
everything<00:00:57.540> is<00:00:57.840> over

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:11.669 

you<00:01:04.620> want<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.890> take<00:01:05.130> it<00:01:05.280> off

00:01:11.669 --> 00:01:11.679 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:12.899 

the<00:01:11.950> reason<00:01:12.219> why<00:01:12.340> I<00:01:12.399> don't<00:01:12.490> like<00:01:12.700> these<00:01:12.850> kind

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
the reason why I don't like these kind

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.270 
the reason why I don't like these kind
of<00:01:13.179> cartridges<00:01:13.780> is<00:01:13.990> basically<00:01:14.469> the<00:01:14.770> printhead

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
of cartridges is basically the printhead

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.249 
of cartridges is basically the printhead
is<00:01:19.140> attached<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.409> cartridge<00:01:20.920> so<00:01:21.250> you<00:01:21.310> could

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
is attached the cartridge so you could

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.399 
is attached the cartridge so you could
refill<00:01:23.259> these<00:01:23.439> cartridges<00:01:24.369> but<00:01:24.939> then<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
refill these cartridges but then the

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.929 
refill these cartridges but then the
printhead<00:01:27.250> gets<00:01:27.579> slowly<00:01:28.209> and<00:01:28.569> slowly<00:01:28.810> worse

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
printhead gets slowly and slowly worse

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.069 
printhead gets slowly and slowly worse
but<00:01:30.939> I<00:01:31.090> think<00:01:31.329> there's<00:01:31.569> a<00:01:31.659> problem<00:01:31.810> with<00:01:31.990> my

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
but I think there's a problem with my

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:35.340 
but I think there's a problem with my
printer<00:01:32.679> where<00:01:33.060> it's<00:01:34.060> not<00:01:34.270> clean<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:35.020> print

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
printer where it's not clean the print

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.789 
printer where it's not clean the print
heads<00:01:35.530> properly<00:01:36.189> a<00:01:37.140> little<00:01:38.140> too<00:01:38.350> tired<00:01:38.649> to

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
heads properly a little too tired to

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.639 
heads properly a little too tired to
take<00:01:38.950> apart<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.670> printer<00:01:40.000> because<00:01:40.299> I<00:01:40.649> can

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
take apart the printer because I can

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.710 
take apart the printer because I can
just<00:01:41.740> buy<00:01:41.979> an<00:01:42.130> inkjet<00:01:42.399> for<00:01:42.819> twenty<00:01:43.390> or<00:01:43.509> thirty

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
just buy an inkjet for twenty or thirty

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.649 
just buy an inkjet for twenty or thirty
dollars<00:01:44.520> versus<00:01:45.520> taking<00:01:45.729> apart<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.270> printer

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
dollars versus taking apart the printer

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.440 
dollars versus taking apart the printer
but<00:01:47.140> anyways<00:01:47.579> I'm<00:01:48.579> gonna<00:01:48.759> try<00:01:49.030> cleaning<00:01:49.329> the

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
but anyways I'm gonna try cleaning the

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.910 
but anyways I'm gonna try cleaning the
print<00:01:49.780> heads<00:01:50.189> when<00:01:51.189> I<00:01:51.219> have<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.489> time<00:01:51.520> with

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
print heads when I have the time with

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.380 
print heads when I have the time with
cotton<00:01:53.920> swab<00:01:54.130> with<00:01:54.729> some<00:01:54.909> water

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
cotton swab with some water

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.940 
cotton swab with some water
I<00:01:57.179> found<00:01:58.179> this<00:01:58.329> on<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:58.569> website<00:01:58.780> so<00:01:59.439> give<00:01:59.770> that

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
I found this on the website so give that

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.280 
I found this on the website so give that
