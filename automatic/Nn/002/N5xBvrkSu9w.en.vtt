00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.529
 we are visiting ecological 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.210
 farm over s in raalte 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.280
 for, among other things, organic plus pork meat 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.889
 but we also have several 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.309
 vegetables and grain are grown in 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.890
 we have the sows after this space 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.140
 sit here they can enjoy 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.480
 of a straw bed 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.340
 and outside we can go to the mud pool 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.439
 with three months 3 weeks and 3 days 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.810
 the sows go to the 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.630
 they are going to shed maternity cages to a4 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.120
 So to return to after granaries 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.100
 from the 115 day 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.140
 pigs who love barns 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.990
 That's why we have this good brush in it 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.370
 the shed or go so that they are nice against it 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.480
 can apply for 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.610
 they also do it on the corners of the 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.310
 walls as you can see but the brush 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.790
 both I finish a nice device 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:58.070
 they have automatic feeding system here 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:01:00.920
 and through which they can eat their food 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.140
 and outside a goal for hold 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.780
 for extra grass 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.720
 this is the pig pool where the pigs 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.740
 in the summer so nice in the mud 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.880
 can lie 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.670
 enjoy a yes almost sauna say 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.840
 a mud bath around it is also very good 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.160
 for the skin 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.900
 they then suffer less from scabies and 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.450
 it they will just enjoy going to 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.220
 the balls and 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.590
 and they can also have it in the summer 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.130
 from the grassland next door in this 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.690
 name 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.440
 the maternity pens here become the piglets 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:40.270
 born so the sows after that come here 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.270
 so 3 days before casting 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.580
 so liar get here so then the 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.430
 piglets and stay here for 6 weeks 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.840
 together with the piglet and that is inside 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.770
 large enough to get rid of the mother 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.080
 can do 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.670
 sows that get to hunt twitch 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.260
 landscape 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.290
 and so come twice a year is us 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.590
 sit down 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.420
 these mountains are best days born 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.400
 teething of pi got not sharpened and 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.760
 the curly tail may also be used for piglets 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.610
 to hold 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.530
 this is possible with organic because the pigs 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.239
 have sufficient distraction and space and 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.170
 so stay away from each other 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.870
 this is the department where the pigs come 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.110
 so when come from the mother 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.049
 about 6 weeks old we step them 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.489
 40 pigs in this off 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:32.210
 here they also have a tasty one 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.450
 straw bed to lie comfortably 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:39.290
 they are lying about you to them 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:43.130
 about 50 pounds and then we place 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.390
 she left after the agnes shed 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.520
 organic pigs are delicious 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.610
 space normal pigs have approx 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.960
 0.7 square meters at your disposal 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.210
 organic pigs no less than two 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.590
 bowls four square meters so that they 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.090
 moving more meat also becomes one 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.220
 firmer 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.740
 black shoes also slowly become the normal 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.790
 around 750 grams per day 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.440
 therefore you have fewer problems 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.470
 moisture loss during packing and 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.910
 the more remains in the pan 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.310
 but how do you recognize a biologist piece 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.110
 from this you the supermarket 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.730
 as a consumer you recognize organic meat 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.580
 to the eko quality mark 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:21.110
 or to the green new European 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.520
 emblem with a leaf 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.010
 you have a mixed organic 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.780
 company what does it mean 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.510
 besides there we have pigs here too 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.490
 arable farming and horticulture on the farm as 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.540
 organic farmers try the land them 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.820
 keep healthy 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.950
 this can in different ways 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.470
 of which is alternating 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.080
 so the second the plants once in the 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.140
 now on the same plot for six years 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.170
 so artichoke here next year would be here 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.320
 potatoes stand and the next year 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.260
 vegetables and then pick up another grain 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.360
 that is a very quiet little what was 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.500
 asks from the bottom 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.730
 so that the soil can relax again 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.720
 come 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:07.050
 and then another intensive mast 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.060
 here we are the grain on a nagra field 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.590
 so use this as if they 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:16.049
 Pig food done this is now almost ripe 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.910
 or does not drive yet but the monkey is coming now 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.720
 almost in it still needs about a month 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.230
 and then it is ready again 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.230
 to be harvested
