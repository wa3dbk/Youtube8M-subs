00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.060

 the main advantages of rugby 5 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.239

 rugby without violence ok but concretely 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.100
 how it works 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.410
 5-a-side rugby is played with teams of 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.480
 ten people including five singing and five 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.430
 substitutes the goal is always to 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.530
 score a try by putting the ball 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.600
 behind the goal line for 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.580
 progress you have to move forward by doing 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.020
 passes backwards a player from 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.380
 his team to stop his opponent 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.610
 we have to touch him tomorrow from the front and 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.410
 back 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.130
 the handover takes place between the 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.810
 legs then the game goes on but the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.429
 rugby at 5 is it an easy sport for 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.840
 as much as it is not necessary to be in 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:28.289
 very good physical condition to play 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.789
 to five-wise rugby or 18 to 70 years old 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.789

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.330
 physical at the entrance is accessible to 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.610

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.000
 we have teams that can be either 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.500
 male over 35 years old is mixed with 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.709
 at least two players in the field 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.030
 in Ile de France on the committee 

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:47.340
 territorial we are putting in 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.380
 place a women's open ie 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.580
 exclusively female teams this 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.580
 which does not exist yet at 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.200
 national is a sport that requires little 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.179
 physical qualities within the meaning of 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.700
 physical strength but that goes a lot more 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.920
 work the cardiovascular vascular 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.039
 everything that is taken over all that is 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.120
 playing the game positioning and then that 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.980
 allows 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.900
 to further develop tactics where 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.590
 often women like them are a 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.590
 little bit stronger
