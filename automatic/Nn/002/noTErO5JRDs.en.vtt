00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
Philippines and from there I basically

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.910 
Philippines and from there I basically
became<00:00:33.809> interested<00:00:34.470> in<00:00:34.559> Bible<00:00:34.860> translation

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
became interested in Bible translation

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.420 
became interested in Bible translation
myself<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:35.940> when<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.600> actually<00:00:36.809> heard<00:00:37.770> what

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
myself so when I actually heard what

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.820 
myself so when I actually heard what
needs<00:00:38.699> were<00:00:38.910> out<00:00:39.030> there<00:00:39.300> people<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.290> existed

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:40.830 
needs were out there people that existed

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.100 
needs were out there people that existed
that<00:00:41.149> didn't<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.450> scriptures<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:42.960> their

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
that didn't have the scriptures in their

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.819 
that didn't have the scriptures in their
language<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.790> I<00:00:44.790> understand<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:46.440> impact

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
language and I understand the impact

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.979 
language and I understand the impact
that<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.160> Bible<00:00:47.520> actually<00:00:47.640> has<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.149> people<00:00:48.540> so

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
that the Bible actually has on people so

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.650 
that the Bible actually has on people so
I<00:00:49.020> decided<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.820> will<00:00:50.880> also<00:00:51.329> get<00:00:51.480> behind

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
I decided that I will also get behind

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.490 
I decided that I will also get behind
Wickliffe<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.710> Bible<00:00:53.010> translation<00:00:56.809> ort<00:00:57.840> came

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
Wickliffe and Bible translation ort came

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.040 
Wickliffe and Bible translation ort came
about<00:00:58.739> because<00:00:59.250> there's<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.910> every<00:01:00.660> groups<00:01:00.870> in

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
about because there's a every groups in

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.040 
about because there's a every groups in
the<00:01:01.110> middle<00:01:01.290> of<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> island<00:01:02.809> it's<00:01:03.809> very

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
the middle of the island it's very

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.510 
the middle of the island it's very
unclear<00:01:04.290> about<00:01:04.440> what<00:01:04.589> languages<00:01:05.070> they<00:01:05.190> speak

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
unclear about what languages they speak

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:13.090 
unclear about what languages they speak
so<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.030> decided<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.930> investigate

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.149 

there's<00:01:14.100> no<00:01:14.360> real<00:01:15.360> roads<00:01:15.630> there's<00:01:16.159> dirt

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
there's no real roads there's dirt

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.280 
there's no real roads there's dirt
tracks<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.790> goat<00:01:18.030> track<00:01:18.299> sand<00:01:18.659> would<00:01:19.049> have<00:01:19.170> to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
tracks and goat track sand would have to

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.350 
tracks and goat track sand would have to
hike<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.830> would<00:01:20.009> have<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.310> jump<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.240> back

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
hike and would have to jump in the back

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.720 
hike and would have to jump in the back
of<00:01:21.479> you

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.610 

basically<00:01:29.360> drive<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:30.050> the<00:01:30.140> end<00:01:30.260> of<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.440> road

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
basically drive to the end of the road

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.160 
basically drive to the end of the road
and<00:01:30.800> it's<00:01:31.220> got<00:01:31.400> a<00:01:31.430> 45<00:01:32.090> or<00:01:32.120> 15<00:01:32.570> minute<00:01:32.780> hike<00:01:32.930> in

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
and it's got a 45 or 15 minute hike in

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.290 
and it's got a 45 or 15 minute hike in

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.419 

Melissa<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.109> Julie<00:02:05.530> they<00:02:05.710> took<00:02:05.890> wordless

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
Melissa and Julie they took wordless

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.309 
Melissa and Julie they took wordless
they<00:02:07.090> had<00:02:07.270> a<00:02:07.299> word<00:02:07.509> list<00:02:07.749> of<00:02:07.869> a<00:02:07.929> neighboring

language<00:02:08.679> and<00:02:08.950> I'd<00:02:09.610> basically<00:02:09.819> asked<00:02:10.119> how<00:02:10.450> do

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
language and I'd basically asked how do

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.270 
language and I'd basically asked how do
you<00:02:10.599> say<00:02:10.780> this<00:02:10.989> through<00:02:11.230> a<00:02:11.260> translator<00:02:11.739> now

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
you say this through a translator now

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.550 
you say this through a translator now
would<00:02:12.459> essentially<00:02:12.930> find<00:02:13.930> out<00:02:14.140> whether<00:02:14.410> the

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
would essentially find out whether the

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.930 
would essentially find out whether the
language<00:02:14.830> was<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.040> same<00:02:15.250> how<00:02:15.519> different<00:02:15.879> it

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
language was the same how different it

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.210 
language was the same how different it
was<00:02:16.090> different<00:02:16.989> words<00:02:17.349> totally<00:02:17.890> different

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
was different words totally different

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.440 
was different words totally different
context<00:02:23.099> I<00:02:24.099> would<00:02:24.430> also<00:02:24.670> take<00:02:25.090> voice

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
context I would also take voice

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.780 
context I would also take voice
recordings<00:02:26.019> of<00:02:26.140> customs<00:02:26.590> stories<00:02:27.040> to

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
recordings of customs stories to

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.180 
recordings of customs stories to
basically<00:02:28.180> compare<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:29.410> custom<00:02:29.830> story<00:02:30.069> in

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
basically compare the custom story in

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.160 
basically compare the custom story in
one<00:02:30.310> village<00:02:30.519> to<00:02:30.910> another<00:02:31.299> village<00:02:31.599> I<00:02:32.019> would

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
one village to another village I would

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.809 
one village to another village I would
ask<00:02:32.500> them<00:02:32.799> you<00:02:32.950> know<00:02:32.980> what<00:02:33.190> language<00:02:33.340> did<00:02:33.670> the

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
ask them you know what language did the

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.220 
ask them you know what language did the
children<00:02:34.030> speak<00:02:34.450> what<00:02:34.660> language<00:02:34.959> did<00:02:35.110> the

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
children speak what language did the

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.809 
children speak what language did the
older<00:02:35.530> people<00:02:35.769> in<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.890> village<00:02:36.190> speak<00:02:36.459> we're

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
older people in the village speak we're

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.789 
older people in the village speak we're
trying<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.090> find<00:02:37.269> out<00:02:37.450> language<00:02:38.140> shift<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.650> see

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
trying to find out language shift to see

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.229 
trying to find out language shift to see
whether<00:02:38.980> new<00:02:39.430> languages<00:02:39.819> were<00:02:39.940> coming

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
whether new languages were coming

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.360 
whether new languages were coming
