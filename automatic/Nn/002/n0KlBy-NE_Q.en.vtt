00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.140
 half yes because it will last less in fact I will 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.430
 only one game fails on 72 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.570

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.820
 40th episode no no actually not there 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.800
 I can record two because they have 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.570
 lots of things to do if you don't succeed 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.879
 not even to bring me these episodes then 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.950
 instead of not bringing it to you 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.920
 I take advantage of one to tell you something 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.780
 during this video and two to make you for 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.239
 make this match that why 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.840
 you know I always bring you two videos though 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.760
 today I can't do because how 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.079
 you know I always bring you two videos only 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.750
 that I have to save the most time 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.879
 possible to register to the other sudan 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.050
 and okay just so sometimes it happens 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.660
 this time it happened right in the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.019
 fortieth to bad luck but what should I do 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.360
 to say 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.090
 I won't tell you now because I'll tell you 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.720
 during the game anyway that's cool 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.490
 we are first 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.979
 sorry if this episode does not last long 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.049
 but then I already said that I have to look 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.280
 to save as much time as possible for 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.979
 also save the other I must also 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.560
 mount must render montane is 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.460
 this other video for everything will be a 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.280
 infinity you can upload is I have to put in 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.220
 load together will grow all ok 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.900
 from this this formation here I have 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.540
 said everything will grow but not in the sense 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.250
 which will grow as a plant will grow 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.270
 in the sense it crashes 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.649
 crush ok that's okay but what should I do 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.750
 say that now is the time to say 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.549
 but then the many but you said that 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.220
 I do n't wait then a sentence won't 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.490
 may so that then in so many but you have 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.520
 having said that he throws a little too much time 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.890
 against teams that I would still fight 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.850
 so you have recommended cell phone 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.920
 of the matches 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.570
 But I don't want to do everything of mine 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.910
 intention I wanted to ask if second 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.470
 you are the pole to simulate the matches 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.569
 we will try to do as much as possible 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.489
 we succeed 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.900
 finish this whole season first 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.150
 of the end before the arrival of those who do 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.749
 16 so I ask you to let me know here 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.459
 under 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:21.799
 if you think I should simulate an ops 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.249
 this wall but single ray 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:28.280
 I don't know what the teams do anymore 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:31.099
 lower in the league let me know 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.469
 also against whom should I simulate nodes 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.500
 that all of you who can't play 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:38.120
 but now I take the safe goal though 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.769
 I believe it is also trained at the moment 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.079
 second season to simulate a little seen 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.180
 that I showed you that the parts 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.950
 eyes closed sometimes it's really for 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.919
 mac more cordate that you leave without queues a 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.000
 we are here the cross the ball remains 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:52.000
 there and who are 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.110
 it's presidential you did it I did 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.880
 because I put the face 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.520
 you want fishing at certain times 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.170
 let me know this too, I know I don't 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.400
 I put it because I 'm ugly because I do n't 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:16.320
 because there is a big nose 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.810
 fiction not admit it because I see where 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:26.310
 if you want me to know I feel a 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:29.580
 stupid little of stunned or nothing 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.750
 no no no cadu you want to defend ours 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.910
 salvatore de janeiro wanted to say god in 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.710
 world 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:43.200
 martines pop jazz or martinez ma la 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:46.080
 jackson martinez from the mids all that 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.450
 then the ball is signed in throw-in 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.870
 side but I think the first one ends here 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:55.890
 no cage time here but one to zero for 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:59.490
 us against berlin bed is what to say I am 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.260
 the stronger I am the stronger I am 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.760
 funeral made a hostage by morricone 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.740
 me there is no balcony without 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.270
 insurance doesn't matter here 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.040
 due to suspension 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.860
 the important of landing as tyco 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.470

 at most even entertained with a concert 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.620
 live having heard my singing skills a 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:32.389

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:36.410

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.620
 give us hope for this victory 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.160
 martinis look at them 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.320
 I saw nothing out of it 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.560
 jackson made in the past by put 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.750
 inside you can't risk good though 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.229
 it is not rigor because there is an injury 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.150
 after no it is given rigor 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:11.360
 yellow therefore it is rigor but we have 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.340
 lost player but for the excellent all but 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.090
 since I see everything that is not allowed 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.229
 all the dead are resounding of the uri e 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.910

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.830
 I do you a favor, please 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.750
 because I make only one game today 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.380
 so it will delight you with the rigor of 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:37.630
 montali 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.630
 in short, a great master in your time 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:49.479
 two to zero for us that does more with the buy 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:52.849
 in the league to a Moldovan at 75 o 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:54.620
 heroine duty a match matches 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:58.130
 arrival and it seems to me right took away 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:00.169
 has taken away a lot of shelter with 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:05.510
 the goal of magic that generally go 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:07.400

 touch hurt you jackson martinez o 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:17.900
 dominated mainly by shit but not 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.100
 he wanted to do it, I don't believe it 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:25.120
 I think 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:27.490
 come two months, no maybe 100 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.890
 morning I'm nothing but we lost 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:35.320
 verratti for two 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:38.860
 no it is not true nothing was done 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:42.250
 jackson marquis but verratti you do 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:44.950
 who breaks the cardone so nothing by 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:47.170
 I told him that these two was a bit 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.930
 less excuse me yet but in the meantime you have 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.850
 therefore, one of my vocal talents 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:55.810
 non-believers accepted from the song 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:58.270
 difficult and according to you have seen with i 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.990
 your eyes the prudence of mandate in 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.330
 goal after a penalty 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.350
 if i liked m like it they wouldn't 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.390
 let me know 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.190
 I like to put it but let me know 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.960
 although I think they need help no 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.660
 summer you liked flat methods 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:13.920
