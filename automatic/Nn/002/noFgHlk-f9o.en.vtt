00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.270 
this scale is pretty much the same thing
as<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.719> pan<00:00:13.260> atonic<00:00:13.650> scale<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:14.160> we

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
as the pan atonic scale that we

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.249 
as the pan atonic scale that we
discussed<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.969> first<00:00:15.269> video<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:16.080> lead

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:16.259 
discussed in the first video of the lead

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:18.890 
discussed in the first video of the lead
scale<00:00:16.529> series<00:00:17.330> but<00:00:18.330> we're<00:00:18.450> just<00:00:18.599> going<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.779> add

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
scale series but we're just going to add

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.179 
scale series but we're just going to add
in<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.140> few<00:00:19.290> more<00:00:19.410> notes<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.800> make<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.950> similar

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
in a few more notes to make a similar

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.620 
in a few more notes to make a similar
but<00:00:20.369> more<00:00:20.490> bluesy<00:00:20.849> or<00:00:21.029> leave<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.240> more<00:00:21.360> jazzy

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
but more bluesy or leave it more jazzy

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.290 
but more bluesy or leave it more jazzy
you<00:00:22.199> know<00:00:22.320> spice<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.770> up<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.949> little<00:00:23.100> bit<00:00:23.310> so

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
you know spice it up a little bit so

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:32.380 
you know spice it up a little bit so
here's<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.260> pattern<00:00:25.590> first<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.920> all<00:00:26.449> 14<00:00:28.640> 1<00:00:29.640> 2<00:00:30.119> 3

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:39.920 

13<00:00:33.920> 13<00:00:35.809> 414<00:00:37.010> 140<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:39.390> going<00:00:39.540> back<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.750> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
13 13 414 140 so going back to the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.340 
13 13 414 140 so going back to the
pentatonic<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.650> just<00:00:40.890> for<00:00:41.659> 13<00:00:42.659> 13<00:00:42.930> 13<00:00:43.760> 14<00:00:44.760> 14<00:00:45.350> so

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
pentatonic is just for 13 13 13 14 14 so

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.890 
pentatonic is just for 13 13 13 14 14 so
all<00:00:46.500> we're<00:00:46.650> doing<00:00:46.949> is<00:00:47.159> adding<00:00:47.519> in<00:00:47.970> the<00:00:48.210> second

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
all we're doing is adding in the second

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.600 
all we're doing is adding in the second
fret<00:00:49.140> or<00:00:49.580> the<00:00:50.580> second<00:00:50.940> position<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.989> UM

blues scale what we want to do to make
it<00:01:17.010> a<00:01:17.070> little<00:01:17.190> bit<00:01:17.340> better<00:01:17.520> because<00:01:17.640> that's

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
it a little bit better because that's

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.580 
it a little bit better because that's
kind<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.060> boring<00:01:18.300> we<00:01:18.810> want<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.050> add<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.380> few

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.770 
kind of boring we want to add in a few
more<00:01:19.680> notes<00:01:19.860> okay<00:01:20.760> so<00:01:20.820> let's<00:01:21.120> let's<00:01:21.450> look<00:01:21.630> at

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.030 
you play a lot of half-steps just a lot
of<00:01:27.900> passing<00:01:28.290> tones<00:01:30.410> just<00:01:31.410> like<00:01:31.560> on<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.800> fifth

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
of passing tones just like on that fifth

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.490 
of passing tones just like on that fifth
string<00:01:32.250> there<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:32.700> blue<00:01:32.880> skill<00:01:33.500> so

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
string there in the blue skill so

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.200 
string there in the blue skill so
everywhere<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:34.980> have<00:01:35.190> a<00:01:35.220> 13<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:36.030> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
everywhere we have a 13 in the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:46.969 
everywhere we have a 13 in the
pentatonic<00:01:36.570> scale<00:01:37.520> let's<00:01:38.520> do<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> passing<00:01:39.030> tone

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.380 

okay<00:01:47.979> so<00:01:48.040> you<00:01:48.189> can<00:01:48.310> see<00:01:48.460> it's<00:01:48.880> becoming<00:01:49.149> even

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
okay so you can see it's becoming even

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.969 
okay so you can see it's becoming even
more<00:01:49.420> jazzy<00:01:51.960> okay<00:01:52.960> we<00:01:53.380> get<00:01:53.500> down<00:01:53.680> here<00:01:53.799> to<00:01:53.950> the

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
more jazzy okay we get down here to the

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.109 
more jazzy okay we get down here to the
one<00:01:54.189> force<00:01:55.680> let's<00:01:56.680> add<00:01:56.920> in<00:01:57.189> a<00:01:57.369> whole<00:01:57.610> step<00:01:57.909> up

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
one force let's add in a whole step up

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.469 
one force let's add in a whole step up
from<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.420> fourth<00:01:58.750> position<00:02:00.090> on<00:02:01.090> both<00:02:01.360> the

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
from the fourth position on both the

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.330 
from the fourth position on both the
strings<00:02:02.789> okay<00:02:03.789> so<00:02:03.850> we<00:02:04.030> go<00:02:04.119> 14<00:02:04.479> 14<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.130> slide<00:02:06.130> up

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
strings okay so we go 14 14 and slide up

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.020 
strings okay so we go 14 14 and slide up
and<00:02:06.490> do<00:02:06.640> 13<00:02:07.149> 13<00:02:07.709> and<00:02:08.709> then<00:02:09.489> you<00:02:09.610> have<00:02:09.789> another

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
and do 13 13 and then you have another

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:21.420 
and do 13 13 and then you have another
13<00:02:10.599> so<00:02:11.500> add<00:02:11.680> in<00:02:12.040> your<00:02:12.069> passing<00:02:12.519> tones<00:02:19.920> okay<00:02:20.920> so

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
13 so add in your passing tones okay so

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.199 
13 so add in your passing tones okay so
starting<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.850> sound<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.090> little<00:02:22.209> bit<00:02:22.360> better
