00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:11.769
 ready for the tsarate 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.899
 set the stars - 

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:16.909
 third age university 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:20.109
 the perfect storm 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.109
 but they are extremely 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.560
 let's find out about the cards 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.560
 a lot of forcom alters 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.790
 we leave the pit lane 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.990
 that we carry towards the first 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.990
 we remain on the left side of the track 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.180
 3 we face the first one 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.470
 speed 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.050
 about 70 kilometers per hour in second gear 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.040
 let the car slide outwards 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.780
 we are particularly careful to take us out of the dark 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.420
 next one 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.030
 because it is connected to a difficult left technique and a bay starter 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.830
 missive matters 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.830
 and as soon as you arrive by rope you can accelerate 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.130
 extremely driven trait that puts a strain on the car's qualities is 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.000
 an extremely left he right 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.340
 where it can come out of the car's oversteer and where it feels 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.240
 indeed heller mind make the load change 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.400
 eiteam left hand hairpin right here 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.340
 use the brand on the moon 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.770
 can allow you to open the bellucci 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.300
 you change gear you arrive in third 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.720
 after which they handed down to us second violates 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.140
 and here we must be careful because if the index is a sweet change in load 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.240
 you could lose the rear end 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.320
 we arrive third secondary 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.830
 xke you go to a very long left here you have to try not to use 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.170
 too much steering stay close to the curb and fas related tour to arsoli 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.600
 very very long duma key 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.600
 you win second and then pass to the third 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.269
 you must try to slide the summit 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.140
 yes mainboard every year the vote can die for the wooden land stage 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:19.719
 which you can easily download even the look we eat 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:22.819
 I have to be a good girl in 50 meters 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:25.459
 third secondary 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.329
 towards the first curve at the intel
