00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.210 

so<00:00:01.230> let's<00:00:01.410> go<00:00:01.530> for<00:00:01.680> a<00:00:01.709> bike<00:00:01.829> ride<00:00:01.860> on<00:00:02.129> my

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
so let's go for a bike ride on my

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.999 
so let's go for a bike ride on my
electric<00:00:02.520> bicycle<00:00:02.879> shall<00:00:03.060> we<00:00:03.799> I've<00:00:04.799> been

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
electric bicycle shall we I've been

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.650 
electric bicycle shall we I've been
starting<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.400> keep<00:00:05.549> my<00:00:05.700> batteries<00:00:05.879> inside

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
starting to keep my batteries inside

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.990 
starting to keep my batteries inside
because<00:00:07.109> if<00:00:07.410> they<00:00:07.560> get<00:00:07.799> too<00:00:07.859> cold<00:00:08.250> below<00:00:08.730> 20

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
because if they get too cold below 20

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.520 
because if they get too cold below 20
degrees<00:00:09.030> Fahrenheit<00:00:09.780> well<00:00:10.139> they<00:00:10.320> don't

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
degrees Fahrenheit well they don't

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.490 
degrees Fahrenheit well they don't
really<00:00:10.620> put<00:00:10.920> any<00:00:11.099> power<00:00:12.110> so<00:00:13.110> it<00:00:13.230> doesn't

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
really put any power so it doesn't

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.640 
really put any power so it doesn't
really<00:00:13.559> work<00:00:13.740> too<00:00:13.920> well<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:14.370> let's<00:00:15.360> add<00:00:16.350> this

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
really work too well so let's add this

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.010 
really work too well so let's add this
in<00:00:16.920> there<00:00:17.130> that's<00:00:17.400> 24<00:00:17.880> volts<00:00:18.150> 35<00:00:18.570> amp<00:00:18.779> hours

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
in there that's 24 volts 35 amp hours

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.170 
in there that's 24 volts 35 amp hours
now<00:00:19.770> this<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.100> my<00:00:20.220> old<00:00:20.430> battery<00:00:20.730> pack<00:00:20.970> which

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
now this is my old battery pack which

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.509 
now this is my old battery pack which
was<00:00:21.330> 48<00:00:21.779> volts<00:00:22.050> but<00:00:22.140> i<00:00:22.199> rewired<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.859> be<00:00:22.980> 24

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
was 48 volts but i rewired it to be 24

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.849 
was 48 volts but i rewired it to be 24
volts<00:00:23.789> about<00:00:24.000> twice<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.240> yeah<00:00:25.140> 24<00:00:25.529> volts<00:00:25.740> with

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
volts about twice the yeah 24 volts with

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.930 
volts about twice the yeah 24 volts with
twice<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.070> m<00:00:26.279> power<00:00:30.140> all<00:00:31.140> right<00:00:31.230> like<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.940> so

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
twice the m power all right like that so

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.910 
twice the m power all right like that so
now<00:00:33.030> i<00:00:33.090> have<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.540> big<00:00:33.840> battery<00:00:34.230> bank<00:00:34.469> going<00:00:34.680> in

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
now i have the big battery bank going in

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.400 
now i have the big battery bank going in
series<00:00:35.670> with<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.059> smaller<00:00:36.450> battery<00:00:36.780> bank<00:00:37.050> so

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
series with the smaller battery bank so

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.440 
series with the smaller battery bank so
overall<00:00:37.739> it's<00:00:37.980> only<00:00:38.100> 18<00:00:38.520> amp<00:00:38.730> hours<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.420> I

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
overall it's only 18 amp hours and I

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.440 
overall it's only 18 amp hours and I
have<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> fuse<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.230> 30<00:00:40.649> hip<00:00:41.180> that's<00:00:42.180> come<00:00:42.329> in

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
have a fuse on it 30 hip that's come in

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.910 
have a fuse on it 30 hip that's come in
handy<00:00:42.690> quite<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> bit<00:00:44.239> close<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.450> up<00:00:48.739> add<00:00:49.739> it

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
handy quite a bit close it up add it

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.900 
handy quite a bit close it up add it
together<00:00:50.510> or<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.570> mean<00:00:51.780> connect<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.170> together

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.799 

then<00:00:56.910> take<00:00:57.149> our<00:00:57.329> strap<00:00:57.629> put<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.590> around<00:00:59.809> push

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
then take our strap put it around push

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.549 
then take our strap put it around push
it<00:01:01.309> like<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.780> so<00:01:03.780> now<00:01:03.899> it's<00:01:04.049> all<00:01:04.170> nice<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
it like that so now it's all nice and

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:12.050 
it like that so now it's all nice and
strong<00:01:08.510> we<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:09.720> our<00:01:09.869> power<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.500> here<00:01:11.060> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
strong we have our power on here the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.990 
strong we have our power on here the
green<00:01:12.270> light<00:01:12.450> isn't<00:01:12.630> lit<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:12.990> but<00:01:13.140> oh<00:01:13.200> well

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
green light isn't lit up but oh well

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.789 
green light isn't lit up but oh well
let's<00:01:15.000> go<00:01:17.630> now<00:01:18.630> remember<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.080> motor<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
let's go now remember the motor and the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.789 
let's go now remember the motor and the
motor<00:01:19.830> controller<00:01:20.369> are<00:01:20.640> at<00:01:21.570> 25<00:01:22.259> degrees<00:01:22.590> right

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
motor controller are at 25 degrees right

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.620 
motor controller are at 25 degrees right
now<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.220> only<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.580> battery<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:24.330> 60

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
now and only the battery is like 60

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:34.500 
now and only the battery is like 60
degrees

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.520 

evidently<00:01:35.510> it's<00:01:35.660> the<00:01:35.780> motor<00:01:35.960> controller<00:01:36.350> that

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
evidently it's the motor controller that

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.740 
evidently it's the motor controller that
needs<00:01:36.710> a<00:01:36.830> warmup<00:01:37.900> that's<00:01:38.900> odd<00:01:40.510> maybe<00:01:41.510> if<00:01:41.660> I

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
needs a warmup that's odd maybe if I

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.630 
needs a warmup that's odd maybe if I
just<00:01:41.900> put<00:01:42.050> my<00:01:42.140> hand<00:01:42.320> on<00:01:42.470> it<00:01:42.500> to<00:01:42.890> help<00:01:43.280> warm<00:01:43.520> it

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
just put my hand on it to help warm it

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.820 
just put my hand on it to help warm it
up<00:01:43.700> it'll<00:01:44.000> help<00:01:47.080> certainly<00:01:48.080> is<00:01:48.230> cold<00:01:48.560> though

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
up it'll help certainly is cold though

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.740 
up it'll help certainly is cold though
wowser

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.870 

it's<00:01:53.750> getting<00:01:53.990> better<00:01:54.140> as<00:01:54.350> I<00:01:54.530> heat<00:01:55.400> it<00:01:55.550> up<00:01:55.670> but

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
it's getting better as I heat it up but

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:05.290 
it's getting better as I heat it up but
I<00:01:55.910> keep<00:01:56.090> drying<00:01:56.360> it<00:01:56.540> I<00:02:03.820> never<00:02:04.820> would<00:02:05.030> have<00:02:05.060> felt

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
I keep drying it I never would have felt

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.790 
I keep drying it I never would have felt
the<00:02:05.420> motor<00:02:05.630> controller<00:02:05.990> would<00:02:06.140> have<00:02:06.320> such

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
the motor controller would have such

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.770 
the motor controller would have such
problems<00:02:07.220> with<00:02:07.400> cold<00:02:07.700> I<00:02:08.000> always<00:02:08.479> thought<00:02:08.600> my

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
problems with cold I always thought my

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.590 
problems with cold I always thought my
issues<00:02:08.990> were<00:02:09.229> derived<00:02:09.649> from<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.100> battery's

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
issues were derived from the battery's

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.840 
issues were derived from the battery's
temperature<00:02:11.600> conditioning<00:02:12.440> or<00:02:12.620> whatever<00:02:12.920> how

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
temperature conditioning or whatever how

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.190 
temperature conditioning or whatever how
eight<00:02:14.150> likes<00:02:14.360> to<00:02:14.480> be<00:02:14.570> an<00:02:14.630> or<00:02:14.750> more<00:02:14.930> temperate

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
eight likes to be an or more temperate

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.570 
eight likes to be an or more temperate
climate<00:02:15.560> but<00:02:16.280> as<00:02:16.520> I<00:02:16.760> when<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.540> go<00:02:17.750> like<00:02:17.870> that<00:02:18.580> the

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
climate but as I when I go like that the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.750 
climate but as I when I go like that the
voltage<00:02:19.910> isn't<00:02:20.090> going<00:02:20.420> down<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:21.760> sometimes

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
voltage isn't going down and sometimes

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.160 
voltage isn't going down and sometimes
the<00:02:22.910> HTC<00:02:23.240> spike<00:02:23.480> where<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.720> voltage<00:02:23.990> goes

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
the HTC spike where the voltage goes

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.120 
the HTC spike where the voltage goes
back<00:02:24.410> up<00:02:24.590> so<00:02:24.950> that's<00:02:25.160> I<00:02:25.490> don't<00:02:25.970> know<00:02:26.209> I<00:02:27.130> guess

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
back up so that's I don't know I guess

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.490 
back up so that's I don't know I guess
it<00:02:28.280> wouldn't<00:02:28.430> hurt<00:02:28.520> just<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.880> drive<00:02:29.090> it<00:02:29.180> though

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
it wouldn't hurt just to drive it though

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.900 
it wouldn't hurt just to drive it though
probably<00:02:30.500> on<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.650> way<00:02:30.770> back<00:02:30.980> it'll<00:02:31.250> start

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
probably on the way back it'll start

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.460 
probably on the way back it'll start
heating<00:02:32.209> up<00:02:32.330> because<00:02:32.480> usually<00:02:33.140> what<00:02:33.440> happens

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
heating up because usually what happens

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.520 
heating up because usually what happens
is<00:02:33.890> as<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.340> as<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.640> battery<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.330> or<00:02:36.019> as<00:02:36.170> the

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
is as the as the battery and or as the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.710 
is as the as the battery and or as the
entire<00:02:36.769> system<00:02:37.130> is<00:02:37.610> driven<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.209> I<00:02:38.300> keep<00:02:38.510> going

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
entire system is driven and I keep going

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.430 
entire system is driven and I keep going
like<00:02:38.840> that<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:40.340> warms<00:02:41.090> up<00:02:41.330> more<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:41.870> give<00:02:42.290> more

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
like that it warms up more and give more

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.630 
like that it warms up more and give more
power

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640
