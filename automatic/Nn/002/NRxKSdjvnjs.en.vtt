like<00:03:54.319> as<00:03:55.319> you<00:03:55.620> can<00:03:55.739> see<00:03:55.920> it's<00:03:56.129> a<00:03:56.189> little<00:03:56.310> bit

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
like as you can see it's a little bit

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:02.690 
like as you can see it's a little bit
past<00:03:57.090> my<00:03:59.569> my<00:04:00.569> armpits<00:04:01.170> in<00:04:01.409> the<00:04:01.560> front<00:04:01.890> but<00:04:02.159> I<00:04:02.340> am
