00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.540
 Let me tell you something you already know 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.550
 conquer something big 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.310
 something that will make a difference in 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.510
 life of others but in yours you already know 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.820
 What do you have to do? 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.650
 So how do you know when to wake up? 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.610
 at 5 am it is not always just being 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.680
 alert 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.660
 Not always the temperature will be mild 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.110
 your body does not always want to 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.140
 get out of bed but you will get up 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.350
 most are adapted but you are 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.350
 foot 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.370
 You end up in shooting practice. 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.450
 sometimes until the end of a full length film 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.460
 of week 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.010
 you do what you have to do because the 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.420
 your armor thinks the big scenes 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.350
 are strong 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.350
 you are not 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.260
 every race has that moment 16 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.210
 at that time when you are not 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.230
 unaware of is that the bucks do not think 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.610
 about july 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.970
 you will show the incredible ability 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.370
 to continue a little longer because the pain 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.570
 will receive no matter where you are 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.660
 finished 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.890
 no matter how many runs appeal made 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.330
 come a time when the most 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.090
 strong and you at the second pharmacy 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.340
 interest but when this happens 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:29.580
 when you're looking at the floor 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.580
 You'll be after the line.
