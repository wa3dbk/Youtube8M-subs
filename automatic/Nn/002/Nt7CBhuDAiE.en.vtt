pixel art so right away you put three

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.220 
pixel art so right away you put three
black<00:00:09.300> pieces<00:00:09.570> down<00:00:10.280> then<00:00:11.660> diagonal<00:00:12.660> relax

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
from there a diagonal black piece and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:25.500 
from there a diagonal black piece and
then<00:01:17.250> two<00:01:17.460> more<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.759> top<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.090> that

alright then another three and we're
gonna<00:01:27.910> put<00:01:28.060> a<00:01:28.090> block<00:01:28.360> on<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.570> side<00:01:28.870> so<00:01:29.140> that<00:01:29.260> we

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
gonna put a block on the side so that we

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.040 
gonna put a block on the side so that we
can<00:01:29.470> get<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.650> diagonal<00:01:30.190> again<00:01:34.050> another

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
can get the diagonal again another

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.540 
can get the diagonal again another
diagonal<00:01:35.380> and<00:01:35.890> then<00:01:36.040> now<00:01:36.130> we're<00:01:36.310> coming

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
diagonal and then now we're coming

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.980 
diagonal and then now we're coming
around<00:01:36.670> to<00:01:36.850> make<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:37.120> roof<00:01:37.300> of<00:01:37.450> dome<00:01:37.660> old's

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
around to make the roof of dome old's

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.280 
around to make the roof of dome old's
body<00:01:38.140> I<00:01:38.560> mean<00:01:39.130> his<00:01:39.250> head<00:01:40.080> so<00:01:41.080> we're<00:01:41.200> almost

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
body I mean his head so we're almost

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.590 
body I mean his head so we're almost
done<00:01:41.560> with<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.770> outline<00:01:42.270> they<00:01:43.270> just<00:01:43.450> make

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
done with the outline they just make

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.700 
done with the outline they just make
sure<00:01:43.750> i'm<00:01:44.020> going<00:01:44.530> to<00:01:44.650> spaces<00:01:45.100> right<00:01:46.590> all<00:01:47.590> right

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
sure i'm going to spaces right all right

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.800 
sure i'm going to spaces right all right
diagonal<00:01:48.040> down<00:01:48.430> and<00:01:48.820> another<00:01:49.120> diagonal<00:01:49.420> down

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
diagonal down and another diagonal down

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.020 
diagonal down and another diagonal down
after<00:01:50.140> that<00:01:50.290> and<00:01:50.650> then<00:01:51.550> you're<00:01:51.700> gonna<00:01:51.790> make

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
after that and then you're gonna make

00:01:52.030 --> 00:02:00.450 
after that and then you're gonna make
him<00:01:52.150> eat<00:01:52.300> the<00:01:52.450> rest<00:01:52.600> of<00:01:52.780> his<00:01:52.900> body<00:01:59.100> there<00:02:00.100> we<00:02:00.310> go

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
him eat the rest of his body there we go

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.610 
him eat the rest of his body there we go
so<00:02:00.729> now<00:02:00.760> he's<00:02:01.090> a<00:02:01.120> mirror<00:02:01.420> image<00:02:01.630> of<00:02:01.900> himself<00:02:02.080> so

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
so now he's a mirror image of himself so

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.100 
so now he's a mirror image of himself so
it<00:02:02.740> came<00:02:02.890> out<00:02:03.040> perfect<00:02:03.520> and<00:02:03.750> now<00:02:04.750> we<00:02:04.810> just<00:02:05.080> have

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
it came out perfect and now we just have

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.370 
it came out perfect and now we just have
to<00:02:05.229> worry<00:02:05.410> about<00:02:05.500> filling<00:02:05.800> everything<00:02:06.310> in<00:02:10.380> so

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
to worry about filling everything in so

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
we're gonna put some white wool there

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.190 
we're gonna put some white wool there
for<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.730> eyes<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:13.390> get<00:02:13.570> a<00:02:13.600> store<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:13.990> shape

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
for the eyes to get a store the shape

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:22.050 
for the eyes to get a store the shape
started
