00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.730
 the basic principle are energetic of 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.730
 the air 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.120
 the suckers that are powered by 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.070
 these boarding schools and sister venturi 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.460
 actually enter the breathing 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.489
 sending air and we have 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.500
 following the point of a close is very 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.550
 simple actually to clinch these finally 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.739
 just two layers and 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.470
 the exhaust is there sales us and 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.760
 pick up here is to be there 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.269
 climbing to afford it 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.589
 the ascent 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.589
 and then we're on something 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.489
 this is a way of crossing 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.080
 to ride on 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.430
 structures whatever it is there we are 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.070
 on a device that offers us 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.300
 opportunities can among other 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.920
 steel like most boats 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.490
 but it can be fooled and uv 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.890
 what resin of aluminum also 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.090
 in fact here is the panel is wide enough 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.530
 and after the potential users 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.880
 they are either people who want to 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.490
 to please to vote on a structure 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.820
 weird little souad and the speakers 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.990
 it's a box that have a job to 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.990
 to do on a structure 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.170
 the concept of using suction cups for 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.180
 goes up there is something vertical 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.170
 which was triggering its decline and 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.080
 that's especially been a problem we 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.130
 had in the past and find a solution 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.320
 to climb very high 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.909
 and in fact 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.729
 the idea we had long enough 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.610
 it's a little less there was an element 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:02.360
 trigger that was hard reporting on 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.490
 it's not why not try to 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.189
 to do 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.300
 suckers after we looked a little 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.500
 which arise and not to say that the 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.390
 competition there are a lot of people who 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.770
 have tried to find the solution but 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.790
 compared to us because we wanted 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.560
 to do it is not acceptable 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.730
 we will take the developing parts 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.860
 something 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.860
 we will say more adapted to my boyfriend
