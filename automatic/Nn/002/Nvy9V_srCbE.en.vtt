talked<00:02:53.040> about<00:02:53.220> how<00:02:53.310> much<00:02:53.459> faster<00:02:53.910> this<00:02:54.030> office

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
talked about how much faster this office

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.449 
talked about how much faster this office
has<00:02:54.690> been<00:02:54.720> in<00:02:55.650> practice<00:02:55.860> can<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:56.220> kind<00:02:56.430> of

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
has been in practice can you kind of

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.370 
has been in practice can you kind of
speak<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:56.819> it<00:02:57.329> is<00:02:57.480> very<00:02:57.630> fast<00:02:57.959> I<00:02:58.200> mean

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
speak to that it is very fast I mean

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.199 
speak to that it is very fast I mean
it's<00:02:58.530> fast<00:02:59.040> tempo<00:02:59.340> I've<00:02:59.489> ever<00:02:59.670> been<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.849> part<00:02:59.910> of

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
it's fast tempo I've ever been a part of

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.690 
it's fast tempo I've ever been a part of
I<00:03:00.480> guess<00:03:00.989> that's<00:03:01.650> what<00:03:01.829> gives<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:02.340> an<00:03:02.400> edge<00:03:02.549> on

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
I guess that's what gives you an edge on

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.949 
I guess that's what gives you an edge on
defense<00:03:03.120> because<00:03:03.299> they<00:03:03.389> break<00:03:03.600> their<00:03:03.750> will<00:03:03.900> to

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
defense because they break their will to

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.660 
defense because they break their will to
play<00:03:06.079> it's<00:03:07.079> kind<00:03:07.350> of<00:03:07.470> an<00:03:07.650> elder<00:03:08.130> statesman<00:03:08.160> now

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
play it's kind of an elder statesman now

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.460 
play it's kind of an elder statesman now
you<00:03:08.880> can<00:03:09.060> embody<00:03:09.329> the<00:03:09.540> leadership<00:03:09.959> role<00:03:10.170> the

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
you can embody the leadership role the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.830 
you can embody the leadership role the
wide<00:03:10.709> receiver<00:03:11.010> I<00:03:11.400> mean<00:03:12.030> yeah<00:03:12.209> but<00:03:12.239> I've<00:03:12.660> never

better day by day things are a lot

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.319 
better day by day things are a lot
faster<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:34.769> know<00:03:34.920> we<00:03:35.250> execute<00:03:35.819> a<00:03:35.850> lot<00:03:36.000> faster

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
faster you know we execute a lot faster

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:37.970 
faster you know we execute a lot faster
than<00:03:36.389> we<00:03:36.480> did<00:03:36.600> last<00:03:36.660> year<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.260> we<00:03:37.590> practice

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
than we did last year and we practice

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.530 
than we did last year and we practice
the<00:03:38.010> whole<00:03:38.190> lot<00:03:38.370> faster<00:03:38.519> in<00:03:38.790> your<00:03:38.910> last<00:03:39.090> year<00:03:39.329> I

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
the whole lot faster in your last year I

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.479 
the whole lot faster in your last year I
feel<00:03:39.989> like<00:03:40.049> it's<00:03:40.799> a<00:03:40.859> lot<00:03:40.950> more<00:03:40.980> loose<00:03:41.250> around

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
feel like it's a lot more loose around

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.670 
feel like it's a lot more loose around
here<00:03:41.670> you<00:03:41.819> know<00:03:41.849> the<00:03:42.420> cultural<00:03:42.780> we<00:03:43.170> play<00:03:43.319> music

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
here you know the cultural we play music

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.750 
here you know the cultural we play music
during<00:03:43.829> practice<00:03:44.220> some<00:03:44.370> things<00:03:44.579> that<00:03:44.700> we

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
during practice some things that we

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.280 
during practice some things that we
didn't<00:03:44.910> do<00:03:44.970> last<00:03:45.120> year<00:03:45.299> so<00:03:45.870> I<00:03:45.900> guess<00:03:46.049> it's<00:03:46.139> kind

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
didn't do last year so I guess it's kind

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.270 
didn't do last year so I guess it's kind
of<00:03:46.319> ready<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.560> practice<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:46.950> we're<00:03:47.069> excited

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
of ready to practice and we're excited

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.490 
of ready to practice and we're excited
about<00:03:47.430> coming<00:03:47.670> to<00:03:47.849> practice<00:03:48.109> so<00:03:49.109> many<00:03:49.260> skill
