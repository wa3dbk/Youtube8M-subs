00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.799
 and we stay with the football of the switch until spring weather and bombing 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:10.510
 The MyPhone Austria Stadium, which is filled to capacity with 1,000,300 spectators in 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:11.539
 Maxglan 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.320
 everything was done for the big hit 24 food in the 

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:17.789
 Regionalliga West Austria Salzburg 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.140
 and the promotion aspirants 1 the SG Wattens 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.360
 Iran wants the SG data centrally between the Salzburg Austria Genster 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.820
 for the best holds and the best away team of the league to each other 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.809
 So tension is guaranteed in the table, the two parted before the 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:42.430
 hospital 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.050
 only six points and the violets were eager for the tight 2 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.140
 1 1 defeat made in the fall on day one of the industry 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.230
 Accordingly, Gales motivates in the game 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.030
 Antiques title Decision open game earns compelling scoring chances 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.030
 but is missing 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.150
 you will see the minute in which the hosts then for the first time in the housing of 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.820
 Wattens politician 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.020
 Märzendorfer hits the ball in the penalty area but does not finish 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.460
 In the middle of the halftime the Tyroleans will get more than a few 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.570
 non-dangerous shooting from a distance "but do not jump either 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.570
 out 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.510
 the first real excitement of the game then after just under half an hour after 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.340
 beautiful solo by Raphael on the market sees evaluation Dieter Puchta from 20 meters 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.450
 but without a crossbar prevented the much desired goal 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.590
 after this so far only big chances the game flattened again and 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.310
 both teams go with a 0 0 in the cabins 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.560
 After the break, the Violets from kickoff way would have them in the book 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.260
 the hand 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.720
 the attack efforts ended for the time being but not at the level of the sixteenth 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.160
 of the guests 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.000
 The wait for accurate finds in this stage of the game is next to nothing 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.820
 more instead of coach Roland Kirchler brings in the 59 minute Although Armin Hobel 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.360
 but also the Topol offender can not change the character of the game here 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.650
 seems like the second half of the rest is satisfied with one point 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.599
 The hosts scored differently the longer the game lasts 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.249
 and Sevilla 75 minutes will be more dangerous 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:32.140
 Violet play gives shots on the guest-gate from Märzendorfer scolding 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:34.639
 finally with the best attempt on aluminum 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:37.639
 for the second time bad luck for the Salzburg in these play 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:41.839
 after all, it was only a matter of isolated standard situations 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:42.540
 dangerous 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.550
 salzburg goalie Tremmel did not have a single one in the second half 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.369
 seriously intervene 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:52.369
 8th 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:03:00.149
 The Violet fans whip their team forward and forward 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:03.429
 make for a great atmosphere in my son from the stadium 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:07.049
 the movie comes from the fans seems to have jumped on the players about 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.499
 because the final offensive of the Salzburg is then again in itself 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:15.419
 Initially commemorating Frank Heine just passing the gate and only one 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:19.259
 Minute later it burns again brightly in the guard room penalty area 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:22.259
 the defensive players can concede a last-gasp goal 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.689
 the Salzburg look for their luck on the offensive but also the next 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.549
 Shot is just distributed on the housing of the Tyrolean 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.549
 dpa 

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:40.959
 everyone plays on their own 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.410
 another pass into the penalty area 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.579
 Lengthening the head and the belly ends up in goal 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.280
 but previously whistled by the sovereign referee Peter Gruber 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:55.229
 that was also the last action in the game is Austria Salzburg and Wartens 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:57.769
 separate at the end goalless with 0 0 0 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.809
 a result that flattered the Tyroleans due to the second half 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:05.370
 Salzburg are investing much more in the offensive if we are going ahead 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.749
 Exozet 0 2 0 the Nordbadener is good if you played but because of the 

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:10.239
 Mission Critical with Bell 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.209
 because fiancé shots body reported superior 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.539
 finished today, world champion Petter Molvær the strongest team 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.959
 Unfortunately, God's are rarely able to put Wall Street on it 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.360
 Solar only 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.789
 the spokesman led Wartens there, the educational pathways in the end always 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.180
 waves again 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.150
 it is now running very well and the 1 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.259
 later, the ethics for the lab was discovered at the top you have to want it 

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:39.469
 Ascent aspirant wait she is still full of the point win in Salzburg 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:44.120
 accordingly, Roland Kienzler, our coach, is satisfied with everything 

00:04:44.119 --> 00:04:47.509
 So last but not least, she can show good football Don 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:48.689
 second halftime 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:51.729
 as she had managed to do as much of the misery as it had done 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:52.370
 has been 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.930
 ten terms Seppi by death threats percent or Malev Dirk Kopp with the 2 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.900
 all three of the list stood i know 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.520
 that was the motto of course in the direction of Tyrol should you be meadow too 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.030
 Home Rheine a laughing stock should be the single judge very strong team and 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.860
 that he is very pleased with the point 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.250
 somehow satisfied and then they do not give back the emotional world 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.130
 the Salzburg player after the match 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.719
 half in which he sits because of the then plays 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:19.879
 times scenes that he again played the leader Sandersdorf 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:22.240
 unfortunately Zeitler handed to the point 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.240
 the headquarters of the best rating is a statement it fits you must 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.240
 By the way, the game was not the first time this time 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.189
 they are afraid that the wall 

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:34.699
 Back in those days, the driver still saw missed opportunities 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:39.620
 she is the most important percent being countries bile and already in 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.389
 Maxglan and I voted for them to be clean and then not clean 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.580
 in the table after the zero number in Salzburg everything climbed the old way 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.789
 because even the immediate competitors have a working this round only 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:53.249
 Draws played 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:56.909
 Martens thus remains on table position two which is Austria 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:59.509
 Fifth and home still unbeaten
