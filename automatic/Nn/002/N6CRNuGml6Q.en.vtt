00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.980
 Yesterday, welcome to conrad seils beer 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.930
 of the week they knew that one of beer 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:34.059
 Drinking can actually decrease 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.460
 it's not just the beer and the trick 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.920
 The combination often every year so that 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:43.090
 we drink a beer then you get lust 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.530
 what a hearty thing to do if 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.379
 this game we play today 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.480
 imagine that costs can actually 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.420
 to lose weight the trick is 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.610
 capsaicin so that's what's in the 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.120
 chilli pepper is included and wants that 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:01.540
 I taste spicy capsaicin there 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.340
 the body the idea of ​​pain and then 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:08.050
 So more hormones are released 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:11.039
 then you have the impression now 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:14.020
 the body's fight and the construction of fed off 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:16.300
 but it is also produced in luck feelings 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.050
 you could drink beer or geely 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.539
 could cross-country try both 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.410
 and that is much more pleasant 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.080
 variant 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.119
 the idea behind it is chilli 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.850
 or capsaicin is not 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:34.200
 soluble in water if you have a chilli pepper 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:38.229
 is then a pretty hot one 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.049
 manager as hoard that leads to 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.880
 sweats out there is one 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.439
 happiness but it feels like it 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.509
 of course, on when you've sweated 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.240
 And if you play these games beer 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:53.380
 exactly the same happens 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.450
 you see it's a beer that very much 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.720
 it's dull because there's a lot going on 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.360
 extract is in it and chile is 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.159
 known to be odorless when we get to it 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.920
 we do not smell that chili 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.149
 inside is and the devil is one 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.149
 it does not taste too 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.510
 one takes a sip of it has 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:21.670
 impression that a pleasant soft 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:26.000
 very easy to drink 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:31.070
 refreshing beer and then with time 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.530
 how it starts to work comes 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.830
 then this effect of that 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.830
 aim 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:49.160
 you know that from chili that 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.900
 so just have a drink and then make 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.100
 we mistake you drink water water 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.900
 allowed to drink it not that 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.470
 that does not help but makes the chili 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.780
 even more intense capsaicin so that the 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.620
 sharpness in the chilly that is not 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.120
 water soluble 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:08.330
 she is soluble in fed could so 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.040
 location olive oil could recommend 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.110
 city ​​bath or oil in it 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.260
 or you could help beer drink beer 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.900
 very good spicy Thai dish 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.230
 has eaten or chili con carne 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.050
 then drink quite well after drinking 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.880
 the sharpness is reduced with the beer 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:31.400
 Of course this works only partially 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.780
 because it brings more sharpness into 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.959
 this beer is capsaicin 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:42.530
 abstention as rudi has it makes one 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:45.740
 really great effect you get one 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.570
 slight sweat break and it is a 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.040
 wonderful drink in the summer wants the 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.190
 Of course I say sweat here 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.180
 but they can be wiped away 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:59.360
 and you have a cool feeling and me 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.750
 I am looking forward to seeing you in summer 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.750
 me 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.450
 the trade drink quite shabby beer 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.150
 so big 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:12.550
 until the next conference 14 of the week 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.550
 and wide with difficult 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.140
 hermann hoff is the weak one
