00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.280 

think<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.059> perfectly<00:00:39.450> timed<00:00:39.719> by<00:00:39.840> Canon

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
think this is perfectly timed by Canon

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.630 
think this is perfectly timed by Canon
because<00:00:40.559> they<00:00:40.770> once<00:00:40.980> again<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.309> know<00:00:41.430> night

because they once again you know night

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.340 
because they once again you know night
concrete<00:00:42.059> some<00:00:42.329> not<00:00:42.719> count<00:00:42.960> as<00:00:43.079> gotta<00:00:43.230> come

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
concrete some not count as gotta come

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.630 
concrete some not count as gotta come
out<00:00:43.410> someone<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.890> know<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.010> vice<00:00:44.250> versa

spec on that real quick and i've been

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.700 
spec on that real quick and i've been
hands-on<00:00:51.690> with<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.050> it's<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.260> pretty<00:00:52.469> good

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
hands-on with it it's a pretty good

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.160 
hands-on with it it's a pretty good
camera<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.760> upgraded<00:00:54.059> from<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.329> d7000

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
camera but it upgraded from the d7000

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.139 
camera but it upgraded from the d7000
which<00:00:55.289> had<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> lot<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.620> focusing<00:00:56.129> issues<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.699> had

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
which had a lot of focusing issues I had

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.360 
which had a lot of focusing issues I had
to<00:00:57.360> SD<00:00:57.660> card<00:00:57.899> slots<00:00:58.170> 24<00:00:58.620> megapixels<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.250> a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
to SD card slots 24 megapixels and a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.979 
to SD card slots 24 megapixels and a
fixed<00:00:59.640> screen<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.090> I'm<00:01:00.239> only<00:01:00.510> those<00:01:00.809> three

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
fixed screen so I'm only those three

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.609 
fixed screen so I'm only those three
matter<00:01:01.260> because<00:01:01.949> now<00:01:02.160> we're<00:01:02.399> looking<00:01:02.550> at<00:01:02.850> the

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
matter because now we're looking at the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.649 
matter because now we're looking at the
70d<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:04.949> taking<00:01:05.309> over<00:01:05.549> for<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.820> canon<00:01:06.270> 60d

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
70d it's taking over for the canon 60d

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.770 
70d it's taking over for the canon 60d
so<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.100> perfectly<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.729> line<00:01:08.760> with<00:01:08.970> coming

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
so it is perfectly in line with coming

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.630 
so it is perfectly in line with coming
back<00:01:09.930> at<00:01:10.140> nikon<00:01:10.590> once<00:01:10.830> again<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.490> very

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
back at nikon once again that is very

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.789 
back at nikon once again that is very
typical<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.600> what<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.049> was<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.350> basically

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
rumors are true it's got a brand-new

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.130 
rumors are true it's got a brand-new
five<00:01:20.400> plus<00:01:20.790> digit<00:01:21.150> processor<00:01:21.689> which<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.930> great

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
five plus digit processor which is great

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.289 
five plus digit processor which is great
for<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:23.130> know<00:01:23.220> better<00:01:23.790> image<00:01:24.090> quality

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
for you know better image quality

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.969 
for you know better image quality
everything<00:01:24.960> like<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.380> know<00:01:25.409> sup<00:01:25.710> here

everything like that you know sup here

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.830 
everything like that you know sup here
it's<00:01:26.100> faster<00:01:26.400> buffering<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.270> got<00:01:27.450> 20

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
it's faster buffering it's got 20

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.749 
it's faster buffering it's got 20
megapixels<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:28.590> not<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> huge<00:01:29.130> bump<00:01:29.490> from<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
megapixels it's not a huge bump from the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.149 
megapixels it's not a huge bump from the
60d<00:01:30.390> which<00:01:30.600> had<00:01:30.840> i<00:01:31.079> think<00:01:31.470> about<00:01:31.770> 18

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
60d which had i think about 18

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.539 
60d which had i think about 18
megapixels<00:01:32.759> yeah<00:01:33.630> 18<00:01:33.960> megapixels<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:34.650> and

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
megapixels yeah 18 megapixels but and

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.740 
megapixels yeah 18 megapixels but and
some<00:01:35.759> little<00:01:36.090> better<00:01:36.240> something<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.630> little

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
some little better something a little

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.960 
some little better something a little
more<00:01:36.869> dynamic<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:37.950> i<00:01:38.070> said<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.369> processor<00:01:38.880> is

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
more dynamic as i said that processor is

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.450 
more dynamic as i said that processor is
actually<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> really<00:01:39.570> huge<00:01:39.960> thing<00:01:40.380> uh<00:01:40.560> it's

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
actually a really huge thing uh it's

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.950 
actually a really huge thing uh it's
still<00:01:41.640> going<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.850> take<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.150> same<00:01:42.329> cards<00:01:42.840> and

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
still going to take the same cards and

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.539 
still going to take the same cards and
everything<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:43.979> there's<00:01:44.490> a

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
everything like that but there's a

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.399 
everything like that but there's a
couple<00:01:44.790> things<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.360> they<00:01:45.630> are<00:01:45.810> trying<00:01:46.140> to

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
couple things that they are trying to

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.710 
couple things that they are trying to
throw<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:46.890> there<00:01:47.040> basically<00:01:47.820> it's<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.329> a

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
throw in there basically it's is a

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.620 
throw in there basically it's is a
built-in<00:01:49.700> wireless<00:01:50.700> one<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.450> biggest

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
built-in wireless one of the biggest

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.819 
built-in wireless one of the biggest
things<00:01:51.899> they<00:01:52.020> have<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.380> built<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.680> wireless

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
things they have is built in wireless

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.410 
things they have is built in wireless
you<00:01:53.189> know<00:01:53.310> they<00:01:53.759> were<00:01:53.820> including<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.390> in

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
you know they were including that in

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.209 
you know they were including that in
some<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.750> their<00:01:54.840> smaller<00:01:55.229> end<00:01:55.560> or<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.070> know

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
some of their smaller end or you know

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.240 
some of their smaller end or you know
newer<00:01:57.030> technology<00:01:57.810> now<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.740> can<00:01:59.070> get

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
newer technology now you can get

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.340 
newer technology now you can get
wireless<00:01:59.490> built<00:01:59.880> right<00:02:00.119> into<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.420> 70d<00:02:01.079> and

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
wireless built right into the 70d and

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.660 
wireless built right into the 70d and
one<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.649> biggest<00:02:01.829> things<00:02:02.130> they<00:02:02.250> have<00:02:02.460> is

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
one of the biggest things they have is

they're going to give you this remote

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.230 
they're going to give you this remote
app<00:02:04.020> for<00:02:04.649> your<00:02:04.680> iOS<00:02:05.130> or<00:02:05.340> Android<00:02:05.670> device<00:02:05.759> that

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
app for your iOS or Android device that

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.730 
app for your iOS or Android device that
you<00:02:06.329> can<00:02:06.540> trigger<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.079> can<00:02:07.200> do<00:02:07.290> whatever<00:02:07.560> you

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
you can trigger you can do whatever you

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.919 
you can trigger you can do whatever you
can<00:02:07.860> view<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.429> select<00:02:09.209> focus<00:02:09.539> points<00:02:09.810> and

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
can view it select focus points and

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.119 
can view it select focus points and
everything<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.349> that's<00:02:10.410> going<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.649> be<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> huge

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
everything so that's going to be a huge

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.270 
everything so that's going to be a huge
selling<00:02:11.580> point<00:02:11.610> for<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.300> 70d<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.080> the

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
selling point for the 70d and the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.710 
selling point for the 70d and the
price<00:02:13.459> isn't<00:02:13.700> that<00:02:13.910> bad<00:02:14.060> as<00:02:14.240> i<00:02:14.300> said<00:02:14.480> i'll<00:02:14.569> get

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
price isn't that bad as i said i'll get

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.530 
price isn't that bad as i said i'll get
to<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:14.870> in<00:02:14.990> just<00:02:15.680> one<00:02:16.130> second<00:02:16.580> another<00:02:17.300> huge

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
to that in just one second another huge

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.240 
to that in just one second another huge
thing<00:02:17.750> is<00:02:17.780> it<00:02:18.020> does<00:02:18.170> seven<00:02:18.500> frames<00:02:18.680> per<00:02:18.890> second

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
thing is it does seven frames per second

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.280 
thing is it does seven frames per second
that's<00:02:19.370> two<00:02:19.670> more<00:02:19.850> frames<00:02:20.150> than<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.569> 60d<00:02:21.080> had

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
that's two more frames than the 60d had

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.600 
that's two more frames than the 60d had
at<00:02:21.470> five<00:02:21.740> so<00:02:22.010> it's<00:02:22.130> going<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:22.280> be<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.400> little

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
at five so it's going to be a little

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.120 
at five so it's going to be a little
faster<00:02:23.030> it<00:02:23.660> still<00:02:23.870> does<00:02:24.020> HD<00:02:24.380> video<00:02:24.680> but<00:02:24.950> I'm

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
faster it still does HD video but I'm

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.240 
faster it still does HD video but I'm
still<00:02:25.550> not<00:02:25.580> quite<00:02:26.000> sure<00:02:26.120> why<00:02:26.480> they<00:02:26.600> don't<00:02:26.720> do

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
still not quite sure why they don't do

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.130 
still not quite sure why they don't do
60<00:02:28.250> frames<00:02:28.490> per<00:02:28.550> second<00:02:29.000> for<00:02:29.120> slow-mo<00:02:29.630> at<00:02:29.840> full

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
60 frames per second for slow-mo at full

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.120 
60 frames per second for slow-mo at full
1080p<00:02:30.680> HD<00:02:31.780> there's<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.870> only<00:02:32.989> do<00:02:33.230> 30<00:02:33.680> frames<00:02:33.980> of

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
1080p HD there's to only do 30 frames of

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.559 
1080p HD there's to only do 30 frames of
24<00:02:34.520> frames<00:02:34.819> once<00:02:35.060> again<00:02:35.209> if<00:02:35.270> you're<00:02:35.390> more<00:02:35.510> in

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
24 frames once again if you're more in

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.300 
24 frames once again if you're more in
the<00:02:35.630> video<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:36.380> kind<00:02:36.620> understand<00:02:37.010> that<00:02:37.130> more

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
the video you kind understand that more

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.979 
the video you kind understand that more
because<00:02:37.489> 60<00:02:37.790> frames<00:02:38.030> is<00:02:38.180> more<00:02:38.360> for<00:02:38.540> slow-mo

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
because 60 frames is more for slow-mo

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.420 
because 60 frames is more for slow-mo
still<00:02:39.680> understand<00:02:40.100> why<00:02:40.190> it's<00:02:40.310> at

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
still understand why it's at

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.309 
still understand why it's at
seven-twenty<00:02:41.030> but<00:02:41.270> you<00:02:41.510> know<00:02:41.630> nikon<00:02:42.110> really

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
seven-twenty but you know nikon really

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.600 
seven-twenty but you know nikon really
hasn't<00:02:42.470> done<00:02:42.680> much<00:02:42.830> either<00:02:43.040> in<00:02:43.220> regards<00:02:43.520> to

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
hasn't done much either in regards to

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.960 
hasn't done much either in regards to
that<00:02:44.110> very<00:02:45.110> angle<00:02:45.530> touchscreen<00:02:46.040> as<00:02:46.220> i<00:02:46.640> think

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
that very angle touchscreen as i think

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.000 
that very angle touchscreen as i think
it's<00:02:47.090> a<00:02:47.180> 3.2<00:02:47.810> inch<00:02:47.989> vari-angle<00:02:48.290> touchscreen

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
it's a 3.2 inch vari-angle touchscreen

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.460 
it's a 3.2 inch vari-angle touchscreen
which<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.760> 60d<00:02:50.269> had<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.600> very<00:02:50.840> angle<00:02:51.260> but<00:02:51.350> it

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
which the 60d had the very angle but it

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.110 
which the 60d had the very angle but it
wasn't<00:02:51.830> it's<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:52.250> little<00:02:52.459> older<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:52.910> know<00:02:53.000> they

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
wasn't it's a little older you know they

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.160 
wasn't it's a little older you know they
were<00:02:53.180> just<00:02:53.269> started<00:02:53.570> throwing<00:02:53.780> that<00:02:53.900> into

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
were just started throwing that into

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.570 
were just started throwing that into
like<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.410> t5<00:02:54.800> I<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:55.040> touchscreen

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
like the t5 I the touchscreen

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.430 
like the t5 I the touchscreen
capabilities<00:02:55.760> everything<00:02:56.480> like<00:02:56.630> that<00:02:56.660> so<00:02:57.019> now

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
capabilities everything like that so now

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.380 
capabilities everything like that so now
you<00:02:57.500> have<00:02:57.709> both<00:02:57.860> so<00:02:58.069> now<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.280> could<00:02:58.400> do<00:02:58.580> you

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
you have both so now you could do you

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.160 
you have both so now you could do you
know<00:02:59.510> you<00:02:59.569> could<00:02:59.720> choose<00:02:59.900> all<00:02:59.989> right<00:03:00.110> on

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
know you could choose all right on

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.330 
know you could choose all right on
screen<00:03:00.410> your<00:03:00.590> focus<00:03:00.860> points<00:03:01.160> you<00:03:01.220> don't

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
screen your focus points you don't

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.460 
screen your focus points you don't
necessarily<00:03:01.430> have<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.910> UM<00:03:02.360> look<00:03:03.200> through<00:03:03.380> the

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
necessarily have to UM look through the

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.940 
lens even though you should anyway but
it's<00:03:05.750> a<00:03:05.810> little<00:03:06.019> more<00:03:06.110> dynamic<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:06.709> you<00:03:06.769> still

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
it's a little more dynamic and you still

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.350 
it's a little more dynamic and you still
get<00:03:07.040> those<00:03:07.190> higher<00:03:07.430> or<00:03:07.640> lower<00:03:07.700> shots<00:03:08.180> because

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
get those higher or lower shots because

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.479 
get those higher or lower shots because
while<00:03:08.660> it's<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.930> variable<00:03:09.380> touch<00:03:09.620> it's<00:03:10.400> the

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
while it's the variable touch it's the

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.490 
while it's the variable touch it's the
variable<00:03:10.850> screen<00:03:11.060> so<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:11.510> can<00:03:11.600> basically<00:03:12.200> do

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
variable screen so you can basically do

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.830 
variable screen so you can basically do
you<00:03:12.530> know<00:03:12.709> do<00:03:12.890> whatever<00:03:13.069> you<00:03:13.250> want<00:03:13.400> with<00:03:13.430> it

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
you know do whatever you want with it

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.790 
you know do whatever you want with it
but<00:03:14.840> one<00:03:14.959> of<00:03:15.050> the<00:03:15.110> largest<00:03:15.410> things<00:03:15.650> they're

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
but one of the largest things they're

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.930 
but one of the largest things they're
trying<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.130> push<00:03:16.310> and<00:03:16.489> I<00:03:16.519> have<00:03:16.670> it<00:03:16.790> right<00:03:16.880> here

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
trying to push and I have it right here

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.560 
trying to push and I have it right here
is<00:03:17.329> their<00:03:17.780> dual<00:03:18.019> pixel<00:03:18.500> CMOS<00:03:18.860> AF<00:03:19.850> sense<00:03:20.390> so

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
is their dual pixel CMOS AF sense so

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.270 
is their dual pixel CMOS AF sense so
slow<00:03:20.810> your<00:03:20.959> crop<00:03:21.170> camera<00:03:21.560> but<00:03:22.100> they're

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
slow your crop camera but they're

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.949 
slow your crop camera but they're
focusing<00:03:22.820> system<00:03:23.000> is<00:03:23.299> something<00:03:23.630> new<00:03:23.780> it's

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
focusing system is something new it's

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.360 
focusing system is something new it's
like<00:03:24.079> they're<00:03:24.200> af2<00:03:24.709> system<00:03:25.160> they're<00:03:25.280> all

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
like they're af2 system they're all

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.170 
like they're af2 system they're all
focusing<00:03:25.760> system<00:03:25.910> 2<00:03:26.329> and<00:03:27.220> this<00:03:28.220> is<00:03:28.280> really

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
focusing system 2 and this is really

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.270 
focusing system 2 and this is really
interesting<00:03:29.720> because<00:03:29.750> a<00:03:29.989> lot<00:03:30.260> of<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.440> I<00:03:30.920> don't

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
interesting because a lot of the I don't

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.710 
interesting because a lot of the I don't
want<00:03:31.400> to<00:03:31.459> say<00:03:31.579> higher<00:03:31.850> higher<00:03:32.209> end<00:03:32.480> video

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
want to say higher higher end video

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.360 
want to say higher higher end video
cameras<00:03:33.140> like<00:03:33.260> for<00:03:33.440> actual<00:03:33.680> video<00:03:33.920> production

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
cameras like for actual video production

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.310 
cameras like for actual video production
or<00:03:35.269> anything<00:03:35.570> like<00:03:35.600> that<00:03:35.750> but<00:03:36.049> they

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
or anything like that but they

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.780 
or anything like that but they
incorporate<00:03:36.890> this<00:03:37.070> same<00:03:37.340> thing<00:03:37.610> and

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
incorporate this same thing and

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.789 
incorporate this same thing and
basically<00:03:38.299> think<00:03:38.630> of<00:03:38.720> it<00:03:38.810> as<00:03:38.930> taking<00:03:39.440> one

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
basically think of it as taking one

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.680 
basically think of it as taking one
pixel<00:03:40.190> and<00:03:40.400> having<00:03:40.730> two<00:03:40.910> photo<00:03:41.239> bodies<00:03:41.570> in

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
pixel and having two photo bodies in

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.229 
pixel and having two photo bodies in
each<00:03:41.840> so<00:03:42.320> it's<00:03:42.440> kind<00:03:42.620> of<00:03:42.709> like<00:03:43.030> it's<00:03:44.030> kind<00:03:44.060> of

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
each so it's kind of like it's kind of

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.150 
each so it's kind of like it's kind of
like<00:03:44.329> duplicating<00:03:45.019> you<00:03:45.440> know<00:03:45.560> two<00:03:45.620> pixels

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
like duplicating you know two pixels

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.250 
like duplicating you know two pixels
within<00:03:46.400> each<00:03:46.609> one<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.150> why<00:03:47.780> is<00:03:47.840> that<00:03:47.989> great

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
within each one and why is that great

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.620 
within each one and why is that great
because<00:03:48.500> it<00:03:49.010> will<00:03:49.250> well<00:03:49.820> supposedly<00:03:50.299> once

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
because it will well supposedly once

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.360 
because it will well supposedly once
again<00:03:50.810> this<00:03:50.930> is<00:03:50.989> how<00:03:51.200> a<00:03:51.230> larger<00:03:51.829> technologies

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
again this is how a larger technologies

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.180 
again this is how a larger technologies
work<00:03:52.609> the<00:03:52.760> larger<00:03:53.060> cameras<00:03:53.390> it<00:03:54.380> improves

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
work the larger cameras it improves

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.920 
work the larger cameras it improves
quicker<00:03:55.579> autofocusing<00:03:56.359> so<00:03:56.510> that<00:03:56.600> we<00:03:56.690> can<00:03:56.840> do

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
quicker autofocusing so that we can do

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.360 
quicker autofocusing so that we can do
it<00:03:56.989> on<00:03:57.079> the<00:03:57.170> fly<00:03:57.320> it's<00:03:57.590> extremely<00:03:58.010> fast<00:03:58.220> it's

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
it on the fly it's extremely fast it's

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.729 
it on the fly it's extremely fast it's
very<00:03:58.609> very<00:03:58.820> precise<00:03:59.269> yeah<00:04:00.170> an<00:04:00.320> accurate

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
very very precise yeah an accurate

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.380 
very very precise yeah an accurate
focusing<00:04:01.190> and<00:04:01.310> it<00:04:01.400> reduces<00:04:01.519> hunting<00:04:02.180> and

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
focusing and it reduces hunting and

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.390 
focusing and it reduces hunting and
hunting<00:04:02.540> well<00:04:03.380> that's<00:04:03.709> when<00:04:03.890> your<00:04:04.040> camera's

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
hunting well that's when your camera's

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.949 
hunting well that's when your camera's
like<00:04:04.549> trying<00:04:04.910> to<00:04:04.970> find<00:04:05.180> focus<00:04:05.660> if<00:04:05.840> you're

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
like trying to find focus if you're

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.660 
like trying to find focus if you're
using<00:04:06.170> autofocus<00:04:06.799> and<00:04:06.859> it's<00:04:07.040> not<00:04:07.190> grabbing<00:04:07.459> it

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
using autofocus and it's not grabbing it

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.400 
using autofocus and it's not grabbing it
right<00:04:07.880> away<00:04:08.000> so<00:04:08.630> that's<00:04:08.780> what<00:04:08.959> this<00:04:09.109> dual

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
right away so that's what this dual

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.120 
right away so that's what this dual
pixel<00:04:09.859> CML<00:04:10.280> CMOS<00:04:11.150> AF<00:04:11.900> system<00:04:12.260> is<00:04:12.590> going<00:04:12.859> to<00:04:12.980> do

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
pixel CML CMOS AF system is going to do

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.410 
pixel CML CMOS AF system is going to do
and<00:04:13.370> I<00:04:13.430> think<00:04:13.700> that's<00:04:13.880> one<00:04:14.060> of<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.209> biggest

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
and I think that's one of the biggest

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.539 
and I think that's one of the biggest
improvements<00:04:15.079> that<00:04:15.440> the<00:04:15.590> 70d<00:04:16.160> is<00:04:16.280> going<00:04:16.489> to

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
improvements that the 70d is going to

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.029 
improvements that the 70d is going to
have<00:04:16.729> so<00:04:17.450> if<00:04:17.690> you<00:04:17.810> own<00:04:17.959> the<00:04:18.079> 60d<00:04:18.560> or<00:04:18.799> should<00:04:19.010> you

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
have so if you own the 60d or should you

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:23.050 
have so if you own the 60d or should you
look<00:04:19.220> into<00:04:19.549> a<00:04:19.579> six-cd<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:21.470> 60d<00:04:21.919> is<00:04:22.130> a<00:04:22.520> great

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
look into a six-cd the 60d is a great

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.730 
look into a six-cd the 60d is a great
camera<00:04:23.360> ton<00:04:23.750> of<00:04:23.840> people<00:04:24.080> picked<00:04:24.289> it<00:04:24.380> up<00:04:24.440> a<00:04:24.590> lot

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
camera ton of people picked it up a lot

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.230 
camera ton of people picked it up a lot
of<00:04:24.860> vloggers<00:04:25.130> and<00:04:25.340> everything<00:04:25.760> like<00:04:25.909> that

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
of vloggers and everything like that

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.890 
of vloggers and everything like that
they<00:04:26.360> use<00:04:26.539> it<00:04:26.720> for<00:04:26.750> YouTube<00:04:27.169> but<00:04:28.630> it<00:04:29.630> is<00:04:29.870> a

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
they use it for YouTube but it is a

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.480 
they use it for YouTube but it is a
little<00:04:30.169> bit<00:04:30.319> of<00:04:30.440> an<00:04:30.530> older<00:04:30.800> technology<00:04:31.370> the

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
little bit of an older technology the

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.249 
little bit of an older technology the
processor<00:04:32.000> isn't<00:04:32.150> as<00:04:32.330> fast<00:04:32.590> um<00:04:33.590> yeah<00:04:35.259> its

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
processor isn't as fast um yeah its

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:37.930 
processor isn't as fast um yeah its
biggest<00:04:36.650> thing<00:04:36.770> was<00:04:36.889> that<00:04:37.009> it<00:04:37.069> really<00:04:37.340> did<00:04:37.580> HD

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
biggest thing was that it really did HD

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.360 
biggest thing was that it really did HD
video<00:04:38.210> it<00:04:38.360> had<00:04:38.479> hdmi<00:04:38.690> inputs<00:04:39.560> so<00:04:39.979> that<00:04:40.069> we<00:04:40.160> can

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
video it had hdmi inputs so that we can
