from<00:01:50.490> Spurs<00:01:50.790> but<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.030> think<00:01:51.299> one<00:01:51.390> player<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.810> I

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
from Spurs but I think one player that I

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.630 
from Spurs but I think one player that I
know<00:01:52.259> we<00:01:52.350> only<00:01:52.470> went<00:01:52.680> though<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.829> seasonable<00:01:53.520> we

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
know we only went though I seasonable we

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.130 
know we only went though I seasonable we
should<00:01:53.820> still<00:01:54.000> be<00:01:54.090> looking<00:01:54.180> at<00:01:54.450> his<00:01:54.840> most<00:01:55.020> of

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
should still be looking at his most of

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.569 
should still be looking at his most of
them<00:01:55.259> belly<00:01:55.470> people<00:01:55.979> were<00:01:56.040> going<00:01:56.189> on<00:01:56.310> about<00:01:56.369> it

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
them belly people were going on about it

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.219 
them belly people were going on about it
before<00:01:56.939> he<00:01:57.030> left<00:01:57.210> followed<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.869> he's<00:01:57.960> such<00:01:58.200> a

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
before he left followed and he's such a

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.660 
before he left followed and he's such a
good<00:01:58.439> strong<00:01:58.740> player<00:01:59.040> he's<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.250> box-to-box

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
good strong player he's a box-to-box

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.580 
good strong player he's a box-to-box
sack<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.509> he's<00:02:00.540> not<00:02:00.750> always<00:02:00.930> getting<00:02:01.469> in<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.260 
sack and he's not always getting in the
team<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.009> spurs<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.460> think<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.850> we<00:02:02.969> put<00:02:03.180> in

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
team of spurs and I think that we put in

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.639 
team of spurs and I think that we put in
a<00:02:03.360> strong<00:02:03.509> bid<00:02:03.810> we<00:02:03.930> might<00:02:04.079> be<00:02:04.200> able<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.380> get<00:02:04.530> all

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
a strong bid we might be able to get all

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.020 
a strong bid we might be able to get all
of<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.159> he's<00:02:05.250> some<00:02:05.430> other<00:02:05.610> could<00:02:05.759> really

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
of it and he's some other could really

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.660 
of it and he's some other could really

if you don't include messy and and we

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.059 
if you don't include messy and and we
and<00:02:50.049> we<00:02:50.079> just<00:02:50.260> need<00:02:50.379> that<00:02:50.500> winger<00:02:50.799> we<00:02:50.920> need<00:02:51.040> a

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
and we just need that winger we need a

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.440 
and we just need that winger we need a
winger<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.519> well<00:02:51.670> that's<00:02:51.879> not<00:02:52.030> scared<00:02:52.389> to

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
winger that well that's not scared to

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.690 
winger that well that's not scared to
take<00:02:52.659> on<00:02:52.840> defenders<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.500> I<00:02:53.799> think<00:02:54.010> Valencia

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
take on defenders and I think Valencia

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.210 
take on defenders and I think Valencia
is<00:02:54.819> kind<00:02:55.000> of<00:02:55.090> he's<00:02:55.420> not<00:02:55.629> been<00:02:55.780> that<00:02:55.870> player

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
is kind of he's not been that player

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.710 
is kind of he's not been that player
last<00:02:57.220> season<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:57.939> I<00:02:58.030> think<00:02:58.209> when<00:02:58.299> Aldo<00:02:58.540> will

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
last season and I think when Aldo will

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.360 
last season and I think when Aldo will
bring<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:59.049> back<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.530> Manchester<00:03:00.069> United

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
bring that back to Manchester United
