00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
played so we can't really count him at

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.459 
played so we can't really count him at
the<00:04:53.819> top<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:54.240> look<00:04:54.389> at<00:04:54.479> that<00:04:54.659> Nick<00:04:54.900> Foles<00:04:55.169> with

rating<00:04:59.389> 1230<00:05:00.389> yards<00:05:00.810> probably<00:05:01.080> not<00:05:01.560> the

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
rating 1230 yards probably not the

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.730 
rating 1230 yards probably not the
highest<00:05:01.979> because<00:05:02.460> I<00:05:02.490> don't<00:05:02.819> pass<00:05:03.090> that<00:05:03.419> much

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
highest because I don't pass that much

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.379 
highest because I don't pass that much

touchdown<00:05:09.389> passes<00:05:09.659> with<00:05:09.990> Nick<00:05:10.199> Foles<00:05:10.409> look<00:05:10.620> at

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
touchdown passes with Nick Foles look at

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.580

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.959 
that 17 leading the NFL only three
interceptions<00:05:13.979> so<00:05:14.340> that's<00:05:14.490> that's<00:05:14.819> really

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:14.969 
interceptions so that's that's really

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:16.790 
interceptions so that's that's really
good<00:05:15.360> let's<00:05:15.569> check<00:05:15.659> out<00:05:15.960> the<00:05:15.990> rushing<00:05:16.469> leaders
