this video we're going to show how you

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.200 
this video we're going to show how you
can<00:00:03.440> swap<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.620> pins<00:00:04.859> on<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.549> back<00:00:05.759> of<00:00:06.000> this

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
can swap the pins on the back of this

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
the cars original wiring first thing you

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.769 
the cars original wiring first thing you
got<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.570> do<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.840> remove<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.650> connector<00:00:20.779> well

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
got to do is remove this connector well

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.529 
got to do is remove this connector well
unlock<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.230> from<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.490> housing<00:00:23.910> itself<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.449> you

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
unlock it from the housing itself so you

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.660 
unlock it from the housing itself so you
can<00:00:24.720> get<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.080> those<00:00:25.260> wires<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.830> back<00:00:26.010> how

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
can get to those wires in the back how

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.460 
can get to those wires in the back how
you're<00:00:26.789> gonna<00:00:26.849> do<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.480> behind<00:00:27.900> here

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
you're gonna do that is behind here

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.970 
you're gonna do that is behind here
you'll<00:00:29.130> see<00:00:29.900> that<00:00:30.900> it's<00:00:31.140> actually<00:00:31.349> clipped<00:00:31.800> in

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
you'll see that it's actually clipped in

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.630 
you'll see that it's actually clipped in
with<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.430> plastic<00:00:32.989> here<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.170> here<00:00:34.890> so

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
with this plastic here and here so

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.700 
with this plastic here and here so
you're<00:00:35.790> gonna<00:00:35.880> have<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.149> pry<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:39.230> on<00:00:40.230> one<00:00:40.500> end

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
you're gonna have to pry it on one end

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.240 
you're gonna have to pry it on one end
first<00:00:44.780> between<00:00:45.780> there<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.110> mean<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.039> not

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
first between there I mean this is not

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.310 
first between there I mean this is not
too<00:00:47.579> hard<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.690> see<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:50.629> so<00:00:51.629> while<00:00:51.870> giving

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
too hard you can see it so while giving

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.760 
too hard you can see it so while giving
a<00:00:52.410> little<00:00:52.680> pressure<00:00:53.539> I'm<00:00:54.539> gonna<00:00:54.750> stick<00:00:55.620> it

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
a little pressure I'm gonna stick it

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.000 
a little pressure I'm gonna stick it
there<00:00:55.800> put<00:00:56.489> one<00:00:56.730> edge<00:00:56.969> first<00:00:57.559> so<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.770> out<00:00:58.980> a

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
there put one edge first so it's out a

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.549 
there put one edge first so it's out a
little<00:00:59.309> bit<00:00:59.489> out<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.030> clip<00:01:00.780> then<00:01:01.440> I'm

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
little bit out of the clip then I'm

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.000 
little bit out of the clip then I'm
gonna<00:01:01.680> do<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> other<00:01:02.010> side<00:01:02.309> I'm<00:01:03.239> gonna<00:01:03.359> fry<00:01:03.780> it

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
gonna do the other side I'm gonna fry it

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.329 
gonna do the other side I'm gonna fry it
there<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.159> go

there you go
go<00:01:06.090> both<00:01:06.299> sides<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:06.780> now<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.110> gonna<00:01:07.229> be<00:01:07.320> loose

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
go both sides so now it's gonna be loose

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.000 
go both sides so now it's gonna be loose
and<00:01:08.189> getting<00:01:08.400> bring<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.729> up<00:01:09.710> there<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.860> can

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
and getting bring it up there you can

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.890 
and getting bring it up there you can
see<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.280> wires<00:01:11.960> that<00:01:12.960> we'll<00:01:13.140> need<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.320> access

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
see the wires that we'll need to access

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.280 
see the wires that we'll need to access
okay<00:01:15.900> now<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.290> we<00:01:16.439> have<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:18.290> connector

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
slack and access to the back of the

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.499 
slack and access to the back of the
wires<00:01:25.380> you're<00:01:25.890> gonna<00:01:26.009> need<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.340> small<00:01:26.939> tool

screwdriver just to have a point there

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.039 
screwdriver just to have a point there
you<00:01:34.350> could<00:01:34.470> try<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.740> paperclip<00:01:35.729> but<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.930> know

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
you could try a paperclip but you know

the best is if you have a really small

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.069 
the best is if you have a really small
flat-head<00:01:39.000> screwdriver<00:01:39.950> that<00:01:40.950> will<00:01:41.159> fit<00:01:41.400> into

flat-head screwdriver that will fit into
this<00:01:43.079> little<00:01:43.140> area<00:01:43.890> above<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.520> pins<00:01:45.090> you'll

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
this little area above the pins you'll

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.440 
this little area above the pins you'll
see<00:01:45.509> each<00:01:45.659> pin<00:01:45.990> above<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.500> has<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> little

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
see each pin above it has a little

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.330 
see each pin above it has a little
rectangular<00:01:48.450> gap<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.710> that's<00:01:49.950> where<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.220> want

the bottom if you flip the pin over I

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.590 
the bottom if you flip the pin over I
can<00:03:06.890> also<00:03:07.070> push<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:07.580> off<00:03:07.700> so<00:03:07.970> you<00:03:08.150> want<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:08.510> go
