little hints throughout the lace this is

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.819 
little hints throughout the lace this is
what<00:01:42.479> came<00:01:42.630> with<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.840> shoe<00:01:42.990> or<00:01:43.470> do<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.619> like<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
what came with a shoe or do you like the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.200 
what came with a shoe or do you like the
replacement<00:01:44.310> laces<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.670> came<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.030> shoe

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
replacement laces that came in the shoe

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.630 
replacement laces that came in the shoe
with<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.290> purple<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.009> then<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.250> has<00:01:47.399> like<00:01:47.549> this

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
with the purple and then I has like this

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.370 
with the purple and then I has like this
bright<00:01:48.000> red<00:01:48.030> head<00:01:48.479> which<00:01:48.689> matches<00:01:48.930> with<00:01:49.259> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
bright red head which matches with the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.350 
bright red head which matches with the
outsole<00:01:49.799> but<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.430> think<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:51.000> bright<00:01:51.210> one

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
outsole but I think is this bright one

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.999 
outsole but I think is this bright one
of<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.479> six<00:01:51.630> parts<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.049> shoe<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.770> my

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
of the six parts of the shoe in my

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.319 
of the six parts of the shoe in my
opinion<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.460> just<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.820> way<00:01:53.939> there's<00:01:54.210> like

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
opinion is just the way there's like
