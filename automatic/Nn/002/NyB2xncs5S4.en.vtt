playing the moment with the quarterback
on<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.150> opposite<00:01:09.540> side<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> field<00:01:10.049> so

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
on the opposite side of the field so

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.590 
on the opposite side of the field so
that's<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.400> bizarre<00:01:11.729> thing<00:01:12.180> about<00:01:12.390> playing

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
that's the bizarre thing about playing

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.420 
that's the bizarre thing about playing
the<00:01:12.869> mad<00:01:13.110> moments<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.650> are<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.950> disc<00:01:14.159> is

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
the mad moments that are on the disc is

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.100 
the mad moments that are on the disc is
that<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> rosters<00:01:15.270> don't<00:01:15.450> match<00:01:15.630> up<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.020> this

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
that the rosters don't match up and this

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.920 
that the rosters don't match up and this
is<00:01:16.259> probably<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.680> most<00:01:17.570> glaring<00:01:19.610> change<00:01:20.930> as

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
is probably the most glaring change as

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.749 
is probably the most glaring change as
you<00:01:22.110> have<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.560> quarterback<00:01:23.100> playing<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.640> major

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
you have a quarterback playing a major

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.370 
you have a quarterback playing a major
role<00:01:23.909> on<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> other<00:01:24.540> side<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.049> moment

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
role on the other side of the moment

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.810 
role on the other side of the moment
than<00:01:25.799> what<00:01:25.979> actually<00:01:26.130> happened<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.640> real<00:01:26.790> life

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
than what actually happened in real life

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.499 
than what actually happened in real life
but<00:01:27.920> taking<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.040> aside<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:30.240> do<00:01:30.390> have

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
but taking that aside you do have

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.679 
but taking that aside you do have
Donovan<00:01:30.930> McNabb<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.619> got<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.860> use<00:01:31.979> him<00:01:32.189> to

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
Donovan McNabb and you got to use him to

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.420 
Donovan McNabb and you got to use him to
beat<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.869> come<00:01:34.500> back<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.829> beat<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> Eagles

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
that play is broken up so now we got a

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.050 
that play is broken up so now we got a
fourth-down<00:01:54.899> we're<00:01:55.229> really<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:56.219> tough<00:01:57.000> bind

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.490 
fourth-down we're really in a tough bind
here<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:59.000> 19<00:02:00.000> seconds<00:02:00.390> left<00:02:00.600> got<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.380> get<00:02:01.439> a

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
here so 19 seconds left got to get a

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.560 
here so 19 seconds left got to get a
first<00:02:01.770> down<00:02:01.860> first<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.399> foremost<00:02:02.850> probably

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
first down first and foremost probably

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.999 
first down first and foremost probably
have<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.750> use<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.960> time<00:02:04.200> out<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.649> then<00:02:04.799> see

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
have to use that time out and then see

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.010 
have to use that time out and then see
where<00:02:05.159> we<00:02:05.250> can<00:02:05.280> go<00:02:05.430> from<00:02:05.549> there<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:06.329> pitch<00:02:06.840> to

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
where we can go from there so a pitch to

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.410 
where we can go from there so a pitch to

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
replay of it here bouncing around like a

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.680 
replay of it here bouncing around like a
pinball<00:03:53.190> game<00:03:53.639> at<00:03:53.790> first<00:03:54.000> but<00:03:54.209> then<00:03:54.269> he<00:03:54.419> gets

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
pinball game at first but then he gets

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.869 
pinball game at first but then he gets
out<00:03:54.900> in<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.410> open<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.829> had<00:03:56.160> he<00:03:56.280> not<00:03:56.430> taken<00:03:56.790> on

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
out in the open and had he not taken on

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.569 
out in the open and had he not taken on
that<00:03:56.910> blocker<00:03:57.329> and<00:03:57.660> got<00:03:57.930> out<00:03:58.049> of<00:03:58.169> bounds<00:03:58.579> you

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
that blocker and got out of bounds you

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.479 
that blocker and got out of bounds you
had<00:03:59.700> one<00:03:59.940> more<00:04:00.060> shot<00:04:00.299> to<00:04:00.599> get<00:04:01.290> closer<00:04:01.560> but<00:04:02.160> also

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
had one more shot to get closer but also

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:03.800 
had one more shot to get closer but also
might<00:04:02.790> not<00:04:02.940> have<00:04:03.030> been<00:04:03.150> close<00:04:03.299> enough<00:04:03.480> for<00:04:03.599> the

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
might not have been close enough for the

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.690 
might not have been close enough for the
field<00:04:03.989> goal<00:04:04.200> in<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.650> first<00:04:04.829> place<00:04:05.010> so<00:04:05.280> the

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
field goal in the first place so the

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.460 
field goal in the first place so the
Redskins<00:04:06.150> win<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:06.450> toss<00:04:06.660> they<00:04:07.290> will

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
Redskins win the toss they will

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.670 
Redskins win the toss they will
obviously<00:04:07.819> will<00:04:08.819> choose<00:04:09.120> to<00:04:09.269> receive<00:04:09.680> so

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
that's just my bad for not not reading

the<00:06:17.070> play<00:06:17.250> are<00:06:17.430> correctly<00:06:17.910> I<00:06:18.180> was<00:06:19.050> thinking

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
the play are correctly I was thinking

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.960 
the play are correctly I was thinking
that<00:06:19.530> Portus<00:06:20.160> was<00:06:20.190> getting<00:06:20.520> the<00:06:20.580> ball<00:06:20.729> there

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
that Portus was getting the ball there

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.990 
that Portus was getting the ball there
so<00:06:21.270> anyway<00:06:22.139> the<00:06:22.470> second<00:06:23.099> and<00:06:23.220> 13<00:06:23.610> put<00:06:23.880> myself

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
so anyway the second and 13 put myself

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.080 
so anyway the second and 13 put myself
in<00:06:24.300> a<00:06:24.360> hole<00:06:24.830> that's<00:06:25.830> that's<00:06:26.550> not<00:06:26.669> going<00:06:26.910> to<00:06:27.000> get

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
in a hole that's that's not going to get

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.219 
in a hole that's that's not going to get
it<00:06:27.210> done<00:06:27.389> should<00:06:27.750> have<00:06:27.840> thrown<00:06:27.960> to<00:06:28.139> the

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:28.229 
it done should have thrown to the

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:29.629 
it done should have thrown to the
underneath<00:06:28.590> guy<00:06:28.770> that<00:06:28.979> looked<00:06:29.190> like<00:06:29.280> it's<00:06:29.550> a

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 
underneath guy that looked like it's a

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.930 
underneath guy that looked like it's a
sideline<00:06:30.030> but<00:06:30.949> instead<00:06:31.949> I<00:06:32.130> throw<00:06:32.490> to<00:06:32.669> a<00:06:32.699> guy

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
sideline but instead I throw to a guy

and you'll see that from time to time

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:41.020 
and you'll see that from time to time
probably<00:06:40.130> more<00:06:40.250> often<00:06:40.550> than<00:06:40.669> not<00:06:40.729> my
