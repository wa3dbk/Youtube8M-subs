00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.920
 fungi and bacteria 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.620
 the indication is made by the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.430
 volume found on the packaging 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.680
 but attention is needed to be careful 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.350
 not to harm health

 answer what is myth and what is truth 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.879
 on hydrogen peroxide 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.080
 hydrogen peroxide can be used as a 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.000
 mouthwash is a fear of water 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.250
 oxygen must be very careful to 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.160
 handling it just for use as a 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.800
 was in place because the anvisa that the 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.420
 regulator she advocates that this water 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.750
 A 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.840
 very low concentration then what is 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.270
 indicated is whether to use rinsing agents 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.500
 because they do have the 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.720
 concentration of hydrogen peroxide is not 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.310
 correct way to make use of both 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.220
 how is it called to clear 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.950
 meters or even keep the toothbrushes 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.820
 in a solution with hydrogen peroxide 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.920
 eliminating the genes was a fear that originated 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.950
 in the same way as other products have 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.320
 an expiration date and you use the 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.899
 hydrogen peroxide for you to leave brushes 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.479
 of tooth sauce may be promoting right 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.670
 and over a period of time the 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.509
 degradation of the journey flowers instead of 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.060
 you and promote brush cleaning 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.670
 you are thus promoter by producing the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.580
 production of new microorganisms, which 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.739
 is to indicate you used oxygenated 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.799
 just brush the brush and do not 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.440
 use hydrogen peroxide in the feet and 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:24.440
 avoids colds fungi and squalls 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:26.750
 It is an oxygenated truth that promotes 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.739
 death of microorganisms that promote 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.299
 this stench promoted by the sos 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.329
 excessive pressure on feet 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.950
 drinking drops of hydrogen peroxide kills 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.470
 bacteria and viruses 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.640
 it's a book to volkswagen nothing she does not 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.750
 should be used for this purpose 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.700
 the consumption of hydrogen peroxide or 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.670
 wash the apple either with hydrogen peroxide 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.230
 it may promote the irritation of the 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.290
 mucosa of the mouth of the 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.840
 sings if ingested can lead to pain 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.060
 then in any way should 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.810
 be used at the team paul g nothing to 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.420
 this end 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.840
 the hydrogen peroxide serves to disinfect 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.610
 all kinds of surfaces is a myth 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.170
 when you use it only for cleaning 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:17.510
 My ne rich is toilets inside your 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:22.099
 residence because the mechanism by which 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.739
 the water to hydrogen peroxide acts is not 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.420
 this disinfection is possible 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.459
 in these environments 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.060
 in the case of yesterday ijuÃ­ environments 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.129
 hospitals that you will have there 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.739
 secretions like cars is possibly 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:39.109
 a few drops of blood 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:44.420
 Did you clean these products? 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:46.879
 they activate the oxygen, releasing it is the 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.620
 Oxygen to live which is a great event 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.640
 which will promote the death of these 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.060
 microorganisms 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:56.030
 a volks igg nothing prevents infections and help 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.639
 in true wound healing 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.250
 this is the main use of hydrogen peroxide 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:05.090
 to promote is not it is from 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.590
 cleaning of injured areas 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.130
 is mainly used as 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.130
 antiseptic
