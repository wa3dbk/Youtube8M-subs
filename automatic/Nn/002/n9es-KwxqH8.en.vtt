00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.939
 a long time ago I began to worry about 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.099
 improving the quality of the video in my 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.290
 video reviews due to the fact that I use 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.050
 An ordinary video table lamp seems 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.179
 darkish if not unscrew the value 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.000
 iso and I decided not to get myself 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.039
 the chamber light immediately went to 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.429
 aliexpress and picked the best for 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.109
 yourself option costing $ 20 but 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.909
 possessing pretty good 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.460
 specifications for their 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:33.649
 money it is in this premise he and 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.649
 is located so proceed to unpack 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:51.300
 here it is a box our firm Vincennes 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:57.380
 model kw 160 that is, we have 160 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.380
 lamps so 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.810
 but here we have all the possible types of food 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.440
 what can power this device but we 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.970
 let's see what is inside and not 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:15.080
 broke if the parcel is in time 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:19.300
 transportation so immediately meet us 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:31.369
 filters this as i understood cold light 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:37.610
 it's warm that's kind of diodes I kiss all so 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:39.440
 on the back we have a compartment for all 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.430
 types of food 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.350
 Well, I understand no tires that is 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.490
 batteries if I hang around here they 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:53.420
 and will stick up 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.960
 dimmer and some other 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.720
 chip 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.259
 Well, look at it in the full review so 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:05.540
 and what else do we have for picking it 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:06.909
 us mount and mount under hot 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:13.209
 shoe 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:15.580
 Probably you can attach to a tripod and 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:21.230
 put video water highlight 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:23.209
 any videos so well actually we 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.340
 I wonder how this device works 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.950
 I'm going to look for batteries and 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.080
 I also spent the night testing 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.900
 I managed to test this non-chamber 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.150
 the light even managed to highlight it using 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.269
 one of their future videos so 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.579
 a few words I can say the first is not 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.799
 take a cheap battery for this 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.140
 the unit is enough for a maximum of an hour 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.239
 one and a half charge indicator 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.239
 shows only half though 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.350
 the batteries were new and the brightness will be in 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.780
 half weaker 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.209
 but the first pancake is known as a lump 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.850
 so I bought a second set of batteries 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.019
 which benefit shows already full 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.750
 charge indicator 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.440
 by no means advertising because I 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.660
 not himself 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.610
 how long will these batteries last 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.120
 I advise you to get a battery from 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.950
 video camera sony or panasonic for example 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.700
 but this advice is primarily for yourself 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.410
 of himself 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.040
 Well , try to demonstrate 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.580
 what are you capable of this unit 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:27.680
 plunge into total darkness 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:29.900
 well, or almost certainly please note 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.680
 the regulator has a rather smooth ride and 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.700
 we can adjust light intensity as 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.700
 we want 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:46.310
 so all light on maximum let's take one of 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:51.590
 provided light filters cold 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:53.950
 light is not cold white about 5000 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.950
 kelvin 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.870
 Well, I would not say that he is very strong 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:12.160
 scatters light and something changes 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:15.970
 performs more aesthetic function with 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:20.220
 him with him he looks like there is no salt 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:24.490
 whether more beautiful and now take the warm 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:32.520
 2700 Kelvin and here it is valid 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:32.520
 the effect is the light gets warmer 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.050
 Now I set the light on the camera and 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.880
 I will try to show you a gain 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.010
 performance versus 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.520
 An ordinary lamp that I for this 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.520
 used 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:57.020
 so here we have iso value 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:05:08.919
 400 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:13.520
 and now we will change to 200 and 100 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:19.159
 now turned off the light so it would have been without 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:20.419
 of this project so now i am out 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:23.680
 rooms and I want to show you 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:27.139
 how it will look on the street 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:31.839
 iso value in history at about 1600 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.839
 and now I turn on the spotlight 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.720
 now shines to maximum 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.930
 well this is not camera view of me 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.570
 completely satisfied 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.990
 cost me this color is 700 rubles so 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.520
 what I think is not bad 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.590
 leave comments under the video set 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.810
 Like and be sure to subscribe to 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:27.790
 the channel ahead is still a lot of interesting to all 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.790
 Thank you for your attention to new meetings
