00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
noticed we're people that have tried to

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.059 
noticed we're people that have tried to
use<00:02:17.879> it<00:02:17.910> their<00:02:18.569> faces<00:02:19.080> get<00:02:19.530> more<00:02:19.739> red<00:02:20.040> and

use it their faces get more red and

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.890 
use it their faces get more red and
irritated<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:21.000> itchy<00:02:21.150> because<00:02:21.420> it's<00:02:21.690> drying

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
irritated and itchy because it's drying

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.320 
irritated and itchy because it's drying
out<00:02:22.080> their<00:02:22.290> skin<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.610> main<00:02:23.819> difference

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
out their skin and the main difference

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.720 
out their skin and the main difference
between<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.690> floor<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.110> CEO<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.950> in

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
between the floor to the CEO and in

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.390 
between the floor to the CEO and in
Florence<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.209> gel<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:27.720> just<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.709> consistency

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
Florence and gel is just a consistency

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.039 
Florence and gel is just a consistency
of<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.580> gel<00:02:29.819> they<00:02:30.030> basically<00:02:30.360> do<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.810> exact

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
of the gel they basically do the exact

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.720 
of the gel they basically do the exact
same<00:02:31.080> thing<00:02:31.560> but<00:02:31.590> some<00:02:31.980> people<00:02:32.340> cannot

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
same thing but some people cannot

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.319 
same thing but some people cannot
tolerate<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:34.290> serum<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:35.730> then<00:02:35.910> they<00:02:36.060> go<00:02:36.209> ahead

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
tolerate the serum so then they go ahead

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.080 
tolerate the serum so then they go ahead
and<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.930> gel<00:02:37.319> allows<00:02:37.920> them<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.310> put<00:02:38.819> it<00:02:38.940> on<00:02:39.060> a

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
and the gel allows them to put it on a

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.550 
and the gel allows them to put it on a
little<00:02:39.360> easier<00:02:39.810> on<00:02:39.870> their<00:02:40.079> skin<00:02:40.319> and<00:02:40.349> they're

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
little easier on their skin and they're

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.289 
little easier on their skin and they're
able<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.799> tolerate<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.340> isn't<00:02:41.700> maybe<00:02:41.819> isn't<00:02:42.239> it

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
able to tolerate it isn't maybe isn't it

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.710 
able to tolerate it isn't maybe isn't it
doesn't<00:02:42.450> feel<00:02:42.690> as<00:02:42.750> strong<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.380> their<00:02:43.530> skin

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
doesn't feel as strong to their skin

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.970 
doesn't feel as strong to their skin
some<00:02:45.720> people<00:02:46.019> actually<00:02:46.170> say<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.739> gel

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
some people actually say that the gel

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.229 
some people actually say that the gel
lasts<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.340> little<00:02:47.430> bit<00:02:47.579> longer<00:02:47.700> because<00:02:48.150> they

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
lasts a little bit longer because they

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.490 
lasts a little bit longer because they
don't<00:02:48.420> need<00:02:48.599> as<00:02:48.750> much<00:02:48.900> because<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.319> goes<00:02:49.470> a

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
don't need as much because it goes a

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.800 
don't need as much because it goes a
little<00:02:49.739> further<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.819> that's<00:02:51.000> also<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.390> benefit

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
little further so that's also a benefit

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.990 
little further so that's also a benefit
but<00:02:51.959> it's<00:02:52.110> off<00:02:52.319> it's<00:02:52.709> mostly<00:02:53.220> what<00:02:53.549> do<00:02:53.910> you

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
but it's off it's mostly what do you

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.170 
but it's off it's mostly what do you
prefer<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.420> serum<00:02:54.989> or<00:02:55.200> gel<00:02:55.530> okay<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.030> hope

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
prefer a serum or gel okay and I hope

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.809 
prefer a serum or gel okay and I hope
that<00:02:57.360> clears<00:02:57.629> up<00:02:57.750> any<00:02:58.099> questions<00:02:59.099> if<00:02:59.519> you<00:02:59.790> have
