00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:09.379
 today the dollar today 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.970
 sep we are only in sÃ£o januÃ¡rio the new 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.509
 damn it 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.610
 the horn is not working too 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.470
 how are we going to test studying and 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.140
 I got a multimeter here 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.210
 The team got in you cheap at 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:40.010
 any store is seeing here 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:43.160
 I put new to direct current 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.190
 here is alternating current 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.300
 We're going to use direct current 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.760
 selecting here or 20 because the battery 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.769
 provides 12 volts 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.409
 I took a connector the two connector 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.299
 horn and I'll test it if I do not receive 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:57.949
 that the problem is not in the 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:59.780
 horn 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.549
 now if it receives energy the 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.460
 problem is in the horn 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:06.490
 we'll see press the horn there looks 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.270
 only what happens 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:15.159
 seen is still negative because it 's just a question 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.159
 Reverse but no problem 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.060
 the energy is coming to the horn not 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.450
 is working then who burned was 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.690
 the horn is no problem there in the not 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:31.040
 gives problem here is simple to solve 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:34.370
 Okay, that's it, of course you have one. 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.380

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.730

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.330
 real 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.510
 you can not see if the bike does not have the time 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.510
 bad 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.080
 only that soon support took advantage of the support 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.080
 what is on the bike? 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.810

 this bike she is Korean not only with belt 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.359
 only would a monster round of the 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.620
 suzuki and malta I observed a perspective 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:57.340

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:01.590
 and is the clutch cable and the road 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.590

 as well as close together 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.860
