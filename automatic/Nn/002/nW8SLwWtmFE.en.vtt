00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.779
 where was it a birmingham just 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.669
 six or seven months 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.240

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:10.880

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.280
 true or you just could not understand 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.050
 that she was always like that 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.540

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.790

 nowhere to go all this in the image 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.920
 because I loved thinking in my head 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.170
 as if I forgot it soon 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.110
 after all, how many times did she leave 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.540
 only this time has become fatal for you 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.720
 one meeting to avoid scandal and 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.720
 right there with this freak he did not change him 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.720
 she did not value the paper nowhere to go but 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.660
 she plunged a knife into his heart is no longer 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.180
 love are words left but from her 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.149
 look all around the head he 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.610
 changed he understood all the mistakes and there 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.820

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.760
 take out what was no longer return she 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.309
 I myself have not forgotten but they say forget this 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.950
 evening I will remember forever our last 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.619
 the meeting was no longer discussed 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.920
 just not enough and breathing is no longer 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.130
 because I love you and do not think I'm stupid and I 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.210
 constantly 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.950
 tears themselves flowed what you want now 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.520
 stopped approached me and said 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.390
 I love you not only for this I live 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.850
 you said love though it wasn't me 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.729
 after all, I believed you as a young fool 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.939
 stepping over yourself goodbye is everything 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.759
 I've done worse, I did it even worse 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.369
 broke me like a match in half and on 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.409
 lips and crawl they say I will not give 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.110
 heart pieces 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.990
 her reflection she remembered what was 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.569
 nothing to do with my soul broken and my heart 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.909
 stretch your bios and it seems like time 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:53.610
 as if I stopped quietly went out into the yard 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.069
 it was raining outside I didn't even immediately 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.700
 noticed this small tremor like 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.700
 run away 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.429
 but I did not know where the moments were recalled 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.829
 we were together when I wanted to scream 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:08.039
 but the chest is a little pain thinking to her 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:11.319
 go but did not have the will tried to smoke 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.930
 but matches were let down by falling drops 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.260
 shot were clubs and a friend was sitting next 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.290
 and told me something but didnâ€™t hear 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.950
 single not i will reach the cigarette and just 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.439
 looking into the distance 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.379
 sat rooster silent lead lead 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.769
 reasons only rain drops 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:30.579
 rushed past 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:32.950
 and in my head the image of my beloved this evening 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:36.189
 I will remember forever our last meeting 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.680
 this is no longer speech evil is simply not 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:41.049
 enough and breathing is no longer because I 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.459
 I love you and I do not feel stupid at I 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.659
 stood for a while 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.370
 tears themselves flowed what you want now 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:51.969
 stopped approached me and said 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:55.780
 I love you not only for this I live 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:58.449
 I told him not to take seriously she 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.000
 just a queen but only your dreams 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:03.669
 we lit a cigarette sitting on the bench I 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.730
 soothe him forget about this shuffle 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:09.280
 you were her toy we know it is a woman but 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.010
 he loved her and apparently to the grave 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.739
 the moon has changed the sun and he looks like give 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.880
 in his glassy eyes could be seen by 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.610
 print 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.340
 time will cure melt this ice winters 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.040
 Audit heart spring he sings but 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.290
 it was all wrong it was only worse and 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.540
 who would n't he say no one 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.150
 listen to the month was not at all 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.180
 find out and only whisper him but could not 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.970
 she would lie and she would not tell me 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.880
 all eyes that it was not just her not 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.550
 when she looked at you turned it 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.760
 love and you did not see live and believed it 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.490
 again she skillfully as an actress played with 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.130
 you and you could not see her beautiful 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:54.160
 the role you all believed her eyes 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.980
 close further walked behind her nothing 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.830
 noticing or just did not want to see how 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.350
 everything worked out and here she went and the pain 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.840
 I have this evening left inside 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.630
 forever our last meeting 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.120
 this is no longer discussed it was simply not 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.790
 enough and breathing is no longer because I 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.239
 love you and don't think I'm stupid 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.220
 stood a little tears themselves poured 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:21.340
 wanted you to stop now 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.090
 came up to me and said you love not 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.670
 just for the sake of 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.210
 this 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.760
 I live this evening I will remember for the liver 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.100
 our last meeting is about this more 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.770

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.740

 stopped approached me and said 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.250
 quietly love not only for this I live 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.210
 this 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.670
 like this 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.570
