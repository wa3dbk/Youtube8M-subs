little<00:01:10.560> bit<00:01:10.800> different<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.310> then<00:01:11.429> it<00:01:11.550> builds

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:11.789 
little bit different and then it builds

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
layer of powder and then we selectively

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.330 
layer of powder and then we selectively
apply<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:17.130> binder<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:18.470> create<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.560> solid<00:01:19.979> part

once the layer is finished the more it I

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.340 
once the layer is finished the more it I
want<00:01:23.789> layer<00:01:23.940> thickness<00:01:24.390> spread<00:01:24.929> a<00:01:24.960> new<00:01:25.140> layer

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
want layer thickness spread a new layer

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.380 
want layer thickness spread a new layer
of<00:01:25.440> powder<00:01:25.740> repeat<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.850> layer<00:01:27.149> by<00:01:27.360> layer

of powder repeat that layer by layer

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.899 
of powder repeat that layer by layer
until<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.960> part<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.319> complete<00:01:28.710> we<00:01:29.670> have<00:01:29.789> to

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
until the part is complete we have to

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.120 
until the part is complete we have to
allow<00:01:30.149> to<00:01:30.450> sit<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.929> cure<00:01:31.259> for<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> few<00:01:31.799> hours

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
allow to sit to cure for a few hours

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.950 
allow to sit to cure for a few hours
and<00:01:32.340> then<00:01:32.819> we<00:01:32.940> can<00:01:33.090> vacuum<00:01:33.299> away<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.810> loose

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
and then we can vacuum away the loose

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.919 
and then we can vacuum away the loose
powder<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.380> retrieve<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.100> tile<00:01:35.310> we've<00:01:35.640> built

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
powder and retrieve the tile we've built

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.749 
powder and retrieve the tile we've built
one<00:01:36.929> last<00:01:37.200> step<00:01:37.440> we<00:01:37.619> do<00:01:37.740> apply<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> layer<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.520> a

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
one last step we do apply a layer of a

00:01:38.759 --> 00:02:52.220 
one last step we do apply a layer of a
quart<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.450> epoxy<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.200> strengthen<00:01:40.679> apart

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.539 

one<00:02:53.230> beautiful<00:02:53.500> things<00:02:53.859> about<00:02:54.010> this<00:02:54.189> is<00:02:54.370> it's

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
one beautiful things about this is it's

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.280 
one beautiful things about this is it's
artistically<00:02:55.450> beautiful<00:02:55.569> in<00:02:55.900> terms<00:02:55.989> of<00:02:56.200> how

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
artistically beautiful in terms of how

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.349 
artistically beautiful in terms of how
its<00:02:56.409> boxed<00:02:56.769> out<00:02:56.859> with<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:57.549> complexity<00:02:58.060> inside

its boxed out with the complexity inside
it

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:58.689 
it

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:01.319 
it
it's<00:02:59.109> about<00:02:59.829> this<00:02:59.980> digital<00:03:00.189> story<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:01.060> it<00:03:01.150> and

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
it's about this digital story to it and

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.199 
it's about this digital story to it and
its<00:03:01.810> scientific<00:03:02.620> evidence<00:03:03.069> exactly<00:03:03.939> data

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
its scientific evidence exactly data

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.149 
its scientific evidence exactly data
it's<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:05.019> lot<00:03:05.260> of<00:03:05.290> things<00:03:05.560> together<00:03:05.739> and<00:03:06.040> that's

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 
it's a lot of things together and that's

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.750 
it's a lot of things together and that's
what's<00:03:06.430> kind<00:03:06.579> of<00:03:06.670> so<00:03:07.209> neat<00:03:07.540> about<00:03:07.659> it<00:03:07.810> is<00:03:08.079> that

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
what's kind of so neat about it is that

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.220 
what's kind of so neat about it is that
it's<00:03:09.760> emblematic<00:03:10.359> of<00:03:10.450> many<00:03:10.689> many<00:03:10.900> different

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
it's emblematic of many many different

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:18.150 
it's emblematic of many many different
things<00:03:11.349> that<00:03:11.560> are<00:03:11.739> like<00:03:11.950> really<00:03:12.310> cutting<00:03:12.579> it

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
this is what we can do we broadly like

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.820 
this is what we can do we broadly like
in<00:03:21.850> museums<00:03:22.300> but<00:03:22.660> with<00:03:23.200> international

collaboration you have something that's

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.020 
collaboration you have something that's

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.940 
it looks amazing the details on that are
just<00:03:43.860> tremendous<00:03:44.860> and<00:03:45.130> that's<00:03:46.800> you<00:03:47.800> know<00:03:47.860> I

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
just tremendous and that's you know I

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.890 
just tremendous and that's you know I
think<00:03:47.980> that's<00:03:48.190> a<00:03:48.370> large<00:03:48.820> part<00:03:49.060> of<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.480> tribute

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
think that's a large part of a tribute

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.740 
think that's a large part of a tribute
to<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.070> digital<00:03:51.480> standing<00:03:52.480> that<00:03:52.600> we

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
to the to the digital standing that we

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:59.240 
to the to the digital standing that we
did<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.110> capturing<00:03:53.530> that<00:03:53.620> level<00:03:54.010> of<00:03:54.070> detail

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.250 

yeah<00:04:00.250> and<00:04:00.430> this<00:04:00.760> is<00:04:00.940> actually<00:04:01.300> not<00:04:01.450> inaccurate

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
yeah and this is actually not inaccurate

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.710 
yeah and this is actually not inaccurate
in<00:04:02.410> terms<00:04:02.650> of<00:04:02.890> what<00:04:03.430> it<00:04:03.550> looked<00:04:03.730> like<00:04:03.820> like

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
in terms of what it looked like like

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.030 
in terms of what it looked like like
this<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:04.930> probably<00:04:05.170> one<00:04:05.500> of<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.650> cleanest

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
this is probably one of the cleanest

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.200 
this is probably one of the cleanest
bones<00:04:06.250> we<00:04:07.210> had<00:04:07.450> and<00:04:07.750> that's<00:04:08.910> really<00:04:09.910> what<00:04:10.120> it

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.210 
bones we had and that's really what it

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.360 
bones we had and that's really what it
look<00:04:10.330> like
