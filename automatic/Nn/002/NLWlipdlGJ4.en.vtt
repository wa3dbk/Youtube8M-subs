00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
what is it that changed in American

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.400 
what is it that changed in American
society<00:00:09.240> well<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:09.719> think<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.960> lot<00:00:10.139> of<00:00:10.170> things

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
society well I think a lot of things

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.499 
society well I think a lot of things
have<00:00:10.679> happened<00:00:11.099> first<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:11.910> all<00:00:12.000> there<00:00:12.300> as

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
have happened first of all there as

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.509 
have happened first of all there as
there<00:00:12.990> always<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.410> when<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.980> economic

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
there always is when the economic

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.129 
there always is when the economic
paradigm<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.330> country<00:00:15.750> or<00:00:15.870> in<00:00:15.990> this<00:00:16.080> case

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
paradigm of a country or in this case

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.220 
paradigm of a country or in this case
the<00:00:16.500> whole<00:00:16.680> world<00:00:16.920> changed<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.720> we<00:00:18.720> shifted

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
the whole world changed and we shifted

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.080 
the whole world changed and we shifted
to<00:00:19.320> an<00:00:19.410> information<00:00:19.949> technology<00:00:20.100> society

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
to an information technology society

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.080 
to an information technology society
where<00:00:22.850> people<00:00:23.850> as<00:00:24.150> consumers<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.050> investors

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
where people as consumers and investors

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.640 
where people as consumers and investors
have<00:00:27.090> given<00:00:28.279> mobile<00:00:29.279> money<00:00:29.550> relative<00:00:29.880> power

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
have given mobile money relative power

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.959 
have given mobile money relative power
so<00:00:31.650> we<00:00:31.800> change<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.250> economic<00:00:32.700> paradigm

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
so we change the economic paradigm

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.780 
so we change the economic paradigm
that's<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.780> downside<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:35.160> put<00:00:35.430> enormous

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
that's the downside is it's put enormous

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.910 
that's the downside is it's put enormous
pressure<00:00:36.000> on<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.600> middle<00:00:36.750> class<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.350> our

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
pressure on the middle class in our

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.280 
pressure on the middle class in our

country and in many other countries very

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.110 
country and in many other countries very
difficult<00:00:40.800> for<00:00:40.829> us<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.040> maintain<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.579> solid

middle-class dream in America that

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.310 
middle-class dream in America that
requires<00:00:45.180> politics<00:00:45.719> that's<00:00:45.899> why<00:00:46.050> there's<00:00:46.230> a

well spent that's first thing the second
thing<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:04.379> advent<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.129> Internet<00:01:05.640> giving

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
thing is the advent of Internet giving

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.810 
thing is the advent of Internet giving
has<00:01:06.990> given<00:01:07.409> people<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.860> modest<00:01:08.280> means<00:01:08.460> the

has given people of modest means the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.490 
has given people of modest means the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
chance if they all care about the same

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.370 
chance if they all care about the same
thing<00:01:10.770> at<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.040> same<00:01:11.159> time<00:01:11.869> to<00:01:12.869> swamp<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
thing at the same time to swamp the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.100 
thing at the same time to swamp the
giving<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.950> gates<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.460> buffett<00:01:14.760> if<00:01:15.600> they<00:01:15.869> all

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
giving of gates and buffett if they all

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.740 
giving of gates and buffett if they all
join<00:01:16.439> together<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.860> give<00:01:17.130> what<00:01:17.400> they<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
join together to give what they can the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.080 
join together to give what they can the
third<00:01:19.049> thing<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.560> would<00:01:20.189> say<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.670> rise<00:01:20.880> of

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
third thing I would say is the rise of

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.359 
third thing I would say is the rise of
the<00:01:21.119> non-governmental<00:01:21.750> organizations<00:01:22.560> both

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
the non-governmental organizations both

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.300 
the non-governmental organizations both
as<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> conduit<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:25.229> service<00:01:25.710> delivery<00:01:25.860> tool

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
as a conduit and service delivery tool

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.090 
as a conduit and service delivery tool
in<00:01:26.580> our<00:01:26.759> country<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.450> for<00:01:28.170> partners<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.860> poor

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
in our country and for partners in poor

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.420 
in our country and for partners in poor
developing<00:01:29.640> countries<00:01:30.320> so<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.799> what<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
developing countries so and what the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.600 
developing countries so and what the
reason<00:01:32.670> that's<00:01:32.850> important<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.390> gives

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
reason that's important is that gives

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.039 
reason that's important is that gives
people<00:01:35.610> who<00:01:35.700> invest<00:01:36.030> their<00:01:36.119> time<00:01:36.240> or<00:01:36.659> money<00:01:36.840> or

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
people who invest their time or money or

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.679 
people who invest their time or money or
skills<00:01:37.380> or<00:01:37.619> give<00:01:37.799> things<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:39.090> confidence

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
skills or give things the confidence

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.390 
skills or give things the confidence
that<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.110> will<00:01:40.140> be<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.470> waste<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.829> gift<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.250> will

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
that it will be a waste to gift it will

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.639 
that it will be a waste to gift it will
be<00:01:41.549> an<00:01:41.640> empty<00:01:42.060> gesture<00:01:42.390> there<00:01:42.869> really<00:01:43.170> will<00:01:43.500> be

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
be an empty gesture there really will be

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.920 
be an empty gesture there really will be
a<00:01:43.680> very<00:01:44.009> high<00:01:44.250> probability<00:01:44.570> that<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.750> get<00:01:45.899> a

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
a very high probability that you get a

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.800 
a very high probability that you get a
big<00:01:46.290> return<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.740> your<00:01:47.040> investment<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.600> that's

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
big return on your investment and that's

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.539 
big return on your investment and that's
the<00:01:48.930> concept<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> microcredit<00:01:50.189> what<00:01:50.460> you
