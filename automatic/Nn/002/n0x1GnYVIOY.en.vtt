there<00:03:25.570> I<00:03:25.920> thought<00:03:26.920> they<00:03:27.130> thought<00:03:27.600> that<00:03:28.600> was<00:03:28.750> a

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
there I thought they thought that was a

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.410 
there I thought they thought that was a
no-no<00:03:29.080> so<00:03:29.500> they<00:03:29.590> just<00:03:29.769> put<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.340> symbol<00:03:31.030> on<00:03:31.180> there

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
no-no so they just put a symbol on there

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.880 
no-no so they just put a symbol on there
where<00:03:31.870> it's<00:03:31.989> big<00:03:32.200> but<00:03:32.380> then<00:03:32.560> there's<00:03:32.739> the
