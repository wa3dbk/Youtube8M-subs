00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 I put there that I was going to bet all 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.430
 friday 11 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.440
 Then I spend three weeks posting the 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.179
 guys is when your body in our area 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.370
 three weeks to impose dipo 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.370
 I was playing a little animal game. 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.750
 The Bible has a certain way of 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.220
 read and I did that nor am I talking about 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.290
 hermeneutics these stops of 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.540
 interpreting or even translating 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.529
 I'm talking the Bible she needs 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.450
 be read 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.489
 I can not even speak in an easy way. 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.379
 so I'll give an example open the sita 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.110
 acts of the apostles in where the galley 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:41.150
 I sold everything I had to give to who 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.290
 You need manja this is something very crazy 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.180
 happened in the church 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.280
 I have a brother and I 'm not going 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.300
 name names in respect to him today. 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.970
 love it too much 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.829
 only that he arrived like this kind of sabadão at 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.470
 People go to the restaurant in a 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.170
 hot dog and we eat and then 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.840
 He ate at the time of paying, he talks to 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.239
 acts of the apostles kind of propagate to 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.059
 revitalize of the type you need to understand 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.310
 unlike the type so you nor the 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.040
 betting staff would sell everything they 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.920
 I had to give anyone who needs the leu 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.570
 That looked at us, man. 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.580
 Acts of the Apostles pay for who 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.950
 accurate is something like the bible type 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.440
 Speak to you to forgive the other seventy 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.060
 times seven is not the best example 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.670
 so the bible says if you take a 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.679
 slap in the face you see the other face is 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.750
 Like the guy slaps his face. 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:30.530
 and talk like that in the bible to write 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.229
 another phase 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.959
 for this is not the way to read the way 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.500
 to read is the way you 're writing yourself 

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:41.420
 donate you do good and even there in the 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.970
 hill sermon then the good ones 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.250
 sinister about it so do not 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.440
 fall into that temptation to read the Bible to 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.050
 otherwise there are several things too 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.940
 a little more subtle than this is a 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.890
 thing that also open wide remember 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.810
 when I did a lot of work with 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.000
 living in addition to other things that 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.550
 I will not be quoting here without shouting 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.170
 illustrating well there already you see, and my mother 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.849
 That's all I'm saying. 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.860
 for these people, they think they 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:08.720
 I would do for you if you needed me 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.390
 I said it's an influence I do not even 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.890
 even think about it like that, but only for 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.750
 to think I know they will not they will not 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.670
 they would do and she would just say 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.110
 so but this is the gospel kind guy 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.540
 I can not do it and I hope they 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.959
 repay me kind of human will 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.670
 be legacy mass of the ok is linked type 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.830
 this every hour when you 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.720
 but something to help someone without 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.120
 expectation that this person will 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.430
 give back home do not return you will 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.380
 stay very happy type will now stay 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.480
 surprise will be too much of the time and if she 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.819
 night retribuísse no longer expected then 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.090
 Okay now if you do something for someone. 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.850
 face expecting a retribution if this 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.560
 person had to assign if he was going to 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.450
 did not do anything more than he should 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.430
 until now, nothing else that I expected and 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.489
 she had no assignment and will be 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.620
 face disappointed delegate traumatized 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.890
 types is a very important issue. 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.350
 very simple a question so very subtle 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.019
 Any time you're upset 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.180
 you do not create expectations 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.380
 so simple khan be careful with the 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.510
 expectations 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.640
 they have a great chance if they 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.069
 disappointments, especially when 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.650
 it is about human beings but when 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.360
 it comes about god also pasted penguin 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.100
 But god will disappoint me of course 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.140
 because our technology is not the 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.450
 time we understand people do not know 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.340
 God and we create expectations that he 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.000
 said I would do it on 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.440
 mainly in relation to money 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.900
 relationship disease these three things 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.239
 people traveling god will water website 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.790
 Come on, brother. Take it easy. 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.850
 Remember to do things for others 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.590
 without wanting something back and your favor 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.170
 Remember when you do something to 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.579
 God does not want something back home had 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.579
 Between good and goes crazy. 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:54.459
 but if not you will be online 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:57.019

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.709

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:04.130
 I stayed playing the game for a second 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:06.170

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.290

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.600
 hour this time I feel good, free me 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.220

 but it's more these three be three weeks 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.160
