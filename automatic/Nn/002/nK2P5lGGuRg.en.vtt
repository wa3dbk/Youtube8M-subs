 10 mot .. 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.930
 10 reasons to believe the Bible! 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.880
 Greetings everyone! Another video of the channel Goes in the Bible, 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.359
 our second video. 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.699
 And first, I wanted to thank everyone who signed up for the channel, 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.680
 and before we get into the 10 reasons, 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.920
 make something very clear: 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.419
 Believing in the Bible is not simply believing in some specific passages, 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.459
 is to believe in the whole Bible! 

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:34.459
 The first reason we are going to point here, 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:35.609
 (I'll take a look there) 

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:38.469
 The Bible is a literary work! 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:39.580
 And? 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.200
 I do not know if you ever played the cordless phone? 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.360
 Tell a story to a person, 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.340
 and she tells the same story, and goes on telling several people. 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.900
 When it comes to the last, the story is already distorted. 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.820
 Now, you imagine a complex story as is the history of mankind, 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.660
 How is God revealing himself to man, 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.860
 with which it would reach our days? 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.080
 There would be no better way for God to communicate with man than for writing! 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.820
 When we see God opting for 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.280
 to reveal himself to man through writing, 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.130
 the most interesting is that He revealed Himself to different men, 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.620
 were about 40 writers, 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.789
 who lived at different times, 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:17.089
 in an interval of approximately fifteen hundred years, 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.990
 and write content that holds a drive! 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.900
 And it is not simply a 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:23.670
 any literary work. 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.070
 The main Bible from around the world, 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.490
 if God 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.140
 allowed the main book of the world to be a lie, 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.080
 then God is not God! 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.990
 Huh?! Is not true? 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.050
 Does not make sense? 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.130
 It makes sense! 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.130
 The second reason you believe the Bible, 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.500
 is that it brings answers! 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.220
 The Bible provides answers for you to know where you came from, 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.030
 Where are you going? 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.750
 whatever happened to things like that. 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.299
 The important thing is you know where the answers come from, sometimes you are content with answers 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.980
 that you do not even know the source. 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.200
 So if it is to trust an answer, about things we do not understand, 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.240
 Believe in the Bible that it brings the answers! 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.750
 The third plea 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.290
 for you to believe the Bible 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.959
 is that the Bible, too, does not hide 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.780
 Faults and Errors 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.820
 of the great men of God. 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.200
 David, for example, committed adultery and murder! 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.199
 And the Bible says that he was a man after the heart of God. 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:23.349
 What a mistake! 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.449
 Among other men who made a mistake. 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:29.069
 So if the Bible had been an initiative of man, 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.199
 some 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:34.859
 failures would be covered up, some things would be tampered with, 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.760
 but the Bible does not have that concern! 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.869
 The fourth reason is 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:40.169
 promises! 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:42.560
 The Bible has promises 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.530
 of peace, 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.730
 of joy, 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.039
 of security, 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:47.719
 of rest, 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:49.099
 of prosperity, 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.659
 of health... 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:52.609
 There are many promises. 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:57.200
 And the interesting thing is that a person who makes promises and does not fulfill, it loses credibility. 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.139
 And the Bible proposes to take that risk! 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:03.800
 She promises to those who believe in her, and practice what she teaches, 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.289
 all these things! 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:06.670
 The Bible promises 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.379
 Eternal life! 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:09.629
 Eternal life!!! 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.120
 (And you do not have to be a vampire!) 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.159
 (Neither zombie!) 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.539
 The other reason is the reason! 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:18.169
 It's a complex but understandable book! 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:21.189
 You do not have to give up your reason to believe the Bible, 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:24.599
 and you also need to have a great intellectual capacity 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.329
 to understand what the Bible teaches. 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.749
 The Bible, it is no respecter of persons. 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:31.249
 The prerequisite it places 

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:33.229
 is that you approach her 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:35.170
 no prejudice, 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.390
 that you are willing to learn and willing to revise your concepts 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.200
 regarding 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.960
 to how things work. 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.329
 The sixth plea, 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:45.949
 Jesus Christ! 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:47.729
 Jesus Christ 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:51.109
 is the most famous character in history! 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:57.269
 He is the character that influenced our time count: 2015 AD 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.969
 The story of the life of Jesus Christ is told 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:02.539
 someway 

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:05.280
 virtually impossible to invent, 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.129
 by the complexity of Jesus. 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.649
 The only place 

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:11.919
 which brings information 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:15.440
 consistent and complete statements about Jesus Christ 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.469
 is the Bible. 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:18.599
 The seventh reason: 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:20.019
 forecasts 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.629
 or prophecies. 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:22.699
 The Bible, 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:24.979
 it contains forecasts 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:26.889
 which were fulfilled, 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.889
 which are being fulfilled today and will be fulfilled! 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.439
 None of the biblical prophecies are no longer fulfilled. 

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:37.389
 So in the pages of the Bible you find stories of 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.770
 things that would happen, and they happened! 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.930
 For example: 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.620
 In Isaiah, which was a book written about 700 years before Christ, 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.400
 speech 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.550
 as Jesus Christ would suffer. 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.169
 The Book of Daniel 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.219
 points to the time when Jesus would be born. 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:58.340
 The prophet Micah also, in about the same time, predicted where Jesus would be born. 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.560
 Daniel foretold the rise and fall of four kingdoms: 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.560
 Babylonian, Fear-Persian, Greek and Roman! 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.360
 Prophecies that were fulfilled, 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.759
 through the Bible, 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:12.319
 is a proof that it is not possible to be man's action. 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.860
 Man would not have access to this kind of knowledge. 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.660
 (nor the mother Dinah) 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.909
 The eighth are the contradictions! 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:24.349
 The Bible has a content that, if analyzed in the wrong way, 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:26.920
 may seem like a contradiction or it may seem like a mistake. 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.529
 Interestingly, the most interesting thing is that God left it that way! 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:35.740
 For the one who approaches the Bible not wanting to believe, he will not believe it! 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.280
 Now, the one who approaches the Bible with the intention of believing, 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.280
 this will not be a barrier for him to believe in the Bible. 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.049
 When you fit the biblical truths into your life, 

00:05:44.049 --> 00:05:48.339
 your life begins to make sense and the Bible begins to make sense. 

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:50.419
 (there's a Maria-stinky here!) 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.589
 The ninth motive, 

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:54.409
 no reason 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:55.509
 Big Bang! 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:00.389
 Because the fact that you believe in the Big Bang, because the dinosaurs would have existed, 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.880
 and the fact that there had been "Glacial Eras", 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.319
 that does not invalidate the Bible! 

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:09.779
 The Bible does not limit the creation of all things about 6,000 years ago. 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:12.520
 it limits this in relation to the creation of man (perhaps not even that). 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.760
 The seven days in the creation account, 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.280
 need not necessarily be regarded as literal. 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.939
 Any event, time or beings "proven" by science, 

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:26.839
 can fit perfectly in the interval between the creation of all things 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.210
 and the creation of man, without any problem. 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.819
 And if the Big Bang happened, 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:32.119
 Maybe God ... 

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:33.879
 (it was there, pressed the button and bum!) 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:36.679
 And the last reason, the tenth reason: 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:38.930
 It is the experience! 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.490
 The Bible allows a personal experience, without intermediaries, 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.349
 you are God! 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:47.139
 You will be able to prove, 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:49.040
 in his practical life, 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.270
 the effects of you believing in the Bible. 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.689
 No matter how many people speak, no matter how many arguments there are for or against 

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:56.709
 the Bible, 

00:06:56.709 --> 00:06:58.749
 your personal experience, 

00:06:58.749 --> 00:07:01.260
 to apply a biblical truth in your life 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.860
 and see this happen, 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.240
 and have an answer of something that nobody knew, just you and God, 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.820
 no one can take it from you! 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.839
 Because it is a personal experience of yours that the Bible allows! 

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:11.939
 Then that's it! 

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:12.919
 Did you like the video? 

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:14.289

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:18.939

 stay in peace, 

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:30.669
 God bless! 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:31.720
 Thanks!
