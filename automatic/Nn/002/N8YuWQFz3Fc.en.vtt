most<00:04:41.909> of<00:04:42.120> the<00:04:42.210> time<00:04:42.479> it's<00:04:43.020> lushes<00:04:43.530> its<00:04:43.710> way

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
most of the time it's lushes its way

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.520

it's well worth the upgrade from the

it's well worth the upgrade from the
6-speed<00:04:49.409> manual<00:04:49.440> gearbox<00:04:49.919> you<00:04:50.639> get<00:04:51.030> a
