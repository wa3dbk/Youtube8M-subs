00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
actually I take it back the very last

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.499 
actually I take it back the very last
song<00:02:07.159> that<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.520> girl<00:02:07.759> sings<00:02:08.060> while<00:02:08.209> getting

the<00:02:08.630> water<00:02:08.840> actual<00:02:09.289> I<00:02:09.319> think<00:02:09.560> it's<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.740> very

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
the water actual I think it's a very

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:27.380 
the water actual I think it's a very
nice

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.610 

I'd<00:02:28.390> like<00:02:28.570> to<00:02:28.660> hear<00:02:28.750> somebody<00:02:29.080> do<00:02:29.230> a<00:02:29.260> different

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
I'd like to hear somebody do a different

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.990 
I'd like to hear somebody do a different
version<00:02:29.830> of<00:02:30.070> it<00:02:30.190> because<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.550> actually<00:02:30.700> is<00:02:30.970> a

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
version of it because it actually is a

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.240 
version of it because it actually is a
very<00:02:31.090> soothing<00:02:31.540> melody<00:02:32.110> but<00:02:32.710> aside<00:02:32.950> from<00:02:33.010> that

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
very soothing melody but aside from that

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.190 
very soothing melody but aside from that
nothing<00:02:33.730> really<00:02:34.120> stands<00:02:34.510> out<00:02:34.780> about<00:02:35.050> the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
nothing really stands out about the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.930 
nothing really stands out about the
Jungle<00:02:35.560> Book<00:02:35.590> which<00:02:36.070> is<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.250> shame<00:02:36.490> because<00:02:36.670> the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
Jungle Book which is a shame because the

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.940 
Jungle Book which is a shame because the
original<00:02:37.180> book<00:02:37.600> is<00:02:37.750> not<00:02:37.900> only<00:02:37.960> much<00:02:38.410> darker

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
original book is not only much darker

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.740 
original book is not only much darker
but<00:02:39.100> it's<00:02:39.250> much<00:02:39.400> more<00:02:39.580> interesting<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.630> way

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
but it's much more interesting the way

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.570 
but it's much more interesting the way
the<00:02:40.870> animal<00:02:41.320> world<00:02:41.500> views<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.130> human<00:02:42.460> world

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
the animal world views the human world

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.980 
the animal world views the human world

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
is actually sort of a fascinating

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.750 
is actually sort of a fascinating
commentary<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:45.130> characters<00:02:45.520> are<00:02:45.640> more

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
commentary the characters are more

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.580 
commentary the characters are more
developed<00:02:46.180> -<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:46.660> it<00:02:46.930> follows<00:02:47.230> Mowgli

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
developed - and it follows Mowgli

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.199 
developed - and it follows Mowgli
through<00:02:47.800> sort<00:02:48.010> of<00:02:48.100> a<00:02:48.190> coming-of-age<00:02:48.580> story

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
through sort of a coming-of-age story

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.090 
through sort of a coming-of-age story
which<00:02:49.750> really<00:02:49.959> is<00:02:50.110> a<00:02:50.140> shame<00:02:50.380> because<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.800> think

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
which really is a shame because I think

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.770 
which really is a shame because I think
Disney<00:02:51.459> could<00:02:51.790> have<00:02:51.880> done<00:02:52.060> that<00:02:52.209> story<00:02:52.480> great

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
Disney could have done that story great

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.720 
Disney could have done that story great
Chuck<00:02:53.410> Jones<00:02:53.650> did<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.040> version<00:02:54.220> that<00:02:54.400> was<00:02:54.490> much

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
Chuck Jones did a version that was much

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.370 
Chuck Jones did a version that was much
closer<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.300> book<00:02:55.450> in<00:02:55.570> a<00:02:55.660> half<00:02:55.870> hour

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
closer to the book in a half hour

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.290 
closer to the book in a half hour
I<00:02:56.410> found<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:56.770> infinitely<00:02:57.459> more<00:02:57.670> fascinating

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
I found that infinitely more fascinating

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.420 
I found that infinitely more fascinating
than<00:02:58.330> this<00:02:58.630> film<00:02:58.870> but<00:02:59.470> as<00:02:59.620> is<00:02:59.950> there's<00:03:00.280> nothing

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
than this film but as is there's nothing

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.030 
than this film but as is there's nothing
really<00:03:00.790> bad<00:03:01.239> about<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.900> jungle<00:03:02.170> book<00:03:02.470> except

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
really bad about the jungle book except

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.590 
really bad about the jungle book except
like<00:03:03.280> I<00:03:03.430> said<00:03:03.610> not<00:03:03.790> following<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.239> book<00:03:04.390> that

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
like I said not following the book that

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.170 
like I said not following the book that
closely<00:03:04.870> but<00:03:05.230> has<00:03:05.620> its<00:03:05.800> own<00:03:05.980> separate<00:03:06.550> thing<00:03:06.610> I

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
closely but has its own separate thing I

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.449 
closely but has its own separate thing I
guess<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.690> works<00:03:07.870> out<00:03:08.080> fine<00:03:08.410> it's<00:03:09.130> a<00:03:09.280> very

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
guess it works out fine it's a very

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.250 
guess it works out fine it's a very
basic<00:03:09.670> kids<00:03:10.120> bill<00:03:10.360> what<00:03:10.600> you<00:03:10.720> see<00:03:10.900> is<00:03:11.050> what<00:03:11.230> you
