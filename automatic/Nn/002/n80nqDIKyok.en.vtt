a little external DC to make it a little
bit<00:02:05.079> safer<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:06.490> new<00:02:06.640> construction<00:02:07.119> also<00:02:07.450> 190

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
bit safer the new construction also 190

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.230 
bit safer the new construction also 190
you<00:02:08.229> reminded<00:02:08.800> me<00:02:08.830> of<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.280> parts<00:02:09.610> on<00:02:09.729> Spitfire

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
you reminded me of the parts on Spitfire

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.710 
you reminded me of the parts on Spitfire
little<00:02:10.720> a<00:02:11.159> reasonable<00:02:12.159> size<00:02:12.340> plane<00:02:12.760> but<00:02:13.120> when

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
little a reasonable size plane but when

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.750 
little a reasonable size plane but when
you<00:02:14.140> open<00:02:14.349> it<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.709> find<00:02:15.220> that<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:15.580> don't

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
you open it you find that you don't

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.940 
you open it you find that you don't
really<00:02:16.180> have<00:02:16.390> that<00:02:16.420> much<00:02:16.810> space

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
really have that much space

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.390 
really have that much space
so<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.490> was<00:02:18.670> enough<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.030> fit<00:02:19.450> everything<00:02:19.990> in

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
so it was enough to fit everything in

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.070 
so it was enough to fit everything in
then<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.430> went<00:02:21.700> on<00:02:21.910> with<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.239> redirects<00:02:22.840> I

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
then I went on with the redirects I

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.860 
then I went on with the redirects I
moved<00:02:23.709> it<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.310> little<00:02:24.340> bit<00:02:24.790> more<00:02:25.060> forward<00:02:25.450> by

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
moved it a little bit more forward by

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.809 
moved it a little bit more forward by
putting<00:02:26.260> some<00:02:26.500> washers<00:02:26.739> underneath<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.610> rear

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
putting some washers underneath the rear

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.970 
putting some washers underneath the rear
mounting<00:02:28.270> screws<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:28.930> increase<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.530> angle<00:02:29.860> a

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
mounting screws to increase the angle a

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.540 
mounting screws to increase the angle a
little<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:31.450> almost<00:02:31.930> is<00:02:32.140> a<00:02:32.170> reflex<00:02:32.770> to<00:02:33.040> do<00:02:33.250> that

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
little it almost is a reflex to do that

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.229 
little it almost is a reflex to do that
because<00:02:33.790> it's<00:02:34.450> never<00:02:34.810> enough<00:02:34.989> and<00:02:36.000> here's<00:02:37.000> one

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
because it's never enough and here's one

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.870 
because it's never enough and here's one
thing<00:02:37.540> I<00:02:37.660> didn't<00:02:37.930> expect<00:02:38.319> it<00:02:38.500> there<00:02:39.489> were<00:02:39.610> no

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
thing I didn't expect it there were no

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.690 
thing I didn't expect it there were no
screws<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.660> install<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:41.170> gear<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:41.739> mean<00:02:42.310> not

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
screws to install the gear I mean not

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.809 
screws to install the gear I mean not
the<00:02:42.819> right<00:02:43.030> one<00:02:43.300> set<00:02:43.569> anyway<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:45.340> I<00:02:45.370> got<00:02:45.550> some

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
the right one set anyway so I got some

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.550 
the right one set anyway so I got some
of<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.120> countersunk<00:02:46.660> screws<00:02:47.050> that<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.319> had

of the countersunk screws that I had

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.280 
of the countersunk screws that I had
leftover<00:02:47.950> from<00:02:48.250> my<00:02:48.540> p-47<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:49.660> screw<00:02:49.900> it<00:02:49.959> again

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
leftover from my p-47 and screw it again

leftover from my p-47 and screw it again
place<00:02:50.650> only<00:02:51.550> to<00:02:51.700> find<00:02:51.940> that<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.390> wheels<00:02:52.630> were

place only to find that the wheels were
not<00:02:53.080> straight<00:02:53.459> so<00:02:54.459> I<00:02:54.519> took<00:02:54.580> it<00:02:54.819> out<00:02:54.910> again<00:02:54.970> and

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
not straight so I took it out again and

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.180 
not straight so I took it out again and
bent<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.840> struts<00:02:56.140> a<00:02:56.260> little<00:02:56.560> to<00:02:56.680> make<00:02:56.860> it<00:02:56.920> more

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
bent the struts a little to make it more

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.390 
bent the struts a little to make it more

and what's working on the gear I trimmed
the<00:03:05.200> wheel<00:03:05.410> doors<00:03:05.709> a<00:03:05.860> little<00:03:06.160> I<00:03:06.370> know<00:03:07.060> they

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
the wheel doors a little I know they

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.449 
the wheel doors a little I know they
look<00:03:07.930> more<00:03:08.170> like<00:03:08.230> scale<00:03:08.709> but<00:03:08.980> on<00:03:09.010> grass

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
look more like scale but on grass

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.850 
look more like scale but on grass
especially<00:03:10.180> high<00:03:10.360> grass<00:03:10.690> they<00:03:11.230> are<00:03:11.350> dangerous

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
especially high grass they are dangerous

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.100 
especially high grass they are dangerous
because<00:03:12.069> they<00:03:12.519> tend<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:12.819> hook<00:03:13.060> up<00:03:13.269> in<00:03:13.690> the

not a good sink even with these little
changes<00:03:18.880> that<00:03:19.180> barely<00:03:19.630> took<00:03:19.810> me<00:03:20.019> a<00:03:20.049> day<00:03:20.260> to

flew<00:03:57.489> perfectly<00:03:58.060> only<00:03:58.510> a<00:03:58.540> little<00:03:58.750> bit<00:03:59.049> of<00:03:59.350> fine

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
flew perfectly only a little bit of fine

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.620 
flew perfectly only a little bit of fine
trimming<00:04:00.160> and<00:04:00.340> she<00:04:00.579> cruised<00:04:00.850> nice<00:04:01.299> through

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
trimming and she cruised nice through

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.170 
trimming and she cruised nice through
the<00:04:01.660> skies<00:04:02.109> overall<00:04:02.650> Berlin<00:04:03.100> she<00:04:03.760> is<00:04:03.850> not<00:04:04.060> the

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
the skies overall Berlin she is not the

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.300 
the skies overall Berlin she is not the
best<00:04:04.390> gliding<00:04:04.870> plane<00:04:05.140> I<00:04:05.170> flew<00:04:05.530> yet<00:04:05.769> but<00:04:06.010> she

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
best gliding plane I flew yet but she

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.470 
best gliding plane I flew yet but she
also<00:04:06.579> has<00:04:07.090> no<00:04:07.420> bad<00:04:07.660> habits<00:04:08.579> so<00:04:09.579> I<00:04:09.609> had<00:04:10.150> enough

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
also has no bad habits so I had enough

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.599 
also has no bad habits so I had enough
confidence<00:04:11.109> to<00:04:11.350> try<00:04:11.620> a<00:04:11.650> real<00:04:11.950> landing<00:04:12.430> and

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
confidence to try a real landing and

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:14.940 
confidence to try a real landing and
guess<00:04:12.850> what<00:04:13.120> she<00:04:13.900> lands<00:04:14.230> as<00:04:14.380> good<00:04:14.620> as<00:04:14.769> she

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
guess what she lands as good as she

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.659 
guess what she lands as good as she
flies<00:04:15.190> and<00:04:15.639> no<00:04:15.910> sato<00:04:16.269> on<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:16.900> ground<00:04:17.169> either

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
flies and no sato on the ground either

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.610 
flies and no sato on the ground either
so<00:04:18.669> I<00:04:18.700> guess<00:04:19.030> I<00:04:19.150> can<00:04:19.329> say<00:04:19.539> the<00:04:19.720> main<00:04:19.900> was<00:04:20.139> total

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
so I guess I can say the main was total

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.000 
so I guess I can say the main was total
fun<00:04:21.389> so<00:04:22.389> what<00:04:22.539> can<00:04:22.720> I<00:04:22.780> say<00:04:23.110> about<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:23.530> parks<00:04:23.860> on

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
fun so what can I say about the parks on

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.950 
fun so what can I say about the parks on

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
started to seeing how I could modify her

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.690
