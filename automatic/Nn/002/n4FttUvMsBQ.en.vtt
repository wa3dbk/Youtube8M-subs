 very good or bad, not him 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.880
 the tests that you put your hand to see to make us the proof of which to 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.219
 Sometimes this theme 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.589
 let's talk today I brought them unesco very nice transit the fact just 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.589

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:20.929
 this country is exemplary 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:25.999
 good background are scorpions or scorpions and ditch mole 2 of the class 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.009
 united alak 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.409
 there are many species and above all they are found in the personal 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.760
 in jungles in humid places but also in 1 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.410
 set ticos this tape that we have here not in it 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.890
 indeed poisonous 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.710
 comes the end of the mass total innocence some 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.690
 dictatorship 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.340
 Well, who is not poisonous as some other specimens such as axes durango 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.220
 between special fact 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.550
 i can if one can get to die 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.010
 because this question 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.880
 Well, also all the scorpions are in what they said 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.260
 hot and temperate dry regions 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.350
 i good some species are also in very cold places 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.290
 them in Spain because it supposes the type of body that has 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.970
 they are under the stones barks of the various trees 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:18.900
 debris 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.780
 in cans sticks water tanks 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.409
 and well here we are going to open a little bit these parasites against you 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.210
 needless 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.500
 if you puppets 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.079
 a massive act the scorpion 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.190
 in fact they have for sale 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.460
 I started without pets the campus but you can find there 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.860
 and well I keep talking about this copy they will go 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.050
 min hidden among the vegetation that surrounds them 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.540
 alaska the houses that usually enter especially is why I like refuge to 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.149
 cossío cover the rains 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.610
 and also when they look for food 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.800
 as the cockroaches offer the scottish the woodlice the tigerillas 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.250
 and other insects within the housing hide untidy care lady 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.430
 in this kind of weather 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.499
 we can find this kind of entity the clans 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:13.779
 is hidden in the classes between the shoes and the boots also between the 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:17.009
 clothes folded as sheets towel covers 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:21.289
 i good you have to be very careful when pulling any of these garments 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:23.479
 in case a hidden one is found 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:27.369
 They have a special predilection for the roofs of palm trees along the roads 

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:29.809
 old the old houses 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:32.959
 stables and among the garbage and accumulated waste 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.959
 there are also many species adapted to live in the deserts 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:38.129
 in the arid lands 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.810
 and many mountains get married as well as in the sand 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.519
 nor near the beaches 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.979
 notice this fact is very curious because they are able to bury c gi joe 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.099
 meanwhile in the interior 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.829
 they are able to bury being not only in loose earth mixed 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.009
 with a sheet know here with sand 

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:02.219
 They also tend to bury themselves on the ground with a certain hardness, helping each other 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:06.439
 especially with its appendices that these critiques were necessary as well as 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:07.549
 those 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.399
 diarioc will make food idea 

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:10.400
 and good one 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.420
 this curious fact that I want to tell you 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.450
 one species was found a hundred meters deep 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.719
 another 5 thousand 525 thousand 500 meters 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:25.099
 of altitude in mountainous mountains and how you can be as a judge of 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:26.459
 execute 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.639
 this type to these species because they are very resistant to any type of climate and 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.699
 that's precisely why you have to be very careful at home 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:35.199
 when one is 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:36.839
 no kind of these 

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:41.819
 they are nocturnal animals that remain hidden during the day and 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.339
 above all they go out to hunt their prey during the night they have great resistance 

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:51.809
 to withstand the heat the lack of water and long periods from 1 thanks to that 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:56.799
 can store part of the food eaten when it has been plentiful 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.749
 and good as I told you, particularly they feed on insects 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:02.389
 years lockers lost on screen 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.409
 by atlanta 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.299
 it does not come out there is no problem 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:11.190
 and good another data of these animals this study bad vision of the 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.669
 good prey mind of the eyes 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:17.269
 does not help them at all in the act of getting married, that's why the meaning of this 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.949
 act is essential for their survival 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:23.279
 its main organs with the senses of the scorpions onu 

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:26.340
 p those that are on top 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.770
 that are long called tri as trias that are located in the expert reports 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.069
 positio are able to perceive any vibration 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:36.819
 that occurs in the original medium apod 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:38.529
 a living being or for some 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:42.109
 physical phenomenon precisely that's why when they go through the night despite 

00:04:42.109 --> 00:04:42.970
 that they do not see 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.290
 because with the vibrations they can capture prey houses 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.150
 when you're fine when some 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.469
 the possible prey touches some of the parts of the body 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:56.659
 of the appendages of a scorpion the reaction of this will be immediate and 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:00.120
 will open and close the clips as you could see 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.720
 with logic that we approach the third was not what the current bay stick 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.259
 what is this 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:07.870
 appointment status 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.910
 and well I will eat said it will open and close the clamps 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.990
 also good I'm here very entertaining with 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.000
 the scorpion 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.860
 and good its present in tarazá part and it is when the scorpion precisely in 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.620
 nail in what is in the tail part of that in the hall and john 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:29.020
 i percent nothing more in the soft parts of the dam is also piece 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.849
 inject only a little poison but usually the scorpions 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.550
 with the claws to their prey 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.169
 not with the poison and good as the data allegedly many people have them 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.270
 very afraid of this kind of specimens for the 100 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.159
 good for the characteristic they have that can kill you 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:50.960
 to people but the bpn species there are more than 4 thousand species so 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.300
 it is difficult to distinguish therefore if it suffers 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.800
 some sting in your house for a scorpion is important 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.490
 first of all that immediately rush to dr 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.380
 why in medical care and after 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.090
 that the people who can affiliate some of them stay at home to 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.069
 I can capture the copy 

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:16.729
 for Kenya and determine what kind of scorpions what kind of species i 10 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:18.309
 Poisonous bonus 

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:19.699
 so good these years 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:21.990
 to this month some features 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.819
 this dell animalito a scorpion that you can also find in fish and 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:27.020
 pets the field 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.740
 where you can buy it but it is not recommended for children that's what 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.759
 he made it clear 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:35.749
 if tucumán unt or puerto like the cdm exotic animals 

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:39.639
 for you then you can have it in almost as you can see here in not even the 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:42.889
 veterinarian any of your assistants 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:46.809
 what I wear in two to cannes - so I am driving with ease 

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:48.339
 because it's good percent 

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:52.370
 they are cold animals that are not exactly domesticable 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.259
 so what 

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:58.039
 in being very careful with them and especially in the capture 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:01.199
 he also cited tampons some should be supervised 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:04.219
 for a very good martín has to be for an adult 

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:05.479
 and not any 

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:08.669
 the duties to touch and you have to know 2 carlos also 

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:11.330
 in that moment when we are happy because we do not have that 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.479
 experience only to a person like 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:14.759
 the doctor rafael 

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:17.919
 Thank you for giving us that nice copy 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:20.919
 good that you think if we go to a commercial court I hope you liked it 

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:24.709
 percent and that has brought you here this exotic animal icta 

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:29.009
 we go a cut but do not go because we came back with very interesting topics
