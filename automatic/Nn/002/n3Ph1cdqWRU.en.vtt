00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.470 

I<00:02:14.250> think<00:02:14.970> jason<00:02:15.450> has<00:02:15.480> got<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.320> very<00:02:16.590> fresh

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
I think jason has got a very fresh

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.590 
I think jason has got a very fresh
womanly<00:02:18.480> approach<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:19.440> designing<00:02:19.860> and

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
womanly approach to designing and

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.000 
womanly approach to designing and
although<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.900> clothes<00:02:22.170> are<00:02:22.380> kind<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.680> fresh

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
although the clothes are kind of fresh

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.580 
although the clothes are kind of fresh
and<00:02:23.040> young<00:02:23.460> they're<00:02:23.700> not<00:02:23.880> too<00:02:24.120> girly<00:02:24.330> girly<00:02:24.930> so

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
and young they're not too girly girly so

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.680 
and young they're not too girly girly so
I<00:02:25.620> think<00:02:25.740> they're<00:02:26.070> for<00:02:26.370> women<00:02:27.240> of<00:02:27.390> sort<00:02:27.630> of

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
I think they're for women of sort of

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.540 
I think they're for women of sort of
30-something<00:02:28.440> or<00:02:28.560> 40<00:02:28.830> something<00:02:29.070> feel<00:02:29.400> they

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
30-something or 40 something feel they

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.970 
30-something or 40 something feel they
can<00:02:29.730> wear<00:02:29.910> them<00:02:30.120> with<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.020> lot<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.410> confidence

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
can wear them with a lot of confidence

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.760 
can wear them with a lot of confidence
and<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.730> think<00:02:32.970> Michelle<00:02:33.540> Obama<00:02:33.810> looks<00:02:34.110> amazing

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
and I think Michelle Obama looks amazing

00:02:34.770 --> 00:03:01.619 
and I think Michelle Obama looks amazing
in<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:34.980> things<00:02:35.190> he<00:02:35.370> designs

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.039 

the<00:03:02.170> biggest<00:03:02.379> challenge<00:03:02.829> is<00:03:02.980> always<00:03:03.129> to<00:03:04.049> have

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
the biggest challenge is always to have

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.229 
the biggest challenge is always to have
my<00:03:05.230> idea<00:03:05.439> comes<00:03:05.650> clear<00:03:05.829> on<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.010> runway<00:03:06.370> in<00:03:06.730> a

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
my idea comes clear on the runway in a

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.940 
my idea comes clear on the runway in a
few<00:03:07.599> seconds<00:03:08.049> I<00:03:08.200> mean<00:03:08.349> it's<00:03:08.530> got<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.799> come

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
few seconds I mean it's got to come

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.940 
few seconds I mean it's got to come
through<00:03:09.189> and<00:03:09.450> how<00:03:10.450> do<00:03:10.510> we<00:03:10.659> make<00:03:10.900> it<00:03:10.959> do<00:03:11.530> it<00:03:11.560> in<00:03:11.859> a

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
through and how do we make it do it in a

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.190 
through and how do we make it do it in a
subtle<00:03:12.189> yet<00:03:12.639> distinctive<00:03:13.569> way<00:03:13.749> and<00:03:14.049> that's

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
subtle yet distinctive way and that's
