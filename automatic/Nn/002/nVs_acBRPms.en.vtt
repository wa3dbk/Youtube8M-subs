one<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:23.970> great<00:00:24.150> things<00:00:24.420> about<00:00:24.510> readiness

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
one of the great things about readiness

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.599 
one of the great things about readiness
vault<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.830> manage<00:00:26.189> everything<00:00:26.279> from

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
vault is that you manage everything from

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.700 
vault is that you manage everything from

managed<00:00:30.840> through<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.140> cloud<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.859> don't<00:00:31.890> ever

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
managed through the cloud you don't ever

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:40.360

have<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.430> log<00:00:32.700> into<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.059> readiness<00:00:33.270> again

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.240

I've started this service on my

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.190 
I've started this service on my
readiness<00:00:51.380> now<00:00:52.220> I'll<00:00:52.370> set<00:00:52.640> up<00:00:52.790> a<00:00:53.090> wizard<00:00:53.570> to<00:00:54.080> go

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
readiness now I'll set up a wizard to go

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.990 
readiness now I'll set up a wizard to go
ahead<00:00:54.320> and<00:00:54.590> create<00:00:54.860> my<00:00:54.890> very<00:00:55.070> first<00:00:55.550> backup

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
ahead and create my very first backup

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.360 
ahead and create my very first backup
job<00:00:56.320> it's<00:00:57.320> a<00:00:57.379> pretty<00:00:57.590> simple<00:00:57.860> point-and-click

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
job it's a pretty simple point-and-click

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.010 
job it's a pretty simple point-and-click
wizard<00:00:58.850> and<00:00:59.330> the<00:00:59.390> thing<00:00:59.570> to<00:00:59.660> keep<00:00:59.809> in<00:00:59.960> mind

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
wizard and the thing to keep in mind

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.930 
wizard and the thing to keep in mind
here<00:01:00.530> is<00:01:00.559> how<00:01:00.860> fast<00:01:01.160> we're<00:01:01.460> setting<00:01:01.730> up<00:01:01.820> a

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
here is how fast we're setting up a

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.670 
here is how fast we're setting up a
backup<00:01:02.330> job<00:01:02.510> that's<00:01:02.780> automatic<00:01:03.350> and<00:01:03.500> you<00:01:03.559> know

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
backup job that's automatic and you know

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.140 
backup job that's automatic and you know
you<00:01:03.949> need<00:01:04.129> never<00:01:04.339> come<00:01:04.610> back<00:01:04.729> and<00:01:04.790> do<00:01:05.030> this

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
you need never come back and do this

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.900 
you need never come back and do this
again<00:01:05.860> so<00:01:06.860> we've<00:01:06.979> selected<00:01:07.190> the<00:01:07.520> bandwidth

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
again so we've selected the bandwidth

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.430 
again so we've selected the bandwidth
we're<00:01:08.060> gonna<00:01:08.150> use<00:01:08.510> and<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:08.869> to<00:01:09.050> default

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
we're gonna use and the to default

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.050 
we're gonna use and the to default
shares<00:01:09.770> on<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.040> ready<00:01:10.220> NAS<00:01:10.430> are<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:10.760> media

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
shares on the ready NAS are the media

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.420 
shares on the ready NAS are the media
and<00:01:11.270> backup<00:01:11.660> share<00:01:11.900> so<00:01:12.800> we'll<00:01:12.950> set<00:01:13.160> up<00:01:13.190> the

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
and backup share so we'll set up the

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.090 
and backup share so we'll set up the
backup<00:01:13.850> share<00:01:14.090> to<00:01:14.330> have<00:01:14.479> a<00:01:14.830> automatic<00:01:15.830> job

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
backup share to have a automatic job

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.400 
backup share to have a automatic job
we'll<00:01:16.850> select<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.300> schedule<00:01:17.570> for<00:01:17.869> the<00:01:18.020> backup

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
we'll select the schedule for the backup

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.719 
we'll select the schedule for the backup
share<00:01:18.619> in<00:01:18.770> this<00:01:18.920> case<00:01:19.160> we're<00:01:19.340> going<00:01:19.430> to<00:01:19.490> leave

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
share in this case we're going to leave

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.639 
share in this case we're going to leave
it<00:01:19.850> at<00:01:19.940> continuous<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:20.810> we'll<00:01:21.290> save<00:01:21.470> the

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
it at continuous and we'll save the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.830 
it at continuous and we'll save the
changes<00:01:22.100> you<00:01:22.670> can<00:01:22.729> see<00:01:23.030> that<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:23.300> backup<00:01:23.660> job

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
changes you can see that the backup job

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.480 
changes you can see that the backup job
has<00:01:24.050> already<00:01:24.380> started<00:01:24.770> it's<00:01:25.009> monitoring

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
has already started it's monitoring

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.490 
has already started it's monitoring
continuously<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:26.899> what's<00:01:27.229> even<00:01:27.350> more

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
continuously and what's even more

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.650 
continuously and what's even more
impressive<00:01:28.160> is<00:01:28.399> that<00:01:28.729> after<00:01:29.119> finishing<00:01:29.300> the

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
impressive is that after finishing the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.499 
impressive is that after finishing the
wizard<00:01:30.070> we'll<00:01:31.070> take<00:01:31.280> a<00:01:31.310> look<00:01:31.520> at<00:01:31.640> that<00:01:31.789> job<00:01:32.060> and

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
wizard we'll take a look at that job and

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.420 
wizard we'll take a look at that job and
see<00:01:33.289> how<00:01:33.440> many<00:01:33.500> files<00:01:33.800> have<00:01:34.039> already<00:01:34.130> been

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
see how many files have already been

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.359 
see how many files have already been
