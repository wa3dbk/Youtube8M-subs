kosher<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.369> imagined<00:01:09.030> there<00:01:09.180> was<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.360> bit<00:01:09.720> of

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810

kosher so I imagined there was a bit of
friction<00:01:10.020> there<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:11.659> imagine<00:01:12.740> there's<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.830> lot

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010
