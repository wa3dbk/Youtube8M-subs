00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
this is my favorite part

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.460 
this is my favorite part
as<00:04:42.180> you<00:04:42.600> can<00:04:42.690> see<00:04:42.840> when<00:04:42.960> you<00:04:43.050> turn<00:04:43.170> the<00:04:43.260> motor

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
as you can see when you turn the motor

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.420 
as you can see when you turn the motor
on<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.760> wood<00:04:44.760> actually<00:04:45.210> comes<00:04:45.480> through<00:04:45.630> this

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
on the wood actually comes through this

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.820 
on the wood actually comes through this
you<00:04:47.430> know<00:04:47.480> mercy<00:04:48.480> back

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.750 

then<00:04:52.830> it<00:04:52.920> actually<00:04:53.280> goes<00:04:53.460> through<00:04:53.790> the<00:04:53.880> pipe

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
then it actually goes through the pipe

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.850 
then it actually goes through the pipe
here<00:04:56.760> and<00:04:57.000> it<00:04:57.960> actually<00:04:58.020> filters<00:04:58.470> all<00:04:58.740> the

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
here and it actually filters all the

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.200 
here and it actually filters all the
water<00:04:59.040> so<00:04:59.250> if<00:04:59.310> you<00:04:59.400> do<00:04:59.520> have<00:04:59.670> fish<00:04:59.820> in<00:04:59.850> here

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210
