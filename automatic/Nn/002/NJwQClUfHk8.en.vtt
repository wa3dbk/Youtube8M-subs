seemed<00:03:42.760> kind<00:03:42.790> of<00:03:43.150> working<00:03:43.690> it<00:03:43.840> around<00:03:43.959> like

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
seemed kind of working it around like

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.559 
seemed kind of working it around like
the<00:03:44.709> inside<00:03:45.160> full<00:03:45.580> of<00:03:45.790> all<00:03:45.970> comes<00:03:46.330> together

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
the inside full of all comes together

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:55.790 
the inside full of all comes together
overlapping<00:03:52.650> see<00:03:53.650> me<00:03:53.769> kind<00:03:53.920> of<00:03:54.040> twisting<00:03:54.730> it

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
overlapping see me kind of twisting it

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.650 
overlapping see me kind of twisting it
defines<00:03:56.800> the<00:03:57.129> inside<00:03:57.610> there<00:03:57.970> a<00:03:58.000> lot<00:03:58.239> better<00:03:58.540> I

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
defines the inside there a lot better I

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.520 
defines the inside there a lot better I
think<00:03:59.940> let<00:04:00.940> me<00:04:01.000> go<00:04:01.269> back<00:04:01.510> and<00:04:01.840> push<00:04:02.140> out<00:04:02.349> the

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
think let me go back and push out the

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.360 
think let me go back and push out the
petals<00:04:03.209> and<00:04:04.209> close<00:04:04.569> in<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:05.050> outer<00:04:05.200> ones<00:04:05.680> make

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
petals and close in the outer ones make

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.550 
petals and close in the outer ones make
it<00:04:06.489> to<00:04:06.580> sharpen<00:04:07.090> up<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.330> definition<00:04:07.720> of<00:04:08.170> it

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.259 

really<00:04:11.560> makes<00:04:11.799> it<00:04:11.950> a<00:04:12.040> lot<00:04:12.190> more

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
really makes it a lot more

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.940

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
and outer flames and this your oxygen is

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.120 
and outer flames and this your oxygen is
sharpen<00:04:54.190> it<00:04:54.310> up<00:04:54.720> oxygen<00:04:55.720> we<00:04:56.020> add<00:04:56.200> more<00:04:56.650> oxygen

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
sharpen it up oxygen we add more oxygen

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.270 
sharpen it up oxygen we add more oxygen
and<00:04:57.280> will<00:04:57.370> cool<00:04:57.850> it<00:04:57.880> down<00:04:58.150> and<00:04:58.960> I<00:04:59.770> just<00:04:59.830> gives

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
and will cool it down and I just gives

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.900 
and will cool it down and I just gives
