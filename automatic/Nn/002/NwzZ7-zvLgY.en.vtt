 stop that I wanted will not be set

 for business donors which is a 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.630
 laptop computer that I had wanted for a long time 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:37.020
 time and my wife gave me the 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.660
 Valentine's Day gift and lots of 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.460
 people asked me twitter year in 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.370
 facebook because I'm trying 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.410
 again use a a mac a bit because 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.629
 she had given me a macbook 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.280
 about two years ago I 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.809
 I could not dislike the experience. 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.570
 using the mec 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.239
 I just returned the computer because I 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.820
 I thought I'm not going to make the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.199
 my spend a thousand and cacetada dollars for 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.570
 buy a computer i never 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.820
 buy a computer that hid 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.560
 then use the return the computer to 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.900
 do not get so angry that you do not 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.159
 spend the money to see the tour goes 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.140
 give a gift a person the person is 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.909
 enjoying present having enough actor 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.619
 because I did not like the mec because in the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.520
 time when she tried with the name of a 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.710
 macbook 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.290
 a few years ago because I want it 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.080
 I tried to replace the computer 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.210
 who used the main personal computer 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.650
 by macbook when you're very 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.140
 accustomed to the arrows 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.759
 these windows structures you change 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.799
 from nothing to the doctor that is one thing 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.090
 it's almost traumatic today you do not 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.220
 Can do what you are 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.390
 used to do on windows and you do not 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.799
 can work with it 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.420
 you become very efficient 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.610
 frustrated I'm a guy was stolen I 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.159
 I like to make things work 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.380
 right away I like that they have the 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.689
 control over the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.850
 I happen to be very frustrated because of this. 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.299
 I just gave up on Mexico in that 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.920
 time a few years ago this time 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.320
 different this time I keep having the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.299
 computer to do more than the 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.009
 What I do on the internet, what I do is 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.959
 important to taking advantage of the year to 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.230
 mercedes because of this background that 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.700
 I have so many years 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.800
 one of the things things I do with 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.239
 much more efficiency then for these I 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.019
 I keep my personal computer or 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.030
 desktop 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.620
 I just wanted to play a little 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.080
 But how do you think it was a 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.060
 perfect having a laptop for you 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.560
 play with it will not do anything 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.110
 very important I'm writing a 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.819
 book on it I update on the website I go 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.680
 update because keirrison has notorious 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.480
 Your site is still going to play a little bit 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.069
 with imovie video editing i know 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.319
 it is very limited compared to the 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.540
 sony vegas that use the desktop but me 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.829
 I wanted to try it a bit then 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.650
 It 's different this time, I 'm 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:48.160
 trying to change every way I use the 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.840
 computer to mess with something all 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.540
 throwing away everything I do in 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.250
 how is this not just one 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.200
 this is just an additional one now i can 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.760
 play as it begins but as I need 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.090
 really do one more thing 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.489
 important is something that depends 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.910
 from my of my skill level 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.349
 already with windows I use the desktop to 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.090
 Why do you talk like I have? 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.920
 a lot of choice the woman gave me a time 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.140
 I do not speak, I already had a master gave me a 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.750
 light way though I'll do it too 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.250
 Girl, I thanked you because I told you 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.209
 I wanted to play a little more like 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.430
 knows a lot 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.959
 long even after bad 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.160
 experience I had with my 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.639
 first macbook 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.590
 I decided that this would be a way 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:31.419
 migrate once you know me 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.049
 I am not at the level for it yet but 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:36.849
 allow yourself a little with a laptop to 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.280
 which only serves to is common This is how I 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.500
 I said 'oh I'm very excited about 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.630
 be partying to see pictures also the 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.900
 old little games have abandoned edson ala 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.940
 old games computer machines there me 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.319
 only thing the game is actually is 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.230
 giving to see cool and on the screen but is 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.569
 there is something else very interesting to 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.400
 I bought last week arrived 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.019
 now look here 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.690
 Look, I just bought it, I think the name 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.629
 this is diffuser are nieces with 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.280
 lamps inside which diffuses the light 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.840
 so that it does not pop in the 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.370
 my face i bought this for 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.620
 replace the bulbs you used 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.359
 formerly to affirm my gomes 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.669
 those were cool but it was time 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:17.169
 garden the first great to seek a 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:19.989
 little more proficiency in 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.180
 compresses this umbrella on amazon 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.780
 it was super cheap then $ 60 per 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.380
 two 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:30.380
 there are two nieces with lights with 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.620
 pedestal also came here it iss O 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.970
 here for me to use common look only has one 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.169
 ac adapter to put the ipad here 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.510
 because i can use the ipad as 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.820
 teleprompter to read the script of some 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.080
 some videos sucks keep it in 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.210
 lap because it is a middle thing 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.070
 always tells you to get 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.600
 raises in law the team does not stay long 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.490
 cool I had in my head that if I 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.380
 had a booth to stand alone so the 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.419
 booth will stand in front of the camera and 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.160
 a step inscribed with the finger and such I 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.690
 I always thought it was going to be easier. 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.340
 a small experiment in actually was 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.040
 This whole kit was one of the most 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.020
 $ 60 super cheap a freight was 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.910
 free too because it is amazing 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.270
 because the box that umbrellas came from 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.669
 also a car nash mensa if it was more 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.440
 new kid was kidding about making 111 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.229
 something with this box set up a 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.330
 spaceship a spouse is some 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.190
 thing like the box that does this 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.440
 when he was a kid in his father he worked 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.850
 with computers and received there are certain 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.590
 things that come in boxes and even when 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.570
 It was stupid to do it later, but I'm finally there. 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.710
 super excited because they are two things that 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.410
 I wanted so much time that the lighting 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.390
 Nice for my videos. I wanted one. 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.580
 macbook air that promised to drop the 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.340
 I love portability as I've shown 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.200
 you expect to find because there is no 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.850
 a little more portable and this affection is 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:46.610
 old thin type - cfo and with memory 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:48.470
 solid state cele does not have 111 hd as 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.660
 people know there are no moving parts in the 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.030
 naga de león memory passed in flash 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:56.870
 makes it super fast to start 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:59.060
 wake up from mpv and i have a netbook is 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.430
 another not I know you will get 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.810
 fucking compare a macbook a netbook but 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.020
 I mean the question of being a 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.760
 small computer that the proposal is more 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.890
 using the internet is not an album 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.350
 heavy processing is a one thing 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.840
 little lighter to will not be running 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.640
 the seals in such a business is my focus 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.289
 would not run a netbook 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.450
 I know it extinguishes if countless 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:22.340
 differences but I have one 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.930
 notebook that I used just for the 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.150
 population and to Julinho the ancients of 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.030
 computer that the good advantage of windows 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.310
 is supposed to have several old games but 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.409
 lately use that notebook only 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.539
 xvii the bag because he talented 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:36.940
 fuck it from the battery lasts a long time 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:38.320
 and it's huge 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.450
 I'm going to pick it up now I'm lazy but I 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.090
 I was in my room the difference between 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:45.010
 a macbook a netbook but what I 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.900
 I bought think two three years ago in 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.880
 me then maybe that fucking promise 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.160
 put something in the name to see something 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.650
 if the space of it by any value and 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.060
 I'm happy right now. 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.940
 I'm going to play that shit who knows someday. 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.800
 I swap your mac desktop so see max 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.690
 is complete but at last this in your book 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.930
 I wanted to show you today. 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.130
 These stops I 'm on now 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:10.420
 professionalize and if this channel 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:12.250
 the year-old parasols do not go too far 

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.080
 professionalizing videos 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.480
 but finally the pedestal for the ipad 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.160
 sunshade nation photo i know i am 

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.230
 I am much more concerned with this kind of 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.910
 with focus on those stops. 

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:23.280
 Technical videos of you 

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.050
 mind being far from you including 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.000
 watch videos with the type doing 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.500
 in other things, not even seeing the 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.760
 video only listening as if a podcast 

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.810
 so it's an expensive thing, I like 

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.930
 develop the stop or make a business 

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:40.420
 well done to make a value of 

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.010
 cool production technical values ​​cool 

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.290
 so I'm interested in doing this. 

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.030
 that right so that's I think the blog 

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.590
 now it's going to be a little bit but it's going to 

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.120
 get a little more professional once 

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.500
 that you realize the difference I do not know 

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.120
 At least that's what I'm going to try 

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.810
 and this was one more of them blog people I 

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.810
