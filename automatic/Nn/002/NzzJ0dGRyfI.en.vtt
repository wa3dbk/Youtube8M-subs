00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 Mojang released today on 3.6.2014 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.589
 a release and that a primel it 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.940
 for the minecraft version 1.7 at 10 and 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.280
 what's in it all in comparison 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.320
 to version 1.7 point 9 has changed the 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.179
 you will learn in this video from 10 07 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.949
 the minecraft lienz we had you 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.869
 already shown several times among others 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.340
 also in the now linked videos 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.140
 and for these there were many many 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.150
 changes and there is also one 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.439
 innovation concerning the update system 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.119
 is now a small time 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.710
 Change to the williams made so 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.869
 as it is the case even if it is 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.550
 then some major changes are needed 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.110
 not every time a minecraft update 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.090
 be created and you do not have to be all 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.620
 update but the minecraft are now 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.790
 practically a little more independent 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.320
 become and that I find on each 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.730
 very good, so we will not be here 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.559
 constantly need to update 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.239
 Nonetheless, there is still time 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.829
 an update and we also see the same 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.260
 innovations when we work here in man 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.300
 roms menu are and then ours 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.129
 Select and click Configure 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.149
 then we have player activity here 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.399
 a new button 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.469
 there are now, for example, even the 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.239
 first data just the community on 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.190
 my minecraft william and we will see 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.500
 here his player name is displayed and 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.159
 there we still have to data 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.750
 to be collected 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.540
 because the feature it very much just off 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.740
 when the whole thing has expanded further 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.930
 then there will definitely be 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.180
 another video here at 107 where we are 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.680
 Get closer to this player activity system 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.630
 explain otherwise there is also 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.860
 changes in the settings and such can 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.060
 we now click here on settings 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.770
 We already know that but we can 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.390
 also click on the moor options 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.340
 let's do that we have the possibility 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.740
 pvp on and off we can 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.079
 sporting animals on and off as well 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.340
 how to do wyss with monsters and npcs 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.920
 can and we can even spawn 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.229
 protection thus resets the radius 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.729
 the spot where you start in the world 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.070
 the protected one should be protected 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.119
 before dismantling and that could be here completely 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.799
 easy with this slider 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.329
 set how many blocks in the radius 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.380
 that should happen around the spot 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.390
 and here and there we can do the same 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.799
 I prefer the game mode 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.689
 Just creative and that works now 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.250
 In this menu you simply confirm 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.780
 can we do that with then and again with 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.610
 then and here was the server 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.469
 changed and we have our minecraft 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.030
 we simply reconfigured 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.680
 There are still others as usual 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.299
 improvements here in the williams like that 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.180
 that the general run better and 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.619
 Of course there are also some bugfixes 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.509
 minecraft related changes not 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.290
 There is a lot to do with the ruin 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.269
 this update minecraft 1.7 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.489
 Unfortunately, point 10 was not 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.049
 also tweeted by dinner bonn 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.450
 one of the main developers minecraft 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.010
 By the way, that version of the now 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.269
 names could sometimes differ and 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.879
 you should not be surprised then 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.859
 therefore also minecraft 1 point 7.10 and 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.970
 not yet minecraft 1.8 on the 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.620
