00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.430
 good minus a new video welcome 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.500
 to my channel today as you will have seen in the 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.970
 I'm going to teach you two ways to 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.130
 be able to call from a private number 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.169
 so that the people you call do not 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.239
 know who's calling who from 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.699
 is calling and your number looks like 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:25.739
 appears hidden so you will not see 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.710
 it's very simple and we're going to put the 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.689
 first option forever we will 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.210
 having to do anything is always going to 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.829
 appear the hidden number we will edit 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.739
 the google call application 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.260
 official if you have a nexus or motorola already 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.300
 will come incorporated that would be 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.649
 here the phone and now the only thing 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.030
 we have to do would be to come to the 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.519
 three little dots on the top right that 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.859
 we appear to come to adjustments to 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.940
 call settings and down at all we 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.670
 an option that says 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.289
 there we give additional configuration 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.999
 they downloaded the small adjustments that 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.699
 will read the configuration that puts us here 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:01.710
 and we give the call idea we can 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.290
 choose between the default value of 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.730
 network that is in danger come the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.830
 hide number to show number 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.730
 clearly the only thing that we have 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.940
 to hide number and it would already be 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.690
 once we call, we would have 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.730
 it would disappear as it is calling you 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.130
 a hidden number and they may not know 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.190
 our our identity as well as I what 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.410
 I'm going to leave as I had so that 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.030
 have problems like this is already and the last 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.740
 option but that is to use this 8 only 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.840
 you want to call the hidden number in 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.070
 certain occasions the only thing 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.770
 we are going to have to do is before 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.290
 dial the phone number in which 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.920
 we want person we want to call we have 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.690
 than pressing the keys on the 31st pad 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.190
 after this we only have to do 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.410
 it would be add the phone number 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.030
 of the person who is the one 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.920
 we want to call if today is a way 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.570
 so very simple to have our 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.190
 hidden number of these two ways 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.869
 because the first one would be forever what 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.180
 we leave and all the calls 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.979
 would be directly already hidden and with 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.200
 this would be when some call from 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.240
 termination that we would not want with the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.890
 that burned will stay at least 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.300
 so in something seen very simple 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.690
 I hope that these comments have been 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.530
 served if you see some utility and 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.050
 remember that this works for all 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.560
 companies what ten cents serves to 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.080
 all 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.239
 and the first thing of the application because only 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.950
 is for the google application it depends 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.870
 like the others, the truth is that I do not know 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.610
 how it works because I do not have any 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.830
 mobile that is sound such that they have another 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.840
 application but I also like that 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.400
 everything is for android for iphone or a 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.130
 deceased would be otherwise so 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.090
 nothing left me liked this video
