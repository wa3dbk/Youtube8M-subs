00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.080
 God, don't catch it! 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.840
 Daddy, what's with TV? 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.340
 Good evening, London! 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.940
 Let me first of all apologize for interrupting you. 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.680
 This is an emergency channel! 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:50.600
 Just like you appreciate the convenience of everyday routine, the safety of running, the certainty of repetitive actions. 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.100
 To hell. 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.780
 I enjoy it as any of you. 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.920
 But in the spirit of memories of important events of the past. 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.440
 Mostly associated with someone's death, or the end of some bloody endeavor, 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.100
 which are celebrated by some nice holiday, 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.640
 I thought we could record 5 November - a day that is unfortunately not mentioned anymore - 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.280
 by taking a little time, we sit down and talk a little. 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.700
 Of course, there are also those who don't want us to talk. 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.800
 Let me think. 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.860
 I assume that even at this point, the orders are shouting into the phones and the armed men will soon be on their way. 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.000
 It's Suttler's office. 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.180
 Damn! 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.940
 Why? 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.580
 Even though you can argue with a shoe during a conversation, words always retain their power. 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.240
 Words convey meaning and materialize the truth for those who listen. 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.460
 And the truth is, there's something very wrong with this country, right? 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.180
 You suggested it, sir. You wanted it stupid, you said, "All households in London!" 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.980
 Cruelty and wrong. Intolerance and oppression. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.300
 And where you once had the freedom to disagree, think and talk as you thought fit - 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.320
 You now have sensors and tracking systems that force you to conform and demand your obedience. 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.900
 We need cameras. 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.100
 How did that happen? 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.560
 Who's to blame? 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.940
 Of course there are those who bear more responsibility than others - and they will be brought to court - 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.060
 But again, in truth, if you are looking for the culprit - just look in the mirror. 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.960
 I know why you did it. I know you were afraid - who wouldn't be afraid? War, Terror, Disease ... 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.440
 There were a number of problems that conspired to rock your thinking and rob you of your common sense. 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.620
 You were scared and in panic you turned to the current chief executive, Adam Suttler. 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.420
 He promised you order, he promised you peace. 

00:02:41.534 --> 00:02:45.394
 And the only thing he demanded in return was your quiet, obedient consent. 

00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:46.494
 Inspector? We're almost inside. 

00:02:46.494 --> 00:02:49.314
 Last night I meant to break the silence. 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.760
 Last night I destroyed the court building to remind this country of what is forgotten. 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.440
 More than 400 years ago, one great citizen wished forever to seal November 5th our memories. 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.680
 He hoped that the world team would remind themselves that fairness, justice and freedom were more than words. 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.140
 They are perspectives. 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.680
 So, if you haven't seen anything, if you don't know the crimes of this government, 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.500
 in that case, I propose that your 5th November will just pass. 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.840
 But if you see what I see, if you feel what I feel. 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.580
 And if you were looking for me - in that case, stand by my side. 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.980
 One year from this day, in front of the gates of Parliament! 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:41.180
 And together we will give them 5 November, which will never be forgotten again!
