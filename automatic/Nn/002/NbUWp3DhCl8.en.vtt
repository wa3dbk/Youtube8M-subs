00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
so the yield meter climb earlier Brandon

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.140 
so the yield meter climb earlier Brandon
then<00:03:40.900> look<00:03:41.350> at<00:03:41.560> it<00:03:41.680> different<00:03:42.100> angle<00:03:42.490> being

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150

through the panel battling a good time

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.530 
through the panel battling a good time
or<00:03:47.620> whatever<00:03:47.890> so<00:03:48.460> we<00:03:48.520> go<00:03:48.640> into<00:03:48.850> the<00:03:48.940> jungle<00:03:49.120> but

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
or whatever so we go into the jungle but

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.600 
or whatever so we go into the jungle but
then<00:03:49.690> even<00:03:50.020> worse<00:03:50.320> than<00:03:50.530> before<00:03:50.650> that<00:03:51.430> you're

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
then even worse than before that you're

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.570
