00:00:59.739 --> 00:00:59.749 
and now I have in mind that vision in my

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.439 
and now I have in mind that vision in my
mind<00:00:59.780> you<00:01:00.079> know<00:01:00.109> so<00:01:00.379> strongly<00:01:00.679> and<00:01:01.010> but<00:01:01.699> in<00:01:01.940> the

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
mind you know so strongly and but in the

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.049 
mind you know so strongly and but in the
long<00:01:02.600> run<00:01:02.629> like<00:01:02.989> I<00:01:03.109> think<00:01:03.379> totally<00:01:03.949> if<00:01:04.159> that

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
long run like I think totally if that

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.340 
long run like I think totally if that
wouldn't<00:01:05.269> have<00:01:05.390> happened<00:01:05.510> like<00:01:05.870> I<00:01:06.020> mean<00:01:06.200> I<00:01:06.229> I

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
wouldn't have happened like I mean I I

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.130 
wouldn't have happened like I mean I I
think<00:01:06.770> that<00:01:07.100> we<00:01:07.220> might<00:01:07.400> not<00:01:07.520> even<00:01:07.930> when<00:01:08.930> were

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
think that we might not even when were

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.630 
think that we might not even when were
we<00:01:09.290> were<00:01:09.500> we've<00:01:09.680> been<00:01:09.860> in<00:01:10.010> wrestling<00:01:10.400> you<00:01:10.490> know

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590

you might not even became professional
wrestlers<00:01:12.920> I<00:01:13.070> totally<00:01:13.520> think<00:01:13.700> that<00:01:13.970> she's

power<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:44.570> do<00:01:44.840> what<00:01:44.870> I<00:01:45.050> do<00:01:45.110> you<00:01:45.710> know<00:01:45.740> because

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
power to do what I do you know because

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.860

I'm as she is like a hot you know like
it<00:01:48.050> basically<00:01:48.410> because<00:01:48.770> she's<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.070> closest

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
it basically because she's the closest

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.400 
it basically because she's the closest
person<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.450> me<00:01:50.510> to<00:01:50.720> ever<00:01:50.840> need<00:01:51.050> a<00:01:51.200> past

person to me to ever need a past

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.860 
person to me to ever need a past
hardened<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.300> witnessing<00:01:53.300> that<00:01:53.420> as<00:01:53.570> a<00:01:53.600> young

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
hardened and witnessing that as a young

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.170 
hardened and witnessing that as a young
age<00:01:54.050> really<00:01:54.620> like<00:01:54.800> it's<00:01:55.580> not<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.790> thing<00:01:55.970> for<00:01:56.120> a

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
age really like it's not the thing for a

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.520 
age really like it's not the thing for a
kid<00:01:56.360> that's<00:01:56.390> growing<00:01:56.720> up<00:01:56.870> in<00:01:56.990> with<00:01:57.230> their<00:01:57.380> mom

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
kid that's growing up in with their mom

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.690 
kid that's growing up in with their mom
and<00:01:57.560> dad<00:01:57.800> and<00:01:57.980> I<00:01:58.070> think<00:01:58.130> they're<00:01:58.370> still<00:01:58.580> around

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
and dad and I think they're still around

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.760 
and dad and I think they're still around
them<00:01:59.000> you<00:01:59.060> know<00:01:59.180> because<00:01:59.480> it's<00:01:59.630> if<00:02:00.380> unless

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
them you know because it's if unless

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.050 
them you know because it's if unless
you've<00:02:00.980> had<00:02:01.100> that<00:02:01.250> happen<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.700> you<00:02:01.910> you<00:02:01.970> know

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
you've had that happen to you you know

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.580 
you've had that happen to you you know
you<00:02:02.150> don't<00:02:02.330> know<00:02:02.450> what<00:02:02.690> it's<00:02:02.840> like<00:02:02.900> exactly

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
you don't know what it's like exactly

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.190 
you don't know what it's like exactly
and<00:02:03.770> it<00:02:04.040> just<00:02:04.880> really<00:02:05.180> liked<00:02:05.420> estrangement

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
and it just really liked estrangement

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.919 
and it just really liked estrangement
that<00:02:06.620> I<00:02:06.650> think<00:02:07.010> that<00:02:07.190> she's<00:02:07.400> totally<00:02:07.640> gonna

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
that I think that she's totally gonna

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.719 
that I think that she's totally gonna
the<00:02:08.929> reason<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:09.590> we've<00:02:09.769> been<00:02:09.950> so<00:02:10.129> successful

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
the reason you we've been so successful

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.360 
the reason you we've been so successful
and<00:02:11.090> what<00:02:11.629> we've<00:02:11.780> done

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
and what we've done

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.429 
and what we've done
yeah<00:02:14.060> I<00:02:14.360> would<00:02:14.510> say<00:02:14.540> probably<00:02:14.930> could<00:02:15.230> have<00:02:15.290> had

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439 
yeah I would say probably could have had

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.589 
yeah I would say probably could have had
a<00:02:15.469> big<00:02:15.620> impact<00:02:15.739> on<00:02:16.069> that<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.400> like<00:02:16.519> I<00:02:16.790> think

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
a big impact on that and like I think

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.390 
a big impact on that and like I think
the<00:02:17.810> guy's<00:02:17.989> lifetimes<00:02:18.769> I<00:02:18.890> wonder

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
the guy's lifetimes I wonder

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.770 
the guy's lifetimes I wonder
got<00:02:19.700> through<00:02:19.940> some<00:02:20.090> of<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.239> things<00:02:20.390> I'm<00:02:20.599> done
