buddy<00:02:24.850> just<00:02:25.120> energy<00:02:25.510> balls<00:02:25.750> but<00:02:26.650> um<00:02:26.830> yeah

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
buddy just energy balls but um yeah

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.220 
buddy just energy balls but um yeah
that's<00:02:27.850> not<00:02:28.000> very<00:02:28.210> effective<00:02:28.480> on<00:02:28.810> meta<00:02:28.990> gross

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
that's not very effective on meta gross

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.490 
that's not very effective on meta gross
so<00:02:29.860> it<00:02:30.700> didn't<00:02:30.880> really<00:02:30.910> matter<00:02:31.150> either<00:02:31.300> way<00:02:31.540> so

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
so it didn't really matter either way so

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.450 
so it didn't really matter either way so
he's<00:02:32.710> going<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:32.890> retreat<00:02:33.370> into<00:02:33.510> gliscor<00:02:34.510> as<00:02:34.810> i

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
he's going to retreat into gliscor as i

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.000 
he's going to retreat into gliscor as i
set<00:02:36.460> up<00:02:36.550> an<00:02:36.670> agility<00:02:37.350> but<00:02:38.350> you<00:02:38.470> know<00:02:38.590> what<00:02:38.830> I'm

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
set up an agility but you know what I'm

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.240 
set up an agility but you know what I'm
not<00:02:39.310> going<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:40.140> stay<00:02:41.140> in<00:02:41.170> against<00:02:41.770> Gliscor

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
not going to stay in against Gliscor

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.370 
not going to stay in against Gliscor
because<00:02:42.640> of<00:02:42.820> his<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.000> good<00:02:43.570> physical<00:02:43.810> defense

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
because of his a good physical defense

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.200 
because of his a good physical defense
so<00:02:44.620> I<00:02:44.650> decided<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.130> switch<00:02:45.460> in<00:02:45.610> a<00:02:45.700> gyarados

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
so I decided to switch in a gyarados

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.000 
so I decided to switch in a gyarados
again<00:02:46.570> and<00:02:47.340> he<00:02:48.340> has<00:02:48.520> hyper<00:02:48.730> cutter<00:02:49.030> so<00:02:49.390> by

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
again and he has hyper cutter so by

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.190 
again and he has hyper cutter so by
intimidate<00:02:51.010> doesn't<00:02:51.250> do<00:02:51.310> anything<00:02:51.640> but<00:02:52.570> I'm

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
intimidate doesn't do anything but I'm

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.420 
intimidate doesn't do anything but I'm
pretty<00:02:53.350> sure<00:02:53.470> he's<00:02:53.740> going<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:53.890> switch<00:02:54.190> I

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
pretty sure he's going to switch I

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.580 
pretty sure he's going to switch I
decided<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.970> set<00:02:55.480> up<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.690> free<00:02:55.959> dragon<00:02:56.380> dance

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
decided to set up a free dragon dance

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.220 
decided to set up a free dragon dance
and<00:02:58.470> he<00:02:59.470> goes<00:02:59.650> into<00:02:59.950> vaporeon<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:01.240> I'm<00:03:01.900> really

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
and he goes into vaporeon and I'm really

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.570 
and he goes into vaporeon and I'm really
hoping<00:03:02.500> it's<00:03:02.830> not<00:03:02.860> one<00:03:03.100> of<00:03:03.130> those<00:03:03.310> hidden

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
hoping it's not one of those hidden

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.830 
hoping it's not one of those hidden
power<00:03:03.790> electric<00:03:04.420> ones<00:03:04.660> so<00:03:05.350> I<00:03:05.620> decide<00:03:06.010> just<00:03:06.280> to

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
power electric ones so I decide just to

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.199 
power electric ones so I decide just to
go<00:03:07.840> for<00:03:08.050> the<00:03:08.080> taunt<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:08.820> actually<00:03:09.820> he<00:03:09.910> decides

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
go for the taunt and actually he decides

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.560 
go for the taunt and actually he decides
to<00:03:10.300> ice<00:03:10.510> beam<00:03:10.870> so<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:12.910> actually<00:03:13.060> does<00:03:13.300> a<00:03:13.330> little

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
to ice beam so it actually does a little

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.259 
to ice beam so it actually does a little
more<00:03:13.720> than<00:03:13.840> I<00:03:13.930> thought<00:03:14.080> it<00:03:14.140> would<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.769> gyarados

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
more than I thought it would to gyarados

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.670 
more than I thought it would to gyarados
but<00:03:16.269> i'm<00:03:16.390> still<00:03:16.570> thinking<00:03:16.630> i<00:03:17.019> can<00:03:17.170> live<00:03:17.410> two

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
but i'm still thinking i can live two

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.190 
but i'm still thinking i can live two
more<00:03:17.980> but<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:18.970> turns<00:03:19.269> out<00:03:19.390> i<00:03:19.450> was<00:03:19.540> wrong<00:03:19.660> i

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
more but it turns out i was wrong i

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.850 
more but it turns out i was wrong i
probably<00:03:20.410> should<00:03:20.620> have<00:03:20.680> paid<00:03:20.830> attention

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
probably should have paid attention

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.890 
probably should have paid attention
better<00:03:21.430> so<00:03:21.670> i<00:03:21.730> just<00:03:21.910> go<00:03:22.060> for<00:03:22.239> a<00:03:22.300> second<00:03:22.690> dragon

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
better so i just go for a second dragon

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.930 
better so i just go for a second dragon

unfortunately<00:03:25.630> it's<00:03:26.200> going<00:03:26.320> to<00:03:26.380> be<00:03:26.500> i'm<00:03:26.950> going

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
unfortunately it's going to be i'm going

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.520 
unfortunately it's going to be i'm going
to<00:03:27.550> be<00:03:27.670> taken<00:03:27.940> down<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.390> another<00:03:28.660> ice<00:03:28.870> beam<00:03:29.140> so

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
to be taken down to another ice beam so

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.170 
to be taken down to another ice beam so
i<00:03:29.560> only<00:03:29.739> going<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.130> get<00:03:30.220> one<00:03:30.430> stone<00:03:30.760> edge<00:03:30.940> off

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
i only going to get one stone edge off

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.960 
i only going to get one stone edge off
which<00:03:31.510> leaves<00:03:31.810> of<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.860> point<00:03:33.160> on<00:03:33.340> it<00:03:33.370> pretty<00:03:33.700> low

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
which leaves of a point on it pretty low

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.509 
which leaves of a point on it pretty low
health<00:03:34.209> but<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:35.080> could<00:03:35.320> have<00:03:35.410> been<00:03:35.440> better<00:03:35.769> so

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
health but it could have been better so

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.580 
health but it could have been better so
gyarados<00:03:37.150> goes<00:03:37.360> down<00:03:37.600> and<00:03:37.959> that's<00:03:38.260> kind<00:03:38.530> of

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
gyarados goes down and that's kind of

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.550 
gyarados goes down and that's kind of
bad<00:03:38.830> so<00:03:39.790> i<00:03:40.239> have<00:03:40.420> to<00:03:40.540> deal<00:03:40.660> with<00:03:40.720> this<00:03:40.870> vaporeon

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
bad so i have to deal with this vaporeon

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.660 
bad so i have to deal with this vaporeon
somehow<00:03:42.010> so<00:03:42.459> i<00:03:42.489> decide<00:03:42.910> just<00:03:43.360> to<00:03:43.480> go<00:03:43.720> into

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
somehow so i decide just to go into

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
pretty awesome anyway he's thinking

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.770 
pretty awesome anyway he's thinking
about<00:04:29.979> it<00:04:30.069> a<00:04:30.159> lot<00:04:30.210> because<00:04:31.210> he<00:04:31.419> doesn't<00:04:31.599> really

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
about it a lot because he doesn't really

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.809 
about it a lot because he doesn't really
have<00:04:31.870> a<00:04:32.050> whole<00:04:32.379> lot<00:04:32.409> to<00:04:32.860> take<00:04:33.310> a<00:04:33.370> hit<00:04:33.610> from

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:37.680 
have a whole lot to take a hit from
myself<00:04:34.800> so<00:04:35.800> eventually<00:04:36.280> he<00:04:36.909> decides<00:04:37.389> to<00:04:37.569> go

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
myself so eventually he decides to go

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.680 
myself so eventually he decides to go
out<00:04:37.930> into<00:04:38.169> torkoal<00:04:38.919> and<00:04:39.419> I'm<00:04:40.419> just<00:04:40.509> going<00:04:40.659> to

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
know torkoal's special defense isn't too

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.230 
know torkoal's special defense isn't too
great<00:04:46.569> it's<00:04:47.560> really<00:04:47.860> his<00:04:48.069> defense<00:04:48.970> it<00:04:49.150> is

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
great it's really his defense it is

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.379 
great it's really his defense it is
pretty<00:04:49.479> good<00:04:49.659> so<00:04:50.259> I<00:04:50.289> go<00:04:50.500> for<00:04:50.680> a<00:04:50.710> psychic<00:04:51.129> it

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
torkoal so that's not good at all for

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
too tight because I was thinking if

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.050 
too tight because I was thinking if
weight<00:05:08.409> is<00:05:08.440> it<00:05:08.650> steel<00:05:08.919> bug<00:05:09.190> or<00:05:09.400> rock<00:05:09.580> bug<00:05:09.849> it
