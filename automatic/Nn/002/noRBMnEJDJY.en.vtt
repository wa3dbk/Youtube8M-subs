 butterflies coming to the competition magazine

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.490
 South Pole expedition 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.540
 ideal cruise of course 20 degrees and 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.400
 will be 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.740
 but there is a hen it will be slippery 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.740
 so basically look at the beginning

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.189
 make it

 cycling at transmitter and freezer temperatures 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.980

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.190
 you can lubricate well with warm self 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.950
 good clothes to put on many layers 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.610
 and then and then wait how long you are 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.610
 stays warm 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.829
 no fewer than 195 renders across 28 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.620
 tims take up the challenge 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.629
 they leave for 130 km and abandon 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.390

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.740
 gulls and pear tries jonas vianen 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.140
