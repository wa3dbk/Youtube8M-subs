on your substrate the reason for a

on your substrate the reason for a
primer<00:00:55.440> application<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.820> sink

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
primer application is that it can sink

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.000

deep<00:00:57.390> into<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.780> substrate<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.530> base<00:00:58.710> coat

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
deep into the substrate so the base coat

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.369 
deep into the substrate so the base coat
can<00:00:59.250> lay<00:00:59.399> on<00:00:59.550> top<00:01:00.079> providing<00:01:01.079> uniform
