00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
hey guys um I'm going to show you how to

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.559 
hey guys um I'm going to show you how to
restore<00:00:03.870> your<00:00:03.929> synthetic<00:00:04.440> pieces<00:00:05.509> this<00:00:06.509> is

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
restore your synthetic pieces this is

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.650 
restore your synthetic pieces this is
one<00:00:06.960> of<00:00:06.990> our<00:00:07.200> older<00:00:07.529> ones<00:00:07.740> and<00:00:08.150> I<00:00:09.150> just<00:00:09.360> washed

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
one of our older ones and I just washed

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.430 
one of our older ones and I just washed
it<00:00:09.960> today<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.800> it's<00:00:11.250> dry<00:00:11.580> at<00:00:12.000> it<00:00:12.840> kind<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.170> sort

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
it today and it's dry at it kind of sort

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.220 
it today and it's dry at it kind of sort
of<00:00:13.530> went<00:00:13.679> back<00:00:13.799> into<00:00:14.009> shape<00:00:14.250> but<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.610> didn't

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
of went back into shape but it didn't

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.599 
of went back into shape but it didn't
remember<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.650> synthetic<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.520> is

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
remember this is synthetic so this is

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.939 
remember this is synthetic so this is
what<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.820> looks<00:00:17.970> like<00:00:18.180> it's<00:00:18.480> kind<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.869> hope<00:00:19.830> you

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
what it looks like it's kind of hope you

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.670 
what it looks like it's kind of hope you
can<00:00:20.130> see<00:00:20.279> it's<00:00:20.430> pretty<00:00:20.939> frizzy<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:22.500> one

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
can see it's pretty frizzy and this one

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.849 
can see it's pretty frizzy and this one
comes<00:00:22.710> out<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.250> be<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.570> how<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:25.080> kind

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
comes out to be and this is how I kind

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.339 
comes out to be and this is how I kind
of<00:00:25.949> restored<00:00:26.340> my<00:00:26.490> pieces<00:00:26.779> because<00:00:27.779> sits<00:00:28.230> on

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
of restored my pieces because sits on

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.380 
of restored my pieces because sits on
the<00:00:28.439> budget<00:00:28.740> what<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.699> do<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:29.910> take<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.150> powder

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
the budget what I do is take a powder

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.959 
the budget what I do is take a powder
brush<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:32.899> just<00:00:33.899> brush<00:00:34.500> through<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.190> then

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
brush and just brush through it and then

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.139 
brush and just brush through it and then
I<00:00:36.149> use<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.750> suppose<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.350> can<00:00:37.410> weave<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.910> is

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
I use I suppose we can weave and this is

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.430 
I use I suppose we can weave and this is
renewed<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.899> shine<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.559> reduce<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.100> pulse

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
renewed to shine and reduce the pulse

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.729 
renewed to shine and reduce the pulse
and<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:43.920> good<00:00:44.309> for<00:00:44.930> synthetic<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.320> human

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
and it's good for synthetic and human

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.190 
and it's good for synthetic and human
and<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.760> take<00:00:47.940> my<00:00:48.090> curling<00:00:48.329> iron<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.719> i<00:00:48.870> have<00:00:49.050> it

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
and I take my curling iron and i have it

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.900 
and I take my curling iron and i have it
on<00:00:49.260> really<00:00:49.710> low<00:00:50.070> i<00:00:50.340> have<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.789> barely<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.989> one<00:00:52.379> i

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
on really low i have it barely on one i

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.020 
on really low i have it barely on one i
had<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.030> between<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.510> five<00:00:54.829> so<00:00:55.829> i<00:00:56.219> just

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
had it between one and five so i just

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.220 
had it between one and five so i just
take<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:58.079> wasn't<00:00:59.780> originally<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> cold

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
take it this wasn't originally a cold

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.969 
take it this wasn't originally a cold
piece<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:03.000> was<00:01:03.149> more<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.570> straight<00:01:03.870> wavy<00:01:04.140> so

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
piece it was more of a straight wavy so

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.580 
piece it was more of a straight wavy so
what<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.189> do<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.869> run<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.049> through<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.409> really

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
what I do is run it through it really

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.770 
what I do is run it through it really
quickly<00:01:08.780> curl<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:12.060> there<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.390> go<00:01:12.420> because

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
quickly curl it and there you go because

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.109 
quickly curl it and there you go because
it<00:01:12.900> was<00:01:13.020> more<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.409> street<00:01:13.820> because<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:15.030> a

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
it was more of a street because it's a

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.580 
it was more of a street because it's a
synthetic<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.750> course<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.170> not<00:01:16.229> going<00:01:16.500> to

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
synthetic of course it's not going to

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.950 
synthetic of course it's not going to
really<00:01:16.740> curl<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:18.150> really<00:01:18.450> don't<00:01:18.570> want<00:01:18.840> to

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
really curl and you really don't want to

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.960 
really curl and you really don't want to
put<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.200> much<00:01:19.560> heat<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.100> because<00:01:20.700> then

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
put that much heat on it because then

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.840 
put that much heat on it because then
you'll<00:01:21.150> burn<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:22.100> so<00:01:23.100> I'll<00:01:23.189> do<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.430> again<00:01:23.520> I'm

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
you'll burn it so I'll do it again I'm

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.490 
you'll burn it so I'll do it again I'm
just<00:01:24.030> taking<00:01:24.360> little<00:01:24.509> pieces<00:01:24.630> at<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> time

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:35.149 

getting<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.710> part<00:01:29.009> out<00:01:29.100> my<00:01:29.310> way<00:01:32.720> bigger<00:01:34.159> comb

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
getting this part out my way bigger comb

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:48.679 
getting this part out my way bigger comb
it<00:01:35.479> take<00:01:36.479> my<00:01:36.600> paddle<00:01:36.990> brush<00:01:47.240> this<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> little

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
it take my paddle brush this is a little

00:01:48.689 --> 00:02:02.250 
it take my paddle brush this is a little
big<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.170> I'm<00:01:49.259> just<00:01:49.530> kind<00:01:49.829> of

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.040 

run<00:02:03.260> through<00:02:03.530> once<00:02:04.420> and<00:02:05.420> you<00:02:05.570> don't<00:02:05.750> want<00:02:05.960> the

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
run through once and you don't want the

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.749 
run through once and you don't want the
heat<00:02:06.229> to<00:02:06.260> stay<00:02:06.590> home<00:02:06.800> wrong<00:02:07.009> because<00:02:07.430> this<00:02:07.640> is

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
heat to stay home wrong because this is

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.720 
heat to stay home wrong because this is
synthetic<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:08.479> it<00:02:08.569> can<00:02:08.780> burn<00:02:12.459> some<00:02:13.459> synthetic

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
synthetic and it can burn some synthetic

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.750 
synthetic and it can burn some synthetic
hair<00:02:14.180> does<00:02:14.480> curl<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:15.260> don't<00:02:16.190> know<00:02:16.310> which<00:02:16.489> ones

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
hair does curl I don't know which ones

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.090 
hair does curl I don't know which ones
do<00:02:17.090> but<00:02:18.250> this<00:02:19.250> is<00:02:19.400> what<00:02:19.580> I<00:02:19.610> do<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.970> restore<00:02:20.120> my

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
do but this is what I do to restore my

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.920 
do but this is what I do to restore my
I've<00:02:22.100> had<00:02:22.310> this<00:02:22.489> for<00:02:22.550> about<00:02:22.730> almost<00:02:23.480> at<00:02:23.750> your

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
I've had this for about almost at your

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.509 
I've had this for about almost at your
new<00:02:24.140> I<00:02:26.680> just<00:02:27.680> wash<00:02:27.890> it<00:02:27.920> when<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.370> wear<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:28.820> and

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
new I just wash it when I wear it and

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:38.290 
new I just wash it when I wear it and
just<00:02:31.519> move<00:02:32.500> over<00:02:36.459> here<00:02:37.459> it's<00:02:37.580> nice<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.000> thin

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
just move over here it's nice and thin

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.140 
just move over here it's nice and thin
um<00:02:38.830> it<00:02:39.830> wasn't<00:02:40.220> like<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:40.670> said<00:02:40.910> it<00:02:41.000> wasn't

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
um it wasn't like I said it wasn't

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.630 
um it wasn't like I said it wasn't
naturally<00:02:41.810> in<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.019> beginning<00:02:42.500> wasn't<00:02:43.250> curly

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
naturally in the beginning wasn't curly

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.800 
naturally in the beginning wasn't curly
