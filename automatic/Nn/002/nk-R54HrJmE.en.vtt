00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.980
 good kids, how are you doing, my mother? 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.720
 what did I want to say after almost a 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.520
 month of inactivity in a channel to which 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.140
 really has not missed at least 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.090
 two videos and lately three from 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.680
 a year and a half ago so I already 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.049
 you can imagine that not a day goes by 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.460
 this time out is without remembering that 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.169
 I was not receiving your ration 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.609
 weekly cee in the form of select and 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.650
 Of course I would like to start 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.630
 clarifying one thing that I know that many 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.070
 of which is well my last video or the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.369
 farewell video you'll ask what 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.140
 although try to make a positive video 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.240
 saying that he would come back and all that always 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.520
 I made it clear that it would not be far from 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.780
 soon and good here I am just a 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.550
 month after saying that with luck 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.260
 could go back to hard line for what 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.270
 there were then five months what 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.710
 I want it to be totally clear is 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.270
 that what I said at the time was what 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.470
 I thought it would take me to come back and 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.970
 I never would have imagined that 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.950
 circumstances for which I had to 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.450
 let this change so quickly by 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.010
 course with enough effort for me 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.110
 part but anyway I would like 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.940
 that you thought that this is not a technique 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.800
 crazy marketing or anything for the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.300
 style the truth is that I thought I was going 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.100
 to happen one thing and in the end I had 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.870
 a lot of luck of course I'm 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.060
 very happy to be back soon 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.740
 although the typical doubts that arise 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.810
 if they come up, it's that 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.579
 too well but in the end stop 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.110
 focus on the past and look at the 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:15.000
 future of the channel a future that from 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.229
 then there is promising not only 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.520
 for fans of battlefield that 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.439
 obviously will remain the dish 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.180
 strong channel but also for the 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.259
 who want to see other things and 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.659
 I do not know if you have noticed 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.750
 but the video that I will upload tomorrow will be 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.549
 bolt and it's going to be the first video of 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.049

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.380
 streak of masterpieces during 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.119
 September and October and the best thing is that 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.770
 this streak is likely to not end 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.840
 even in a few months only this month 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.789
