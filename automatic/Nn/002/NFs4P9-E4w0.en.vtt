00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.950
 Hello dear friends with you Anton 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.230
 chase and literally recently passed 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.929
 draw lots of championship butt matches 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.769
 World Cup from Europe and here 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.109
 four pairs 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.970
 such we have turned out interesting 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.230
 now we say so fast 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.650
 discuss I give some opinion 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.470
 about who should like me 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.900
 it seems to be a favorite who like me 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.000
 I think it will go on 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.829
 we start the first couple is portugal 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.460
 sweden and know between these two 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.579
 teams can hold some parallel 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.879
 that is, in that and in that team there is 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.730
 one very bright star you understand about 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.700
 com it ronaldo ibrahimovic all 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.829
 the rest of the players, let's say not the most 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.300
 high top level that is well yes 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.160
 although in portuguese it seems to me in 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.440
 the average level of the Portuguese national team in 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.629
 plan technology experience higher all the same 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.609
 that is, there is moutine cycling on it 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.129
 there are n that is such cool players in 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.510
 Overall but still this is not a super star 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.830
 let's say this sweden 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.970
 there are bras and everyone else let's say 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.400
 hard workers that is so normal 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.520
 strong Scandinavian boys who 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.750
 can give battle to portugal i think that 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.580
 much will depend on it 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.259
 confrontation from ronaldo and from 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.619
 ibrahimovic for their national team that is 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.720
 it will be 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.790
 and confrontations and national teams and 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.350
 confrontation of two individuals then 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.880
 I think the same plan 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.799
 individuality even ibrahimovic who 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.810
 will be more 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.700
 but I don’t know how well everyone knows that 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.920
 Ibrahimovic likes to constantly show off 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.020
 on someone then he is such a dude hand on 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.869
 pathos that is, they are not shy about anything 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.390
 of knows his worth even perhaps partly 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.189
 sometimes overestimates himself ronaldo not 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.500
 knew that said and does what he 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.659
 says that is who will come out 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.420
 I don't know the winner, but there is 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.250
 probably would put on portugal though 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.229
 not the greatest loyalty but 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.280
 less because portugal 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.020
 at all past world championships and 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.060
 Europe still went to them and 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.860
 they were pretty good 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.539
 not bad results because well, not 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.400
 I know, but somehow they do that 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.440
 there they barely go out there on and nato 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.480
 through the joints but then 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.820
 quietly out of the group and beyond all 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.260
 bombed then here in 2006 there was 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:25.410
 semifinal then 1 4 was then in my opinion 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.560
 5 1 4 to 8 you see yes well, well, it does not matter 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.590
 the essence is shorter all the same I would put on 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.360
 portugal and because it seems to me yes 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.870
 and especially 5 world without ronaldo it 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.730
 not then here is the next pair 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.770
 so it seems to me to be tense and 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.530
 sweet Ukraine is France in that 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.590
 plan that looks me a lot of people with 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.780
 Ukraine, I think and they will be interested that 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.460
 I will say a couple for this and he will say that 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.770
 there is despite the fact that the national team 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.930
 france many players 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.300
 good level there benzema and riberi 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.260
 which is considered one of the favorites in 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.450
 fight for the golden ball 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.880
 nevertheless I would not put so 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.100
 blindly favorite that is up to france me 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.760
 it seems a bit taller there but not on 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.450
 head there there on 1 two hairs this from 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.340
 for the fact that there is literally in composition 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.810
 there are players out there from manchester united there 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.590
 they come from real 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.360
 so if Ukrainians are not afraid of names 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.040
 then I think they have very good ones 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.110
 the chances to go the more Ukraine now 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.170
 Pretty decent team I mean 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.540
 young talented guys i think more 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.610
 they can do pretty well if 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.010
 do not scare is not the most important thing 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.690
 so and so, and I think that the two teams in the 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.850
 same principle yes and France now 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.290
 to put it mildly not that before that is 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:45.690
 which could calmly all merge here 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.660
 the next couple is not particularly interesting is 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:52.050
 Greece Romania I think that the Greeks 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.300
 his style, that is, one year will score and 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.280
 in defense of the vortex for sex are zabesh 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.420
 so in romania who's there for them is not 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.880
 I know old muddy cheeks and dudes table 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.010
 which one I don’t know well I don’t know 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.780
 novels too like a dark horse for me 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.150
 don't know when it would be after time 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.640
 there were Romanians in major championships to me 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.620
 it seems it was 2008 this is not then 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.120
 failed and last place in my 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:22.229
 took up the next couple is iceland 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:25.370
 croatia here is what iceland ended up in 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.940
 the joints and for me it's generally just 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.470
 surprise that is 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.540
 well yes they had a group not the most not 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.870
 the most so let's say so serious that is 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.420
 there even Switzerland ranked first 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.220
 but by no means the slates are good, that is, I 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.150
 Wikipedia looked at their composition then 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.860
 specially even 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.470
 that is, there is not a single dude out 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.300
 top clubs that is generally here for all 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.850
 history of the national team of Iceland seems to me 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.500
 except good yong sen and everything then everything 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.740
 know where he played chelsea played 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.150
 barcelona and now he don't know after times 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.890
 I know that he was in the dish I am now 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.360
 I can’t say exactly where he is 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.970
 his mother is not only broth 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.460
 son's all the tables there are sigurdsson and feast 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.210
 dixon and some shorter play 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.190
 it is not clear where there are no shorter stars in the team 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.710
 it is clear that Croatia is a cut above 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.630
 but still it seems to me that Iceland is so 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.520
 say can give a surprise 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.190
 most likely Croatia will pass that is 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.140
 Croat must get together and pass in 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.890
 easy iceland then you stand yourself not 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.010
 get scared 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:25.020
 This is the only thing that can prevent 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.580
 actually that's all 4 pair 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.600
 that is, I think that they go further rather 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.490
 total portugal 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:34.830
 then I do not know who is from Ukraine France 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.560
 greece and croatia it seems to me and 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.270
 so and the rest of the collection who need 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.850
 even our first places have already fallen 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.570
 Russian national team got it right 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.350
 surprises 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:48.150
 and what is there in other continents 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.310
 honestly really even I do not know yet know 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.100
 what do you like uruguay hit the junction that is 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.590
 also amazing there is low iran 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.380
 naughty sardonically shit plays 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.100
 most likely there will be freaks rule 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.800
 how passed 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:05.100
 burkina faso you heard something like that 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:08.940
 there is very very amazing information 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.710
 for me this ocean is most likely 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.740
 new zealand past again here i'm still 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:16.470
 I did not recognize this information I think closer to the very 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.590
 toss the whole tournament I'm interested in 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.440
 By this , too, I will give some analysis such 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:25.260
 analysis of all good luck to all everyone with 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.600
 you were Anton Chase goodbye waiting for what 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.580
 5 world in Brazil, waiting for the Russian national team 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.880
 there and all the other teams there too 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.880
 we wait
