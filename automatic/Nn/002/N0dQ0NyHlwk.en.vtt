00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.660
 here one of my favorite maps knows 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.240

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:39.000
 summit there is a team the match but 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:41.760
 Nevertheless read yes my topics 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.160

 Giant goat made and was a lot 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:08.549
 los young people have called the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.590
 most of them also have real questions 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.880
 I did not have to think about that 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.720
 I thought the calls just say 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:23.960
 and say, what are we going to do , but I found that 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.610
 cool that you thought about it 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.210
 and you really have a few seeds 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.700
 interested 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.390
 there are consistently correct people 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.810
 called 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.620
 nobody called, we said 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.620

 Before I turn the phone be 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:03.200

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:12.220

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.540
 play that if I just say 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.430
 none of my people is online and 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.100

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.290

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.020
 is being talked a bit small 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:57.510
 Talk is cool though 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.320
 do not have to constantly chat now 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.990
 the people did not do it either 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.990
 up to 12 or something else actually 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.850
