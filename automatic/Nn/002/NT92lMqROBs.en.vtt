00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.920
 that I have is a highlighter and this is what 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.170

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.010
 Tower has one saltadores 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:17.160
 then how did you get the probable pink 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:22.640
 underlined what has always covered this 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:26.690

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.230
 The next thing I have is my charger 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.560
 listen with my cell phone chargers 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.350

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.650
 next I have in that same 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.500
 compartment is a are some glasses 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.050
 sun and those are the desires that I always 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.910
 my photos in my videos on the blog I think 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.910
 which are my favorites 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.160

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.850
 wallet 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.100
 and the wallet can not miss 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.680
 although I feel we started a lot because 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.670
 It's too big for the bag 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.860
 and the last thing I have in that 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.060

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.220
 highlighter with me in the bag 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.110
