00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.160
 with respect to the specifications of 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.380
 this case the neon high volume account 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.800
 with four colors you will see that 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.809
 these this framework is interchangeable the 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.129

 green and is the one that you can 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.750
 appreciate at this time and yellow the 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.989
 cost of the case is 26 dollars with 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.360
 99 and comes in two materials the material 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.120
 itself the case is a plastic 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.489
 flexible known as tet usa and the 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.830
 frame is made of polyurethane one more plastic 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.100
 hard that together because it helps 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:14.000
 absorb impacts or blows the plastic or 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.650
 sorry the case itself does not expand 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.290
 with the heat of the equipment always keeps 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.990
 its shape so now I know it is 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.610
 install our case device 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.280
 this is very simple simply 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.070
 we add the cell phone 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.979
 so easy and it is like you can 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.869
 appreciate scopes have a relief that 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.850
 allows the moment you 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.259
 place the cell on flat surfaces 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.830
 the first thing he plays is going to be the 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:44.229
 protector more not the screen in the part 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.750
 from behind you are going to have access to 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.610
 what in doing the speaker the camera and 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.380
 the viewing flash ld make the 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.570
 top you can see who 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.000
 they have the entry for the headset of 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.860
 3.5 mm microphone on this side 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.110
 they have the on / off button 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.179
 here they have access to what is going to 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.399
 be the connector the microphone is by 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:04.860
 here on the other hand we have what 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.560
 come to do 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.050
 the volume the volume buttons and that 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.790
 is everything with regard to the device as 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.260
 I told you these parts are 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.080
 interchangeable in case you 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.600
 want to buy the accessory for 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.760
 can change color as this package 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.480
 of the option the other thing that I've noticed 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.210
 because the case really is very good 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.240
 but I've noticed that the moment 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.160
 you keep the cell phone off in 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.080
 the side part of the button 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.080
 on if you click here 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.740
 close to what not to do the button will 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.450
 Automatically turn on the phone or pass 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.340
 the same with the volume then that's 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.970
 the only problem of millions without 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.900
 press the button turns on the 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.880
 screen 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.640
 that is the button 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.250
 and here we are squeezing the side 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.720
 then it is very sensitive with respect to 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.400
 what comes to be the part of the 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.010
 buttons that is the negative point with 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.500
 regarding this case that as 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.410
 I say it seems very good to the naked eye 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.140
 protects from impacts but has those 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.580
 small problems that supposedly 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.080
 could affect the fact that you 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.350
 keep in your pocket and constantly 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.880
 the screen is falling off because 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.840
 you are simply squeezing the 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.550
 side of the cell then that 's 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.710
 the negative point in any case if 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.070
 you are interested in respect to 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:32.710

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.690
