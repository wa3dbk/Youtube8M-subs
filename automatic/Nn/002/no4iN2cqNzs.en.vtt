what<00:01:41.290> didn't<00:01:41.440> have<00:01:41.620> to<00:01:41.710> be<00:01:41.800> a<00:01:41.830> bad<00:01:42.010> ball<00:01:42.250> but

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
what didn't have to be a bad ball but

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.130 
what didn't have to be a bad ball but
master<00:01:42.640> Tommy<00:01:42.850> he<00:01:43.420> kind<00:01:43.600> of<00:01:43.690> pierced<00:01:43.870> the<00:01:43.990> gap

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
master Tommy he kind of pierced the gap

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.690 
master Tommy he kind of pierced the gap
and<00:01:44.560> make<00:01:44.710> sure<00:01:44.830> the<00:01:44.980> ball<00:01:45.130> got<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.370> boundary

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
and make sure the ball got the boundary

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.280 
and make sure the ball got the boundary
I'm<00:01:46.240> really<00:01:46.540> glad<00:01:46.660> that<00:01:46.810> he's<00:01:46.960> back<00:01:47.140> and

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
involved because I think he's got a

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.710 
involved because I think he's got a
whole<00:01:48.760> lot<00:01:48.910> to<00:01:49.000> offer<00:01:49.090> South<00:01:49.330> African<00:01:49.600> cricket

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
whole lot to offer South African cricket

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.540 
whole lot to offer South African cricket
and<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.170> will<00:01:50.650> be<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:51.040> poorer<00:01:51.280> for<00:01:51.430> not

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
and and will be the poorer for not

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.000

you know if I did go and have a net or
whatever<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.069> is<00:02:37.160> I'd<00:02:37.310> ever<00:02:37.489> bet<00:02:37.819> for<00:02:38.030> five<00:02:38.239> 10

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480

minutes<00:02:38.690> I<00:02:38.840> mean<00:02:38.989> to<00:02:39.110> run<00:02:39.290> around<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.620> field

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
minutes I mean to run around the field

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.280 
minutes I mean to run around the field
was<00:02:40.010> just<00:02:40.040> way<00:02:40.519> out<00:02:40.549> of<00:02:40.790> line<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.930> I<00:02:42.079> just

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
was just way out of line and I just

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.670 
was just way out of line and I just
thought<00:02:42.620> I<00:02:42.950> had<00:02:43.099> to<00:02:43.220> conserve<00:02:43.640> energy

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680

thought I had to conserve energy
hopefully<00:02:45.680> believing<00:02:46.130> maybe<00:02:46.310> I'd<00:02:46.519> spent<00:02:46.819> some

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
hopefully believing maybe I'd spent some

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.479 
hopefully believing maybe I'd spent some
time<00:02:47.180> out<00:02:47.360> there<00:02:47.569> and<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:47.959> just<00:02:48.950> think<00:02:49.370> it's

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
time out there and I just think it's

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.630 
time out there and I just think it's
overdone<00:02:49.910> today<00:02:50.150> I<00:02:50.180> really<00:02:50.569> do

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
matches after his 23rd birthday I wonder

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.320 
matches after his 23rd birthday I wonder
if<00:04:13.010> he'd<00:04:13.190> been<00:04:13.340> given<00:04:13.490> the<00:04:13.700> opportunities

that some of his contemporaries have got

what batting average he might have

the age of 26 when he was probably

massive<00:05:00.830> blow<00:05:00.980> for<00:05:01.220> him<00:05:01.400> he<00:05:01.850> was<00:05:02.210> a<00:05:02.240> little<00:05:02.420> bit

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
massive blow for him he was a little bit

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.570 
massive blow for him he was a little bit
of<00:05:02.660> a<00:05:02.690> different<00:05:02.990> personality<00:05:03.290> to<00:05:03.770> two<00:05:04.400> very

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
of a different personality to two very

of a different personality to two very
richest<00:05:04.910> I<00:05:05.060> think<00:05:05.270> maybe<00:05:05.510> he<00:05:05.750> doped<00:05:06.020> with<00:05:06.560> with

it

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
it

I<00:05:07.430> wouldn't<00:05:08.060> say<00:05:08.240> better<00:05:08.540> but<00:05:08.900> maybe<00:05:09.020> a<00:05:09.200> little

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
I wouldn't say better but maybe a little

I wouldn't say better but maybe a little
bit<00:05:09.440> easier<00:05:09.520> and<00:05:10.520> he<00:05:10.640> was<00:05:10.760> able<00:05:11.030> to<00:05:11.060> continue
