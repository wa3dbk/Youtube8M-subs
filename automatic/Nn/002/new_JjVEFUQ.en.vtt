00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
look better so right now I really didn't

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.259 
look better so right now I really didn't
someone<00:03:06.299> summon<00:03:07.079> anyone<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.310> didn't<00:03:09.180> bother

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
someone summon anyone so I didn't bother

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.280 
someone summon anyone so I didn't bother
with<00:03:09.420> that

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
with that

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.649 
with that
also<00:03:10.799> I'd<00:03:11.040> recommend<00:03:11.519> doing<00:03:11.670> this<00:03:11.879> uh<00:03:11.939> this

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
also I'd recommend doing this uh this

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.479 
also I'd recommend doing this uh this
boss<00:03:12.930> battle<00:03:12.959> by<00:03:13.500> yourself<00:03:13.859> because<00:03:14.040> if<00:03:14.370> you

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
boss battle by yourself because if you

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.569 
boss battle by yourself because if you
summon<00:03:16.069> the<00:03:17.069> two<00:03:17.250> MVC's<00:03:17.879> in<00:03:18.090> front<00:03:18.859> or<00:03:19.859> anyone

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
summon the two MVC's in front or anyone

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.589 
summon the two MVC's in front or anyone
I<00:03:20.609> think<00:03:20.989> it<00:03:21.989> boosts<00:03:22.980> up<00:03:23.099> his<00:03:23.340> defense<00:03:24.090> by

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
I think it boosts up his defense by

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.580 
I think it boosts up his defense by
quite<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:24.989> bit<00:03:25.169> so<00:03:26.299> you<00:03:27.299> see<00:03:27.510> I'm<00:03:28.079> doing<00:03:28.379> a<00:03:28.439> bit

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
quite a bit so you see I'm doing a bit

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.369 
quite a bit so you see I'm doing a bit
of<00:03:28.620> damage<00:03:28.799> here<00:03:29.359> 789<00:03:30.359> now<00:03:30.989> when<00:03:31.139> I<00:03:31.169> was

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
of damage here 789 now when I was

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.220 
of damage here 789 now when I was
fighting<00:03:32.069> with<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.400> NPC's<00:03:32.879> I<00:03:33.209> was<00:03:33.870> only<00:03:34.019> doing

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
fighting with the NPC's I was only doing

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.740 
fighting with the NPC's I was only doing
about<00:03:34.470> 389<00:03:35.250> so<00:03:35.669> I'd<00:03:36.060> recommend<00:03:36.540> just<00:03:36.599> doing

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
about 389 so I'd recommend just doing

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.740 
about 389 so I'd recommend just doing
this<00:03:36.989> by<00:03:37.139> yourself<00:03:37.700> as<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:39.329> can<00:03:39.480> see<00:03:39.629> is

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
this by yourself as you can see is

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.270 
this by yourself as you can see is
extremely<00:03:39.930> effective<00:03:40.560> didn't<00:03:40.980> get<00:03:41.099> touched

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
extremely effective didn't get touched

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.300 
extremely effective didn't get touched
once<00:03:41.639> and

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
once and

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.820
