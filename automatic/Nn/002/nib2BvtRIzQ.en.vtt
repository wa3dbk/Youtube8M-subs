progress but i don't think it's as as
big<00:01:11.299> a<00:01:11.329> factor<00:01:11.719> is<00:01:11.990> a<00:01:12.139> lot<00:01:12.560> of<00:01:12.590> people<00:01:12.740> think<00:01:13.280> it

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
big a factor is a lot of people think it

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.370 
big a factor is a lot of people think it

makes<00:03:32.260> enough<00:03:32.500> place<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:33.070> Cardinals<00:03:33.640> are

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
makes enough place the Cardinals are

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.750 
makes enough place the Cardinals are
historically<00:03:35.050> not<00:03:35.560> a<00:03:35.620> very<00:03:35.890> good<00:03:35.950> road<00:03:36.250> team<00:03:36.489> I

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
historically not a very good road team I

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.820 
historically not a very good road team I
think<00:03:37.330> that<00:03:37.390> they'll<00:03:37.660> hold<00:03:37.720> this<00:03:38.080> Cardinal

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
think that they'll hold this Cardinal

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.550 
think that they'll hold this Cardinal
offense<00:03:38.980> in<00:03:39.370> check<00:03:39.640> for<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:39.910> most<00:03:40.120> part<00:03:40.560> 27-24
