00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400
 Ali 8 cylinder aircraft en-2 number 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.540
 understandable reasons do not call here 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.540
 state of rocker 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:21.510
 nobody has done anything yet 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:25.490
 then used oil Hungarian r22 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:31.140
 and motor gasoline which is allowed 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:36.059
 all documents are moving here are particular 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.870
 exhaust exhaust valve try 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.870
 wipe it with a cloth 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:50.489
 Can of course someone from specialists 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:55.250
 saw something like that I haven't seen yet 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.250
 this state of exhaust means for 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.820
 to clear the engine was worked on 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:10.470
 This cylinder worked for about 300 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:13.409
 350 hours now remove the exhaust 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.450
 a glass here selling fingers polazili 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.439
 Cicek but I wipe with a cloth that has been 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:25.380
 all 10 grams is just shaking which 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:31.009
 replaces us ordinary scraper well not 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.009
 hard to see the sun go over here 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:41.390
 it's easy to see in there wiping with a rag 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:45.180
 we get to the metal house yes 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.860
 metal surface can anyone 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:53.220
 then I did it not 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:56.230
 never worked before if someone 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.510
 I said this cylinder turned out 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:04.890
 50 hours can be turned over 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.950
 Here such carbon formation happened for 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:16.620
 350 hours 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:18.150
 who understands and sees that soot with 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.990
 suction valve practically 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:26.040
 missing almost washed away means 350 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:28.610
 hours of them last hours 20 he 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:35.330
 works with topping the unwashed prize from glasses and 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:38.250
 dad poured boost so well 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:44.240
 further this state 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.240
 exhaust valve I will climb there with a hand 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.910
 try to wipe it 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:13.890
 here note nagar in some 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:14.540
 the ground is just removed m it is good 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.970
 fluff 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:24.480
 Well, if I know soot removed by hand they 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:27.030
 violin song I say hello to you 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.050
 look at the cylinder that worked 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:35.630
 without this garbage though was good too 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.630
 gasoline was the same man too 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.050
 this is an exhaust valve by cylinder bin 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:45.900
 engine sex two aircraft an-2 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:48.560
 when I work on the stem of this valve 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.840
 nagar is always formed between the sleeve 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:56.370
 by the valve itself therefore when increasing 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.870
 this valve hangs on the mountains literally 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.460
 every 50 hours it is supposed to do 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.510
 sharoshku feel this snuff which 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:08.490
 available on this valve is removed 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:12.020
 understands removed that can be removed 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:16.820
 you can not shoot can be through the exhaust 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:19.860
 but you can dry drought clean 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.040
 brush them honestly there are many ways 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.080
 like food 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:29.870
 but the fact is that the pancake on this valve 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:33.540
 which worked well at least 150 hours 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:36.360
 absolutely no knife works can be shown 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.460
 which is available at the gift that's in the middle of 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.060
 it has a working surface here 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.900
 some damage to the soot 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:50.790
 It turns out that you and Galicia 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:54.980
 035 0 45 mm here such nor are 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:05:00.410
 usually obtained on the stem of this valve 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.410
 on this rock we see the mountains there 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:17.310
 and even if you would too 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:20.910
 has worked 50 hours already for a hundred should hundred 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.700
 percent and then he turned out at least 150 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.730
 maybe we are like last year 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.650
 I donâ€™t remember how much was there , but we 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.080
 You can remove it cleaned but still 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.770
 last year and today's year and in this 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:38.640
 Well, the minimum 150 hours to work on 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:42.100
 the heat is not hanging any mean it 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:45.590
 if you apply this one 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:48.610
 which zat swizer is practically possible 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.970
 generally avoid valve sticking like 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:55.250
 what we do each of three rows can 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:57.700
 if a bad day gasoline falls on 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.560
 two three times to do honor to the stern and 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:04.040
 this one will soon be able to box as a 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.160
 it is well in it at least here well 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.390
 now just need to take this very paste 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.090
 apply 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.730
 and twist it will show in what 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:17.980
 condition but in the cylinder 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:21.410
 itself valve sits down with him there 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:26.050
 mobility saddle itself mobility evil 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.050
 very cool our personal state will do 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:39.410
 not a single crayfish Nastya nothing on it 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:43.750
 on earth no Nazar usually such spots 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.750
 stay on the saddle 

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:34.300
 It is still finally like this 

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:55.140
 I think more begins to show even 

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:55.140
 an incompetent person able to understand
