before I came here so everything is

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.130 
before I came here so everything is
different<00:02:08.740> classes<00:02:09.740> the<00:02:10.190> way<00:02:11.000> they<00:02:11.240> teach<00:02:11.300> in

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
different classes the way they teach in

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.750 
different classes the way they teach in
what<00:02:12.350> way<00:02:12.500> different<00:02:15.100> here<00:02:16.100> they<00:02:16.340> try<00:02:16.700> to

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
what way different here they try to

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.680 
what way different here they try to
explain<00:02:17.090> more<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.540> like<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.320> do<00:02:19.210> they<00:02:20.210> practice

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
explain more to like to do they practice

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.430 
explain more to like to do they practice
the<00:02:21.320> material<00:02:21.610> they<00:02:22.610> teach<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.690> have<00:02:23.990> a

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
the material they teach so you have a

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.530 
the material they teach so you have a
lot<00:02:24.830> of<00:02:24.980> researchers<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.520> do<00:02:25.820> out<00:02:26.360> of

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
lot of researchers to do out of

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.410

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
presentations but back home I think it's

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.940 
presentations but back home I think it's
more<00:02:29.900> like<00:02:30.170> just<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:31.340> memorize<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.090> materials

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950
