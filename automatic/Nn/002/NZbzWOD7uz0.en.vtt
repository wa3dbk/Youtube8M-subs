up<00:01:32.620> we've<00:01:33.620> got<00:01:33.830> a<00:01:33.860> second<00:01:34.310> one<00:01:34.400> here<00:01:34.460> hold<00:01:35.120> on

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
up we've got a second one here hold on

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.210 
up we've got a second one here hold on
let's<00:01:37.430> do<00:01:37.520> that<00:01:37.730> on<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.090> side<00:01:38.360> here<00:01:39.070> there<00:01:40.070> we

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
let's do that on the side here there we

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.940 
let's do that on the side here there we
go<00:01:40.600> there<00:01:41.600> we'll<00:01:42.020> just<00:01:42.230> pop<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:42.530> off<00:01:42.590> like<00:01:42.800> that

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
go there we'll just pop it off like that

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.260 
go there we'll just pop it off like that
and<00:01:43.010> I<00:01:43.220> actually<00:01:43.400> like<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:43.850> leave<00:01:44.000> it<00:01:44.120> like

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
and I actually like to leave it like

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.700 
and I actually like to leave it like
this<00:01:44.300> so<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:45.380> lid<00:01:45.620> is<00:01:45.740> kind<00:01:46.010> of<00:01:46.100> hinged

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
this so the lid is kind of hinged

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.440 
this so the lid is kind of hinged
alright<00:01:48.710> so<00:01:48.950> moving<00:01:49.130> on<00:01:49.370> to<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.550> kid<00:01:49.850> inside

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
alright so moving on to the kid inside

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.720 
alright so moving on to the kid inside
you'll<00:01:51.170> see<00:01:51.440> that<00:01:51.650> there's<00:01:51.890> directions<00:01:52.400> on

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730
