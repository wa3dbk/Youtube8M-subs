00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:24.619
 So this is the new kawasaki z1000 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.509
 For the 2014 season, the Japanese 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.300
 manufacturer not the potent naked bike 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.349
 only visually heavily revised 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.650
 However, the extravagant design stood 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.510
 in the focus of development of the low 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.430
 mounted lamps mask over the new ones 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.559
 alu handlebar and the towering tank 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.449
 continue over the bench and the pointed 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.409
 tapering narrow tail should the bike 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.670
 and profile remind of a cat 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:48.860
 that this look polarized 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.859
 Do not be surprised that the cover still 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.120
 has become more sporty earlier 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.800
 At the same time the engine and the chassis became 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.429
 almost unchanged from the predecessor 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.829
 accepted 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:59.480
 thanks to a new mappings modified 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.879
 airbox and longer approach judges 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.829
 the performance could still be 1 4 ps 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.829
 now be increased 142 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.490
 think of a stupid four-cylinder now 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.410
 at low speeds no power 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.090
 delivers and he is neat up there 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.090
 and teaches this 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.530
 specimen of a better 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.910
 thanks to the shorter translation of the first 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.860
 five gears and the full torque 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.560
 you do not have to drive the engine at any time 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.180
 Turn off to get ahead 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.260
 already starting from 3000 touring produces the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.260
 cover printing properly 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.740
 the brand wants to pop 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.450
 7,000 moves from there pushes the cover 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.700
 Go on this is a free country 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.210
 a true fireworks on propulsion and 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.210
 rotating joy 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.640
 the new z 1000 is definitely not for 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.530
 People who want to cruise comfortably want them 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.120
 wants with a lot of body use and pressure 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.890
 put the handlebar on the back of him and 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.780
 who will be held with it 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.580
 The crops are properly harvested 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.960
 dynamic motorcycle feeling and can 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.350
 over the views from the roadside 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.350
 be sure 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.160
 the complete driving report of the kawasaki 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.400
 z1000 you read in motorcycle magazine 26 2013
