00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
fundamental steps and this episode we're

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.439 
fundamental steps and this episode we're
going<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.190> be<00:00:17.250> covering<00:00:17.400> movement<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.210> yeah

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
going to be covering movement so yeah

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.820 
going to be covering movement so yeah
moving<00:00:18.840> around<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.140> map<00:00:19.170> you'll<00:00:19.500> get<00:00:19.680> you

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
moving around the map you'll get you

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.590 
moving around the map you'll get you
guys<00:00:20.010> probably<00:00:20.160> go<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.490> like<00:00:20.580> that's<00:00:21.210> obvious

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
guys probably go and like that's obvious

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.840 
guys probably go and like that's obvious
they<00:00:21.750> just<00:00:21.960> move<00:00:22.140> my<00:00:22.170> joysticks<00:00:22.830> but<00:00:23.100> like<00:00:23.279> you

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
they just move my joysticks but like you

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.580 
they just move my joysticks but like you
need<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.090> figure<00:00:24.359> out<00:00:24.480> how<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.720> us<00:00:25.170> how<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.350> move

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
need to figure out how to us how to move

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.589 
need to figure out how to us how to move
around<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.859> map<00:00:25.920> properly<00:00:26.849> like<00:00:27.240> which<00:00:27.449> will

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
around the map properly like which will

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.410 
around the map properly like which will
help<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:28.019> get<00:00:28.619> killed<00:00:29.010> less<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.699> also<00:00:30.060> allow

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
help you get killed less and also allow

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.089 
help you get killed less and also allow
you<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.810> get<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.230> better<00:00:31.500> chance<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.949> killing

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
you to get the better chance of killing

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.920 
you to get the better chance of killing
your<00:00:32.340> position<00:00:32.700> like<00:00:33.210> as<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:33.630> see<00:00:33.719> when

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
your position like as you can see when

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.600 
your position like as you can see when
I'm<00:00:34.050> moving<00:00:34.469> around<00:00:34.590> Maps<00:00:34.950> I'm<00:00:35.219> always<00:00:35.370> making

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
I'm moving around Maps I'm always making

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.510 
I'm moving around Maps I'm always making
sure<00:00:35.820> we're<00:00:36.270> cover<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.770> know<00:00:37.920> where<00:00:38.460> I'm

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
sure we're cover is and I know where I'm

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.520 
sure we're cover is and I know where I'm
going<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.700> move<00:00:38.790> next<00:00:39.239> with<00:00:39.570> having<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.320> most

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
going to move next with having the most

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.860 
going to move next with having the most
amount<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.980> cover<00:00:41.190> between<00:00:41.430> where<00:00:42.270> I'm<00:00:42.480> going

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
amount of cover between where I'm going

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.430 
amount of cover between where I'm going
and<00:00:43.340> like<00:00:44.340> between<00:00:45.059> how<00:00:45.600> I'm<00:00:45.780> going<00:00:46.020> there<00:00:46.289> so

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
and like between how I'm going there so

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.690 
and like between how I'm going there so
when<00:00:46.590> I'm<00:00:46.680> going<00:00:46.890> let<00:00:47.010> across<00:00:47.219> here<00:00:47.399> i'd<00:00:47.550> move

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
when I'm going let across here i'd move

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.369 
when I'm going let across here i'd move
here<00:00:47.730> i'd<00:00:48.030> have<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.390> barrel<00:00:48.780> here<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.140> front

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
here i'd have this barrel here in front

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.350 
here i'd have this barrel here in front
of<00:00:49.469> me<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.710> I've<00:00:49.800> got<00:00:50.010> half<00:00:50.579> my<00:00:50.610> bodies<00:00:51.180> behind

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
of me so I've got half my bodies behind

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.670 
of me so I've got half my bodies behind
cover<00:00:51.690> then<00:00:51.899> I'm<00:00:52.020> when<00:00:52.140> I'm<00:00:52.230> moving<00:00:52.350> here<00:00:52.649> I

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
cover then I'm when I'm moving here I

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.110 
cover then I'm when I'm moving here I
wouldn't<00:00:52.949> just<00:00:53.010> run<00:00:53.160> straight<00:00:53.460> down<00:00:53.879> here

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
wouldn't just run straight down here

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.310 
wouldn't just run straight down here
because<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.420> song<00:00:54.600> pox<00:00:54.809> around<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.170> corner

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
barrel i'll go here and move here and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.450 
barrel i'll go here and move here and
across<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.170> then<00:01:01.530> get<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.770> sides<00:01:02.010> up<00:01:02.190> again

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
when i stopped moving could be ready for

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.170 
when i stopped moving could be ready for
every<00:01:04.890> single<00:01:05.100> gun<00:01:05.339> fight<00:01:05.549> then<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.790> like<00:01:06.000> move

every single gun fight then I like move
around<00:01:06.390> here<00:01:06.750> check<00:01:07.409> your<00:01:07.619> corners<00:01:07.890> as<00:01:08.189> well

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340

around here check your corners as well
when<00:01:08.490> you're<00:01:08.580> moving<00:01:08.670> around<00:01:08.939> maps<00:01:09.180> be

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
when you're moving around maps be

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.210 
when you're moving around maps be
exactly<00:01:10.229> sure<00:01:10.439> where<00:01:10.590> you're<00:01:10.680> going<00:01:10.830> cuz<00:01:11.070> when

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220

I go mouth here I know roughly there is
pretty<00:01:14.220> much<00:01:14.340> going<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.610> be<00:01:14.700> pretty<00:01:15.150> safe<00:01:15.570> but

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
pretty much going to be pretty safe but

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.719 
pretty much going to be pretty safe but
upstairs<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.920> course<00:01:17.159> here<00:01:17.369> if<00:01:17.460> someone's

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
upstairs of course here if someone's

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:18.859 
upstairs of course here if someone's
going<00:01:17.850> down<00:01:17.939> here<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.420> run<00:01:18.720> straight

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
going down here and I just run straight

to hear you're gonna get picked off you
got<00:01:20.880> me<00:01:20.970> thinking<00:01:21.000> about<00:01:21.509> everything<00:01:22.229> like

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
got me thinking about everything like

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.539 
got me thinking about everything like
this<00:01:22.590> when<00:01:22.770> you're<00:01:22.860> going<00:01:23.009> round<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.280> maps

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
this when you're going round the maps

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.390 
this when you're going round the maps
that's<00:01:24.150> why<00:01:24.390> map<00:01:24.689> knowledge<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.350> key<00:01:25.770> just

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
that's why map knowledge is key just

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.520 
that's why map knowledge is key just
make<00:01:26.580> sure<00:01:26.630> everywhere<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.659> move<00:01:28.110> there's<00:01:28.470> a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
make sure everywhere you move there's a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.890 
make sure everywhere you move there's a
piece<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.799> cover<00:01:29.189> between<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.210> where<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
piece of cover between you and where the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.390 
piece of cover between you and where the
enemy<00:01:31.170> are<00:01:31.290> going<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.560> be<00:01:31.650> coming<00:01:31.680> from<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.310> if

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
enemy are going to be coming from so if

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.499
