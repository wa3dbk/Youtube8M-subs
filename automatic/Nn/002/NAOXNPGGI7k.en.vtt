00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
2012 all the flowers have opened up on

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.850 
2012 all the flowers have opened up on
my<00:00:07.620> phalaenopsis<00:00:08.400> orchids<00:00:08.820> so<00:00:08.970> I<00:00:09.000> thought<00:00:09.269> I'd

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
my phalaenopsis orchids so I thought I'd

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.110 
my phalaenopsis orchids so I thought I'd
do<00:00:10.860> this<00:00:11.040> video<00:00:11.880> update<00:00:12.860> there's<00:00:13.860> 21<00:00:14.429> total<00:00:14.730> I

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
do this video update there's 21 total I

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.269 
do this video update there's 21 total I
thought<00:00:15.509> that<00:00:15.570> was<00:00:15.780> going<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:15.990> be<00:00:16.049> maybe<00:00:16.440> 23

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
thought that was going to be maybe 23

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.630 
thought that was going to be maybe 23
but<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.789> looks<00:00:17.970> like<00:00:18.029> it's<00:00:18.300> going<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:19.070> be<00:00:20.070> 21

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
but it looks like it's going to be 21

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.700 
but it looks like it's going to be 21
but<00:00:21.000> can't<00:00:21.300> complain<00:00:21.660> about<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:22.109> pretty

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
but can't complain about that pretty

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:30.620 
but can't complain about that pretty
impressive

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.510 

it's<00:00:31.199> pretty<00:00:31.410> top-heavy<00:00:31.919> I<00:00:32.099> think<00:00:32.340> I'm<00:00:32.430> going

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
it's pretty top-heavy I think I'm going

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.389 
it's pretty top-heavy I think I'm going
to<00:00:32.579> have<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.790> put<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.120> into<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> larger<00:00:34.399> pot

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
to have to put it into a larger pot

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.340 
to have to put it into a larger pot
because<00:00:35.699> it's<00:00:36.090> almost<00:00:36.449> on<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.870> verge<00:00:36.989> of

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
because it's almost on the verge of

00:00:37.350 --> 00:01:26.160 
because it's almost on the verge of
tipping<00:00:37.739> over<00:00:38.180> when<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.300> pot<00:00:39.510> dries<00:00:39.840> out

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.710 

so<00:01:26.680> if<00:01:26.740> you<00:01:26.799> got<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.009> one<00:01:27.220> main<00:01:27.460> spike<00:01:27.970> and<00:01:28.299> I

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
so if you got the one main spike and I

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.590 
so if you got the one main spike and I
have<00:01:28.900> three<00:01:29.350> side<00:01:30.930> branches<00:01:33.210> off<00:01:34.210> of<00:01:34.450> that

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
have three side branches off of that

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:47.980 
have three side branches off of that
main<00:01:34.899> spike

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:02:00.820 

so<00:01:48.590> thanks<00:01:48.860> for<00:01:48.950> watching

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.890 

you
