00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
time but history time photography there

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.110 
time but history time photography there
that<00:04:06.610> these<00:04:06.880> three<00:04:07.180> think<00:04:07.480> three<00:04:09.120> three

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
that these three think three three

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.510 
that these three think three three
different<00:04:10.540> medium

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
different medium

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.770 
different medium
something<00:04:12.520> thinking<00:04:12.910> about<00:04:13.180> the<00:04:13.300> time<00:04:13.540> it's

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
something thinking about the time it's

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.660 
something thinking about the time it's
more<00:04:14.350> like<00:04:14.860> job<00:04:15.550> of<00:04:15.820> a<00:04:15.850> philosopher<00:04:16.660> maybe<00:04:16.989> or

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
more like job of a philosopher maybe or

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.420 
more like job of a philosopher maybe or
scientists<00:04:18.670> or<00:04:18.940> mathematicians<00:04:19.380> or

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
scientists or mathematicians or

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.270 
scientists or mathematicians or
physicians<00:04:21.430> but<00:04:22.120> why<00:04:22.570> not<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:23.140> user<00:04:23.350> art<00:04:23.710> to

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
physicians but why not the user art to

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.610 
physicians but why not the user art to
make<00:04:24.460> people<00:04:24.850> think<00:04:25.030> about<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.900> time<00:04:26.140> and

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
make people think about the time and

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.520 
make people think about the time and
then<00:04:27.160> photography<00:04:27.790> is<00:04:27.970> the<00:04:28.030> best<00:04:28.570> medium<00:04:29.110> to

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
then photography is the best medium to
