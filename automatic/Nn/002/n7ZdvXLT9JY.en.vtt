I have you to personally top and white
top<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.469> black<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:54.079> this<00:00:55.079> has<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.860> spine<00:00:56.399> ball

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
top is black so this has the spine ball

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.369 
top is black so this has the spine ball
they're<00:00:57.059> not<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.660> there<00:00:57.840> was<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> regular

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
they're not that there was a regular

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.260 
they're not that there was a regular
spine<00:00:58.590> most<00:00:58.800> enough<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.460> had<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> right<00:01:00.030> team

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
spine most enough and I had a right team

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.330 
spine most enough and I had a right team
keyboardist<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.109> they<00:01:02.010> were<00:01:02.190> they<00:01:02.309> were

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
keyboardist and they were they were

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.690 
keyboardist and they were they were
thicker<00:01:03.210> they're<00:01:03.899> not<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.229> stick<00:01:04.530> here<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.430> it's

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
thicker they're not a stick here so it's

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.240 
thicker they're not a stick here so it's
not<00:01:05.820> quite<00:01:06.030> as<00:01:06.210> much<00:01:06.360> office<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.380> fact<00:01:10.100> this<00:01:11.100> is

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
not quite as much office in fact this is

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.210 
not quite as much office in fact this is
the<00:01:11.280> low-rise<00:01:12.240> rocker<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.380> what<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:13.979> means

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
the low-rise rocker so what that means

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.179 
the low-rise rocker so what that means
is<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.790> basically<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:16.320> flat<00:01:16.680> all<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.040> way

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
is that basically it's flat all the way

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.070 
is that basically it's flat all the way
through<00:01:17.460> here<00:01:17.700> instead<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.750> being<00:01:18.960> too

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
through here instead of being too

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.920 
through here instead of being too
loosely<00:01:19.259> curved<00:01:19.950> like<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:21.479> it's<00:01:21.659> flat

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
loosely curved like that but it's flat

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.660 
loosely curved like that but it's flat
all<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.229> way<00:01:22.320> through<00:01:22.590> there<00:01:22.770> they're<00:01:23.490> right

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
all the way through there they're right

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.950 
all the way through there they're right
about<00:01:23.880> here<00:01:24.180> at<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.420> end<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.659> starts<00:01:24.869> to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
about here at the end that starts to

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.770 
about here at the end that starts to
curve<00:01:25.200> up<00:01:25.350> it's<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.619> little<00:01:25.979> bit<00:01:26.600> much<00:01:27.600> more

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
curve up it's a little bit much more

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.899 
curve up it's a little bit much more
stable<00:01:28.049> writing<00:01:28.590> Leslie<00:01:29.490> what<00:01:29.610> you're<00:01:29.729> doing

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
stable writing Leslie what you're doing

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.160 
stable writing Leslie what you're doing
parking<00:01:30.240> stuff<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.600> also<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.840> whole<00:01:31.140> lot

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
parking stuff it's also a whole lot

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.219 
parking stuff it's also a whole lot
easier<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.710> talk<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.430> was<00:01:33.329> made<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.110> was

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
easier to talk I was made that I was

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.690 
easier to talk I was made that I was
easier<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.590> could<00:01:34.799> pop<00:01:34.979> up<00:01:35.009> on<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.310> things<00:01:35.579> and

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
easier I could pop up on the things and

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.420 
easier I could pop up on the things and
I<00:01:35.729> feel<00:01:35.909> if<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.090> write<00:01:36.299> instantly<00:01:36.990> rail<00:01:37.430> they

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
I feel if I write instantly rail they

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.690 
I feel if I write instantly rail they
have<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:38.820> much<00:01:39.000> you

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
have so much you

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.270 
have so much you
I<00:01:40.229> thought<00:01:41.229> that<00:01:41.439> improved<00:01:41.710> so<00:01:41.860> much<00:01:41.890> brother

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
I thought that improved so much brother

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.999 
I thought that improved so much brother
got<00:01:42.549> to<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.729> board<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:44.110> board<00:01:44.380> is<00:01:44.530> gonna<00:01:44.829> be

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
got to the board this board is gonna be

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.649 
got to the board this board is gonna be
light<00:01:45.539> much<00:01:46.539> wider<00:01:46.810> than<00:01:46.869> my<00:01:47.049> ranking<00:01:47.439> was

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
light much wider than my ranking was

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.029 
light much wider than my ranking was
going<00:01:49.659> off<00:01:49.750> jump<00:01:50.049> popping<00:01:50.469> the<00:01:50.530> Barna<00:01:50.799> things

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
going off jump popping the Barna things

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.370 
going off jump popping the Barna things
which<00:01:51.729> is<00:01:51.880> just<00:01:52.179> a<00:01:52.360> lot<00:01:52.659> easier<00:01:53.110> I<00:01:53.170> just

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
which is just a lot easier I just

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:11.479 
which is just a lot easier I just
definitely<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:56.140> don't<00:01:56.920> know<00:01:57.009> all<00:01:57.189> the<00:02:02.369> stuff

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:28.050 

but<00:02:25.860> all<00:02:26.860> right<00:02:27.069> I'm<00:02:27.250> as<00:02:27.400> far<00:02:27.579> as<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:27.880> you

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
but all right I'm as far as that you

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.240 
but all right I'm as far as that you
know<00:02:28.090> ability<00:02:28.510> goes<00:02:28.660> I<00:02:29.019> think<00:02:29.829> is<00:02:30.130> actually

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
know ability goes I think is actually

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.610 
know ability goes I think is actually
durable<00:02:30.760> more<00:02:30.940> I<00:02:31.209> definitely<00:02:31.720> liked<00:02:31.930> it<00:02:32.110> some

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
durable more I definitely liked it some

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.979 
durable more I definitely liked it some
boots<00:02:32.829> that<00:02:32.920> did<00:02:33.280> use<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:33.459> it<00:02:33.670> feel<00:02:33.989> still

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
boots that did use it it feel still

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.330 
boots that did use it it feel still
stuff<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.410> I<00:02:35.470> don't<00:02:35.650> think<00:02:35.890> it's<00:02:36.010> gonna<00:02:36.130> mess

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
stuff that I don't think it's gonna mess
