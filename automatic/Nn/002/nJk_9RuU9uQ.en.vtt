Stormbreaker<00:00:44.340> armor<00:00:44.790> this<00:00:45.060> is<00:00:45.240> a<00:00:45.270> water-based

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
Stormbreaker armor this is a water-based

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.470 
Stormbreaker armor this is a water-based
elemental<00:00:46.950> armor<00:00:47.130> it<00:00:47.700> gives<00:00:47.880> me<00:00:47.970> a<00:00:48.030> bonus<00:00:48.240> to

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
elemental armor it gives me a bonus to

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.030 
elemental armor it gives me a bonus to
staph<00:00:48.690> damage<00:00:49.080> and<00:00:49.230> increases<00:00:49.620> my<00:00:49.650> attack<00:00:50.010> a

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
staph damage and increases my attack a

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.710 
staph damage and increases my attack a
little<00:00:50.310> bit<00:00:50.400> so<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.550> think<00:00:50.640> that's<00:00:51.060> really

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
little bit so I think that's really

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.840 
little bit so I think that's really
beneficial<00:00:51.960> for<00:00:52.500> me<00:00:52.650> since<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.070> mainly<00:00:53.310> use<00:00:53.550> my

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
beneficial for me since I mainly use my

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.450 
beneficial for me since I mainly use my
staff<00:00:54.180> as<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.750> main<00:00:54.900> source<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.260> damage<00:00:55.460> so

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
staff as the main source of damage so

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.860 
staff as the main source of damage so
I'm<00:00:56.640> gonna<00:00:56.730> go<00:00:56.910> ahead<00:00:56.970> and<00:00:57.090> select<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.660> and

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
I'm gonna go ahead and select that and

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.600 
I'm gonna go ahead and select that and
then<00:00:57.990> I'm<00:00:58.110> gonna<00:00:58.200> pick<00:00:58.470> four<00:00:58.860> pieces<00:00:59.130> of<00:00:59.310> gear

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610
