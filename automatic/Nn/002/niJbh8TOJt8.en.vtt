looks<00:00:38.040> really<00:00:38.340> really<00:00:38.969> well<00:00:39.239> done<00:00:39.270> though<00:00:39.750> I

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
looks really really well done though I

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.930 
looks really really well done though I
think<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.320> well<00:00:40.950> done<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.579> picture

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
think it's well done and the picture

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.819 
think it's well done and the picture
looks<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.690> doesn't<00:00:43.079> look<00:00:43.110> like<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:43.620> been

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
looks it doesn't look like it's been

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.440 
looks it doesn't look like it's been
photoshopped<00:00:44.640> or<00:00:44.760> anything<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.210> haven't<00:00:45.360> seen

anything really to photoshop and now you

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.090 
anything really to photoshop and now you
see<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.570> see<00:00:48.750> deserted<00:00:49.410> for<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.710> other<00:00:49.860> one

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
see you see deserted for the other one

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.150 
see you see deserted for the other one
and<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.370> other<00:00:50.460> one<00:00:50.670> over<00:00:51.680> over<00:00:52.680> something<00:00:53.100> I

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
and the other one over over something I

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.950 
and the other one over over something I
can't<00:00:53.430> read<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.820> rest<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.510> could

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
can't read the rest of it I could

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.660 
can't read the rest of it I could
probably<00:00:55.050> find<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.559> somewhere<00:00:55.620> else<00:00:55.949> probably

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
probably find it somewhere else probably

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.639 
probably find it somewhere else probably
someone<00:00:56.879> has<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.149> full<00:00:57.300> image<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.870> but<00:00:58.050> for

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
someone has the full image of it but for

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.590 
someone has the full image of it but for
now<00:00:58.800> we're<00:00:59.010> just<00:00:59.039> going<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.340> call<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.120> nothing

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
now we're just going to call it nothing

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.609 
now we're just going to call it nothing
I<00:01:00.780> guess<00:01:01.430> map<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.609> nothing<00:01:03.059> alright<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.019> um<00:01:04.049> so

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
I guess map of nothing alright so um so

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.780 
I guess map of nothing alright so um so
you<00:01:04.680> see<00:01:04.920> once<00:01:05.189> again<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.519> called<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
you see once again it's called the

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.350 
you see once again it's called the
liability<00:01:06.540> call<00:01:06.869> duty<00:01:07.080> black<00:01:07.200> ops<00:01:07.770> 2

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
liability call duty black ops 2

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.880 
liability call duty black ops 2
liability<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.900> just<00:01:10.170> looks<00:01:10.350> really<00:01:10.560> cool

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
liability and it just looks really cool

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.330

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
and you really have to have a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.550 
and you really have to have a
professional<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:24.689> make<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.140> actually

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.690 
should I say liable which means kind of
liability<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.740> guess<00:01:38.009> because<00:01:38.340> that's<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
liability I guess because that's the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.510 
liability I guess because that's the
title<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.810> DLC<00:01:40.380> or<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.950> be<00:01:41.100> DLC

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
title of that the DLC or so to be DLC

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.139 
title of that the DLC or so to be DLC
but<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.630> went<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.590> david<00:01:44.189> vonderhaar<00:01:44.399> Twitter

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
someone used the inspector element on it

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.090 
someone used the inspector element on it
that<00:01:57.780> could<00:01:57.960> be<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.079> huge<00:01:58.290> possibility<00:01:58.560> people

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
that could be a huge possibility people

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.280 
that could be a huge possibility people
are<00:01:59.189> doing<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.700> on<00:01:59.909> all<00:02:00.390> websites<00:02:01.049> to

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
are doing that and on all websites to

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.050 
are doing that and on all websites to
try<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.649> fake<00:02:01.829> stuff<00:02:02.009> use<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.520> stupid

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
try and fake stuff use the stupid

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.730 
try and fake stuff use the stupid
inspect<00:02:03.899> element<00:02:04.320> i<00:02:04.409> think<00:02:04.619> it's

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
inspect element i think it's

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.499 
inspect element i think it's
ridiculously<00:02:05.430> dumb<00:02:05.820> i<00:02:06.030> think<00:02:06.210> they<00:02:06.329> should

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
ridiculously dumb i think they should

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.779 
ridiculously dumb i think they should
just<00:02:06.659> not<00:02:06.930> even<00:02:07.200> have<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.129> for<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.459> public<00:02:08.759> to

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
just not even have it for the public to

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.160 
just not even have it for the public to
use<00:02:08.910> because<00:02:09.270> they<00:02:09.479> can<00:02:09.629> change<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.020> much

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
use because they can change so much

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.070 
use because they can change so much
stuff<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.619> just<00:02:10.770> mind-boggling

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
stuff and just mind-boggling

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.180 
stuff and just mind-boggling
so<00:02:13.290> for<00:02:13.920> me<00:02:14.070> I<00:02:14.100> don't<00:02:14.520> know<00:02:14.640> if<00:02:14.820> that<00:02:16.190> david
