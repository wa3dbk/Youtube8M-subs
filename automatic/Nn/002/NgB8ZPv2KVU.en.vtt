00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.820
 hello for this video i want 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:08.360
 show how to cook 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.250
 soda water at home 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.519
 for this we need a balloon with 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.339
 carbon dioxide in this case it 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:21.779
 fire extinguisher cylinder converted 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:24.060
 the valves and the gear itself 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.169
 water bottle which we will 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:32.009
 to carbonate for this we need 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:34.279
 connect the hose to the bottle open 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.279
 head 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:47.629
 you see the gas went and we start 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.629
 shake bottle to tutor 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:56.830
 as you can see if you do not shake let 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.490
 music stops going to the bones 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.970
 enough 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.970
 arms 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.549
 so 37 minutes or two 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.540
 depending on the volume of the bottle I have 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.540
 two-liter bottle 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.259
 I'll say right away that 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:39.170
 the bottle should be incomplete left 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:42.380
 some free space and water 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.100
 opportunities cold so it is better 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.100
 dosed 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.570
 already 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.570
 until the pile that does not go I think that everything 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.270
 he 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:16.490
 gentlemen ready for flavor can 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.880
 add different syrup to all the pleasant 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.880
 appetite
