00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
grafted to them together and created a

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.780

station wagon and this and the station
wagon<00:01:34.880> actually<00:01:35.450> comes<00:01:35.780> very<00:01:35.990> close<00:01:36.170> to

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
wagon actually comes very close to

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.080

resembling<00:01:36.740> from<00:01:37.130> a<00:01:37.220> distance<00:01:37.580> a<00:01:37.670> new<00:01:37.820> Dodge

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
resembling from a distance a new Dodge

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.910 
resembling from a distance a new Dodge
Magnum<00:01:38.720> and<00:01:39.310> he<00:01:40.900> created<00:01:41.900> this<00:01:42.110> thing<00:01:42.409> it<00:01:42.799> took

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
Magnum and he created this thing it took

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.600 
Magnum and he created this thing it took
an<00:01:43.210> 11,000<00:01:44.210> hours<00:01:44.810> I<00:01:45.140> figured<00:01:46.009> that<00:01:46.159> that<00:01:46.189> car

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
an 11,000 hours I figured that that car

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.069 
an 11,000 hours I figured that that car
is<00:01:46.790> probably<00:01:47.090> worth<00:01:47.720> about<00:01:48.460> 400,000<00:01:49.930> half<00:01:50.930> a

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
is probably worth about 400,000 half a

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.640 
is probably worth about 400,000 half a
million<00:01:51.380> dollars<00:01:51.770> oh<00:01:51.979> yeah<00:01:52.640> and<00:01:53.329> he<00:01:54.320> took<00:01:54.590> it

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
million dollars oh yeah and he took it

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.880 
million dollars oh yeah and he took it

I<00:02:47.130> put<00:02:48.130> their<00:02:48.310> head<00:02:48.549> around<00:02:48.700> this<00:02:49.030> carbon

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
I put their head around this carbon

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.620 
I put their head around this carbon
footprint<00:02:50.019> issue<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:50.590> how<00:02:50.860> how<00:02:51.549> is<00:02:51.910> what<00:02:52.480> are

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
footprint issue and how how is what are

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.910 
footprint issue and how how is what are
the<00:02:52.750> effects<00:02:53.200> what<00:02:53.440> are<00:02:53.530> all<00:02:53.620> the

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
the effects what are all the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.070 
the effects what are all the
ramifications<00:02:54.150> students<00:02:55.150> involved<00:02:55.420> oh<00:02:55.720> yeah

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
ramifications students involved oh yeah

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.949 
ramifications students involved oh yeah
if<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.650> timing<00:02:57.280> could<00:02:57.880> not<00:02:57.910> be<00:02:58.150> possibly

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
if the timing could not be possibly

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.839 
if the timing could not be possibly
better<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.530> this<00:02:59.650> and<00:03:00.250> it<00:03:00.400> doesn't<00:03:00.700> always

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
better and this and it doesn't always

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.789 
better and this and it doesn't always
have<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.120> center<00:03:01.750> around<00:03:01.780> research<00:03:02.500> because

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
have to center around research because

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.920 
have to center around research because
these<00:03:03.489> idea<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:03.910> do<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.060> lot<00:03:04.269> of<00:03:04.330> research<00:03:04.720> but

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
these idea to do a lot of research but

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.259 
these idea to do a lot of research but
we<00:03:05.019> do<00:03:05.140> a<00:03:05.170> lot<00:03:05.290> of<00:03:05.349> Applied<00:03:05.880> apply<00:03:06.880> things<00:03:07.150> will

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
we do a lot of Applied apply things will

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.420 
we do a lot of Applied apply things will
take<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.599> research<00:03:07.959> results<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.799> apply<00:03:09.400> it

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
take the research results and apply it

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.520 
take the research results and apply it
and<00:03:09.700> basically<00:03:10.000> check<00:03:10.720> it<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:10.989> test<00:03:11.230> it<00:03:11.410> and

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
and basically check it and test it and

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.589 
and basically check it and test it and
validate<00:03:12.040> it<00:03:12.190> fraid<00:03:12.819> so<00:03:13.120> then<00:03:13.390> you<00:03:13.480> know

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
validate it fraid so then you know

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.570 
validate it fraid so then you know
that's<00:03:13.780> kind<00:03:14.620> of<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.769> stuff<00:03:14.950> we're<00:03:15.370> looking

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
put a spool and the rear axle you'll be

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.470 
put a spool and the rear axle you'll be
fine<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:41.650> positive<00:03:42.370> traction<00:03:42.640> will<00:03:43.060> have<00:03:43.209> the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
fine the positive traction will have the

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.270 
fine the positive traction will have the
of<00:03:43.690> course<00:03:43.930> a<00:03:43.989> set<00:03:44.170> of<00:03:44.260> clutches<00:03:44.470> in<00:03:44.650> it<00:03:44.920> that

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
of course a set of clutches in it that

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.979 
of course a set of clutches in it that
will<00:03:45.459> allow<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.760> vehicle<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.329> go<00:03:46.630> around<00:03:46.840> a

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
will allow the vehicle to go around a

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.420 
will allow the vehicle to go around a
corner<00:03:47.019> that's<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.590> biggest<00:03:47.739> issue<00:03:47.980> and<00:03:48.310> then

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
corner that's the biggest issue and then

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.039 
corner that's the biggest issue and then
Sophie<00:03:48.819> knows<00:03:49.000> this<00:03:49.209> that<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.540> biggest<00:03:49.840> issue

Sophie knows this that the biggest issue

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.949 
Sophie knows this that the biggest issue
is<00:03:50.350> I<00:03:50.560> it's<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:51.579> turning<00:03:51.910> radius<00:03:51.940> I'm<00:03:52.540> almost

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
is I it's the turning radius I'm almost

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.840 
is I it's the turning radius I'm almost
an<00:03:53.170> expert<00:03:53.620> yeah<00:03:53.920> yeah<00:03:54.310> so<00:03:54.549> you're<00:03:54.730> going

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
an expert yeah yeah so you're going

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.370 
an expert yeah yeah so you're going
around<00:03:55.030> a<00:03:55.269> corner<00:03:55.420> if<00:03:55.660> you<00:03:55.750> have<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:55.870> spool<00:03:56.200> in

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
around a corner if you have a spool in

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.590 
around a corner if you have a spool in
it<00:03:56.530> you<00:03:56.650> end<00:03:56.769> up<00:03:56.889> by<00:03:57.010> having<00:03:57.340> one<00:03:57.549> wheel<00:03:58.180> hop

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
it you end up by having one wheel hop

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.539 
it you end up by having one wheel hop
around<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.139> other<00:03:59.319> dangerous<00:04:00.190> as<00:04:00.400> all

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
clutches in it and my suggestion would

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.830 
clutches in it and my suggestion would
be<00:04:07.329> to<00:04:07.450> be<00:04:07.780> a<00:04:07.810> drop<00:04:08.200> in<00:04:08.440> say<00:04:08.739> a<00:04:08.769> Ford<00:04:09.130> 9-inch

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
be to be a drop in say a Ford 9-inch

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.819 
be to be a drop in say a Ford 9-inch
those<00:04:10.840> that's<00:04:11.769> what<00:04:11.950> I<00:04:11.980> would<00:04:12.100> say<00:04:12.370> to<00:04:13.829> pure

those that's what I would say to pure

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.729 
those that's what I would say to pure
bulletproof<00:04:15.549> rear<00:04:15.910> axles<00:04:16.450> and<00:04:16.720> it'll<00:04:17.530> take<00:04:17.680> a

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
bulletproof rear axles and it'll take a

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.199 
bulletproof rear axles and it'll take a
little<00:04:17.919> bit<00:04:18.039> of<00:04:18.130> fabrication<00:04:18.850> but<00:04:19.000> hey

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
little bit of fabrication but hey

parked there parked in a way that puts
pressure<00:05:08.190> and<00:05:08.580> tension<00:05:08.909> on<00:05:09.300> them<00:05:09.479> and<00:05:09.629> if<00:05:09.750> they

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
pressure and tension on them and if they

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.899 
pressure and tension on them and if they
sit<00:05:10.169> in<00:05:10.349> the<00:05:10.500> Sun<00:05:10.710> for<00:05:10.740> a<00:05:10.979> long<00:05:11.190> time<00:05:11.460> they<00:05:11.639> tend

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
sit in the Sun for a long time they tend

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:15.260 
sit in the Sun for a long time they tend
to<00:05:12.389> take<00:05:12.599> on<00:05:12.870> that<00:05:13.319> shape<00:05:13.830> so<00:05:14.729> I<00:05:14.759> don't<00:05:15.150> know<00:05:15.210> if

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
to take on that shape so I don't know if

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.990 
to take on that shape so I don't know if
you<00:05:15.389> can<00:05:15.539> tell<00:05:15.870> here<00:05:16.169> but<00:05:16.319> they<00:05:16.469> do<00:05:17.009> flex<00:05:17.400> yeah

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
you can tell here but they do flex yeah

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.089 
you can tell here but they do flex yeah
so<00:05:18.270> what<00:05:18.479> this<00:05:18.690> does<00:05:18.750> is<00:05:19.259> it<00:05:19.409> will<00:05:19.440> it<00:05:19.889> will

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 
so what this does is it will it will

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:24.140 
so what this does is it will it will
actually<00:05:20.490> take<00:05:21.330> that<00:05:21.599> set<00:05:22.289> so<00:05:23.159> what<00:05:23.520> you<00:05:23.669> do<00:05:23.879> is

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
actually take that set so what you do is

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.350 
actually take that set so what you do is
if<00:05:24.659> on<00:05:24.870> the<00:05:25.289> swipe<00:05:25.710> up<00:05:26.009> and<00:05:26.460> that's<00:05:26.639> typical<00:05:27.180> on

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
if on the swipe up and that's typical on

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.959 
if on the swipe up and that's typical on
the<00:05:27.599> way<00:05:27.719> up<00:05:27.990> it<00:05:28.259> chatters<00:05:28.740> so<00:05:29.400> if<00:05:29.460> it<00:05:29.580> chatters

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:29.969 
the way up it chatters so if it chatters

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:31.610 
the way up it chatters so if it chatters
on<00:05:30.120> the<00:05:30.210> way<00:05:30.330> up<00:05:30.539> what<00:05:30.719> you<00:05:30.840> do<00:05:31.020> is<00:05:31.199> you<00:05:31.319> pull

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
on the way up what you do is you pull

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.589 
on the way up what you do is you pull
this<00:05:31.770> back<00:05:32.009> from<00:05:32.190> the<00:05:32.340> windshield<00:05:32.759> okay<00:05:33.210> and
