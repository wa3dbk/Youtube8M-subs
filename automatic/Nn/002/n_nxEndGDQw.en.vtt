00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
heat is much better it dissipates faster

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.500

and<00:00:33.530> the<00:00:34.530> fan<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.399> just<00:00:35.640> works<00:00:36.059> great<00:00:36.329> it's<00:00:36.450> a

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
and the fan is just works great it's a

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.810 
and the fan is just works great it's a
single<00:00:36.870> fan<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.320> runs<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.890> cools<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.430> GPU

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
being too hot but it was i thought a

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.689 
being too hot but it was i thought a
great<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.570> great<00:01:00.870> notebook<00:01:01.260> as<00:01:01.379> well<00:01:01.699> anyway

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
great a great notebook as well anyway

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.789 
great a great notebook as well anyway
the<00:01:02.940> specs<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.510> thing<00:01:03.780> it's<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:04.559> pretty

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the specs on this thing it's it's pretty

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.730 
the specs on this thing it's it's pretty
much<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.949> standard<00:01:05.220> specs<00:01:05.670> i<00:01:05.939> updated<00:01:06.420> i

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740

extra attachment cable and then i

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.969 
extra attachment cable and then i
swapped<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.439> out<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.680> put<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:21.409> kingston<00:01:22.409> 96

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
swapped it out and put a a kingston 96

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.240 
swapped it out and put a a kingston 96

the automatic trim support garbage

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.700 
the automatic trim support garbage
collection<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.990> don't<00:01:34.140> have<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.380> do<00:01:34.500> anything

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
collection you don't have to do anything

it automatically cleans itself which is
really<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.259> plus<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.979> also<00:01:38.850> i<00:01:39.420> upgraded<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
really a plus and also i upgraded the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.149 
really a plus and also i upgraded the
processor<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.369> an<00:01:41.700> i7<00:01:42.030> 74<00:01:42.960> tqm<00:01:43.409> which<00:01:44.040> I

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
processor to an i7 74 tqm which I

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.710 
processor to an i7 74 tqm which I
thought<00:01:44.340> might<00:01:44.399> offer<00:01:44.909> slightly<00:01:45.570> better

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
thought might offer slightly better

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.539 
thought might offer slightly better
cooling<00:01:46.049> by<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.860> way<00:01:47.009> if<00:01:47.130> you're<00:01:47.250> looking<00:01:47.490> at

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
cooling by the way if you're looking at

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.530 
cooling by the way if you're looking at
the<00:01:47.670> video<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.119> you're<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.479> you're

the video and you're and you're

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.210 
the video and you're and you're
wondering<00:01:48.780> why<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.170> might<00:01:49.799> look<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.070> little

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
wondering why it might look a little

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.319 
wondering why it might look a little
skewed<00:01:50.549> i'm<00:01:50.850> using<00:01:51.240> my<00:01:51.450> viewsonic<00:01:53.329> 3d

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
very nice anyway a performance on this

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.730 
very nice anyway a performance on this
thing<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.800> ran<00:02:41.040> 3dmark<00:02:41.640> tests<00:02:41.970> on<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.470> with<00:02:43.470> the

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
thing I ran 3dmark tests on it with the

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.450 
thing I ran 3dmark tests on it with the
3d<00:02:44.220> off<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.820> I<00:02:45.660> got<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.900> score<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.260> about<00:02:46.460> 10,000

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
3d off and I got a score of about 10,000

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.050 
3d off and I got a score of about 10,000
583<00:02:48.390> when<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.320> enable<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:50.070> 3d<00:02:50.460> though<00:02:50.670> your

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
583 when you enable the 3d though your

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.480 
583 when you enable the 3d though your
performance<00:02:51.720> drops<00:02:51.960> to<00:02:52.290> just<00:02:52.620> under<00:02:53.070> seven

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
performance drops to just under seven

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.120 
performance drops to just under seven
thousand<00:02:54.090> points<00:02:54.330> so<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:55.440> do<00:02:55.620> take<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:55.860> major

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
thousand points so you do take a major

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.510 
thousand points so you do take a major
hit<00:02:56.280> because<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.510> know<00:02:57.660> you're<00:02:57.930> you're

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
hit because you know you're you're

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.980 
hit because you know you're you're
running<00:02:59.520> 60<00:02:59.790> frames<00:03:00.000> per<00:03:00.090> second<00:03:00.540> but<00:03:00.600> you're

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
running 60 frames per second but you're

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.550 
running 60 frames per second but you're
doubling<00:03:01.380> your<00:03:02.030> view<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.180> so<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.540> does<00:03:04.260> it

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
doubling your view and so it does it

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.500 
doubling your view and so it does it
does<00:03:04.710> take<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.920> performance<00:03:05.640> hit<00:03:05.670> anyway<00:03:06.390> it

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
does take a performance hit anyway it

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.840 
does take a performance hit anyway it

I think I'm going to break this review
down<00:04:06.989> into<00:04:07.260> two<00:04:07.440> sections<00:04:07.769> we're<00:04:08.129> going<00:04:08.250> to

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
down into two sections we're going to

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.569 
down into two sections we're going to
