00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 we arrive at starbucks now because 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.819
 was a place on which is the continent with 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:14.519
 swallowed Julian 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:26.820
 the boy who bought diarrhea and by chance and 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:36.110
 italy already had people ask me famous 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:36.110
 that sells on rgs and this incredible turn 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.780
 is that if you buy the guitar 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.020
 I'm very big, you walk a lot. 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.020
 good 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.750
 I always say that after you go that the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.559
 walk tshirt on the road adopted 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:01.640
 way to the people who go there 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:06.390
 my light attack even if it says lucia 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:10.799
 I always liked listening to the sound of 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.250
 rock my mistaken view on hiring 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.250
 you 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:28.329
 What I'm going through is this , I 'm 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:31.689
 off to the Portuguese that was not 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:44.850
 within 30 days of event 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:44.850
 sometimes it is good to store this equipment 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:53.470
 Are you going to leave this taha? 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:59.380
 I said I'll leave you murder with 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:04.989
 water can thank you once again that it will 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:09.250
 for the key to you 

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:10.599
 then I think I was very lucky 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.060
 because someone lost and to 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.700
 opportunity 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.590
 Did you see that the message 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.930
 In this window, I do not think I could 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:28.090
 see if it will not be for me either 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:30.100
 Our set up all worked out right 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.720
 but the most important thing is that when 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.920
 life that you think 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.390
 time and I have a home library. 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.300
 Because of you, you lived this 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.400
 year to read and get to know this world of 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:54.210
 literature 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:03:01.580
 At this point you do not come to a 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:04.580
 coffee with him where you kiss people is this 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.580
 same
