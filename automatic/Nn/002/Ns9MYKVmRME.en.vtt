00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
the bread making process where you

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.380 
the bread making process where you
really<00:00:56.829> the<00:00:57.829> only<00:00:58.100> thing<00:00:58.520> you<00:00:58.550> can<00:00:58.880> do<00:00:59.149> is<00:00:59.719> wait

and so all of a sudden I'm engaged
is<00:01:21.719> process<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.530> craft<00:01:23.119> where<00:01:24.590> if<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.770> want

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
is process this craft where if you want

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.859 
is process this craft where if you want
to<00:01:26.039> make<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.340> good<00:01:26.579> you<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.539> not<00:01:27.840> rush

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.310 

at<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.290> very<00:01:31.500> beginning<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.899> set<00:01:33.899> out<00:01:34.049> with<00:01:34.079> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
at the very beginning I set out with the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.749 
at the very beginning I set out with the
goal<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.649> never<00:01:36.170> never<00:01:37.170> letting<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.640> know

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
goal of never never letting you know

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.179 
goal of never never letting you know
speed<00:01:39.270> or<00:01:39.780> ease<00:01:40.200> or<00:01:40.649> profit<00:01:41.520> win<00:01:42.299> out<00:01:42.509> over<00:01:43.189> the

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
speed or ease or profit win out over the

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.060 
speed or ease or profit win out over the
quality<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.970> bread<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.530> it's<00:01:46.530> difficult

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
quality of the bread and it's difficult

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.490 
quality of the bread and it's difficult
to<00:01:47.220> do<00:01:47.399> there's<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:47.939> much<00:01:48.090> pressure<00:01:48.479> from<00:01:49.229> so

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
to do there's so much pressure from so

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.750 
to do there's so much pressure from so
many<00:01:49.619> angles

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
many angles

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.510 
many angles
have<00:01:51.850> those<00:01:52.060> other<00:01:52.590> priorities<00:01:53.590> take<00:01:54.130> over

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
have those other priorities take over

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.020 
have those other priorities take over
but<00:01:55.390> I<00:01:55.570> still<00:01:56.440> feel<00:01:56.710> like<00:01:56.740> we've<00:01:57.730> got<00:01:57.910> our

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
but I still feel like we've got our

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.360 
but I still feel like we've got our
priorities<00:01:58.240> straight<00:01:58.540> and<00:01:59.170> we're<00:01:59.950> making<00:02:00.220> the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
priorities straight and we're making the

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.570 
priorities straight and we're making the
best<00:02:00.550> bread<00:02:00.850> we<00:02:01.300> can
