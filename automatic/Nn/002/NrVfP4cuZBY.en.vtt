will<00:02:43.170> come<00:02:43.379> up<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.769> then<00:02:44.219> I<00:02:44.280> just<00:02:44.489> attach<00:02:44.760> my

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
will come up and then I just attach my

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.259 
will come up and then I just attach my
fuel<00:02:45.299> pump<00:02:45.569> line<00:02:45.870> right<00:02:46.469> here<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.799> this<00:02:47.269> the

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
fuel pump line right here to this the

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.539 
fuel pump line right here to this the
fuel<00:02:48.480> filter<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.079> then<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.769> can<00:02:49.980> then<00:02:50.159> attach

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
fuel filter and then I can then attach

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.479 
fuel filter and then I can then attach
the<00:02:50.730> other<00:02:50.760> line<00:02:51.090> into<00:02:51.719> the<00:02:52.250> filter<00:02:53.250> on<00:02:53.370> this

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
the other line into the filter on this

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:54.890 
the other line into the filter on this
one<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:53.849> we're<00:02:53.969> getting<00:02:54.090> double<00:02:54.359> filtered

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
one so we're getting double filtered

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.780 
one so we're getting double filtered
while<00:02:55.109> we<00:02:55.260> why<00:02:55.590> we<00:02:55.739> extract<00:02:56.099> the<00:02:56.310> fuel<00:02:56.489> and

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
while we why we extract the fuel and

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.879 
while we why we extract the fuel and
then<00:02:57.419> the<00:02:57.510> same<00:02:57.689> thing<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.109> fill<00:02:58.319> it<00:02:58.439> up

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
then the same thing to fill it up

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.920 
then the same thing to fill it up
all's<00:02:59.250> we'll<00:02:59.489> do<00:02:59.639> is<00:02:59.790> we'll<00:02:59.969> we'll<00:03:00.480> unclamp

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
all's we'll do is we'll we'll unclamp

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.959 
all's we'll do is we'll we'll unclamp
well<00:03:01.169> clamp<00:03:01.349> the<00:03:01.530> line<00:03:01.680> off<00:03:01.829> first<00:03:02.159> plug<00:03:02.699> in

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:02.969 
well clamp the line off first plug in

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:05.750 
well clamp the line off first plug in
and<00:03:03.209> then<00:03:03.750> we'll<00:03:04.379> unclamp<00:03:04.829> the<00:03:04.919> line<00:03:05.189> insert

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
and then we'll unclamp the line insert

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.670 
and then we'll unclamp the line insert
it<00:03:05.879> into<00:03:06.000> our<00:03:06.239> jug<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.750> preload<00:03:07.049> all<00:03:07.439> of<00:03:07.590> the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
it into our jug and preload all of the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.860 
it into our jug and preload all of the
tanks<00:03:08.129> so<00:03:08.879> I<00:03:09.239> thought<00:03:09.389> this<00:03:09.480> was<00:03:09.599> a<00:03:09.659> pretty

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
tanks so I thought this was a pretty

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.589 
tanks so I thought this was a pretty
good<00:03:10.049> little<00:03:10.290> idea<00:03:10.620> guys<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:12.209> reason<00:03:12.329> why<00:03:12.480> I'm

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
good little idea guys the reason why I'm

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.270 
good little idea guys the reason why I'm
posting<00:03:12.930> this<00:03:13.019> video<00:03:13.199> is<00:03:13.409> because<00:03:13.859> if<00:03:13.980> any<00:03:14.129> of
