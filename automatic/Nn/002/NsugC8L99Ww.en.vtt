acidic<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:55.490> balance<00:01:55.820> that<00:01:56.000> out<00:01:56.060> we<00:01:56.719> have<00:01:56.810> some

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
acidic to balance that out we have some

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.139 
acidic to balance that out we have some
raw<00:01:57.229> shaved<00:01:57.649> cauliflower<00:01:57.920> gives<00:01:58.579> a<00:01:58.670> different

raw shaved cauliflower gives a different

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:00.940 
raw shaved cauliflower gives a different
texture<00:01:59.509> and<00:02:00.020> a<00:02:00.380> little<00:02:00.560> bit<00:02:00.649> of<00:02:00.710> bitterness

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
texture and a little bit of bitterness

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.440 
texture and a little bit of bitterness
as<00:02:01.219> well<00:02:01.369> which<00:02:01.670> counteracts<00:02:02.179> all<00:02:02.329> that

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
as well which counteracts all that

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.330 
as well which counteracts all that
acidity<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.079> sweetness<00:02:03.469> you<00:02:03.530> know<00:02:03.799> think

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
acidity and the sweetness you know think

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.039 
acidity and the sweetness you know think
about<00:02:04.399> all<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.700> palate<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:05.450> then<00:02:05.600> finally

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
about all the palate and then finally

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.230 
about all the palate and then finally
for<00:02:06.229> like<00:02:06.380> a<00:02:06.409> zesty<00:02:07.219> zing<00:02:07.520> we<00:02:07.880> put<00:02:07.999> a<00:02:08.060> bit

for like a zesty zing we put a bit

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.229 
for like a zesty zing we put a bit
coriander<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.750> finish

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.709 

okay<00:02:12.659> so<00:02:12.719> typical<00:02:13.409> main<00:02:14.129> course<00:02:14.430> down<00:02:14.909> here<00:02:14.939> a

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:26.969 
talking about it we thought could be mu

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.179 
talking about it we thought could be mu
like<00:02:27.120> pork<00:02:27.510> space<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.140> cubes<00:02:28.469> but<00:02:28.560> with<00:02:28.709> lamb

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
like pork space the cubes but with lamb

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:30.979 
like pork space the cubes but with lamb
it's<00:02:29.819> a<00:02:29.849> bit<00:02:30.120> of<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.209> mock<00:02:30.329> about<00:02:30.450> were<00:02:30.750> they<00:02:30.870> and

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
it's a bit of a mock about were they and

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.240 
it's a bit of a mock about were they and
we<00:02:31.079> did<00:02:31.260> because<00:02:31.469> some<00:02:31.620> mountain<00:02:31.859> bellick's<00:02:32.129> a

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
we did because some mountain bellick's a

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.440 
we did because some mountain bellick's a
bit<00:02:32.370> bigger<00:02:33.859> marinade<00:02:34.859> it<00:02:35.060> braised<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.239> down

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
little bone sticking on the end and then

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.970 
little bone sticking on the end and then
we<00:02:42.629> char<00:02:43.079> grilled<00:02:43.319> it<00:02:43.439> to<00:02:43.530> give<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.739> that<00:02:43.769> sort

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
barbecue sauce we had this barbecue lamb

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.589 
barbecue sauce we had this barbecue lamb
we<00:02:47.489> thought<00:02:47.760> brilliant<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.150> we<00:02:48.209> built<00:02:48.389> a<00:02:48.450> dish

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
we thought brilliant and we built a dish

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.750 
we thought brilliant and we built a dish
around<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.650> comes<00:02:49.859> with<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.370> rump<00:02:50.669> a

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
around that and it comes with a rump a

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.949 
around that and it comes with a rump a
lamb<00:02:50.989> and<00:02:51.989> then<00:02:52.290> some<00:02:52.620> deep-fried<00:02:53.959> croquettes

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
lamb and then some deep-fried croquettes

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.539 
lamb and then some deep-fried croquettes
of<00:02:55.109> shoulder<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.680> potato<00:02:56.189> and<00:02:56.400> braised

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
of shoulder a potato and braised

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:57.770 
of shoulder a potato and braised
shoulder<00:02:56.879> and<00:02:56.969> so<00:02:57.120> it<00:02:57.209> gives<00:02:57.389> it<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.540> bit<00:02:57.659> of<00:02:57.689> a

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
shoulder and so it gives it a bit of a

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.770 
shoulder and so it gives it a bit of a
punch<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.349> some<00:02:58.439> texture<00:02:58.889> with<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.069> crisp<00:02:59.280> eNOS

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
punch and some texture with a crisp eNOS

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.179 
punch and some texture with a crisp eNOS
and<00:03:00.780> then<00:03:00.930> for<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.319> garnish<00:03:01.680> is<00:03:01.859> sort<00:03:02.069> of<00:03:02.099> a
