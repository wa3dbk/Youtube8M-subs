00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
manufacturer's video because they

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.960

the<00:00:34.230> cave<00:00:34.820> anyway<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.969> reason<00:00:36.210> why<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.329> think

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
the cave anyway the reason why I think

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.470 
the cave anyway the reason why I think
this<00:00:36.719> suits<00:00:36.989> pretty<00:00:37.140> cool<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.850> it's<00:00:38.850> got<00:00:39.210> this

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.150 
the seals actually protected on the
wrists<00:02:04.409> by<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> bit<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:05.009> cuff<00:02:05.640> here<00:02:06.060> and

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
wrists by a bit of a cuff here and

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.880 
wrists by a bit of a cuff here and
inside<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.729> can<00:02:08.910> see<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.869> seal<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.440> not

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
inside you can see that the seal is not

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.040 
inside you can see that the seal is not
traditional<00:02:11.879> latex<00:02:12.330> it's<00:02:12.720> silicone

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
traditional latex it's silicone

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.490 
traditional latex it's silicone
so<00:02:14.140> see<00:02:14.680> how<00:02:14.740> stretchy<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.550> is<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.990> seems

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
so see how stretchy it is and it seems

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.240 
so see how stretchy it is and it seems
to<00:02:17.650> be<00:02:17.800> quite<00:02:18.250> durable<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:19.680> like<00:02:20.680> it<00:02:20.890> because<00:02:21.040> a

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
to be quite durable I like it because a

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.030 
to be quite durable I like it because a
lot<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.520> my<00:02:21.700> latex<00:02:22.120> seals<00:02:22.480> dry<00:02:23.020> rot<00:02:23.380> in<00:02:23.560> Florida

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
lot of my latex seals dry rot in Florida

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.070 
lot of my latex seals dry rot in Florida
and<00:02:24.130> I<00:02:24.190> replace<00:02:24.580> them<00:02:24.850> all<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.150> time<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.990> they

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
and I replace them all the time and they

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.380 
and I replace them all the time and they
tear<00:02:26.440> very<00:02:26.680> easily<00:02:27.010> this<00:02:27.520> I<00:02:27.730> think<00:02:28.060> is<00:02:28.180> going

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
tear very easily this I think is going

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.690 
tear very easily this I think is going
to<00:02:28.510> be<00:02:28.600> a<00:02:28.630> lot<00:02:28.840> better<00:02:29.080> but<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.190> cool<00:02:30.370> thing<00:02:30.400> is

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
to be a lot better but the cool thing is

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.100 
to be a lot better but the cool thing is
it's<00:02:30.880> also<00:02:31.030> put<00:02:31.300> in<00:02:31.390> place<00:02:31.600> with<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.780> ring

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
it's also put in place with a ring

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.920 
it's also put in place with a ring
system<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:32.950> if<00:02:33.160> I<00:02:33.400> did<00:02:33.700> cut<00:02:34.210> one<00:02:34.420> tear<00:02:34.720> one

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
system so if I did cut one tear one

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.830 
system so if I did cut one tear one
damaged<00:02:35.380> one<00:02:35.620> somehow<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.550> could<00:02:37.090> very<00:02:37.300> quickly

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
damaged one somehow I could very quickly

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.840 
damaged one somehow I could very quickly
at<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:39.040> site<00:02:39.370> replace<00:02:40.330> it<00:02:40.660> with<00:02:40.960> a<00:02:40.990> fresh<00:02:41.110> seal

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
at the site replace it with a fresh seal

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.320 
at the site replace it with a fresh seal
the<00:02:42.850> ring<00:02:43.090> system<00:02:43.420> is<00:02:44.640> lower<00:02:45.640> profile<00:02:46.300> than

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
the ring system is lower profile than

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.960 
the ring system is lower profile than
ones<00:02:46.990> that<00:02:47.140> I've<00:02:47.260> used<00:02:47.290> before<00:02:47.770> it's<00:02:48.670> actually

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
ones that I've used before it's actually

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.770 
ones that I've used before it's actually
on<00:02:49.480> an<00:02:49.780> oval<00:02:50.350> rather<00:02:51.310> than<00:02:51.550> a<00:02:51.640> circle<00:02:52.270> so<00:02:52.600> the

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
on an oval rather than a circle so the

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.440 
on an oval rather than a circle so the
profile<00:02:53.230> is<00:02:53.380> much<00:02:53.560> smaller<00:02:54.010> so<00:02:54.700> since<00:02:55.180> it's<00:02:55.330> an

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
profile is much smaller so since it's an

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.260 
profile is much smaller so since it's an
oval<00:02:55.840> you<00:02:56.020> can<00:02:56.170> just<00:02:56.320> slide<00:02:56.770> your<00:02:56.800> hand<00:02:57.520> right

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
oval you can just slide your hand right

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.910 
oval you can just slide your hand right
in<00:02:58.470> easily<00:02:59.470> and<00:02:59.710> again<00:03:00.610> smaller<00:03:01.030> profile<00:03:01.920> the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
in easily and again smaller profile the

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.380 
in easily and again smaller profile the
next<00:03:03.580> field<00:03:03.760> is<00:03:03.910> also<00:03:05.940> silicone<00:03:06.940> as<00:03:07.090> opposed

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
next field is also silicone as opposed

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.020 
next field is also silicone as opposed
to<00:03:07.480> latex<00:03:07.960> and<00:03:08.320> it's<00:03:09.040> also<00:03:09.220> got<00:03:09.730> an<00:03:09.970> insulating

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
to latex and it's also got an insulating

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.430 
to latex and it's also got an insulating
cover<00:03:13.030> around<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.600> you<00:03:13.720> can<00:03:13.900> see<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.260> ring

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
cover around it you can see the ring

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.640 
cover around it you can see the ring
system<00:03:14.860> in<00:03:14.950> there<00:03:15.130> Wow<00:03:15.310> you<00:03:15.490> can<00:03:15.640> see<00:03:15.760> a<00:03:15.790> lot<00:03:16.000> of

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
system in there Wow you can see a lot of

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.770 
system in there Wow you can see a lot of
see<00:03:17.650> a<00:03:17.680> lot<00:03:17.830> of<00:03:17.860> silt<00:03:18.190> in<00:03:18.340> there<00:03:18.489> as<00:03:18.850> well

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
see a lot of silt in there as well

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.010 
see a lot of silt in there as well
I<00:03:19.810> had<00:03:20.230> kind<00:03:20.380> of<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.560> grimy<00:03:20.800> dive<00:03:21.100> yesterday

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
I had kind of a grimy dive yesterday

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.370 
I had kind of a grimy dive yesterday
anyway<00:03:23.850> so<00:03:24.850> far<00:03:25.090> so<00:03:25.330> good<00:03:25.360> I'm<00:03:25.840> really<00:03:26.170> liking

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
the suit I've got about 50 hours I think

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.810 
the suit I've got about 50 hours I think
it's<00:03:29.170> going<00:03:29.320> to<00:03:29.350> hold<00:03:29.560> up<00:03:29.800> well<00:03:30.070> for<00:03:30.489> cave

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
it's going to hold up well for cave

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:43.110 
it's going to hold up well for cave
diving<00:03:31.080> so<00:03:32.080> I'd<00:03:32.380> give<00:03:32.530> it<00:03:32.620> a<00:03:32.680> big<00:03:32.890> thumbs<00:03:33.190> up
