00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.074
Good evening and welcome to the new episode
of “Around the World on a Vespa”.

00:00:19.082 --> 00:00:22.062
I know you haven't heard from me for about
3 months now...

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:26.397
...and I haven't realized how quickly the time passed.

00:00:26.398 --> 00:00:30.983
I'm in Buenos Aires, Argentina and I spent some time trying to...

00:00:31.068 --> 00:00:37.071
...reorganize things and take a break from the routine
of the journey....

00:00:37.132 --> 00:00:43.576
Yes, it is a kind of routine to me now (sometimes).

00:00:43.661 --> 00:00:48.289
I tried to find a job here with the hope of giving a boost...

00:00:48.374 --> 00:00:54.417
...to my budget but unfortunately I didn't make it,
same as in South Africa.

00:00:54.418 --> 00:00:58.440
So I'm thinking to continue with the journey in South America.
“What's written here?!”

00:00:58.445 --> 00:01:01.147
- What's written here?! -

00:01:01.331 --> 00:01:04.257
The other new is that I won't be traveling alone anymore.

00:01:04.341 --> 00:01:08.368
This is a big new: I will continue together with Alexandra...

00:01:08.452 --> 00:01:13.120
the girl I had met in Africa - you can read the story about
South Africa and Lesotho in the blog

00:01:13.204 --> 00:01:20.055
It is going to be a big challenge for the vespa and for me also...

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:30.390
We had to take the vespa for a service as it has already
150,000km on the clock from the time I bought it.

00:01:30.391 --> 00:01:39.684
I've never done any serious service to my vespa,
so maybe it's time for it.

00:01:39.768 --> 00:01:47.520
We had also noticed a problem when we were both on the
vespa with all our luggage in South Africa and Lesotho.

00:01:47.604 --> 00:01:55.031
The shock absorber was “scratching” the rear wheel,
so we had to check that, at least.

00:01:55.109 --> 00:02:00.402
Another thing was that the engine would start only

00:02:00.404 --> 00:02:14.321
after the 20th kick-start, so we had to check the carburetor.

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.657
After a little chat with the members of the
“Vespa Club Buenos Aires”

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.584
we went to a place they suggested us, the “Motonetas Clasicas Arg.”.
23
00:02:22,668 --&gt; 00:01:27,420
The guys there were really nice.

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:38.189
There is grass in the piston!

00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:49.007
The vespa can work with grass, too.

00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:54.219
We never put a hand in a vespa that is still working.

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:21.048
We went there last Friday and we stayed from morning till the evening.

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:28.185
We started from the shock absorber which
had the shape of an “S” as you can see.

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:35.103
Probably that happened somewhere in Lesotho.

00:04:12.504 --> 00:04:27.188
We replaced the shock absorber, we bought a pair of new tires
and we decided to take a deeper look at the vespa.

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:33.399
Unfortunately we found some problems there.

00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:40.361
There is a problem here and...what are these signs...

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:43.572
“What is it?”

00:04:43.573 --> 00:04:47.117
“You're against the light and you're shining!”

00:04:47.168 --> 00:04:58.448
The mechanic took out the clutch and saw that a rivet is broken

00:04:58.496 --> 00:05:08.376
and it's dangerous because the engine may suddenly stop.

00:05:08.456 --> 00:05:15.056
So for the first time after 12 years
the engine will be opened.

00:05:15.085 --> 00:05:24.046
It is a precaution if we want to get back
to Greece on the vespa safe!

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:30.548
So, the engine was opened.

00:05:30.549 --> 00:05:38.007
We replaced some bearings, some gears,
some parts of the engine.

00:05:38.052 --> 00:05:47.804
I have uploaded pictures with details on what we did
and all the spare parts we replaced.

00:05:47.888 --> 00:05:58.001
If you consider that the vespa had already
150,000 kms and it was the first time

00:05:58.015 --> 00:06:01.642
the engine was opened
- and from these 150,000kms,

00:06:01.644 --> 00:06:05.061
the 32,000 done in African soil,
and the rest of them done

00:06:05.064 --> 00:06:08.045
with some bad influence - 
you can tell that it's not bad at all!

00:06:08.048 --> 00:06:13.108
After 150,000kms the engine should be opened
even in cars or motorcycles more expensive than mine.

00:06:13.193 --> 00:06:16.693
I had bought the vespa second hand at 1,500EUR

00:06:16.694 --> 00:06:19.656
just to use it to go to work and back home.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.340
And we found the opportunity to replace everything

00:07:02.408 --> 00:07:08.410
which was worn out (cruciform, rear wheel bearing, gaskets, seals etc)

00:07:08.412 --> 00:07:14.246
After all these, we unfortunately had to pay about 500EUR

00:07:14.247 --> 00:07:20.832
(with the new tires, the new shock absorber and the work hours included)

00:07:20.916 --> 00:07:24.250
And if you add the coffees and the petrol to go

00:07:24.251 --> 00:07:28.611
 to the garage and from there back home, too.

00:07:28.612 --> 00:07:31.171
That's why today I'm dressed in black wearing these black glasses.

00:07:31.172 --> 00:07:33.474
I'm mourning the loss of such a big amount of money.

00:07:33.475 --> 00:07:35.493
From now on and for 1-2 more years we'll be

00:07:35.494 --> 00:07:37.453
on a diet eating cheap food.

00:07:37.454 --> 00:07:39.619
Only lentils. - Don't you agree, Alexandra?!

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.684
Let's hope that the vespa will continue for at least 150,000kms

00:07:43.685 --> 00:07:50.164
without any problems and that the next time
that the engine will have to be opened,

00:07:50.165 --> 00:07:57.520
will be in 15 years from now, somewhere in China.
See you!
