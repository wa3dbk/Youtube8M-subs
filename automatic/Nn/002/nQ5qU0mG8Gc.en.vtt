the motor but it's the non-turbo of
course<00:00:16.940> and<00:00:20.119> there's<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.210> lot<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.539> work

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:23.769 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.849 

it's<00:00:24.580> a<00:00:24.820> fuel<00:00:25.630> pressure<00:00:25.779> regulator<00:00:26.169> it's

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:26.859 
it's a fuel pressure regulator it's

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.859 
it's a fuel pressure regulator it's
broken<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.840> broke<00:00:29.169> inside<00:00:29.589> there<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.660> you

broken and broke inside there and you

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.740 
broken and broke inside there and you
can't<00:00:32.079> just<00:00:32.320> change<00:00:32.829> that<00:00:33.100> piece<00:00:33.600> unless<00:00:34.600> I

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
can't just change that piece unless I

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.310 
can't just change that piece unless I
find<00:00:34.930> that<00:00:35.050> the<00:00:35.199> junkyard<00:00:35.969> but<00:00:36.989> they<00:00:37.989> sell<00:00:38.199> the

whole regulator itself and has the stock

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.020 
whole regulator itself and has the stock
in<00:00:49.180> your<00:00:49.329> filter<00:00:49.739> which<00:00:50.739> I<00:00:50.920> haven't<00:00:51.190> put<00:00:51.430> any<00:00:51.610> K

those nice filters has nowhere right now

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.150 
those nice filters has nowhere right now
because<00:01:00.789> it<00:01:01.059> has<00:01:01.179> a<00:01:01.210> leak<00:01:01.800> which<00:01:02.800> I<00:01:02.920> need<00:01:03.070> to

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
because it has a leak which I need to

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.969 
because it has a leak which I need to
find<00:01:03.460> it<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:07.229> since<00:01:08.229> I<00:01:08.380> don't<00:01:08.560> see<00:01:08.710> anything

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
find it and since I don't see anything

find it and since I don't see anything
dripping<00:01:09.490> on<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.640> floor<00:01:09.759> it<00:01:10.179> has<00:01:10.390> to<00:01:10.570> be<00:01:10.690> one

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:10.929 
dripping on the floor it has to be one

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:14.310 
dripping on the floor it has to be one
of<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.140> hoses<00:01:12.039> back<00:01:12.220> there

of the hoses back there

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.490 
of the hoses back there
they're<00:01:15.929> almost<00:01:16.929> tricky<00:01:17.470> hoses<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:20.229> it<00:01:20.350> has<00:01:20.470> a

they're almost tricky hoses but it has a

battery bought at Costco for I think it

was<00:01:54.490> my<00:01:54.729> brother's<00:01:55.390> vehicle<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.920> he<00:01:57.430> let<00:01:57.579> me

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
was my brother's vehicle and he let me

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.050 
was my brother's vehicle and he let me
have<00:01:57.880> it

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
have it

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.620 
have it
I<00:01:58.979> just<00:01:59.979> had<00:02:00.130> to<00:02:00.250> pick<00:02:00.969> it<00:02:01.030> up<00:02:01.180> from<00:02:01.390> Washington

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
I just had to pick it up from Washington

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.940 
I just had to pick it up from Washington
DC<00:02:02.049> and<00:02:02.469> bring<00:02:02.710> it<00:02:04.140> down<00:02:05.140> here<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.409> North

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
DC and bring it down here to North

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.300 
DC and bring it down here to North
Carroll<00:02:06.280> a<00:02:06.369> key<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:09.700> AC<00:02:09.940> doesn't<00:02:10.450> work

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
Carroll a key and the AC doesn't work

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.710 
Carroll a key and the AC doesn't work
inside<00:02:12.310> at<00:02:12.850> least<00:02:13.500> but<00:02:14.500> I<00:02:14.730> think<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:15.820> needs<00:02:16.000> to

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
inside at least but I think it needs to

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.780 
inside at least but I think it needs to
be<00:02:16.840> recharged<00:02:17.410> I<00:02:17.730> set<00:02:18.730> this<00:02:18.930> r12<00:02:20.489> it's<00:02:21.489> hard<00:02:21.670> to

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
be recharged I set this r12 it's hard to

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.930 
be recharged I set this r12 it's hard to
find<00:02:21.970> that<00:02:22.090> stuff<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:24.220> I'll<00:02:24.400> see<00:02:24.579> if<00:02:24.609> I<00:02:24.760> can

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
find that stuff so I'll see if I can

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.250 
find that stuff so I'll see if I can
convert<00:02:25.269> it<00:02:25.420> later<00:02:25.600> on<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:26.250> r134a

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
convert it later on to r134a

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.420 

but<00:02:30.260> it<00:02:30.410> works<00:02:30.650> for<00:02:31.280> right<00:02:31.430> now<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.830> starter

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
but it works for right now the starter

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.910 
but it works for right now the starter
is<00:02:34.640> out<00:02:34.910> so<00:02:35.330> I<00:02:35.360> can't<00:02:35.690> crank<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:36.140> but<00:02:36.620> I'll<00:02:36.739> do

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
is out so I can't crank it but I'll do

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.880 
is out so I can't crank it but I'll do
that<00:02:36.950> later<00:02:37.250> I'll<00:02:37.700> put<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.120> starter<00:02:38.629> in

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
that later I'll put the starter in

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.720 
that later I'll put the starter in
cranking<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.010> make<00:02:40.250> a<00:02:40.280> video<00:02:40.610> of<00:02:40.640> how<00:02:41.200> it<00:02:42.200> runs

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
cranking and make a video of how it runs

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.119 
cranking and make a video of how it runs
if<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:43.879> could<00:02:44.060> make<00:02:44.239> it<00:02:44.360> run<00:02:44.569> without<00:02:44.750> this<00:02:45.140> with

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
if I could make it run without this with

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:52.059 
if I could make it run without this with
this<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:47.349> have<00:02:48.349> to<00:02:48.470> tape<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:50.650> but<00:02:51.650> yeah<00:02:51.799> this<00:02:51.920> is

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
this I have to tape it but yeah this is

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.670 
this I have to tape it but yeah this is
my<00:02:52.220> project<00:02:52.430> car<00:02:53.230> let's<00:02:54.230> see<00:02:54.349> if<00:02:54.410> you<00:02:54.530> guys

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
my project car let's see if you guys

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.280 
my project car let's see if you guys
could<00:02:54.860> give<00:02:54.980> me<00:02:55.040> a<00:02:55.160> few<00:02:55.459> ideas<00:02:55.900> see<00:02:56.900> what<00:02:57.080> to<00:02:57.170> do

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
could give me a few ideas see what to do

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.880 
could give me a few ideas see what to do
with<00:02:57.470> it

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
with it

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.830 
with it
it's<00:02:58.670> has<00:02:58.849> duct<00:02:59.120> tape<00:02:59.360> I<00:02:59.860> want<00:03:00.860> to<00:03:00.950> change<00:03:01.099> that

it's has duct tape I want to change that

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.180 
it's has duct tape I want to change that
because<00:03:02.840> it<00:03:03.019> shouldn't<00:03:03.230> be<00:03:03.410> any<00:03:03.560> duct<00:03:03.799> tape<00:03:04.040> in

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
because it shouldn't be any duct tape in

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.430 
because it shouldn't be any duct tape in
