my MA

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.300

told me to throw the vacuum cleaner out

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.880 
told me to throw the vacuum cleaner out
when<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.820> was<00:00:29.849> not<00:00:30.090> even<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.420> year<00:00:30.599> old<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.230> I

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
when it was not even a year old and I

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.889 
when it was not even a year old and I
just<00:00:31.920> kept<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.460> around<00:00:32.730> just<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.239> case<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.450> found

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
just kept it around just in case I found

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.650 
just kept it around just in case I found
a<00:00:34.260> spare<00:00:35.010> vacuum<00:00:35.399> cleaner<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.969> garbage<00:00:36.420> to

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
a spare vacuum cleaner in the garbage to

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.510 
a spare vacuum cleaner in the garbage to
use<00:00:36.780> for<00:00:36.989> parts<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.559> that's<00:00:37.649> what<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.890> did<00:00:38.219> find

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
use for parts and that's what I did find

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.450 
use for parts and that's what I did find
later<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.719> found<00:00:40.320> another<00:00:40.739> vacuum<00:00:41.040> cleaner

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
later I found another vacuum cleaner

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.160 
later I found another vacuum cleaner
just<00:00:41.730> like<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> garbage<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.660> had<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
just like it in the garbage that had the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.400 
just like it in the garbage that had the
exact<00:00:43.500> same<00:00:43.530> base<00:00:44.690> which<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.840> installed<00:00:46.260> on

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
exact same base which I installed on

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.880 
exact same base which I installed on
this<00:00:46.530> vacuum<00:00:46.770> cleaner<00:00:48.079> that<00:00:49.079> based<00:00:49.410> who<00:00:49.710> had

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
this vacuum cleaner that based who had

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.130 
this vacuum cleaner that based who had
problems<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.969> height<00:00:51.180> adjuster<00:00:51.690> one<00:00:51.899> date

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
problems the height adjuster one date

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.100 
problems the height adjuster one date
just<00:00:52.379> fell<00:00:52.890> apart<00:00:53.010> all<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.149> pieces<00:00:54.539> just<00:00:54.570> drug

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
just fell apart all the pieces just drug

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.299 
just fell apart all the pieces just drug
over<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.500> carpet<00:00:57.020> then<00:00:58.020> later<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.980> found

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
over the carpet then later on I found

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.160 
over the carpet then later on I found
another<00:00:59.879> Bissell<00:01:00.449> clean<00:01:00.719> view<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
another Bissell clean view in the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.490 
another Bissell clean view in the
garbage<00:01:01.620> which<00:01:02.219> was<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> powertrack<00:01:03.149> model<00:01:03.629> it

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
garbage which was a powertrack model it

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.190 
garbage which was a powertrack model it
had<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> exact<00:01:05.129> same<00:01:05.220> motor<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.900> had<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
had the exact same motor and it had the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.560 
had the exact same motor and it had the
exact<00:01:07.500> same<00:01:07.530> motor<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.220> handle<00:01:08.490> assembly<00:01:08.790> but

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
exact same motor and handle assembly but

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.719 
exact same motor and handle assembly but
the<00:01:09.689> base<00:01:09.900> was<00:01:10.170> different

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
the base was different

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.030 
the base was different
I<00:01:11.760> took<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.630> base<00:01:12.840> off<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.439> one<00:01:13.650> even

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
I took the base off of that one even

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.859 
I took the base off of that one even
though<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.340> vacuum<00:01:14.670> cleaner<00:01:14.909> still<00:01:15.240> ran<00:01:15.540> it

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
though the vacuum cleaner still ran it

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.210 
though the vacuum cleaner still ran it
just<00:01:16.470> stunk<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.250> was<00:01:17.430> pretty<00:01:17.670> dirty<00:01:19.220> it

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
just stunk and it was pretty dirty it

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.950 
just stunk and it was pretty dirty it
just<00:01:20.490> wasn't<00:01:20.850> worth<00:01:20.970> fixing<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.630> took<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
just wasn't worth fixing so I took the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.200 
just wasn't worth fixing so I took the
base<00:01:22.140> off<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.680> one<00:01:22.890> scrubbed<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
base off of that one scrubbed it in the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.539 
base off of that one scrubbed it in the
washtub<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.900> basement<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.590> installed<00:01:26.400> it

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
washtub in the basement and installed it

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.010 
washtub in the basement and installed it
on<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.850> vacuum<00:01:27.270> cleaner<00:01:27.509> since<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
on this vacuum cleaner since the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
on this vacuum cleaner since the
original<00:01:28.229> pieces<00:01:28.790> were<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:30.299> junk<00:01:31.040> this

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
original pieces were just junk this

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.760 
original pieces were just junk this
space<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.820> more<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.450> higher-end<00:01:33.689> base<00:01:34.200> since

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
space is more of a higher-end base since

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.580 
space is more of a higher-end base since
it's<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.130> powertrack<00:01:35.729> base<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:37.290> has<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
it's the powertrack base it's it has the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.770 
it's the powertrack base it's it has the
wider<00:01:37.829> brush<00:01:39.590> yes<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:42.180> vacuum<00:01:42.540> cleaner

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
wider brush yes and the vacuum cleaner

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.600 
wider brush yes and the vacuum cleaner
works<00:01:43.049> great<00:01:43.380> even<00:01:43.409> though<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.890> colors<00:01:44.430> don't

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
works great even though the colors don't

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.960 
works great even though the colors don't
match<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.630> yes<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.799> mean<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.399> power<00:01:47.640> track

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
match and yes I mean the power track

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.899 
match and yes I mean the power track
vacuum<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.990> had<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.439> exact<00:01:49.829> same<00:01:49.920> handle<00:01:50.759> and

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
vacuum it had the exact same handle and

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.679 
vacuum it had the exact same handle and
motor<00:01:51.119> assembly<00:01:51.560> but<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> different<00:01:53.009> base<00:01:53.689> the

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
motor assembly but a different base the

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.300 
motor assembly but a different base the
vacuum<00:01:55.020> cleaner<00:01:55.259> was<00:01:55.439> basically<00:01:55.920> just<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
vacuum cleaner was basically just the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.109 
vacuum cleaner was basically just the
same<00:01:56.520> as<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.850> one

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
same as this one

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.139 
same as this one
the<00:01:57.930> original<00:01:58.290> clean<00:01:58.530> view<00:01:58.770> but<00:01:59.130> Mike<00:01:59.399> but<00:01:59.969> my

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
the original clean view but Mike but my

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.630 
the original clean view but Mike but my
original<00:02:00.299> clean<00:02:00.810> view<00:02:01.020> had<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.399> square<00:02:02.399> base

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
original clean view had a square base

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.020 
original clean view had a square base
just<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.299> basic<00:02:03.659> base<00:02:03.869> which<00:02:04.229> was<00:02:04.439> junk<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.100> I

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
just a basic base which was junk and I

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.240 
just a basic base which was junk and I
replaced<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.689> problematic<00:02:07.290> base<00:02:07.619> with<00:02:08.039> this

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
replaced that problematic base with this

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.520 
replaced that problematic base with this
one<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.819> power<00:02:09.030> track<00:02:09.330> base<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:09.959> holds<00:02:10.379> up

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
one the power track base and it holds up

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.440 
one the power track base and it holds up
pretty<00:02:10.770> good<00:02:10.979> like<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.790> said<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.120> vacuum

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
pretty good like I said the vacuum

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.670 
pretty good like I said the vacuum
cleaner<00:02:12.660> works<00:02:12.900> pretty<00:02:13.080> good

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
cleaner works pretty good

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.259 
cleaner works pretty good
and<00:02:13.769> that<00:02:14.370> concludes<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:14.969> video<00:02:15.329> by<00:02:17.060> here<00:02:18.060> is

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
and that concludes this video by here is

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.300 
and that concludes this video by here is
what<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.689> original<00:02:19.200> base<00:02:19.439> looked<00:02:19.859> like<00:02:20.069> from

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
what the original base looked like from

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.770 
what the original base looked like from
that<00:02:20.489> Bissell<00:02:20.849> clean<00:02:21.120> view<00:02:21.269> I<00:02:21.390> just<00:02:21.420> showed

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
that Bissell clean view I just showed

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.170 
that Bissell clean view I just showed
you<00:02:21.810> in<00:02:22.079> the<00:02:22.170> video<00:02:22.280> like<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.430> said<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.819> was<00:02:23.939> just

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
you in the video like I said it was just

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.050 
you in the video like I said it was just
a<00:02:24.299> square<00:02:24.829> ordinary<00:02:25.829> basic<00:02:26.340> vase<00:02:26.549> like<00:02:26.879> this

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
a square ordinary basic vase like this

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.470 
a square ordinary basic vase like this
one<00:02:27.299> it<00:02:28.200> wasn't<00:02:28.379> a<00:02:28.620> powertrack<00:02:29.250> base<00:02:29.549> this<00:02:30.269> is

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
one it wasn't a powertrack base this is

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.289 
one it wasn't a powertrack base this is
just<00:02:30.719> a<00:02:30.840> short<00:02:31.109> brush<00:02:31.319> version<00:02:31.939> not<00:02:32.939> the<00:02:32.969> wide

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
just a short brush version not the wide

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.559 
just a short brush version not the wide
powertrack<00:02:33.930> base<00:02:34.519> these<00:02:35.519> bases<00:02:36.030> are<00:02:36.150> chunked

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
powertrack base these bases are chunked

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.750 
powertrack base these bases are chunked
they<00:02:36.659> break<00:02:36.930> all<00:02:37.109> the<00:02:37.230> time<00:02:37.439> even<00:02:38.250> though<00:02:38.459> the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
they break all the time even though the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.410 
they break all the time even though the
bases<00:02:39.120> are<00:02:39.269> different<00:02:39.689> on<00:02:39.840> both<00:02:40.409> clean<00:02:40.799> views

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
bases are different on both clean views

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.970 
bases are different on both clean views
the<00:02:42.420> border<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:42.900> handle<00:02:43.200> assemblies<00:02:43.680> are<00:02:43.829> the

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
the border and handle assemblies are the

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.159 
the border and handle assemblies are the
same<00:02:44.189> so<00:02:44.519> they're<00:02:44.670> interchangeable<00:02:45.019> with<00:02:46.019> any

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:46.169 
same so they're interchangeable with any

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.490 
same so they're interchangeable with any
base<00:02:46.909> that<00:02:47.909> uses<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.359> same<00:02:48.569> motor<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.169> handle

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
base that uses the same motor and handle

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.740 
base that uses the same motor and handle
assembly<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.189> that<00:02:50.450> concludes<00:02:51.450> this<00:02:51.569> video

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
assembly and that concludes this video

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.230 
assembly and that concludes this video
