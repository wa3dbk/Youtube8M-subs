start and I've generally think I've i
found<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.309> way<00:00:32.520> as<00:00:32.669> well<00:00:32.700> as<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> bajillion

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
other people so basically the way I do

other people so basically the way I do
it<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.820> like<00:00:36.059> before<00:00:36.300> round<00:00:36.690> two<00:00:36.750> before<00:00:37.260> round
