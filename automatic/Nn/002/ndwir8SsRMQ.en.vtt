00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.340 
be like a player part they're not sure
exactly<00:01:41.460> if<00:01:42.119> all<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.360> years<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.689> outs<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:43.110> how

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
exactly if all the years and outs on how

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.530 
exactly if all the years and outs on how
that<00:01:43.409> would<00:01:43.710> exactly<00:01:44.220> work<00:01:44.579> but<00:01:45.180> for<00:01:45.390> years

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
that would exactly work but for years

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.450 
that would exactly work but for years
now<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.020> cage<00:01:46.229> matches<00:01:46.530> we've<00:01:47.070> really<00:01:47.280> been

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
now in cage matches we've really been

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.819 
now in cage matches we've really been
able<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.729> do<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.000> crossbody<00:01:48.450> off<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.810> cage<00:01:49.049> so

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
able to do the crossbody off the cage so

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.429 
able to do the crossbody off the cage so
I<00:01:49.890> think<00:01:50.159> added<00:01:50.579> more<00:01:50.790> moves<00:01:51.060> such<00:01:51.869> as<00:01:52.049> maybe<00:01:52.259> a

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
I think added more moves such as maybe a

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.410 
I think added more moves such as maybe a
moonsault<00:01:52.680> off<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.250> top<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.579> cage<00:01:53.820> would

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
moonsault off the top of the cage would

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.929 
moonsault off the top of the cage would
be<00:01:54.720> pretty<00:01:55.259> epic<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.860> see<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.369> would<00:01:56.790> be<00:01:56.909> a

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
be pretty epic to see and would be a

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.899 
be pretty epic to see and would be a
pretty<00:01:57.270> fitting<00:01:57.630> OMG<00:01:58.229> moment<00:01:58.460> so<00:01:59.460> we<00:01:59.700> have<00:01:59.820> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
pretty fitting OMG moment so we have the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.969 
pretty fitting OMG moment so we have the
ability<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.899> do<00:02:01.079> different<00:02:01.110> moves<00:02:01.649> off<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
ability to do different moves off the

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.340 
ability to do different moves off the
top<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.490> cage<00:02:02.700> does<00:02:03.360> come<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.810> form<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.290> a

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
top of the cage does come the form of a

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.740 
top of the cage does come the form of a
cage<00:02:04.590> oh<00:02:04.920> gee<00:02:05.189> moment<00:02:05.579> or<00:02:05.909> just<00:02:06.240> comes<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.689> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
cage oh gee moment or just comes in the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.320 
cage oh gee moment or just comes in the
normal<00:02:07.020> way<00:02:07.170> either<00:02:07.890> way<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.340> hope<00:02:08.759> we<00:02:08.940> can<00:02:09.119> do

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
normal way either way I hope we can do

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.240 
normal way either way I hope we can do
more<00:02:09.479> moves<00:02:09.750> off<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.200> top<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.560> cages<00:02:11.039> in

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
more moves off the top of the cages in

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.220 
more moves off the top of the cages in
2k15

now<00:02:13.500> guys<00:02:13.739> moving<00:02:14.520> away<00:02:14.640> from<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.180> cage<00:02:15.420> OMG

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
now guys moving away from the cage OMG

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.949 
now guys moving away from the cage OMG
finishes<00:02:16.500> now<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.340> second<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.090> my<00:02:18.209> dishes<00:02:18.480> I

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
finishes now the second of my dishes I

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.740 
finishes now the second of my dishes I
would<00:02:19.110> like<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.349> see<00:02:19.590> is<00:02:19.860> weapons<00:02:20.790> now<00:02:21.540> I<00:02:21.569> do

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
would like to see is weapons now I do

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.330 
would like to see is weapons now I do
get<00:02:22.110> this<00:02:22.230> could<00:02:22.500> be<00:02:22.620> harder<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:23.010> implement

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
get this could be harder to implement

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.460 
get this could be harder to implement
there<00:02:24.060> could<00:02:24.300> be<00:02:24.330> done<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.690> few<00:02:25.019> different<00:02:25.319> ways

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
there could be done a few different ways

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.100 
there could be done a few different ways
one<00:02:26.280> way<00:02:26.310> would<00:02:26.640> be<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:27.120> maybe<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.569> manager<00:02:28.019> at

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
one way would be that maybe a manager at

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.640 
one way would be that maybe a manager at

similar thing I froze the object into

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.670 
similar thing I froze the object into
the<00:02:40.920> cage<00:02:41.690> alternatively<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:43.140> this<00:02:43.379> kearney

the cage alternatively and this kearney

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.160

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
work in cage matches where you went by

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.770 
work in cage matches where you went by
pin<00:02:46.410> or<00:02:46.500> submission<00:02:46.890> not<00:02:47.370> escaping<00:02:47.780> would

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
pin or submission not escaping would

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.050 
pin or submission not escaping would
beat<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.200> ability<00:02:49.769> to<00:02:49.799> actually<00:02:50.580> open<00:02:50.790> the

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
beat the ability to actually open the

beat the ability to actually open the
cage<00:02:51.239> door<00:02:51.269> lead<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.380> steel<00:02:52.620> cage<00:02:52.920> grab<00:02:53.670> a

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
cage door lead the steel cage grab a

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.550 
cage door lead the steel cage grab a
weapon<00:02:53.910> then<00:02:54.480> make<00:02:54.660> your<00:02:54.780> way<00:02:54.840> back<00:02:55.200> into<00:02:55.440> the

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
weapon then make your way back into the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.309 
weapon then make your way back into the
cage<00:02:55.799> with<00:02:56.190> your<00:02:56.370> weapon<00:02:56.700> in<00:02:56.819> hand<00:02:57.110> so<00:02:58.110> it

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
cage with your weapon in hand so it

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.080 
cage with your weapon in hand so it
because<00:02:58.650> somehow<00:02:58.950> make<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.430> work<00:02:59.640> and<00:03:00.000> I'm

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
because somehow make that work and I'm

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.000 
because somehow make that work and I'm
out<00:03:00.269> of<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.420> way<00:03:00.599> otice<00:03:01.440> reckon<00:03:01.829> that<00:03:01.950> would

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
out of the way otice reckon that would

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.979 
out of the way otice reckon that would
be<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.430> pretty<00:03:02.760> cool<00:03:02.880> addition<00:03:03.299> to<00:03:03.390> have<00:03:03.569> for

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
be a pretty cool addition to have for

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.530 
be a pretty cool addition to have for
steel<00:03:04.200> cage<00:03:04.380> matches<00:03:04.680> in<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.250> new<00:03:05.370> game<00:03:05.640> now

guys<00:03:12.930> what<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:13.470> mean<00:03:13.650> by<00:03:13.799> this<00:03:13.860> is<00:03:14.280> think<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.329> the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
guys what I mean by this is think of the

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.910 
guys what I mean by this is think of the
weight<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.810> new<00:03:15.959> room<00:03:16.170> physics<00:03:16.560> working

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
weight the new room physics working

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.309 
weight the new room physics working
solder<00:03:17.220> matches<00:03:17.790> I<00:03:18.030> like<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.600> see<00:03:18.840> something

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
solder matches I like to see something

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.990 
solder matches I like to see something
similar<00:03:19.590> with<00:03:19.859> that<00:03:20.010> feature<00:03:20.489> of<00:03:20.730> missile

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
similar with that feature of missile

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.750 
similar with that feature of missile
cage<00:03:21.299> so<00:03:22.139> what<00:03:22.319> I<00:03:22.350> mean<00:03:22.590> is<00:03:22.769> maybe<00:03:22.980> using<00:03:23.639> the

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
cage so what I mean is maybe using the

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.150 
cage so what I mean is maybe using the
cage<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.569> lean<00:03:24.720> back<00:03:24.989> on<00:03:25.230> when<00:03:25.470> your<00:03:25.590> superstar

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
cage to lean back on when your superstar

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.190 
cage to lean back on when your superstar
are<00:03:26.310> exhausted<00:03:26.940> or<00:03:27.389> even<00:03:27.780> better

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
are exhausted or even better

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.080 
are exhausted or even better
I'm<00:03:28.440> important<00:03:29.010> now<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.130> guess<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.819> Kate

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
I'm important now I guess the Kate

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.870 
I'm important now I guess the Kate
interacts<00:03:30.780> with<00:03:31.049> moves<00:03:31.350> so<00:03:32.220> how<00:03:32.489> this<00:03:32.670> could

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
interacts with moves so how this could

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.720 
interacts with moves so how this could
work<00:03:33.060> is<00:03:33.359> CEO<00:03:34.109> John<00:03:34.380> Cena<00:03:34.650> for<00:03:34.829> example<00:03:35.400> and

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
work is CEO John Cena for example and

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.120 
work is CEO John Cena for example and
you're<00:03:36.120> about<00:03:36.269> to<00:03:36.329> go<00:03:36.600> for<00:03:36.810> an<00:03:36.900> a<00:03:37.079> a<00:03:37.109> you're<00:03:37.920> too

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
you're about to go for an a a you're too

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.830 
you're about to go for an a a you're too
close<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:38.670> ropes<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.299> steel<00:03:39.569> cage

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
close to the ropes and the steel cage

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.979 
close to the ropes and the steel cage
rather<00:03:40.650> than<00:03:40.889> doing<00:03:41.280> just<00:03:41.310> a<00:03:41.700> regular<00:03:42.120> AAA<00:03:42.269> you

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
rather than doing just a regular AAA you

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.379 
rather than doing just a regular AAA you
would<00:03:43.109> actually<00:03:43.620> do<00:03:43.889> the<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.160> into<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.120> steel

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
would actually do the a a into the steel

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.349 
would actually do the a a into the steel
cage<00:03:45.829> so<00:03:46.829> I'm<00:03:47.040> free<00:03:47.370> sure<00:03:47.700> we<00:03:47.819> have<00:03:48.060> seen<00:03:48.269> that

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
cage so I'm free sure we have seen that

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.479 
cage so I'm free sure we have seen that
done<00:03:48.569> before<00:03:48.690> or<00:03:49.200> we've<00:03:49.680> definitely<00:03:49.889> seen<00:03:50.310> our

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
done before or we've definitely seen our

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.340 
done before or we've definitely seen our
finishers<00:03:51.060> into<00:03:51.389> the<00:03:51.480> steel<00:03:51.720> cage<00:03:51.900> anyway

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
finishers into the steel cage anyway

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.129 
finishers into the steel cage anyway
would<00:03:53.069> also<00:03:53.250> work<00:03:53.639> great<00:03:53.670> for<00:03:54.120> moves<00:03:54.389> such<00:03:54.959> as

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
would also work great for moves such as

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.050 
would also work great for moves such as
the<00:03:55.260> f5<00:03:55.620> or<00:03:55.650> even<00:03:56.130> a<00:03:56.190> belly-to-belly<00:03:56.639> suplex

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
the f5 or even a belly-to-belly suplex

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.809 
the f5 or even a belly-to-belly suplex
or<00:03:57.690> pretty<00:03:58.049> much<00:03:58.109> any<00:03:58.590> move<00:03:58.859> that<00:03:59.099> involves

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
or pretty much any move that involves

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:00.979 
or pretty much any move that involves
some<00:04:00.120> sort<00:04:00.150> of<00:04:00.389> Road

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
some sort of Road

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.110 
some sort of Road
so<00:04:01.470> again<00:04:01.829> just<00:04:02.190> something<00:04:02.340> everyone's<00:04:02.700> not

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
so again just something everyone's not

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.390 
so again just something everyone's not
sure<00:04:03.359> exactly<00:04:03.660> on<00:04:04.109> how<00:04:04.560> easy<00:04:04.769> this<00:04:05.040> would<00:04:05.250> be

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
sure exactly on how easy this would be

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.640 
sure exactly on how easy this would be
to<00:04:05.579> implement<00:04:05.849> into<00:04:06.359> the<00:04:06.450> news<00:04:06.630> game<00:04:06.900> but<00:04:07.530> they

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
to implement into the news game but they

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.159 
to implement into the news game but they
could<00:04:07.859> find<00:04:08.069> a<00:04:08.130> way<00:04:08.340> I<00:04:08.549> do<00:04:08.790> think<00:04:09.389> cage<00:04:09.720> physics

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
could find a way I do think cage physics

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:11.900 
could find a way I do think cage physics
will<00:04:10.620> make<00:04:10.799> a<00:04:10.829> great<00:04:11.069> addition<00:04:11.160> to<00:04:11.549> cage

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
will make a great addition to cage

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.990 
will make a great addition to cage
matches<00:04:12.180> in<00:04:12.599> 2k15

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000

to<00:04:19.799> cage<00:04:19.979> matches<00:04:20.280> in<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:20.880> new<00:04:21.000> game<00:04:21.329> but<00:04:21.780> I

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
to cage matches in the new game but I

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.659 
to cage matches in the new game but I
reckon<00:04:22.200> personally<00:04:22.800> would<00:04:23.039> improve<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.460> suit

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
reckon personally would improve the suit

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.700 
reckon personally would improve the suit
cage<00:04:23.849> matches<00:04:24.120> quite<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.450> bit<00:04:24.690> be<00:04:25.320> sure<00:04:25.560> to

section below like I said before guys I

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.170 
section below like I said before guys I
probably<00:04:37.590> do<00:04:37.920> some<00:04:38.280> more<00:04:38.310> these<00:04:38.670> match<00:04:38.940> type

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
probably do some more these match type

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.180 
probably do some more these match type
improvements<00:04:39.840> up<00:04:40.110> until<00:04:40.680> near<00:04:40.890> a<00:04:40.920> release<00:04:41.160> of

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.370 
improvements up until near a release of
the<00:04:41.370> game<00:04:41.640> I<00:04:41.940> think<00:04:42.240> next<00:04:42.540> time<00:04:42.870> we<00:04:42.900> might<00:04:43.200> do

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
the game I think next time we might do

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.860 
the game I think next time we might do
how<00:04:43.560> nacelle<00:04:43.980> improvements<00:04:44.550> so<00:04:45.240> maybe<00:04:45.600> even

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
how nacelle improvements so maybe even

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.600 
how nacelle improvements so maybe even
leave<00:04:45.990> me<00:04:46.080> some<00:04:46.200> improvements<00:04:46.860> you<00:04:47.280> like<00:04:47.490> the
