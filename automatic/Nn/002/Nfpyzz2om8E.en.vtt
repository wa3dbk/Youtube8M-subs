 hello cÃ©dric of the site it is point 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.459
 I hope you liked the video 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.530
 if it is the case, click on 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.540
 I like and have subscribers to the channel 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.030
 so these exercises are great for the 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.080
 torso development in order to have the 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.290
 property possible result 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:38.420
 I recommend you do what they are 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:42.110
 the most intensive for you by targeting 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:49.670
 series of 4 to 10 repetitions or less 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:51.400
 in some cases like that that with this 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.980
 name repeat his organization 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.230
 will produce the most hormones place 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.350
 muscle development 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.090
 that is to say the densest where sleep 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.959
 testosterone growth hormone or 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:09.580
 still adrenaline that is a weapon the 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:12.500
 place is abolished that graces in general 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:18.560
 after having women workout with 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:21.019
 very intensive exercises a bonus on the 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.380
 hormone production that lasts from 20 to 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.419
 30 hours so if these exercises are 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.660
 too easy for you you can increase 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.910
 the intensity by adding weights by 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.860
 example with a bag a little tight in 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.110
 which you put bottles of water or 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.820
 still bags of flour 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.780
 if the opposite the exercise are rather 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.260
 difficult for you 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:48.200
 she starts by talking about the most 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.510
 simple and you 'll see we stay 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:56.390
 effective so you should take enough 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:05:00.260
 quickly up to an important point he 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.760
 must perform the exercises correctly 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.810
 and at the beginning you have to go 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.910
 gently and speed up 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.800
 with time when when exercises 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.740
 had to master 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.500
 it is better to make few series but 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.479
 speak well now that cheat and 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.699
 make less movement on the one hand 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:22.580
 it's less efficient and others do not 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:23.240
 there is a risk of getting hurt and it's not 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.400
 the goal 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.539
 the goal is to improve here I am 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.940
 thank you again for having 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:33.940
 watched this video the next
