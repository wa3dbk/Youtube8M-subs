this one is what you see right here this
kind<00:00:06.240> of<00:00:06.299> design<00:00:06.480> along<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.140> side<00:00:07.350> it<00:00:07.560> adds<00:00:07.710> a

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
kind of design along the side it adds a

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.440 
kind of design along the side it adds a
little<00:00:07.980> bit<00:00:08.130> of<00:00:08.220> grip<00:00:08.490> eNOS<00:00:08.820> you're<00:00:09.269> going<00:00:09.389> to

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
little bit of grip eNOS you're going to

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.390 
little bit of grip eNOS you're going to
see<00:00:09.630> in<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.809> moment<00:00:09.960> that<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.590> borderline<00:00:11.190> is

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
see in a moment that the borderline is

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.970 
see in a moment that the borderline is
kind<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.759> shiny<00:00:12.030> black<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.290> more<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.590> a

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
kind of a shiny black this is more of a

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
they try to replicate leather but it

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.130 
they try to replicate leather but it
almost<00:00:17.490> feels<00:00:17.789> fabric<00:00:18.300> II<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.600> way<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:18.779> it's

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
almost feels fabric II in a way so it's

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.470 
almost feels fabric II in a way so it's
a<00:00:19.230> different<00:00:19.380> kind<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:20.039> design<00:00:20.850> along<00:00:21.240> the

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
a different kind of design along the

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.840 
a different kind of design along the
side<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.560> case<00:00:22.769> up<00:00:23.010> along<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.400> top<00:00:23.640> you're

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
side of the case up along the top you're

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.670 
side of the case up along the top you're
going<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.029> get<00:00:24.150> some<00:00:24.390> matte<00:00:24.600> black<00:00:24.900> with<00:00:25.500> your

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
poetic branding right up there along the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.269 
poetic branding right up there along the
top<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:27.840> then<00:00:28.140> here's<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.560> side<00:00:28.949> with<00:00:29.160> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
top and then here's the side with the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.529 
top and then here's the side with the
buttons<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.880> can<00:00:30.060> see<00:00:30.210> those<00:00:30.390> are

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
buttons and you can see those are

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.659 
buttons and you can see those are
covered<00:00:30.900> you've<00:00:31.859> got<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.070> cut<00:00:32.219> out<00:00:32.340> there<00:00:32.520> for

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
covered you've got to cut out there for

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.920 
covered you've got to cut out there for
your<00:00:32.759> rocker<00:00:33.030> switch<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.600> then<00:00:33.690> down<00:00:33.870> below

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
your rocker switch and then down below

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.990 
your rocker switch and then down below
it's<00:00:34.380> all<00:00:34.530> open<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.430> let<00:00:35.579> me<00:00:35.640> show<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.820> what

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
it's all open so let me show you what

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.450 
it's all open so let me show you what
this<00:00:36.120> looks<00:00:36.180> like<00:00:36.450> on<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> phone<00:00:37.260> bumper<00:00:38.250> is

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
this looks like on the phone bumper is

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.760 
this looks like on the phone bumper is
exactly<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.059> it's<00:00:39.450> just<00:00:39.780> bumper<00:00:40.140> protection

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
exactly that it's just bumper protection

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.410 
exactly that it's just bumper protection
it's<00:00:41.309> really<00:00:41.550> not<00:00:41.670> going<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.879> provide<00:00:42.180> any

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
it's really not going to provide any

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.440 
it's really not going to provide any
drop<00:00:42.780> protection<00:00:43.879> debatable<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.210> for

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
drop protection debatable on that for

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.029 
drop protection debatable on that for
some<00:00:45.629> people<00:00:45.930> but<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.230> my<00:00:46.350> opinion<00:00:46.469> it's<00:00:46.829> not

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
some people but in my opinion it's not

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.029 
some people but in my opinion it's not
and<00:00:47.870> it<00:00:48.870> really<00:00:49.110> only<00:00:49.320> kind<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.770> gives<00:00:49.920> you

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
and it really only kind of gives you

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.310 
and it really only kind of gives you
some<00:00:50.250> grip<00:00:50.489> eNOS<00:00:50.789> along<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.239> edges<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.870> this

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
some grip eNOS along the edges so this

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.590 
some grip eNOS along the edges so this
fits<00:00:52.620> really<00:00:53.100> really<00:00:53.550> well<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:54.090> don't<00:00:54.239> get

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
fits really really well you don't get

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.750 
fits really really well you don't get
any<00:00:54.840> real<00:00:55.260> strong<00:00:55.649> pool<00:00:55.949> along<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.520> sides

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
any real strong pool along the sides

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.340 
any real strong pool along the sides
unless<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.180> do<00:00:57.300> what<00:00:57.449> I'm<00:00:57.539> doing<00:00:57.870> I'm<00:00:58.050> giving

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
unless you do what I'm doing I'm giving

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.319 
unless you do what I'm doing I'm giving
it<00:00:58.469> some<00:00:58.649> force<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.280> pull<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.699> but<00:01:00.120> otherwise

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
it some force to pull it but otherwise

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.119 
it some force to pull it but otherwise
it<00:01:00.660> actually<00:01:01.020> sits<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.469> there<00:01:01.620> pretty<00:01:01.800> well

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
it actually sits in there pretty well

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.039 
it actually sits in there pretty well
same<00:01:02.850> with<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.090> bottom<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> bottom<00:01:03.690> fits

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
same with the bottom the bottom fits

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.020 
same with the bottom the bottom fits
very<00:01:04.320> nice<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.830> snug<00:01:05.100> unless<00:01:05.460> you're<00:01:05.670> really

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
very nice and snug unless you're really

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.179 
very nice and snug unless you're really
pulling<00:01:06.270> tightly<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.229> then<00:01:07.799> that's<00:01:07.920> when

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
pulling tightly on that then that's when

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.410 
pulling tightly on that then that's when
you're<00:01:08.280> going<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.460> see<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.760> kind<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.030> bow<00:01:09.210> out

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
you're going to see it kind of bow out

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.020 
you're going to see it kind of bow out
but<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.140> an<00:01:10.229> excellent<00:01:10.740> fit<00:01:11.250> here's<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
but this is an excellent fit here's the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.520 
but this is an excellent fit here's the
side<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.450> what<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.600> was<00:01:12.750> talking<00:01:12.990> about<00:01:13.200> with

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
side and what I was talking about with

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.399 
side and what I was talking about with
being<00:01:13.950> glossy<00:01:14.520> black<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.270> yeah<00:01:16.020> that's<00:01:16.229> going

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
being glossy black and yeah that's going

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.080 
being glossy black and yeah that's going
to<00:01:16.470> show<00:01:16.680> some<00:01:16.890> fingerprinting<00:01:17.670> but<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:17.970> can

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
to show some fingerprinting but you can

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.200 
to show some fingerprinting but you can
wipe<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.479> off<00:01:18.920> these<00:01:19.920> buttons<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.610> side<00:01:20.880> I

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
wipe it off these buttons on the side I

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.609 
wipe it off these buttons on the side I
do<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.509> want<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.689> call<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:21.960> out<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> couple<00:01:22.409> of

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
do you want to call this out a couple of

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.249 
do you want to call this out a couple of
things<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.009> first<00:01:23.280> off<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:24.000> switch<00:01:24.509> here<00:01:24.869> you

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
things so first off the switch here you

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.190 
things so first off the switch here you
just<00:01:25.470> can<00:01:26.369> switch<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.880> there<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.330> flick<00:01:28.049> that

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
just can switch in there and flick that

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.260 
just can switch in there and flick that
switch<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:29.009> not<00:01:29.250> too<00:01:29.430> difficult<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:30.090> reach

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
switch it's not too difficult to reach
