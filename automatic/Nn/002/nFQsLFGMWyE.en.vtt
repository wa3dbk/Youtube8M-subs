00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
now Lana is really ripping this thing

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.170 
now Lana is really ripping this thing
apart<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:50.190> only<00:02:50.340> gets<00:02:50.519> worse<00:02:50.640> from<00:02:50.940> here

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
apart it only gets worse from here

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.569 
apart it only gets worse from here
anyway<00:02:52.110> it's<00:02:52.739> obvious<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.340> we're<00:02:53.459> dealing

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
anyway it's obvious that we're dealing

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.430 
anyway it's obvious that we're dealing
with<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.940> watery<00:02:54.239> card<00:02:54.569> which<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.290> too

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
with the watery card which is too

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.140 
with the watery card which is too
powerful<00:02:55.650> for<00:02:55.920> any<00:02:56.099> of<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.489> three<00:02:56.700> cards<00:02:57.060> you

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
powerful for any of the three cards you

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.390 
powerful for any of the three cards you
already<00:02:57.510> have<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.530> you'll<00:02:58.739> have<00:02:58.859> to<00:02:59.010> use<00:02:59.069> two

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
already have so you'll have to use two

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.430 
already have so you'll have to use two
cards<00:02:59.819> in<00:02:59.910> tandem<00:03:00.420> they<00:03:00.959> have<00:03:01.109> by<00:03:01.200> lending

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
cards in tandem they have by lending

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.809 
cards in tandem they have by lending
realism<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.220> fact<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.579> you<00:03:02.700> will

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
realism to the fact that you will

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.550 
realism to the fact that you will
successfully<00:03:03.420> capture<00:03:03.810> each<00:03:04.049> card<00:03:04.350> you

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
successfully capture each card you

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.590 
successfully capture each card you
encounter<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:05.489> that's<00:03:05.850> what<00:03:06.090> I'm<00:03:06.209> supposed<00:03:06.540> to

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
encounter so that's what I'm supposed to

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.949 
encounter so that's what I'm supposed to
be<00:03:06.720> pondering<00:03:07.370> hmm<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.519> think<00:03:08.910> any<00:03:09.060> exercise<00:03:09.750> to

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
be pondering hmm I think any exercise to

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:22.210 
be pondering hmm I think any exercise to
decide<00:03:10.290> which<00:03:10.530> two<00:03:10.739> cards<00:03:11.130> I<00:03:11.250> should<00:03:11.430> use

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.220
