 but not just a million 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.410
 I do not want to see 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.189
 how customizable android 

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:14.639
 there we have then culés original of san xunta we have here 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:15.729
 we have 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:18.630
 hit then blanchon 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.169
 percent 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:23.169
 and a wallpaper in my hand 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.089
 percent 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.970
 as you can see 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.970
 jackie there is only this option 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.220
 members angels 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.020
 have a transition we ask for parks 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.910
 I totally customized and stem what example spots topics 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.690
 in this process in himself marquez 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.490
 let's see again 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.200
 browser 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.200
 maps 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.760
 In music 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.320
 agenda camera 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.050
 certainly his death 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.300
 I liked it very much 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.300
 about a breeding center in common although 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.750
 It's very good, though creation because it allows you to have everything 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.420
 simple delinquent 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.220
 facebook twitter sms 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.000
 missed calls and team calls in more than before 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.940
 it's very good very very very still 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:41.880
 net 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.400
 Keter act 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.510
 Facebook 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.260
 could more 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
 in the title 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.700
 Quinn them 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.700
 well they can contain act their stories look 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.500
 for example not 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.260
 what do you have left 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
 what 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.489
 for example the keyboard is very different 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.469
 it's a very likely title 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:13.939
 it responds very well 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:16.939
 and keyboard ceilings from samsung 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.469
 personally I like more this keyboard I feel much more comfortable 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:26.559
 The saving of notifications can also be modified but I do not like it as 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.749
 as it was then that some icons are not able to see very well 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:33.689
 but with your good choice 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.979
 the maximum cd your album 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:36.849
 the Creole 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.719
 of application of use 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.179
 the one from samsung but it's like that 

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:45.329
 and this is like a guy the Quindío growth 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:46.389
 work 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:47.399
 and up 

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:50.399
 c of transcendent fist in a cube 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.199
 they will not include 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:57.209
 56 and max 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.609
 i 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.869
 and good look 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:04.869
 the transitions 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.110
 and not these transitions because they are not adopted others not 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.909
 take off will be very very good 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.920
 cough after android is fully customizable 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:21.819
 n 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.399
 and then 

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:25.079
 I want to clarify that the east 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.309
 of the accident 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:29.719
 I can not stand all I can not stand flash 

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:33.289
 what 

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:36.120
 its processor peeks at the sun 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.980
 a 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.659
 investment 6 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.240
 and needed a version 7 can with its prize 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.359
 but fortunately with strong browsers 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.649
 so even if the phone rotem 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.219
 they will not be able to play flash 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:54.030
 in the accident 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.349
 as much as men search for more that they do not get in the way 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.229
 it can not 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:01.449
 percent 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.449
 the stellar 

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:06.809
 another thing 

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:09.839
 what is this screen in a phobic survey 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:12.839
 it stays a lot the fat stayed much more of the rolled 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:17.239
 the duel that was not revealed but I did not like that is that all of the sop 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.359
 that all visibility 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.419
 with everything with this although there is no fear for the Hercules 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.469
 but not in perfect of the fat males 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:28.469
 I want you to also see an application to block the screen 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.110
 we can omit situations 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.699
 with the lock screen 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:37.199
 And that's what it is 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.259
 this is how he took it with skipper 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.110
 not for these parts you can not only see them 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.129
 a constitution 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:48.039
 however, they want to give him another blog 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:50.860
 uu when there are two super laxi of those u 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.669
 minimum any phone they had 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.569
 well everything that is produced 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:59.569
 with a little creativity of time 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:01.620
 your phone poor 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.639
 can you see 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.919
 we moved very soon well 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:05.490
 this new
