00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello people and welcome to one 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.660
 another video to destiny directly after 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.880
 The e3 presentation has the developers 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.800
 von Bungie hosts an interview where 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.690
 you about the most important information about the 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.000
 coming extension of the king of 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.859
 obsessed and exactly these 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.490
 I now summarize for you briefly and concisely 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.439
 together 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.810
 but it is important that he only 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.640
 it is to be heard of the visualization 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.410
 it just be the background because it works 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.420
 yes here for the infos the new one 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.340
 Expansion should be big so 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.529
 really big it will be a lot too 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.840
 explore and, so to speak , become one 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.050
 new chapter opened in destiny 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.180
 the year 2000 even for the destiny 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.920
 Veterans will find some new reasons 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.899
 give back to the game 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.059
 I can be what is going to be here now 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.129
 do not say it exactly now but it will 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.719
 probably also in quotes crazy 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.660
 give new pvp modes 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.460
 in bright about super should always be active 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.530
 its in another place is around 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.719
 certain tasks are going to be fulfilled 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.750
 but are that really that way? 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.760
 or again just a marketing 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.769
 is it was now time undecided as 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.090
 you can not say much about it but the 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.500
 mode actually sounds relative 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.439
 I do not think that's crazy 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.810
 really true but well pvp modes with 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.280
 Great always on 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.680
 who knows if that will happen or not 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.170
 Let's get to the story 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.420
 while one ties in with darkness lurking 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.390
 the victory over herbs has a lot 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.400
 set in motion and orix returns 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.720
 to take revenge for that, so to speak 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.060
 coater was defeated 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.049
 when a story really promises 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.939
 clearly in focus 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.110
 one continues to rely on personalities 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.119
 and he already has that 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.640
 Past shows that the way with 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.409
 iris mohren was ex and petra if so 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.689
 was quite successful and you have the 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.159
 impression that the whole of the mini 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.840
 community the whole thing very well 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.850
 and that is why the 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.460
 Developers determined that easy 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.810
 continue to pursue this way 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.610
 The players are especially hot 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.590
 Developer on the new super 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.659
 I have this already in one 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.180
 Extra video partly mentioned 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.920
 It was all about the new focus on the 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.780
 individual classes come yes 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.390
 because the title bullock as well as by hand 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.220
 because yes get a completely new focus 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.569
 setting yes could look there 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.230
 If I'm interested in that, I want it 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.150
 not like now 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.040
 men same size so to speak new 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.560
 start the further comes with the 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.580
 so stair has the ship of orex me 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.040
 I hope I speak that half way 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.500
 reasonable from a new target, so to speak 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.540
 to destiny, the developer stand 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.760
 the following steps so that a 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.680
 style with cherished felt fortress is 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.470
 the players then in the campaign 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.870
 The new ones definitely want to conquer 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.120
 opponents so the obsessed would be too 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.190
 have other abilities than theirs 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.959
 original issue, so to speak 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.299
 you will also see the ancient areas of 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.519
 to visit destiny 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.530
 Furthermore, there is a new raid yes 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.480
 you have correctly is definitely on 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.000
 new raid and this one should be bigger 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.489
 or the biggest one you have been so far 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.530
