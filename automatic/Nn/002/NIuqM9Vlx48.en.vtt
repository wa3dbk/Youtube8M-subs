00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.890 

so<00:03:34.850> first<00:03:35.150> of<00:03:35.390> all<00:03:35.710> you<00:03:36.710> need<00:03:36.860> to<00:03:37.570> pull<00:03:38.570> that

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
out then it folds down and then you get

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.740 
out then it folds down and then you get
your<00:03:45.550> USB<00:03:46.550> cable<00:03:48.790> I've<00:03:49.790> managed<00:03:50.210> to<00:03:50.240> get<00:03:50.510> the

your USB cable I've managed to get the
device<00:03:51.110> in<00:03:53.230> on<00:03:54.230> there<00:03:54.650> we've<00:03:54.860> got<00:03:55.160> I<00:03:56.500> want<00:03:57.500> to

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
device in on there we've got I want to

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:19.050 
device in on there we've got I want to
choose<00:03:57.770> videos

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.820 

it's<00:04:20.060> quite<00:04:20.299> fast<00:04:22.960> miracast<00:04:23.960> working<00:04:24.650> really

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
it's quite fast miracast working really

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.950 
it's quite fast miracast working really
good
