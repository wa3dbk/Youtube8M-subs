00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.880 

before<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.750> we<00:01:42.870> had<00:01:42.930> done<00:01:43.200> was<00:01:43.470> take<00:01:43.680> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
before that we had done was take the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.880 
before that we had done was take the
original<00:01:44.340> iPad<00:01:44.730> and<00:01:44.970> just<00:01:45.210> reduce<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.890> all

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
original iPad and just reduce it all

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.730 
original iPad and just reduce it all
that<00:01:47.190> you<00:01:47.310> would<00:01:47.430> be<00:01:47.580> aware<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.110> was<00:01:49.110> was

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
that you would be aware of was was

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.140 
that you would be aware of was was
everything<00:01:50.160> that<00:01:50.310> was<00:01:50.430> just<00:01:50.610> missing<00:01:50.820> that

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
everything that was just missing that

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.070 
everything that was just missing that
there<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.870> inherent<00:01:52.110> loss<00:01:52.800> in<00:01:53.250> just<00:01:54.180> reducing

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
there is inherent loss in just reducing

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.970 
there is inherent loss in just reducing
a<00:01:55.170> product<00:01:55.530> inside<00:01:56.150> on<00:01:57.150> what<00:01:57.480> we<00:01:57.660> did<00:01:58.050> was<00:01:58.950> we

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
a product inside on what we did was we

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.620 
a product inside on what we did was we
went<00:01:59.220> back<00:01:59.400> to<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.580> very<00:01:59.700> beginning<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.360> we

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
went back to the very beginning and we

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.080 
went back to the very beginning and we
took<00:02:00.870> the<00:02:01.080> time<00:02:01.410> to<00:02:02.040> design<00:02:02.370> a<00:02:02.430> product<00:02:02.850> that

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
took the time to design a product that

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.140 
took the time to design a product that
was<00:02:03.480> a<00:02:03.680> concentration<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.800> not<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> reduction

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
was a concentration of not a reduction

of<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.300> original<00:02:07.610> we<00:02:08.610> felt<00:02:08.910> strongly<00:02:09.330> that

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
of the original we felt strongly that

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.860 
of the original we felt strongly that
seven<00:02:10.619> point<00:02:10.890> nine<00:02:10.950> inches<00:02:11.520> was<00:02:12.210> exactly<00:02:12.810> the

seven point nine inches was exactly the

seven point nine inches was exactly the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
right display size but it became clear

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.440 
right display size but it became clear
that<00:02:16.290> we<00:02:16.770> had<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.070> reduce<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.610> width<00:02:17.910> of<00:02:18.240> the

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
that we had to reduce the width of the

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.990 
that we had to reduce the width of the
borders<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.410> you<00:02:19.740> can<00:02:19.980> still<00:02:20.280> pick<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.700> up<00:02:20.850> and

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
borders so you can still pick it up and

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.310 
borders so you can still pick it up and
easily<00:02:21.420> use<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:21.810> with<00:02:21.930> one<00:02:22.110> hand<00:02:24.290> we<00:02:25.290> have

there<00:02:29.760> are<00:02:29.850> essentially<00:02:30.360> two<00:02:30.690> parts<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.650> the
