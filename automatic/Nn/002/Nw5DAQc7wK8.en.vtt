00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.040
 hello everyone with you jackson and today 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.410
 will be a little bit like that tutorials 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.120
 which tell you how to run 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.160
 more or less modern games on a very 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.740
 old computer is in our case 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.759
 toshiba satellite l30 release computer 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.109
 2005 is relevant in general in 2004 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:25.259
 its characteristics are immediately very clear 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.720
 bad relative to the current time and 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.409
 let's see a little more than that 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.960
 as characteristics so let's get the properties 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:37.380
 the first thing we see we do 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.990
 intel celeron mn processor 16 gigahertz 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.630
 that is, it is not yet pentium 4 but no longer 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.690
 pentium 3 transition 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:48.540
 further here we are 400 megabytes and make sure 512 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.330
 we 448 it turns out that part eats that 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.800
 what is not clear honestly yu what else 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.500
 operating system takes too 200 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.360
 megabyte or think it is first 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.130
 I have almost no memory even on the tablet 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.540
 it's more RAM than on 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.700
 this computer is even 100 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.979
 let the horse some synthetic test 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.630
 my substitute will probably win right away 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.970
 this computer is immediately understandable 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.220
 computers are full of junk and let's 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.659
 actually show you the secret first 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.400
 that you will need to have it of course 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.870
 Internet access without it without any 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.220
 you will not succeed 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.670
 will specifically download the program under 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.070
 by name 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.610
 onlive the essence of this program is to 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.010
 that it handles all games 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.630
 receive on their servers you 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.190
 get the picture itself which you 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.510
 can manage and everything is processed not 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.400
 on your computer you only get 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.900
 picture and everything is processed on 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.670
 third-party servers let's principle 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.049
 let's say it seems to me this way 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.729
 you can even allow the game to 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.470
 pension third may even be the second 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.750
 On the second I do not know, but on the third one exactly 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.190
 because this computer is very close to 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.229
 the third pyncheon but precisely 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.030
 stationary che something else laptop 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.100
 process is useful then the third day than 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.820
 script computer one hundred percent will pull 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.049
 I am the same nonsense and let's principle a 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.630
 let us run our case is tough 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.430
 us 2 game one hundred percent would not go on 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.320
 by the way, we see this computer 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.190
 cards 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:07.570
 you care 128 megabytes as you see here i am 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.570
 I do not know to be seen 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.880
 Look here with the keys I control everything 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:18.200
 all real if you do not believe you can 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.270
 try so let's say we need 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.260
 land so that the load for some 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.290
 Went you can skip 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.910
 so space 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:34.000
 or no space for it to land this 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:39.730
 lower down apparently someone and. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.730
 so now you can space here parachute 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.790
 we need to come down to that point 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.500
 pretty normal to see at all 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.500
 brakes and lags, like there is nothing 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.170
 still sags in some places I have to 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.360
 but it just seems like it all depends on 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:05.440
 internet so we have undermined skip 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.440
 so we have something 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.760
 I do not remember which whale control 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:20.120
 build everything was visible picture 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.120
 So 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.519
 You see, that's all pretty normal 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.250
 so in my hook how to use not 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:39.650
 remember and you atf 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:39.650
 here's a hook probably get 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:51.110
 This program is available to all everyone can and 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:54.220
 to use everything perfectly you climbed like 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.220
 You can accelerate with a pole 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.710
 It is remembered that garbage in rigidity 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.750
 almost fell 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:21.000
 pilaf he jumps with a parachute as well 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.910
 see everyone worked pretty much 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.890
 ok place it is that there are some 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.530
 games are worth the money, I have something you 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.480
 have to pay for the same cost 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.180
 how it costs and let's say the incentive or 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.620
 another similar program well you can 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.620
 quietly play your old 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.620
 computer in these games is quite 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.340
 and so we went beyond need to come back 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.580
 in general, that's how it all works. 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:53.570
 if you do not believe you can check it yourself 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.920
 don't lose the mission if you don't believe 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.320
 can he really check it 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.990
 it works it is all loaded it turns out for 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.730
 external server account and computers 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.460
 almost no lags at all 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:07.760
 moisture is all related only to quality 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.290
 your internet and so let's say this 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.200
 that's the way it's pretty simple 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:15.320
 the only tool onlive 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.970
 have access to the internet and it turns out you 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.580
 you can play literally any game 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.050
 here night play a lot and honestly begins 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.060
 batman all sorts of endings 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.830
 coils fourth mafia second 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.810
 literally everything can be played on the old 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.670
 computer literally even 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.860
 probably this computer he even sundres 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.300
 Normally not pull and in general then themselves 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.370
 already sign and bid for likes 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.520
 I hope you have been helpful and in general 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.520
 then bye
