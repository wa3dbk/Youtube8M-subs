three and we're pretty much ready to

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.580 
three and we're pretty much ready to
install<00:04:02.459> this<00:04:02.879> thing<00:04:03.180> so<00:04:03.989> we've<00:04:04.200> got<00:04:04.379> all

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
install this thing so we've got all

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.339 
install this thing so we've got all
three<00:04:04.799> antennas<00:04:05.280> on<00:04:05.610> it<00:04:05.910> and<00:04:06.420> you<00:04:07.200> can

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
three antennas on it and you can

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.580 
three antennas on it and you can
actually<00:04:07.560> see<00:04:08.599> you<00:04:09.599> can<00:04:09.750> twist<00:04:10.019> to<00:04:10.170> me<00:04:10.319> the<00:04:10.440> way

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
actually see you can twist to me the way

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.729 
actually see you can twist to me the way
i<00:04:10.620> probably<00:04:11.099> i'm<00:04:11.340> going<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.640> keep<00:04:11.879> the<00:04:12.120> y-3

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
i probably i'm going to keep the y-3

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.090 
i probably i'm going to keep the y-3
look<00:04:13.739> that's<00:04:14.190> fine<00:04:14.430> with<00:04:14.670> me<00:04:15.829> one<00:04:16.829> thing<00:04:16.979> I

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100

look that's fine with me one thing I
didn't<00:04:17.340> mention<00:04:17.370> is<00:04:17.789> that<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:18.090> actual<00:04:18.359> wall

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
didn't mention is that the actual wall

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.469 
didn't mention is that the actual wall
plug<00:04:19.560> that's<00:04:19.739> had<00:04:19.949> bases<00:04:20.430> right<00:04:20.760> on<00:04:20.910> both

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
plug that's had bases right on both

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.870 
plug that's had bases right on both
sides<00:04:21.810> as<00:04:22.109> well<00:04:22.139> so<00:04:22.740> nice<00:04:23.250> step<00:04:23.550> nice

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
sides as well so nice step nice

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.200 
sides as well so nice step nice
packaging<00:04:24.590> I'm<00:04:25.590> gonna<00:04:25.740> install<00:04:26.280> it<00:04:26.490> let<00:04:27.090> you

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
packaging I'm gonna install it let you

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.020 
packaging I'm gonna install it let you
guys<00:04:27.389> know<00:04:28.289> what<00:04:28.380> I<00:04:28.500> think<00:04:28.800> once<00:04:29.490> i<00:04:29.639> installed

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
guys know what I think once i installed

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.600 
guys know what I think once i installed
hopefully<00:04:30.630> it's<00:04:30.780> a<00:04:30.930> pretty<00:04:31.289> good<00:04:31.500> router<00:04:31.770> so

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
hopefully it's a pretty good router so

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.480 
hopefully it's a pretty good router so
I'll<00:04:32.940> be<00:04:33.210> back<00:04:33.740> alright<00:04:34.740> guys<00:04:34.919> so<00:04:35.190> check<00:04:35.460> it

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
I'll be back alright guys so check it

start getting 5 megabits for megabits 8

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.430 
start getting 5 megabits for megabits 8
mega<00:05:11.880> bits<00:05:12.120> it'd<00:05:12.360> be<00:05:12.389> all<00:05:12.539> over<00:05:12.960> but<00:05:13.050> it<00:05:13.200> never
