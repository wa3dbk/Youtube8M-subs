now so what you need is a half a cup

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.680 
now so what you need is a half a cup
plus<00:01:23.210> one<00:01:23.540> tablespoon<00:01:24.230> of<00:01:24.440> brown<00:01:24.860> rice<00:01:25.250> flour

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
plus one tablespoon of brown rice flour

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.300 
plus one tablespoon of brown rice flour
you<00:01:26.690> can<00:01:26.840> also<00:01:26.960> use<00:01:27.350> white<00:01:27.620> rice<00:01:27.650> flour<00:01:28.040> it

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
you can also use white rice flour it

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.300 
you can also use white rice flour it
doesn't<00:01:28.640> matter<00:01:28.790> but<00:01:29.450> do<00:01:29.750> use<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:30.770> rice<00:01:31.040> flour

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
doesn't matter but do use the rice flour

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.850 
doesn't matter but do use the rice flour
because<00:01:31.790> it<00:01:31.970> makes<00:01:32.150> it<00:01:32.330> crunchy<00:01:32.480> and<00:01:32.990> I<00:01:33.500> think

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
because it makes it crunchy and I think

00:01:33.860 --> 00:02:18.740 
because it makes it crunchy and I think
with<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.400> wheat<00:01:35.090> flour<00:01:35.360> it<00:01:35.570> makes<00:01:35.750> it<00:01:35.990> gluey

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.090 

and<00:02:19.750> now<00:02:20.050> I'm<00:02:20.140> going<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.350> add<00:02:20.440> two<00:02:20.830> tablespoons

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100

of<00:02:21.790> tamari<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:51.430> this<00:02:52.090> doesn't<00:02:52.270> really<00:02:52.510> make

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
of tamari and this doesn't really make

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.850

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
in the fridge it might thicken up a

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.130 
in the fridge it might thicken up a
bunch<00:03:39.730> so<00:03:40.000> you'll<00:03:40.209> have<00:03:40.390> to<00:03:40.510> add<00:03:40.630> some<00:03:40.900> water

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
bunch so you'll have to add some water

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.290 
bunch so you'll have to add some water
here

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
here

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.610 
here
now<00:03:43.300> we're<00:03:43.420> going<00:03:43.540> to<00:03:43.810> batter<00:03:44.080> our<00:03:44.319> little

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
now we're going to batter our little

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.220 
now we're going to batter our little
veggies<00:03:45.010> just<00:03:45.480> dip<00:03:46.480> them<00:03:46.600> in<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:47.020> should<00:03:47.200> be

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
veggies just dip them in it should be

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:58.500 
veggies just dip them in it should be
about<00:03:47.580> that<00:03:51.360> shake<00:03:52.360> off<00:03:52.510> any<00:03:52.690> excess<00:03:57.150> and<00:03:58.150> it's

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
about that shake off any excess and it's

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.479 
about that shake off any excess and it's
hard<00:03:58.750> to<00:03:58.840> tell<00:03:59.080> you<00:03:59.230> how<00:03:59.500> many<00:03:59.680> vegetables<00:03:59.860> to

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
hard to tell you how many vegetables to

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:08.880 
hard to tell you how many vegetables to
cut<00:04:00.700> up<00:04:00.930> for<00:04:01.930> this<00:04:02.050> amount<00:04:02.319> of<00:04:02.500> batter<00:04:07.320> a<00:04:08.320> few

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
cut up for this amount of batter a few

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.830 
cut up for this amount of batter a few
of<00:04:08.980> each<00:04:09.160> I<00:04:09.370> mean<00:04:09.489> this<00:04:09.580> is<00:04:09.760> just<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:10.360> mushrooms

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
of each I mean this is just to mushrooms

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.069 
of each I mean this is just to mushrooms
and<00:04:11.489> a<00:04:12.489> quarter<00:04:13.269> of<00:04:13.300> a<00:04:13.450> sweet<00:04:13.720> potato<00:04:13.750> maybe<00:04:14.670> so

and a quarter of a sweet potato maybe so

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.650 
and a quarter of a sweet potato maybe so

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
you might if you have extra batter you

00:04:19.660 --> 00:05:41.360 
you might if you have extra batter you
can<00:04:19.870> always<00:04:20.079> save<00:04:20.709> it<00:04:20.829> in<00:04:20.919> the<00:04:20.980> fridge
