00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.870
 second take that I have compared 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.190
 cycling is good at the start I thought 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.930
 he had to adjust the brakes by 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.910
 stuff that's where you can do it 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.610
 but that's only for 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.279
 troubleshoot to solve it quickly 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.480
 after the most effective setting this 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.730
 we always talk about there 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.039
 tells and so that's the caliper the 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.229
 comarit how do i do for bah 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:40.519
 just settle this thing there 

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:41.989
 First, how do I not know 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:43.489
 what are these skate tours that's it 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.889
 is not that it's not so much for 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.699
 check if they are unchanged at bread 

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:52.579
 nan you unlock the caliper lala by the 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:56.359
 cable and if the calculations but that's it you 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.179
 spreads and there you can see your ta heap 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:01.039
 wear control on its skids 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:02.719
 of trompe that we see not necessarily very 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.070
 all right, it's small things 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.189
 who are and slightly 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.450
 here it is split and when happens 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.140
 at the end of 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.149
 dust off taking it to the fake good 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:18.049
 okay and that's good how it gets 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:23.329
 demonstrates how the skate and holds 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:26.060
 only this year it's 2-1 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.799
 in the normal sense we are normal 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.549
 as if I was going to play it's very tight 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:34.340
 in the counterclockwise direction of 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.710
 months fingers is tight it's in the sense 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.049
 videos ex washer that go 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.710
 inside the break but two washers 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.710
 who go with his kidneys 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.250
 and learn to ride that the same 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.790
 operation that now from puck to 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.730
 interior 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.580
 yeah I'm resting at the plateau of at 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.110
 outside and we're big then we have to 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.910
 well admit parallel to the track of 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.630
 braking the braking plug is gone 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.940
 there on the rim 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.350
 that's where the stick to the fringe is that 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.030
 this one or not you will come in support 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.530
 against the agent for taker yet but 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.550
 how do you know content then you reach 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.710
 hang up the stuff to put them 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.510
 yeah nan it's the highway we want 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.700
 break it is sure that that so you can 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.170
 support him to come to the bottom 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.700
 Here you just put pressure on 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.410
 the agent well positioned so much skates 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.780
 okay and once it's fine 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.210
 positioned all the spring so you 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.440
 shove the thing here it's ok that's coming 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.120
 resting against the braking track 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.680
 that's for sure it's the 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.860
 same thing on the other side exactly 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.440
 Paris on the other side 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.990
 agree the cif price were much more 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.880
 3h cherifi who heals well 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.440
 everywhere the same as reading the back and 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.340
 on the poultry on that would not be 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:03.360
 Okay 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:04.590
 that stuff that's where we spent the 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.750
 setting we just made the spring 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.489
 after you can regulate the tension of the 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.640
 cable which will give more leverage or 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.830
 less hard good with me 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.489
 how to hang 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.489
 I am lula 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.790
 okay the two parties that are there and 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.019
 after how you know it's okay 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.400
 nature rigor for ronald watch them 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:29.180
 scholarships to a good tension in the 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.860
 cable after if it was not that yeah so 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.629
 you're not if thou hast anything while 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.060
 those of gasoline but that's it that's what 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.640
 going to serve the troika did not talk about going 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.530
 So that's the bass for that 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.549
 to quickly troubleshoot if its tariffs 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.260
 on a journey you can do it 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.300
 automatically support for these 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.010
 desserts 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.450
 it relaxes low and with many of 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.180
 skates like the patent necessarily a 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.280
 excuse we lose space between 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.000
 between the junta and the skate of the blow the 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.739
 bigger of existence was learned 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:04.950
 so if i was then ruled and u17 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:07.950
 notice the game turns the cable and after that 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.950
 it 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.739
 you always leave by putting things to 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.540
 background I love it thoroughly and you 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.280
 leave a little after you loose them 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.610
 slightly to allow space for 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.350
 and we do not count betrayed strong it takes 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.699
 so you start pressed thoroughly and after 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.740
 you release on rebound light rebound 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.030
 to gain a little face after you do 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.520
 not always two first shots of 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.530
 madness on the circuit I see you have 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.110
 always these things there were keys to 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.720
 allen that's it but that's a tools and 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.510
 there are several cases together on the same 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.500
 useful it makes it possible to do 90% of the streets 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.500
 evening water
