pumping<00:01:30.100> action<00:01:30.310> when<00:01:30.670> you're<00:01:30.940> recording

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
pumping action when you're recording

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.380 
pumping action when you're recording
with<00:01:32.080> microphones<00:01:32.620> and<00:01:33.360> there's<00:01:34.360> a<00:01:36.390> headphone

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
with microphones and there's a headphone

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.560 
with microphones and there's a headphone
out<00:01:37.660> jack<00:01:38.050> that<00:01:38.470> I'm<00:01:38.650> going<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:39.040> connect<00:01:39.310> up

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
out jack that I'm going to connect up

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.970 
out jack that I'm going to connect up
along<00:01:40.570> with<00:01:40.690> two<00:01:40.840> microphones<00:01:41.020> and<00:01:41.770> we'll

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
along with two microphones and we'll

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.680 
along with two microphones and we'll
actually<00:01:42.400> see<00:01:42.610> how<00:01:42.730> this<00:01:42.910> thing<00:01:43.150> sounds<00:01:43.570> when

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
actually see how this thing sounds when

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.630 
actually see how this thing sounds when
connected<00:01:44.050> to<00:01:44.080> a<00:01:44.170> camera<00:01:44.410> also<00:01:45.310> in<00:01:45.580> the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
connected to a camera also in the

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.010 
connected to a camera also in the
package<00:01:45.820> it<00:01:46.120> came<00:01:46.300> with<00:01:46.480> the<00:01:46.600> connection

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
package it came with the connection

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.260 
package it came with the connection
cable<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.500> connect<00:01:47.800> the<00:01:47.920> unit<00:01:48.220> here<00:01:48.460> to<00:01:49.090> your

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
cable to connect the unit here to your

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.790 
cable to connect the unit here to your
camera<00:01:49.690> which<00:01:49.870> I<00:01:50.020> thought<00:01:50.200> was<00:01:50.350> pretty<00:01:50.470> swell

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
camera which I thought was pretty swell

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.130 
camera which I thought was pretty swell
so<00:01:51.460> I'm<00:01:51.520> going<00:01:51.640> to<00:01:51.670> set<00:01:51.850> it<00:01:51.940> all<00:01:52.060> up<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:52.450> then

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
so I'm going to set it all up and then

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.470 
so I'm going to set it all up and then
we'll<00:01:53.260> try<00:01:53.470> it<00:01:53.500> out<00:01:53.620> see<00:01:53.860> how<00:01:53.920> it<00:01:54.070> works<00:01:54.480> okay

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
we'll try it out see how it works okay

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.480 
we'll try it out see how it works okay
I'm<00:01:55.600> gonna<00:01:55.690> try<00:01:56.010> with<00:01:57.010> a<00:01:57.070> couple<00:01:57.400> of

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
I'm gonna try with a couple of

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.430 
I'm gonna try with a couple of
microphones<00:01:57.880> hooked<00:01:58.090> up<00:01:58.240> to<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.450> unit<00:01:58.690> going

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
microphones hooked up to the unit going

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.710 
microphones hooked up to the unit going
directly<00:01:59.830> to<00:01:59.890> the<00:01:59.980> camera<00:02:00.370> so<00:02:01.180> here<00:02:01.480> I<00:02:01.510> have

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
directly to the camera so here I have

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.470 
directly to the camera so here I have
electro-voice<00:02:02.340> re<00:02:03.340> 20<00:02:03.790> microphone<00:02:04.210> that<00:02:04.390> I'm

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
electro-voice re 20 microphone that I'm

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.200 
electro-voice re 20 microphone that I'm
speaking<00:02:04.840> through<00:02:05.080> and<00:02:05.590> it's<00:02:06.100> summed<00:02:06.670> to<00:02:07.000> mono

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
speaking through and it's summed to mono

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.070 
speaking through and it's summed to mono
output<00:02:07.750> and<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:09.340> my<00:02:09.459> bass<00:02:09.640> amp<00:02:09.940> I<00:02:10.179> have<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.479> shure

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
output and on my bass amp I have a shure

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.180 
output and on my bass amp I have a shure
SMA<00:02:11.560> t5<00:02:12.360> it's<00:02:13.360> also<00:02:13.510> summed<00:02:13.960> to<00:02:14.410> mono<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:15.040> it's

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
SMA t5 it's also summed to mono and it's

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.890 
SMA t5 it's also summed to mono and it's
running<00:02:15.490> on<00:02:15.700> phantom<00:02:16.060> power<00:02:16.210> off<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.600> unit

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
running on phantom power off the unit

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.030 
running on phantom power off the unit
and<00:02:18.600> everything<00:02:19.600> is<00:02:19.690> set<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:19.900> flat

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
and everything is set to flat

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.670 
and everything is set to flat
so<00:02:21.610> I'm<00:02:21.939> gonna<00:02:22.060> try<00:02:22.689> out<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:22.900> couple<00:02:23.319> things<00:02:23.439> on

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
so I'm gonna try out a couple things on

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.530 
so I'm gonna try out a couple things on
base<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.159> just<00:02:24.250> see<00:02:24.459> if<00:02:24.580> they<00:02:24.700> come<00:02:24.909> out<00:02:24.939> cuz<00:02:25.329> I

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
base and just see if they come out cuz I

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.520 
base and just see if they come out cuz I
think<00:02:25.720> that's<00:02:25.930> going<00:02:26.019> to<00:02:26.110> be<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.290> hardest

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
think that's going to be the hardest

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.009 
think that's going to be the hardest
thing<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.920> record<00:02:27.340> so<00:02:28.239> we'll<00:02:28.390> try<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.569> out<00:02:28.750> see

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
thing to record so we'll try it out see

00:02:29.019 --> 00:03:28.990 
thing to record so we'll try it out see
what<00:02:29.140> it<00:02:29.230> does

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.150 

so<00:03:30.000> we'll<00:03:30.630> see<00:03:30.720> how<00:03:30.750> those<00:03:30.990> sound<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:31.590> it's

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
so we'll see how those sound and it's

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.570 
so we'll see how those sound and it's
like<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.310> great<00:03:32.670> unit<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:34.100> I'll<00:03:35.100> write<00:03:35.370> in<00:03:35.490> the

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
like a great unit and I'll write in the

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.300 
like a great unit and I'll write in the
comments<00:03:35.970> section<00:03:36.330> if<00:03:36.930> I<00:03:37.290> have<00:03:37.440> any<00:03:37.590> issues<00:03:37.800> or
