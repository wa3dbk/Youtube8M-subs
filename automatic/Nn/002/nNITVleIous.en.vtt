00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.000
 very good cars, but 14 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.009
 here commenting and welcome one more day 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.019
 to your channel and I bring you a small 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.790
 tutorial in this case how to win a 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.730
 game of the league of legends of 3 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.130
 against 3 in five minutes in this case 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.199
 I think it's five minutes, about 40 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.169
 seconds or 39 something like that but well I'll 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.400
 start going fast for then you 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:22.689
 I explain why I have to say the 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.519
 things fast before they occur 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.380
 the events that you are going to see now 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.239
 same is true in the main thing is that you 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.489
 put a character or pe worth in this 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.869
 trim dahmer case I'm not playing with myself 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.330
 trim damme is when my friend is worth 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.950
 but it is a very clear example for 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.630
 for what I want you to see it osea 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.920
 you have to put us in the background and you have 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.510
 to start giving enemies what 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.940
 enough so that trina can give me 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.100
 can give the last blows and go 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.260
 taking fidh is worth going catching his 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.810
 fury too and go kill people like 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.220
 you see double murder right now and now 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.710
 same we retired a little 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.500
 back and triple murder is worth it 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.060
 a 30 watch in less than a minute 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.370
 departure is that I do not see are very numbers 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.950
 little ones in the thumbnail of the video and 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.630
 I do not see it but 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.520
 I do not know how many seconds have passed but 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.650
 come on, not a minute has passed and now 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.540
 you see that trina to see already has a 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.740
 then triple murder is good 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.510
 let's go little by little I'll go 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.520
 explaining why I would have had to 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.620
 say it very fast because nothing else 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.390
 start games when it happens like 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.130
 You see I'm a core that's worth but instead 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.310
 to use the frob as I use soil 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.050
 in most of my videos I decided 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.330
 use this the record ehr after 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.520
 play the game because with the 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.280
 new update of this program you 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.900
 you can put in the character's camera 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.479
 that you want not so much if it's from the team 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.520
 opposite as if it's not worth here I kill myself 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.009
 one but good as you can see I'm as if 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.020
 I was trim dammert does not look like or 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.400
 it is not seen the spell bars are not 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.320
 see the mana life bar and so on 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.130
 but you see that the camera is centered 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.560
 just over 30 worth then has 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.360
 done basically because good because 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.119
 how is it that kills the most and is what 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.340
 you have to do to make it look 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.619
 much more clear then it's good 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.509
 what we have said let's review, you have to 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.119
 catch is a very very ope worth character 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.950
 how can it be trim unless you know 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.220
 there are a lot of characters or pes that 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.780
 they would need a little discount as to their 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.940
 power is usually better to be 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.920
 physical though there are some magicians 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.240
 very strong as it can be white for 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.510
 example leblanc federated is 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.130
 impressive but good provides is very 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.440
 well because it's the character by 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.990
 excellence since the beginning of the 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.590
 lole was the character although good I 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.090
 when I started playing lol I do not know I do not know 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.590
 when did trim me when I started 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.410
 play soles halo was coming out 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.030
 brand but good that 's nonsense that 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.130
 just said no does not come to mind 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.690
 then as I say a character or pe 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.520
 you have to leave in the casualties you have to 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.080
 to leave the warm ones as you see there he 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.640
 the wheel is pulled just at the moment in 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.920
 who has little left to die to 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.690
 character and another double is worth it right now 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.520
 trimmer 5 to 0 voucher 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.680
 then good the enemy already begins to 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.020
 think saying good or that's been done 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.210
 a triple at the beginning as you see 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.310
 one becomes demoralized and leaves another one goes away 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.480
 that is also impressive what 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.920
 you have to use what you have to use 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.480
 about the enemy is a kind of 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.370
 psychology not if you have to sink it 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.650
 morally you have to make him feel 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.240
 enemy that he can not trace not that 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.130
 it feels so sunken that it looks 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.230
 forced to leave the game to surrender 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.880
 to stay on base and get to see the 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.350
 how much bastard or whatever that is what 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.420
 the enemy has to feel worth 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.270
 then we get that as I say to 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.790
 through giving casualties to a character or 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.370
 as you see in a very short time in 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.710
 our trina had five casualties and that 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.340
 that I took one and back because in 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:38.379
 a few minutes more back because 30 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.440
 He was almost lifeless and the truth was 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.780
 to kill but good a mere trill to 50 not 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.560
 I know how much going starting will go about 3 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.090
 minutes and something and it's already 50 already set 3 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.830
 minutes of departure and we are destroying 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.260
 the tower before the inhibitor that is 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.879
 a leftover at this time as a 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.170
 you have seen two have been demoralized and 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.110
 have left the game for the 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.780
 recent events and right now 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.250
 Heel is based on or be good now 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.430
 you see him there but later on 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.140
 will be based on worth because as you see or 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.730
 be the milk we give you are 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.739
 exaggerated in this case I charge it myself 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.290
 ok because I was a little bit 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.030
 fed up with that, that is, everything is left 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.669
 everything is trindad and as you have seen 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.139
 heel is also going or the three are 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.290
 we have gone from the game we are now 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:26.650
 same playing alone is worth my friend 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:29.110
 Ã¡lex and me and to cali that was an open and not 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.389
 we knew who we are playing alone or 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.950
 it is not fit in any head to play only 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.830
 the opposing team is a game 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.139
 whole was gone, so we're going 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.550
 to review the first step and factor and the 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.010
 more important is to have a cogna 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.090
 incredible is worth it and that nobody touches you 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.820
 in the opposite team what 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.710
 Whatever happens, it does not give up like a 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.120
 my friend who does not care that he goes to 040 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.440
 that he does not give up 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.000
 the second step we have to catch is not 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.060
 a character ope how can be trim 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.410
 dammert and give a triple murder to 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.210
 beginning a pretty murder 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.669
 substantial and make the enemy leave 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.220
 feeling useless and you feel that 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.510
 demoralized and get down to arms 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.240
 from his mother to cry valuable is 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.460
 exaggerated what needs to be done and third 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.380
 step wait for these two steps 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.720
 before the effect comes to wait for 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.630
 the seed grows and wait for the 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.410
 other of the opposite team leave 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.940
 going from the game 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.100
 and while being able to do a little pariah 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.600
 as you will see me do now and petar the 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.889
 nexus calmly or without hurry 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.750
 nor do we need to accelerate 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:27.550
 events but good visuals 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.350
 doing or is it rotated gives a tap 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.820
 he turned a tap to her I had 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.860
 to call attention to me saying come 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.710
 uncle peta to the nexus because if not, it's not going to 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.000
 be a winning in five minutes not but 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.740
 well there that is already about to petar 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.750
 half I get on base and I do not even 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.919
 kill the tower as you see invulnerable as well 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.210
 that nothing I hope you liked this 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.289
 foolishness that just did like and 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.910
 favorites and see you in the next 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.600
 next video see in next play 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.600
 chao game
