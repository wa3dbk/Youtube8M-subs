is take your companion cube which is
going<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.640> be<00:00:26.730> over<00:00:27.000> here<00:00:27.150> at<00:00:27.269> first<00:00:27.480> block<00:00:28.349> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
going to be over here at first block the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.799 
going to be over here at first block the
laser<00:00:29.689> and<00:00:30.689> then<00:00:30.929> once<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.890> laser<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.250> blocked

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
laser and then once the laser is blocked

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.150 
laser and then once the laser is blocked
this<00:00:33.809> platform<00:00:34.110> will<00:00:34.469> begin<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.800> come<00:00:34.980> down

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
this platform will begin to come down

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.319 
this platform will begin to come down
and<00:00:35.760> then<00:00:36.649> you<00:00:37.649> kind<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:37.980> want<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.309> shoot<00:00:39.210> a

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
take a cube and then just jump and then

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.570 
take a cube and then just jump and then
there<00:01:43.270> you<00:01:43.390> go<00:01:43.450> now<00:01:44.440> we're<00:01:44.650> just<00:01:44.680> going<00:01:45.160> to
