00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:06.729
 hello how about friends this time 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.099
 I'm going to present an idea like you 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:12.940
 they can make a bottle filler 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:15.480
 for example this is the pot or the 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.390
 fermentor where they have their must 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.800
 Y 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.439
 they are going to buy a tube from a hose 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.110
 depending on the diameter they have here 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.710
 on your way out 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:33.090
 and what can you design is going to be this 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.090
 way this 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.700
 are connections for the hose 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.500
 plastic 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.079
 I put half up and down and a piece 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.620
 of 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.250
 Plastic cone - shaped with 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.530
 screw 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.780
 stainless steel so you do not 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.579
 contaminate your your beer if you can see 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.629
 when I touch here the seat of the 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.440
 bottle is going to leave the beer and already full 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.050
 the bottle and stops filling 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.380
 and there is a small leak therefore it 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.900
 recommends having a frying pan out there in the 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.420
 downstairs 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.780
 and once they have enough 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.780
 beer and warn her again 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.840
 pot or its fermentor and then in fact in 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.880
 even the biggest ones 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.219
 breweries there are leaks to 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.700
 when bottling or filling 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:35.979
 barrels or at least already 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.360
 I give the idea how can you do 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.880
 a bottle filler 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.600
 and of course there's always room to 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.180
 so that they improve it then we go 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.320
 here to proceed to 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:54.050
 to fill the two bottles this hose 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.140
 comes in roll form once the 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.870
 buy put a rod so that 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.720
 Be straight and already at the time of filling 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:06.050
 they will not have this this problem of 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:11.619
 that tends to go to one side 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.619
 then let's say here we have the bottle 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.220
 start filling the same 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.739
 can be seen in the bottom 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.739
 is filling 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.270
 and once it reaches the level above 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.240
 almost 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.000
 before throwing 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.670
 and anomalous they take out a little bit that they 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.240
 you can throw it because you know there they have the 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.550
 pan and here we almost fill you in the 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:50.210
 Top part is the first 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.680
 and we continue with the second 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.680
 we have the bottle here 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.150
 is already filling 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.190
 it almost reaches the top 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.190
 we take out 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.940
 we already have almost at the level of what it should 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.940
 be filling the bottle 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.280
 and it's also a good idea that before 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.150
 pass the beer for its good I love 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.470
 bottles here have a stopcock 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.000
 well any leak or any accident 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.000
 it will not be in this key anymore 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.580
 and there is no problem while 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:35.320
 arrange 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.670
 the repair here its filling now of 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.100
 bottles 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:43.440
 let's see which parts make up 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.940
 the bottle senator or what is it 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.150
 you 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.910
 for example here use a screw 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.220
 2-inch stainless steel 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.350
 a piece of hose if they are fixed well 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.420
 roll you have to put a rod for 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:03.470
 what 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:05.569
 and stay straight and this is the connection 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.710
 simply the 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.930
 the atrocious in two parts 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.570
 and I put an up work this is a 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.170
 piece of plastic in which saying 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.989
 hole in the middle part and what 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:23.550
 work with a sandpaper 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:26.069
 I did it like half of this long what 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.160
 I worked with the sandpaper and with a file for 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:32.430
 give it the cone shape then what 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.110
 will use a hacksaw is a screwdriver 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.650
 Lime 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.440
 a tape measure or a knife or 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.030
 knife 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:47.680
 the tips the bits of the sandpaper 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.640
 you lower the clamps and this is the part 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:55.460
 for example here I had a spoon 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:58.700
 plastic and since the pieces of plastic 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.370
 here that is an easy soft plastic 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.449
 to work 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:07.600
 and in this way I made the filler of 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:09.699
 homemade bottle and you know this one 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.190
 Anything you what what what can 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:14.800
 improve simply give them the idea how 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.910
 work the bottle filler for your 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:21.510
 homemade beer and 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.630
 once again your friend the old man wishes you 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.870
 success 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.020
 in making your homemade beer 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.020
 see you later
