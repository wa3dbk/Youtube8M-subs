00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.339
 yes 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.009
 good kids and welcome to the channel 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.500
 I am mss them and we are in this steer 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.809
 as you see because weeks neither help nor 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.879
 promote if you see is a very 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.860
 controversial a subject that many of you 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.230
 talked many videos also about 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.449
 on the same subject and is one of the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.339
 many conversations that people have 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.790
 for example I am that with colleagues and 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:49.470
 that can help you write this 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.269
 I do not know what I will not do that so 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.559
 nothing I want to make a video of those that 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.120
 I say my opinion to you 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.010
 your comments is a guy like that 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.410
 what debate is worth as I said is a subject 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.670
 who speaks many times many times in 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.800
 private with your colleagues and such 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.269
 you also speak it but I want to know 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.729
 your opinion and I want us to 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.440
 mine is mine before I start with the 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.149
 I want to tell you a little about what you have 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.550
 of gameplay background is a game of 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:13.560
 weapons is an epic comeback since 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.880
 I start I start a little late you see 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.399
 I had zero points and the first one had 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.539
 already 80 or 90 I do not fix it well and the 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.190
 final ended up winning you have seen the 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.170
 last low and at the beginning that is this 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.119
 pool is beautiful all over the head 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.450
 pity that we graben light because it 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.610
 see as the repetition as I jump as it 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.659
 the key the head as it falls with the 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.659
 knife 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.249
 ok I want to tell you that the cut a 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.439
 little because for the moment that the guarantor 

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:40.229
 is that the ballista gives me very badly that is 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.719
 disgusting and more with the metallic sight 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.219
 they kill four or five times in a row 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:46.020
 kill anyone felt then what I 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:47.939
 remove those four times in a row and put 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.319
 the time they kill me first and the last 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.599
 crematorium is ok you will see 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:52.829
 perfect it does not show or anything but good 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:54.689
 you have to tell it so you know that 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.609
 they are thinly cut although it does not have no 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.990
 It is very important so we have already 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:00.450
 the topic what we wanted to talk about because 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.759
 an ex leader help me and promote it 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.259
 as you already know so you do not know who 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.799
 in English that I very much doubt July King is 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.450
 a kid he has has a channel with 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.879
 700 thousand subscribers if I'm not wrong 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.890
 700 thousand voucher is the second most channel 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.349
 great from spain since now the blond 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.030
 It has the largest channel in Spain and 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.010
 is a channel dedicated to gameplays not 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.840
 many people, most people who see 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.599
 speedy gameplays from willy renown 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.549
 go through the little ones of 500 thousand two 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.349
 thousand three thousand his vouchers that are small 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.489
 between them there will be a bigger one but 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.160
 they are all very small compared to 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.900
 willy others because as you know the child 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.670
 promotion or help anyone at all 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.290
 as much then to help those who 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.299
 They are more or less the same size that 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.280
 type stacks and so on so that for 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.189
 that also help him not then my 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.359
 idea is that it is for wild ex youtube 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.739
 it has become more than just a hobby 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.359
 become more something more than something that 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.329
 liked it has become a business or has it 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:53.069
 returned his work and that is supposed to 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:56.099
 promoting someone or helping 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.930
 someone that means that people 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.370
 go through your channel ie if will grace 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.260
 for example, they gave me like me or 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.010
 online media to another that does something 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.230
 it seemed boring 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.849
 that is to say gameplays because the best 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.319
 you do always give us you 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.670
 give to me or give to anyone 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.019
 people would go through my videos it 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.000
 would go through your video would go through the 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.670
 video that would have given like in case 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.639
 that he saw that the channel is equal 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.919
 good or more even more or equal 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.389
 Well, people will start to see that channel 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.560
 I would start to stop seeing a bit of 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:24.419
 bullying then to willy what 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.819
 it leads to promoting someone or 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:31.040
 helping someone is less people for him 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.040
 So I think that this one 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.689
 to this time that is already on youtube 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.790
 for youtube is more like I 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:38.170
 fact that a hobby is already a business already 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.299
 it's your job then how it's done 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.590
 so promoting someone would be less 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.659
 money for him because fewer people than him 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.010
 would see is less what would the 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.870
 video then imagine that he 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.730
 will promote well with a lot of people 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.530
 that I do not see anything wrong 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.840
 once a week to someone because in 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.090
 four or five weeks in a month month and 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.209
 half of it would have half the people who 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.620
 I would see him as limpets to people who 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.090
 example elias promotes that other 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.129
 I would like another one who is one of the 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.810
 famous is not famous many people what 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.079
 know me at least I still like it 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.940
 quite the channel but if I keep seeing 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:12.069
 to them but willy they are afraid of 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.480
 that people stop seeing you because as I have 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.760
 said for her it's a business not here 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.109
 You see that the ballistics failed against 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.729
 same that carries the final ballistic of 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.190
 infarction you see that I also slashes the 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.840
 fucker gets me in a gun with him 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.460
 tie him again and I think I do the 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.560
 last low the same here you have already 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.030
 is going to finish the video leave me your 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.380
 seem in the comments that it is very 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.660
 important, do not forget to leave 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.820
 you like with that saying comment that 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.229
 it seems to you if wilileaks she does it for 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.910
 business puts new comments that 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.260
 it seems because it does not help and others do not forget 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.480
 subscribe if you are not 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.480
