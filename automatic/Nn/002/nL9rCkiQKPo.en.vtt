00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 for all that such a one more day to the 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.440
 channel in today's video I bring you one 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.219
 small review barrabÃ¡s and a review without 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.150
 no type of bar on two products 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.740
 that I bought myself from kobe bryant in 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.780
 Christmas you have seen my blogs 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.539
 you know that at Christmas he extends me with 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.550
 the products and today I come to talk about 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.800
 my trico put them bobby braun and today 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.480
 I come to talk about the proofreader and the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.670
 chemicals and reading 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.770
 These two products according to boy brown are 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.780
 the perfect duo to say goodbye to the 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.280
 dark circles the first product we have 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.350
 but they sold separately 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.150
 recommend how to buy them together 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.600
 first product is the proofreader I have 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.970
 the bis tone that is a product that 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.710
 you have to put before you put what 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.000
 would be the corrector of all life in 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.190
 Spanish although this is what I call it 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.140
 corrector to camouflage the area of 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.420
 dark circles according to the color of your dark circles 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.089
 and you have more brown more grace for 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.800
 take out one tone or another as I said I have 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:01.129
 the beige tone that this product brings one 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.649
 with four grams nothing and less and costs 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.649
 about twenty-five euros and then 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.490
 after putting after putting more the 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:09.710
 corrector we would put what they 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.899
 they call get or that in Spanish is 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.880
 life-long corrector that I bring a 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.590
 corrector to unify the color and ones 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.240
 powders to seal the two products and 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.729
 that remain intact I have the 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.140
 warm tone and gori and bring one with four 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.420
 grams of product in cream cried with 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.220
 seven grams of the product powder and 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.770
 this costs a whopping nothing more and 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.980
 nothing more and nothing more and nothing less than 35 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.420
 euros 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.640
 after having been using the two 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.370
 products I have clear that one has 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.870
 delighted and the other I think that pull 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.910
 the money buying what the one that has 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.770
 delighted is the concealer because the use 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.900
 In addition every day to camouflage 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.430
 dark circles under my eyes I have always 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.580
 said and I will always say that I am not a 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.590
 girl with lots of dark circles but this one 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.450
 helps camouflage the little darkness 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.920
 I really like it, I do not 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.990
 mark the expression lines is a 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.400
 product that spreads a lot and as well 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.950
 we just have to put it in the area 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.170
 inside we put it quickly and 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.610
 then we can put over those that 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.110
 I put on my makeup base but I do not 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.060
 it is due and they that I put the vice 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.950
 illuminator of deliplus identifies 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.930
 pretty good the tone with the skin and this 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.370
 I like it a lot and I think the purchase 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.310
 great and wonderful and that is the 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.140
 I recommend to everyone the truth 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.490
 but instead the chemist schiller does not 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.990
 He liked it a lot because it is true 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.240
 that I bought it after I had 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.000
 try in the store and I loved it in the 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.260
 I was sorry and I loved it but it gives me the 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.120
 feeling that even though it is a 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.350
 product that they call cream and that 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.000
 supposes that it is very creamy to be 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.950
 it diffuses very well and that's good 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.140
 it melts very well with the brand skin 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.920
 very very much the lines of 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.870
 expression 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.270
 the lines that we have just below 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.300
 the zone of the eyepiece of the zone of 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.250
 lower eyelid although we do not have it 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.989
 well I have tried with more correctors 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.880
 light with more sumptuous correctors and 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.069
 I do not like it I do not like it because it marks me 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.959
 all lines of expression unify 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.750
 all perfectly unify the tone very 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.000
 good and gives a lighting of the area 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.800
 beautiful but I do not like that 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.660
 mark those little edges because I 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.970
 it gives the feeling that that makes me 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.849
 look older than that area seems to me 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.100
 that looks older so I'm going 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:11.440
 to spend because good is a very product 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.980
 expensive cost me 35 euros as I say 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.720
 but I did not like the fact is that 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.510
 just what use is that in everyday life not 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.850
 I use it for nothing so good then I'm going 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.790
 to leave I do not know if on top of these videos 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.440
 or now at the end a video in which 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.910
 I come out with the face totally is 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.620
 makeup and I put the two products 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.870
 in one dark circles and in the other not so that 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.370
 you see the difference because really the 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.460
 corrector I recommend that today so you 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.740
 try it because it is very very good but 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.180
 what would be called the cook not what 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.010
 I recommend because you can wear the 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.930
 concealer to camouflage the eyecup and then 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.030
 put on any other concealer that you 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.750
 unifique and I'll take the draft 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.150
 from ribery we go to 100 times before 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.189
 with this one 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.659
 If I had if I had not marked 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:56.670
 lines I would have stayed with this 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.370
 because there is something that is beautiful but 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.560
 is that after ten minutes you get 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.280
 accumulate all the wrinkles and there is no 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.579
 nothing nice and nothing chic and nothing of 35 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.579
 euros 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.570
 and 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.570
 Y 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.090
 Y 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.020
 so nothing like this things this video has 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.090
 been very express but I hope that I have 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.400
 liked to tell me if you want to see some 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.690
 review of today's high line brown that 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.639
 I also bought it these past 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.350
 Christmas and nothing that a little kiss 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.610
 Strong that you spend a great day and 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.120
 that we see you soon a new 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.120
