 very soon ends soon and that 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.680
 doubt what to do after hanging the

 Robson changed the lawns for the life of 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.789
 entrepreneurs, the idea is to start with a

 fitness facility and then ride 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.059
 a network plus a difficulty soon 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.100
 start with the big idea 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.200
 the problem was that he will do gym

 about $ 11,000 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.320
 the solution was to manufacture the device it 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.950
 borrowed a mat the model 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.409

 we could adapt and started to 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.840
 history started there 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.960
 the equipment is born in the computer 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.630
 simulations sample tests the movements 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.270
 after the project is approved it starts to 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.430
 first production in this factory that makes 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.430
 every part of tooling and machining 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.270

 adalberto washers how this 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.360
 equipment works with the system 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.130
 electromagnetic charge and this causes 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.350
 the equipment is much lighter for you 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.450

 is repeated only with the right leg and only 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.940
 with the left 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.700
 the machine costs 20 thousand reais this 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.420
 entrance mat for dvd and 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.880

 modern production systems and 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.540
 apply everything here in jaboticabal 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.670
 I traveled a lot with china to understand the 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.680
 theirs how they can manufacture 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:45.810
 a product is fast as they contain a 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.730
 their production line and I got to know 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.070
 American companies that is manufacturing a 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:54.530
 quality product 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.990
 and in the wake of the old factory gym 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.630
 also grew today is one of the largest 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:03.140
 Brazil occupies an area of ​​25 thousand meters 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.510
 but represents 5% of the 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.690
 of the group it only remains 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.210
 because the 1800 students have a 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.150
 very important role are the first 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:17.959
 to test each new equipment and they 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.959
 ask affection runs do strength of the other 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.360
 the union will not leave this report 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.390
 end up not working a little bit not with 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.980
 sure you can be sure that so 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.370
 to end the story that turns off the 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.510
 cameras I'm going to look at me and robson has to
