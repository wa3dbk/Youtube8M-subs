00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
quite honest and whilst I like the fact

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.880 
quite honest and whilst I like the fact
that<00:02:20.230> they've<00:02:20.410> put<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.680> in<00:02:20.800> there<00:02:21.070> I<00:02:21.390> like<00:02:22.390> it

that they've put it in there I like it

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.640 
that they've put it in there I like it
but<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:24.300> can't<00:02:25.300> get<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.510> decent<00:02:25.960> pose<00:02:26.380> out<00:02:26.560> of

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
but you can't get a decent pose out of

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.100 
but you can't get a decent pose out of
it<00:02:26.800> I<00:02:27.010> haven't<00:02:27.310> got<00:02:28.240> a<00:02:28.270> pose<00:02:28.540> I'm<00:02:28.720> happy<00:02:28.900> with

it I haven't got a pose I'm happy with

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.110 
it I haven't got a pose I'm happy with
because<00:02:29.230> obviously<00:02:29.560> he'd<00:02:29.680> usually<00:02:29.890> be<00:02:30.250> kind

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
because obviously he'd usually be kind

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.560 
because obviously he'd usually be kind
of<00:02:31.180> up<00:02:31.840> in<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.110> air<00:02:32.230> with<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:34.090> know<00:02:34.240> kind

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
to stand up so I'm debating whether to

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.900

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
just playing but then he's out taking a

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.490 
just playing but then he's out taking a
bit<00:02:44.980> far<00:02:45.250> I<00:02:45.520> don't<00:02:46.150> know<00:02:46.209> so<00:02:46.510> it's<00:02:46.600> okay<00:02:46.690> it's
