00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.670
 and we are here at the low cost gaming pc 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:22.610
 of 700 euros in this case we will use 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.990
 a motherboard asus m 5 997 lr 2.0 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.130
 ballack and you can see it a little bit with 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.560
 more detail is a good plate in 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.590
 RAM memory quality-price ratio 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.550
 sarunas christ in hyper x bits ddr3 of 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:41.120
 1613 312 thousand 808 gigabyte in two models 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.690
 of 4 gigas every 19 of which we make use it 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.030
 thermaltake command more script and snow 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.829
 edition is worth that I imagine it is new 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.219
 edition would be that it is white worth should 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.510
 be prepared for base plates x that 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.390
 is the one we have selected in this 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.980
 instantly worth is a box that keeps 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.059
 very good air flow in this case 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.510
 we have also chosen font 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.850
 feeding a cro 7 x 600 v2 of 600 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.210
 watts bull 10 series 80 plus bronze 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.920
 vale is a very good source of great 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.869
 brand and great quality 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.310
 and good of reader already you know we chose 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.750
 the cheapest there is because we are not going 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.180
 to use almost that in this case it would be a 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:22.670
 the shaft gh24 ns 95 dvd recorder 24 x 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.869
 black what would we be going to put in 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.340
 this case is the lowest we have 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.110
 our processor moments we go 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:33.439
 to say once an mdc x series 8.153 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.250
 like 6 gigahertz each nucleus a plank 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.390
 edition that are eight real cores worth 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.759
 we have to say that good yes that is 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.229
 truth that the best the subject 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:46.069
 quality-price would be better the series to 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.720
 of dvd but in this case good I do not know 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:50.220
 Stop a little more for a little more 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.350
 of power goes of guys 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.210
 for hard disk has chosen a 7 for 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.650
 q of 7200 point 200 gb sata 3 and you will say 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.030
 because you have chosen 500 gigabytes good 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.940
 Well the explanation comes next 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.420
 ok is the explanation I have decided 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.030
 put a key sones de know v300 of 60 gb 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.770
 It's worth 57 euros that the price is very 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.210
 well two of the best but it's very 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.000
 Well, it's not going to work here 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.740
 we will install the operating system and the 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.960
 programs that we want to shoot faster 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.240
 60 gigas is a bit limited but 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.459
 good more or less to use it in 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.200
 necessary and that will serve us with 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.900
 this we win good we won that in the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.800
 500 GB hard drive let's keep 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.540
 stored the things that go to your 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.890
 community and in this one for good the system 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.540
 operative mainly so that 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.700
 boot the computer in a series of 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.380
 very fast very fast time of 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.480
 what we are used to now 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.040
 and finally the graphics card that 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.890
 choose or if a girl byte radio hd 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.450
 6850 or is 2 gigahertz 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:53.870
 cr 5 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:56.060
 of 200 of 2 gb that is the graph yes that 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.830
 it's true thing returns no kind of 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.870
 problem also remember that this 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.080
 neither goes about the graph it is also 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.970
 the type of optimization that the 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.980
 dvd with graphics on the tiles 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.019
 different types of video games and that 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.330
 will greatly influence the quality of the 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.400
 time to play in the three vouchers guys 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.500
 so well this is all for today here 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.000
 I leave the pc chemo balconies of 700 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.680
 euros here you see the final price that 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.090
 would be 700 16.90 euros and well 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.160
 up to two guys remember that depression 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.860
 chapter will be 800 euros 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.230
