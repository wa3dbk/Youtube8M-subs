00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.339 
these little mini quads I'm not real
comfortable<00:00:10.980> flying<00:00:11.519> mini<00:00:11.820> quads<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.570> play<00:00:13.110> the

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
comfortable flying mini quads I play the

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.450 
comfortable flying mini quads I play the
mid<00:00:13.830> sized<00:00:14.040> are<00:00:14.250> bigger<00:00:15.470> and<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:17.130> I'm<00:00:17.279> getting

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
mid sized are bigger and so I'm getting

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.890 
mid sized are bigger and so I'm getting
used<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.150> going<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.420> be<00:00:18.510> my<00:00:18.660> third

used to it this is going to be my third

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.279 
used to it this is going to be my third
flight<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.890> quad<00:00:20.240> its<00:00:21.240> claim<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.810> fame<00:00:22.020> is

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
flight of this quad its claim to fame is

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.170 
flight of this quad its claim to fame is
it's<00:00:22.560> at<00:00:22.710> stream<00:00:23.039> gallery<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.730> what<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:23.939> mean

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
it's at stream gallery and what I mean

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.450 
it's at stream gallery and what I mean
it's<00:00:24.330> stream<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.960> mean<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.470> stream<00:00:25.830> you'll

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
it's stream I mean that stream you'll

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.189 
it's stream I mean that stream you'll
see<00:00:26.670> especially<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.240> high<00:00:27.449> but<00:00:27.720> even<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.050> low

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
see especially on high but even on low

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.849 
see especially on high but even on low
rate<00:00:28.849> it's<00:00:29.849> very<00:00:30.119> fast<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:31.380> takes<00:00:31.619> these

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
rate it's very fast it takes these

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.350 
rate it's very fast it takes these
little<00:00:32.219> bitty<00:00:33.469> 150<00:00:34.469> mil<00:00:34.770> amp<00:00:35.070> batteries<00:00:35.820> and

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
little bitty 150 mil amp batteries and

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.270 
little bitty 150 mil amp batteries and
I've<00:00:36.510> got<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> lot<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.079> these<00:00:37.170> before<00:00:37.530> my<00:00:37.649> cg<00:00:38.100> 0

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
I've got a lot of these before my cg 0

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.459 
I've got a lot of these before my cg 0
to<00:00:38.460> 3<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:38.940> I'm<00:00:39.090> repurposing<00:00:39.780> them<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.079> use<00:00:40.230> them

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
to 3 so I'm repurposing them to use them

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.100 
to 3 so I'm repurposing them to use them
in<00:00:40.590> here<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.149> so<00:00:42.149> let's<00:00:42.390> go<00:00:42.540> for<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> flight

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
in here and so let's go for a flight

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.470 
in here and so let's go for a flight
again<00:00:44.040> I'm<00:00:44.219> really<00:00:44.760> getting<00:00:45.059> used<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.329> this

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
again I'm really getting used to this

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.150 
again I'm really getting used to this
I'm<00:00:45.719> not<00:00:45.809> comfortable<00:00:46.140> with<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.590> quad<00:00:46.890> yet

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
I'm not comfortable with this quad yet

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.400 
I'm not comfortable with this quad yet
so<00:00:47.489> I'm<00:00:48.210> not<00:00:48.329> gonna<00:00:48.480> be<00:00:48.629> flying<00:00:48.870> at<00:00:49.079> all<00:00:49.200> that

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
so I'm not gonna be flying at all that

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.910 
so I'm not gonna be flying at all that

the y'all read on it so let's go for a
flight

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.069 

so<00:01:12.140> I'm<00:01:12.260> in<00:01:12.380> low-rate<00:01:12.800> right<00:01:13.040> now

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
so I'm in low-rate right now

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:18.139 
so I'm in low-rate right now
and<00:01:16.079> this<00:01:16.469> is<00:01:16.649> the<00:01:16.829> yawn<00:01:17.039> it<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.729> low<00:01:17.909> rate

pretty decent huh and we flip over to

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.219 
pretty decent huh and we flip over to
high<00:01:25.049> rate<00:01:25.609> get<00:01:26.609> it<00:01:26.729> up<00:01:26.850> here<00:01:27.179> because<00:01:27.450> here's

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
comfortable with these little things

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.719 
comfortable with these little things
they<00:02:07.100> get<00:02:07.220> away<00:02:07.340> from<00:02:07.460> me<00:02:07.729> quick<00:02:09.459> you<00:02:10.459> gonna

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
back down here there we go

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.790 
back down here there we go
all<00:02:15.620> right<00:02:16.930> I'll<00:02:17.930> try<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.170> do<00:02:18.350> some<00:02:18.530> general

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
all right I'll try to do some general

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.160 
all right I'll try to do some general
flow<00:02:18.950> of<00:02:19.070> it<00:02:19.160> so<00:02:19.850> it's<00:02:20.209> clean<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.600> famous<00:02:20.959> that

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
flow of it so it's clean the famous that

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.110 
flow of it so it's clean the famous that
is<00:02:21.350> streamed<00:02:21.709> all<00:02:21.950> read<00:02:22.190> on<00:02:22.370> it<00:02:22.520> but<00:02:22.850> I<00:02:22.880> also

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
is streamed all read on it but I also

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.630 
is streamed all read on it but I also
think<00:02:23.480> that's<00:02:23.630> its<00:02:23.900> Achilles<00:02:24.230> heel<00:02:24.640> because

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
think that's its Achilles heel because

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.150 
think that's its Achilles heel because
in<00:02:25.910> high<00:02:26.090> rate<00:02:26.360> it's<00:02:27.050> really<00:02:27.440> not<00:02:27.620> useful

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
in high rate it's really not useful

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.220 
in high rate it's really not useful
you<00:02:28.459> cannot<00:02:28.760> bank<00:02:29.120> with<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.570> so<00:02:29.750> lower<00:02:30.019> Heat

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
you cannot bank with it so lower Heat

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.070 
you cannot bank with it so lower Heat
see<00:02:30.769> I<00:02:30.800> can<00:02:31.010> kind<00:02:31.250> of<00:02:31.370> Bank<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:31.670> little<00:02:31.940> bit<00:02:35.080> get

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
see I can kind of Bank a little bit get

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.479 
see I can kind of Bank a little bit get
to<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.410> right<00:02:36.560> just<00:02:36.800> lightly<00:02:37.070> so<00:02:37.459> it's

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
to the right just lightly so it's

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.930 
to the right just lightly so it's
controllable<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:39.709> low<00:02:39.890> rate<00:02:40.130> you<00:02:40.519> put<00:02:40.760> it<00:02:40.880> in

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
controllable and low rate you put it in

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.820 
controllable and low rate you put it in
high<00:02:41.090> rate<00:02:43.030> you<00:02:44.030> barely<00:02:44.330> move<00:02:44.660> your<00:02:44.959> finger

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
high rate you barely move your finger

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.370 
high rate you barely move your finger
over<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.220> yah<00:02:46.519> stick<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.180> it's<00:02:47.959> just<00:02:48.200> out<00:02:48.350> of

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
over the yah stick and it's just out of

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.660 
over the yah stick and it's just out of
control<00:02:53.320> but<00:02:54.320> I<00:02:54.410> kind<00:02:54.680> of<00:02:54.769> enjoyed<00:02:55.040> flying<00:02:55.310> it

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
control but I kind of enjoyed flying it

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.370 
control but I kind of enjoyed flying it
in<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.910> low<00:02:56.090> rate<00:02:56.329> but<00:02:56.540> it<00:02:56.690> still<00:02:56.900> gets<00:02:57.110> away

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
in the low rate but it still gets away

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:04.530 
in the low rate but it still gets away
from<00:02:57.680> me<00:02:57.829> as<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:58.820> saw<00:02:59.000> earlier

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.990 

it's<00:03:05.049> a<00:03:05.260> nice<00:03:05.470> flyer<00:03:06.060> it's<00:03:07.060> a<00:03:07.330> smooth<00:03:08.140> player

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.410 

decent<00:03:11.780> amount<00:03:12.020> of<00:03:12.080> power<00:03:12.290> for<00:03:12.620> a<00:03:12.680> little<00:03:12.800> quad

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
decent amount of power for a little quad

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.910 
decent amount of power for a little quad
and<00:03:14.420> I<00:03:14.720> got<00:03:14.900> about<00:03:15.080> a<00:03:15.140> five<00:03:15.350> knot<00:03:15.590> breeze

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
and I got about a five knot breeze

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.560 
and I got about a five knot breeze
blowing<00:03:16.280> right<00:03:16.520> at<00:03:16.730> it<00:03:16.880> right<00:03:17.060> now<00:03:17.240> and<00:03:17.420> it

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
blowing right at it right now and it

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:29.750 
blowing right at it right now and it
handles<00:03:18.320> that<00:03:18.470> no<00:03:18.650> problem

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.400 

and<00:03:30.760> that's<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.090> yaw<00:03:31.270> rate<00:03:31.540> low<00:03:31.810> which<00:03:32.200> isn't

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
and that's a yaw rate low which isn't

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.450 
and that's a yaw rate low which isn't
really<00:03:33.070> fast<00:03:33.760> for<00:03:34.060> most<00:03:34.240> quads

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:52.640 

and<00:03:38.460> that's<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.820> funnels

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.229 

but<00:03:53.650> unless<00:03:54.129> you<00:03:54.310> got<00:03:54.489> skills<00:03:54.819> like<00:03:55.090> the

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
but unless you got skills like the

respect his flying skills which is
that's<00:04:02.349> b.src<00:04:04.200> he's<00:04:05.200> really<00:04:05.499> good<00:04:05.650> at<00:04:05.739> flying

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
that's b.src he's really good at flying

um unless you have their skills the high
rate<00:04:11.500> is<00:04:11.799> no<00:04:12.459> good<00:04:12.700> to<00:04:12.879> you<00:04:13.000> on<00:04:13.150> this<00:04:13.359> it's

rate is no good to you on this it's
pretty<00:04:14.109> much<00:04:14.230> unusable<00:04:14.519> it's<00:04:15.519> just<00:04:15.760> more<00:04:15.939> of<00:04:16.030> a

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
pretty much unusable it's just more of a

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.849 
pretty much unusable it's just more of a
novelty<00:04:16.539> to<00:04:16.660> show<00:04:16.989> your<00:04:17.169> friends<00:04:17.470> how<00:04:17.530> fast

novelty to show your friends how fast
they<00:04:18.009> can<00:04:18.070> spin<00:04:18.570> but<00:04:19.570> on<00:04:19.840> low<00:04:20.079> rate<00:04:22.470> it's

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
they can spin but on low rate it's

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.070 
they can spin but on low rate it's
pretty<00:04:23.740> nice<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:28.030> it<00:04:28.180> lights<00:04:28.389> up<00:04:28.570> really<00:04:28.870> nice

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
pretty nice and it lights up really nice

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.909 
pretty nice and it lights up really nice
red<00:04:29.800> in<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:29.979> front<00:04:30.160> blue<00:04:30.669> in<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.210> back<00:04:31.560> I<00:04:32.560> did

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
red in the front blue in the back I did

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.249 
red in the front blue in the back I did
try<00:04:33.220> it<00:04:33.250> my<00:04:33.759> second<00:04:34.150> flight<00:04:34.210> at<00:04:34.509> night<00:04:34.720> and<00:04:35.080> it

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:35.259 
try it my second flight at night and it

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.710 
try it my second flight at night and it
lights<00:04:35.470> up<00:04:35.590> really<00:04:35.860> nice<00:04:36.070> so<00:04:36.370> so<00:04:37.120> decent<00:04:37.389> night

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
lights up really nice so so decent night

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.779 
lights up really nice so so decent night
flyer<00:04:37.990> actually<00:04:38.860> it's<00:04:39.009> better<00:04:39.220> to<00:04:39.430> fly<00:04:39.639> at

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
flyer actually it's better to fly at

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.420 
flyer actually it's better to fly at
night<00:04:39.970> because<00:04:40.240> you<00:04:41.199> can<00:04:41.410> keep<00:04:41.590> orientation

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
night because you can keep orientation

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:48.650 
night because you can keep orientation
of<00:04:42.550> it<00:04:42.699> better

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.960 

I<00:04:48.750> find<00:04:49.500> it<00:04:49.650> a<00:04:49.680> little<00:04:49.800> difficult<00:04:50.400> to<00:04:50.460> I<00:04:50.610> keep

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
I find it a little difficult to I keep

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.460 
I find it a little difficult to I keep
the<00:04:51.120> orientation<00:04:51.810> on<00:04:51.900> these<00:04:52.050> little<00:04:52.230> bitty

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
the orientation on these little bitty

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.350 
the orientation on these little bitty
quads<00:04:52.830> that's<00:04:53.730> why<00:04:53.910> I'm<00:04:54.030> much<00:04:54.180> more

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
quads that's why I'm much more

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.790 
quads that's why I'm much more
comfortable<00:04:54.570> with<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.140> mid-sized<00:04:55.560> to<00:04:55.770> large

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
comfortable with the mid-sized to large

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:34.600 
comfortable with the mid-sized to large
quads

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.909 

let's<00:05:35.240> see<00:05:35.569> what<00:05:35.720> it<00:05:35.810> looks<00:05:35.840> like<00:05:36.020> up<00:05:36.289> close<00:05:36.319> if

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
let's see what it looks like up close if

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:44.230 
let's see what it looks like up close if
I<00:05:37.240> get<00:05:38.240> it<00:05:38.330> back<00:05:38.479> over<00:05:38.689> here<00:05:42.759> wind<00:05:43.759> is<00:05:43.969> pushing

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
I get it back over here wind is pushing

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:59.780 
I get it back over here wind is pushing
it

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.659 

 my<00:06:01.000> LVC<00:06:01.750> warning<00:06:01.780> is<00:06:02.770> coming<00:06:03.160> on<00:06:03.280> so<00:06:03.490> that

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
 my LVC warning is coming on so that

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.060 
 my LVC warning is coming on so that
battery<00:06:04.030> is<00:06:04.150> spent<00:06:04.450> it<00:06:05.080> seems<00:06:05.380> to<00:06:05.590> blow

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
battery is spent it seems to blow

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.120 
battery is spent it seems to blow
through<00:06:06.280> batteries<00:06:06.700> pretty<00:06:06.970> fast<00:06:07.650> so<00:06:08.650> again

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
through batteries pretty fast so again

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:15.210 
through batteries pretty fast so again
this<00:06:09.250> is<00:06:09.460> eaching<00:06:09.970> h8<00:06:10.720> mini<00:06:11.500> and<00:06:13.050> i<00:06:14.070> think<00:06:15.070> it's

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
this is eaching h8 mini and i think it's

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.520 
this is eaching h8 mini and i think it's
a<00:06:15.310> fun<00:06:15.490> little<00:06:15.580> quad<00:06:15.850> and<00:06:16.090> low<00:06:16.240> rate<00:06:16.480> high<00:06:17.230> rate

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
a fun little quad and low rate high rate

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:18.480 
a fun little quad and low rate high rate
more<00:06:17.740> of<00:06:17.860> a<00:06:17.950> novelty

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
more of a novelty

those common 150,000,000 batteries
they're<00:06:30.370> only<00:06:30.520> about<00:06:30.639> 2<00:06:30.880> bucks<00:06:31.030> apiece<00:06:31.470> so

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470
