00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
really fast boot up but it also has

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.639 
really fast boot up but it also has
really<00:00:42.600> good<00:00:42.719> sustained<00:00:43.020> performance<00:00:43.170> some

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
really good sustained performance some

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.590 
really good sustained performance some
of<00:00:43.710> our<00:00:43.829> competitors<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:45.300> know<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.510> great

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
of our competitors you know it's great

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.569 
of our competitors you know it's great
fresh<00:00:45.930> out<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.200> box<00:00:46.230> but<00:00:46.770> after<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.370> start

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
fresh out of the box but after you start

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.889 
fresh out of the box but after you start
using<00:00:47.730> start<00:00:48.090> playing<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> game<00:00:48.539> starts

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
using start playing the game starts

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.209 
using start playing the game starts
slowing<00:00:49.140> down<00:00:49.379> right<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.070> same

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
slowing down right this is same

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.439 
slowing down right this is same
performance<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.850> guy<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.300> gets

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
performance on this guy it just gets

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.880 
performance on this guy it just gets
better<00:00:51.600> over<00:00:51.930> time<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.350> that's<00:00:52.530> something<00:00:52.710> we

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
better over time so that's something we

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.049 
better over time so that's something we
really<00:00:53.039> prior<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.460> rise<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.879> Drive

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
really prior to rise on this Drive

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.060 
really prior to rise on this Drive
awesome<00:00:54.660> that's<00:00:54.899> great<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.949> you're

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
saying this is a step a cut above the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.540 
saying this is a step a cut above the
vertex<00:00:57.989> 4<00:00:58.199> right<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.710> also<00:00:59.309> widely

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
vertex 4 right it is also widely

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.569 
vertex 4 right it is also widely
successful<00:00:59.789> um<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.350> kind<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.859> makes<00:01:02.430> me

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
sad because I actually own to vertex 4

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.080 
sad because I actually own to vertex 4
is<00:01:04.500> still<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.890> great<00:01:05.040> Drive<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.880> still<00:01:06.060> a

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
feel better but I remember the vertex 4

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.770 
feel better but I remember the vertex 4
really<00:01:10.409> excelled<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.270> right<00:01:12.270> performance

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
really excelled in right performance

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.000 
really excelled in right performance
yeah<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.170> know<00:01:13.260> sequential<00:01:13.650> writes

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
yeah you know sequential writes

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.010 
yeah you know sequential writes
especially<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> similar<00:01:15.600> story<00:01:15.780> with

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
especially is it a similar story with

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.570 
especially is it a similar story with
with<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.350> drug<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.159> actually<00:01:17.369> we

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
with this drug is it is actually we

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.190 
with this drug is it is actually we
actually<00:01:18.060> balanced<00:01:18.450> out<00:01:18.540> both<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.810> reason

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
actually balanced out both the reason

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.240 
actually balanced out both the reason
right<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.470> they're<00:01:19.590> actually<00:01:19.799> both<00:01:20.009> higher

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
right so they're actually both higher

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.580 
right so they're actually both higher
nice<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> total<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.869> ops<00:01:22.020> are<00:01:22.170> also<00:01:22.320> better

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
nice but the total I ops are also better

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.679 
nice but the total I ops are also better
as<00:01:22.770> well<00:01:22.920> too<00:01:23.100> awesome<00:01:23.580> great<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.030> that's<00:01:24.360> so

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.539 
as well too awesome great and that's so
you<00:01:24.750> heard<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.080> other<00:01:25.290> earlier<00:01:25.770> what<00:01:26.070> Alex

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
you heard that other earlier what Alex

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.679 
you heard that other earlier what Alex
said<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.150> more<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.330> fill<00:01:27.570> up<00:01:27.659> your

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
said is that the more you fill up your

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.020 
said is that the more you fill up your
drive<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.320> lot<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.680> SSDs<00:01:29.070> will<00:01:29.280> actually<00:01:29.610> tank

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
drive a lot of SSDs will actually tank

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.580 
drive a lot of SSDs will actually tank
and<00:01:30.240> performance<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.020> more<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.200> fill<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.530> up

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
and performance the more you fill it up

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.920 
and performance the more you fill it up
but<00:01:32.070> they've<00:01:32.670> kind<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:32.970> leveled<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.479> level<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
but they've kind of leveled it level the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.300 
but they've kind of leveled it level the
playing<00:01:34.110> field<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.770> don't<00:01:34.950> you

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
playing field so that you don't you

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.859 
playing field so that you don't you
don't<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.700> start<00:01:35.970> plummeting<00:01:36.540> after<00:01:36.840> a

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
don't just start plummeting after a

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.450 
don't just start plummeting after a
certain<00:01:37.079> point<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.470> capacity<00:01:38.009> being<00:01:38.189> filled

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
certain point of capacity being filled

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.249 
certain point of capacity being filled
it<00:01:38.880> kind<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.060> just<00:01:39.240> plateaus<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:40.020> still

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
it kind of just plateaus and you still

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.109 
it kind of just plateaus and you still
get<00:01:40.619> sustainable<00:01:41.159> performance<00:01:41.310> which<00:01:42.000> is

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
get sustainable performance which is

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.340 
get sustainable performance which is
always<00:01:42.270> very<00:01:42.390> important<00:01:42.930> especially<00:01:43.079> if

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
always very important especially if

this is a kind of a unveiling of the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.200 
this is a kind of a unveiling of the
next<00:01:49.439> generation<00:01:49.799> drive<00:01:50.009> for<00:01:50.220> sre<00:01:50.549> intrepid<00:01:50.970> 3

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
this uses their Everest to platform

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.469 
this uses their Everest to platform
which<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.680> used<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.219> some<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.119> our<00:02:03.210> consumer

which we used in a some of our consumer

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.090 
which we used in a some of our consumer
drives<00:02:03.810> but<00:02:03.990> we<00:02:04.110> bumped<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.469> up<00:02:04.560> also<00:02:04.890> put<00:02:05.070> a

90,000 I ops and it's not just about

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.240 
90,000 I ops and it's not just about
speed<00:02:16.840> on<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.439> enterprise<00:02:17.680> drive<00:02:17.920> is<00:02:18.069> also

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
speed on the enterprise drive is also

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.800 
speed on the enterprise drive is also
about<00:02:18.310> enhancing<00:02:18.670> reliability<00:02:19.269> and<00:02:19.480> we've

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
about enhancing reliability and we've

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.030 
about enhancing reliability and we've
really<00:02:19.989> done<00:02:20.019> that<00:02:20.140> with<00:02:20.409> interrupted<00:02:20.859> three

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
really done that with interrupted three
