00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 good of all here we are in 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:08.160
 minecraft 1.7 point 10 and appeared here 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.500
 what's right here is next to the town efe 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:20.840
 I do not think he has money 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:23.630
 why there is a gap here but good 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.900
 I put the seed because it's cool because 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.369
 appears here is right in the village is 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.850
 pretty cool but well let's see a 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.850
 minimum 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:38.989
 kid who convinced the whole 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.210
 this is curious you have more than another 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.769
 thing especially to hunt ndr mans but 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.620
 well beyond this block here in derman 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:47.660
 disruptor be here just add this 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.000
 block to follow is a micro mode or 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.610
 txiki mod or minimal but good the 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.440
 project unintentionally worth the question is 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.899
 that the block is made with an eye of 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.520
 ender 4 of obsidian and four rods of 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.130
 steel 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.000
 how are these rare iron bars and 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.430
 where we tested it right here the question 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.840
 is that this block does not do anything 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.280
 it's just like that but what it does is 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.440
 prevent Germans from being able to 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.110
 teleport in fact we have to 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.310
 give your shot in the face that gives me back 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.310
 the arrow is a bit weird 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.110
 that you like but it prevents you from 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.420
 can teleport which is 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.220
 pretty cool to hunt in durban 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.650
 above all this works in a radius of 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.380
 16 meters 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.050
 so it's pretty cool and I now 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.930
 I wanted to try 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.670
 I guess no no rain comes by 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.670
 so tourist 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.450
 and it seems that they are singing something 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.910
 let's wait for them to die simply 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.260
 but it's pretty cool and you can 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.940
 It is also not very expensive to make 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.520
 that's why I say that you can put on 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.430
 mole I have all died here and for 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.930
 get in terpel super good but if 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.159
 It can be done in a place like that 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.979
 big 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.140
 as for example in the desert does not have 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.000
 a lot of sense but also so that 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.379
 teleportation but here for example 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.450
 just because of the rain they are going to die 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.010
 then it's pretty white 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.440
 let's try it because it's supposed to 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.540
 the further away clear here so it 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.450
 can transport you are teleporting 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:27.060
 badilla you can not if it's far to accept 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.060
 when you're worth more or less here 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.260
 but she can not have to transport herself 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.540
 is very cool of the day works the same 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.830
 with clear water if I put a here 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.990
 I put water 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.730
 do not count on transporting a charm 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.550
 why because if you do a few 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.280
 like this in a place like this and brogues 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.560
 enough zone 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.450
 alone in case it rains in a 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.360
 site where you do not have block to which the 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.920
 transport can fall to the fence 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.680
 maybe the transported here and here already 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.790
 He could not leave, which is very cool 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.629
 there is 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:05.060
 man which is very cool and if 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.280
 we make towards him in big plan we can 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.750
 cover a lot of area and get a lot 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.750
 de enders is quite white 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.370
 He is quite curious 7 and has been one of the 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.680
 who liked the most of the new 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.860
 attention but good the description is 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.030
 for 1.7 point 10 if this one the 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.030
 they conform as always 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.799
 bye
