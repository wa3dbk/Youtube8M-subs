00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
for me because a four explosion

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.560 
for me because a four explosion
explosiveness<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.799> speed<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.390> know<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
explosiveness and speed you know the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.179 
explosiveness and speed you know the
first<00:01:39.810> two<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.470> three<00:01:40.500> yards<00:01:40.860> for<00:01:40.979> me<00:01:41.070> it's

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
first two to three yards for me it's

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.830 
first two to three yards for me it's
important<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.549> me<00:01:41.700> as<00:01:42.299> well<00:01:42.509> as<00:01:42.630> we'll<00:01:42.720> be<00:01:42.780> able

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
important to me as well as we'll be able

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.260 
important to me as well as we'll be able
to<00:01:42.960> explode<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.380> ball<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.100> over<00:01:45.000> cross

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
to explode to the ball and over cross

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.899 
to explode to the ball and over cross
for<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.750> shot<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.110> important<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:46.649> for<00:01:47.460> me<00:01:47.549> it's

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
for a shot it's important so for me it's

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.179 
for a shot it's important so for me it's
a<00:01:48.119> huge<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.780> piece<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.020> equipment<00:01:49.409> yeah<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:49.890> think

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
a huge a piece of equipment yeah I think

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.469 
a huge a piece of equipment yeah I think
once<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.490> get<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.700> rhythm<00:01:50.820> down<00:01:51.000> with<00:01:51.329> the

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
once you get the rhythm down with the

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.780 
once you get the rhythm down with the
yo-yo<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.740> much<00:01:53.040> nicer<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.610> much

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
yo-yo it's it's much nicer and much

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.630 
yo-yo it's it's much nicer and much
simple<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.240> use<00:01:54.799> there<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:55.829> no<00:01:56.040> stress<00:01:56.369> on<00:01:56.520> my

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
simple to use there is no stress on my

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.700 
simple to use there is no stress on my
back<00:01:56.880> it's<00:01:57.240> much<00:01:57.420> much<00:01:58.110> more<00:01:58.290> comfortable<00:01:58.500> for

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
back it's much much more comfortable for

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.560 
back it's much much more comfortable for
me<00:01:58.829> than

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
me than

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.740 
me than
a<00:01:59.630> gym<00:02:00.260> and<00:02:00.409> put<00:02:00.500> a<00:02:00.890> bar<00:02:01.280> on<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:02.300> benefits

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
a gym and put a bar on that the benefits

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.060 
a gym and put a bar on that the benefits
are<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.470> ability<00:02:03.740> to<00:02:03.770> training<00:02:04.010> the

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
are the ability to training the

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.980 
are the ability to training the

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
eccentric phase in in a controlled

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.290

manner<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:07.130> eccentric<00:02:07.490> phase<00:02:07.520> is<00:02:07.820> important

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
manner the eccentric phase is important

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.389 
manner the eccentric phase is important
when<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.539> comes<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.840> injuries<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:09.860> injury

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
the power but increasing the ability to

repetitions<00:02:27.050> we<00:02:27.350> slowed<00:02:27.650> with<00:02:27.830> programming

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
repetitions we slowed with programming

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.880 
repetitions we slowed with programming
we're<00:02:28.820> able<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:29.320> improve<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.410> athlete<00:02:30.740> both

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
we're able to improve the athlete both

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.910 
we're able to improve the athlete both
performance<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:31.580> injury<00:02:32.150> prevention<00:02:32.180> wise<00:02:32.660> I

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
performance and injury prevention wise I

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.920 
performance and injury prevention wise I
think<00:02:33.920> there's<00:02:34.670> more<00:02:34.910> evenness<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.420> when<00:02:35.840> you

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
think there's more evenness to when you

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.470 
think there's more evenness to when you
do<00:02:36.080> free<00:02:36.470> weights<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:36.980> feel<00:02:37.459> like<00:02:37.610> there's

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
do free weights I feel like there's

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.449 
do free weights I feel like there's
actually<00:02:38.600> real<00:02:38.959> resistance<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:39.920> pushing

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
actually real resistance of you pushing

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.100 
actually real resistance of you pushing
off<00:02:40.760> because<00:02:41.270> like<00:02:41.480> it's<00:02:41.630> somebody<00:02:41.959> that's

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
off because like it's somebody that's

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.479 
off because like it's somebody that's
behind<00:02:42.470> you<00:02:42.620> were<00:02:42.739> holding<00:02:43.010> you<00:02:43.100> back<00:02:43.280> and

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
behind you were holding you back and

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.320 
behind you were holding you back and
maybe<00:02:44.330> go<00:02:44.660> actually<00:02:45.050> actually<00:02:45.650> acts<00:02:46.310> as<00:02:46.520> a<00:02:46.580> you

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
maybe go actually actually acts as a you

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.060 
maybe go actually actually acts as a you
want<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.660> give<00:02:47.810> more<00:02:48.020> power<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.380> be<00:02:48.560> able<00:02:48.890> to

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
want to give more power to be able to

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.890 
want to give more power to be able to
push<00:02:49.280> off<00:02:49.489> and<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.910> decelerate<00:02:50.570> and

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
push off and to decelerate and

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.330 
push off and to decelerate and
accelerate<00:02:51.410> so<00:02:51.530> it's<00:02:51.709> really<00:02:51.890> it's<00:02:52.100> quite<00:02:52.250> a

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
accelerate so it's really it's quite a

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.340 
accelerate so it's really it's quite a
good<00:02:52.489> machine<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:53.420> factors<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:53.930> think<00:02:54.140> you<00:02:54.200> get

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
good machine the factors I think you get

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.699 
good machine the factors I think you get
more<00:02:54.530> power<00:02:54.709> out<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:54.980> it<00:02:55.160> without<00:02:55.519> having<00:02:55.940> to

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
more power out of it without having to

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.300 
more power out of it without having to
swell<00:02:57.709> up<00:02:57.739> and<00:02:59.110> yeah<00:03:00.110> pretty<00:03:00.800> much<00:03:00.950> you

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
swell up and yeah pretty much you

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.130 
swell up and yeah pretty much you
generate<00:03:01.880> more<00:03:02.120> power<00:03:02.330> from<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.600> front<00:03:03.080> of

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
generate more power from the front of

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.360 
generate more power from the front of
your<00:03:03.200> legs<00:03:03.380> in<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.560> back<00:03:03.590> village<00:03:04.040> it's<00:03:04.220> not
