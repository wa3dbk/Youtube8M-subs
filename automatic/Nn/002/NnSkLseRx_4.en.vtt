 Martin and this time I'm going to 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.279
 present this department 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:26.020
 that we got here through this 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:29.960
 elevator is on a sixth floor is in 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.259
 in península in nuevo vallarta we are going 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.259
 entering 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.840
 It should be clarified that there are three in this 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.430
 section of this elevator gives service 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.460
 to three departments then 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.490
 it's practically a give is an elevator 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.330
 that gives him service in 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.860
 in this in this area because very little 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.530
 people are not very exclusive then 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.690
 entering we have this bathroom but then 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.580
 then at the entrance here we go to 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.620
 come back a little bit because there is a closet 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.000
 where is this washing area is a 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.770
 compact department even though 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.320
 it has 110 square meters right now it's going 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.790

 on this side has a second bedroom 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.510
 that this second bedroom can also 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.290
 do studio or room functions 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.600

 which in this case is being used as 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.190
 bedroom is also important to mention 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.890

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.540

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.599
 those crystals that divide it from those 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.930
 neighboring departments but this is the 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.550
 Complex of the complex with all its 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.530
 pool and one of the best beaches that 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.870

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.360

 of photos where the important thing is good 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.010
 but until this when it is appearing 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.590
 on screen part of the facade this is 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.030

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.140
 Despite this, now it is 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.300
 practically in a 90% finished only 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.700
 one of the rooms is missing 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.280
 of the building but it is practically already 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.210

 in the space in dressing rooms where there 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.440

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.250
 department and areas landscaped areas 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.390
 like this one that is being viewed on the screen 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.390
 let's see the location 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:35.169
 let's now see the location here is 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:37.179
 the urban sprawl of everything that is this 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.429

00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:40.989
 on this side is remembering that 

00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:42.729
 practically after the airport 

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:44.139
 until what is the Mayan riviera and everything 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.750
 This is the beach on the Mayan shore 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:50.080

 by flamingos the project is so new 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.930
