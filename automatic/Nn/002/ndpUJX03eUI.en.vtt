00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
there ground and the power wires had I

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.560 
there ground and the power wires had I
guess<00:01:02.609> from<00:01:02.730> opening<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.180> closing<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.539> door

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
guess from opening and closing the door

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.230 
guess from opening and closing the door
so<00:01:03.960> many<00:01:04.110> times<00:01:04.320> had<00:01:05.250> actually<00:01:05.670> bent<00:01:05.970> and
