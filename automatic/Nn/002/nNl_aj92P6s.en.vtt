we're<00:00:01.410> now<00:00:01.560> going<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.920> tie<00:00:02.190> this<00:00:02.250> little<00:00:02.760> knot

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
we're now going to tie this little knot

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.120 
we're now going to tie this little knot
it's<00:00:03.330> got<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.540> little<00:00:03.750> pinwheel<00:00:04.259> design<00:00:04.290> in<00:00:05.009> the

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
it's got a little pinwheel design in the

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.150 
it's got a little pinwheel design in the
center<00:00:05.370> you<00:00:06.359> can<00:00:06.390> make<00:00:06.750> several<00:00:07.230> of<00:00:07.500> them<00:00:07.710> in<00:00:07.950> a

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
center you can make several of them in a

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.009 
center you can make several of them in a
row<00:00:08.309> here's<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.820> single<00:00:09.059> one<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.599> then<00:00:09.750> here's

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
row here's a single one and then here's

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.290 
row here's a single one and then here's
a<00:00:10.080> triple<00:00:10.830> one<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.190> single<00:00:11.580> one<00:00:11.730> in<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.969> triple

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
a triple one a single one in a triple

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.749 
a triple one a single one in a triple
one<00:00:12.420> or<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.290> can<00:00:13.440> make<00:00:13.620> two<00:00:13.980> knots<00:00:14.250> together

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
one or you can make two knots together

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.060 
one or you can make two knots together
with<00:00:14.969> this<00:00:15.599> where<00:00:15.990> this<00:00:16.139> little<00:00:16.320> edge<00:00:16.590> loop<00:00:16.859> is

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
with this where this little edge loop is

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.279 
with this where this little edge loop is
much<00:00:17.520> bigger<00:00:17.760> two<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.480> them<00:00:18.630> together<00:00:18.840> are

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
much bigger two of them together are

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.529 
much bigger two of them together are
part<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.369> element<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.970> making<00:00:21.449> a

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
part of the element of making a

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.500 
part of the element of making a
dragonfly<00:00:21.930> not<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:23.310> let's<00:00:23.850> see<00:00:24.119> how<00:00:24.269> this

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
dragonfly not so let's see how this

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.380 
dragonfly not so let's see how this
basic<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:25.109> goes<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:26.340> tie<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.609> knot<00:00:27.000> we've

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
basic that goes to tie this knot we've

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.929 
basic that goes to tie this knot we've
got<00:00:27.630> two<00:00:27.900> strands<00:00:28.590> different<00:00:29.460> colors<00:00:29.760> that

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
got two strands different colors that

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.359 
got two strands different colors that
way<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.119> can<00:00:30.330> tell<00:00:30.710> what's<00:00:31.710> going<00:00:31.920> on<00:00:32.099> here

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
way you can tell what's going on here

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.299 
way you can tell what's going on here
the<00:00:32.910> thread<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.960> left<00:00:34.200> gets<00:00:34.710> made<00:00:34.950> into<00:00:35.160> a

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
the thread on the left gets made into a

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.370 
the thread on the left gets made into a
loop<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:36.450> one<00:00:36.600> on<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.840> right

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
loop the one on the right

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.569 
loop the one on the right
loops<00:00:38.280> around<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.149> grabs<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:40.190> the<00:00:41.190> one<00:00:41.370> from

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
loops around and grabs it the one from

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.410 
loops around and grabs it the one from
the<00:00:41.700> left<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.390> going<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.690> make<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.050> third<00:00:43.200> loop

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
the left is going to make a third loop

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.630 
the left is going to make a third loop
pokes<00:00:45.420> through<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.870> first<00:00:46.079> one<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.649> then

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
pokes through the first one and then

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.420 
pokes through the first one and then
we're<00:00:47.850> going<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.149> lay<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.360> around<00:00:49.100> this<00:00:50.100> first

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
we're going to lay it around this first

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.660 
we're going to lay it around this first
loop<00:00:50.640> here<00:00:50.940> piece<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.600> front<00:00:51.719> piece<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.170> back

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
loop here piece in front piece in back

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.760 
loop here piece in front piece in back
now<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.699> take<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.539> string<00:00:55.140> from<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.469> right

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
now I take this string from the right

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.010 
now I take this string from the right
and<00:00:56.760> we're<00:00:56.910> going<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.149> poke<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.570> end<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.870> this

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
and we're going to poke the end of this

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.700 
and we're going to poke the end of this
one<00:00:58.640> underneath<00:00:59.640> those<00:00:59.969> two<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.570> pull<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.530> all

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
one underneath those two and pull it all

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.240 
one underneath those two and pull it all
the<00:01:01.739> way<00:01:01.890> through<00:01:02.780> okay<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.350> now<00:01:04.559> our<00:01:04.860> knot<00:01:05.040> is

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
the way through okay so now our knot is

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.410 
the way through okay so now our knot is
tied<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.939> what<00:01:06.299> we<00:01:06.600> need<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.960> do<00:01:07.110> now<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:08.420> to

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
tied and what we need to do now is to

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.630 
tied and what we need to do now is to
tighten<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.840> up<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.229> first<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.369> want<00:01:11.580> to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
tighten it up so first you want to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.450 
tighten it up so first you want to
visualize<00:01:12.229> where<00:01:13.229> we've<00:01:13.560> got<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:14.130> little

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
visualize where we've got this little

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.310 
visualize where we've got this little
pinwheel<00:01:15.150> form<00:01:15.540> here<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.740> pinwheel<00:01:18.049> is<00:01:19.049> right

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
pinwheel form here the pinwheel is right

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.649 
pinwheel form here the pinwheel is right
there<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:20.040> see<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:21.090> want<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.299> know<00:01:21.390> what<00:01:21.540> to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
there you see you want to know what to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.010 
there you see you want to know what to
pull<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.439> end<00:01:22.590> goes<00:01:22.830> down<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.820> out<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.840> is

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
pull the end goes down and out this is

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.010 
pull the end goes down and out this is
the<00:01:25.140> one<00:01:25.380> loop<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:26.549> end<00:01:26.909> goes<00:01:27.360> down<00:01:27.630> and

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
the one loop this end goes down and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.350 
the one loop this end goes down and
here's<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.439> other<00:01:28.470> loop<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:29.820> then<00:01:30.030> we're<00:01:30.329> just

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
here's the other loop so then we're just

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.640 
here's the other loop so then we're just
gonna<00:01:30.600> grab<00:01:30.869> onto<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.500> we're<00:01:31.590> gonna

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
gonna grab onto this and we're gonna

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.580 
gonna grab onto this and we're gonna
trip<00:01:32.430> trip<00:01:32.640> trip<00:01:32.720> tighten<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.810> up<00:01:33.840> tighten<00:01:34.380> it

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
trip trip trip tighten it up tighten it

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.510 
trip trip trip tighten it up tighten it
down<00:01:34.670> there<00:01:35.670> we<00:01:35.790> are<00:01:35.960> snug<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.110> down<00:01:37.369> to<00:01:38.369> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
down there we are snug it down to the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.700 
down there we are snug it down to the
base<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:40.340> then<00:01:42.320> it's<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.409> matter<00:01:43.590> of

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
base and then it's a matter of

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.480 
base and then it's a matter of
tightening<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.340> up<00:01:44.689> so<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:46.350> tighten<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.829> what

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
tightening it up so to tighten it what

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.609 
tightening it up so to tighten it what
helps<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.210> lot<00:01:48.390> yes<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:49.670> little<00:01:50.670> tightening<00:01:51.119> tool

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
helps a lot yes a little tightening tool

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.280 
helps a lot yes a little tightening tool
here's<00:01:52.619> my<00:01:52.799> tightening<00:01:53.310> tool<00:01:53.750> so<00:01:54.750> I've<00:01:55.110> got

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
here's my tightening tool so I've got

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.780 
here's my tightening tool so I've got
the<00:01:55.409> knot<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.860> middle<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.280> two<00:01:56.399> loops<00:01:56.610> on

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
the knot in the middle and two loops on

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.060 
the knot in the middle and two loops on
either<00:01:56.939> side<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.360> want<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.869> pull<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.560> loop<00:01:58.860> in

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
either side I want to pull this loop in

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.179 
either side I want to pull this loop in
I<00:01:59.299> grab<00:02:00.299> here<00:02:01.110> right<00:02:01.259> now<00:02:01.409> if<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.649> pull<00:02:01.890> on<00:02:01.920> the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
I grab here right now if I pull on the

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.709 
I grab here right now if I pull on the
top<00:02:02.369> it's<00:02:02.640> pulling<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.210> end<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
top it's pulling to the end of the

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.840 
top it's pulling to the end of the
string<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.170> don't<00:02:04.439> want<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.619> do<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:05.100> pull<00:02:05.640> on

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
string I don't want to do that I pull on

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.910 
string I don't want to do that I pull on
the<00:02:05.969> bottom<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:07.439> shortens<00:02:07.860> my

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
the bottom of it and that shortens my

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.570 
the bottom of it and that shortens my
loop<00:02:08.220> down<00:02:09.200> there<00:02:10.200> we<00:02:10.289> go<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.709> we<00:02:10.800> pull<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.430> out

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
loop down there we go and we pull it out

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.970 
loop down there we go and we pull it out
there

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
there

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.600

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
now for the blue side I went to shorten

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.180 
now for the blue side I went to shorten
up<00:02:15.700> this<00:02:15.879> loop<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.360> not<00:02:17.170> pull<00:02:17.470> on<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.980> end

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
up this loop and not pull on the end

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.729 
up this loop and not pull on the end
here<00:02:18.819> yeah<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.750> grabbed<00:02:20.080> this<00:02:20.260> part<00:02:20.560> of<00:02:20.650> the

here yeah I grabbed this part of the

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.670 
here yeah I grabbed this part of the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
loop if I pull on one way it pulls the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.290 
loop if I pull on one way it pulls the
string<00:02:23.980> but<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.310> want<00:02:24.640> don't<00:02:24.849> want<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.060> string
