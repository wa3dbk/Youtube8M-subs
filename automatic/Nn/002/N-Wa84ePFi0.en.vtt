I'm<00:00:40.469> not<00:00:40.620> worried<00:00:40.770> about<00:00:40.860> mono<00:00:41.100> blue<00:00:41.219> match

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370

but<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.610> think<00:00:41.790> it's<00:00:41.879> very<00:00:42.000> winnable<00:00:42.390> plus<00:00:43.140> you

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
but I think it's very winnable plus you

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.569 
but I think it's very winnable plus you
know<00:00:43.350> what<00:00:43.440> see<00:00:43.530> mono<00:00:43.710> blue<00:00:43.890> nearly<00:00:44.370> as<00:00:44.460> much

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
know what see mono blue nearly as much

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.549 
know what see mono blue nearly as much
as<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.940> used<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.539> didn't<00:00:46.170> get<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.350> see<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
as you used to I didn't get to see the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.670

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
actually a very good card in this and

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.120 
actually a very good card in this and
especially<00:03:40.260> it<00:03:40.320> fits<00:03:40.500> in<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.680> budget<00:03:40.799> we<00:03:41.100> need

another<00:03:41.459> enchantment<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:42.090> think<00:03:42.269> that<00:03:42.390> fills

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
another enchantment I think that fills

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.420 
another enchantment I think that fills
the<00:03:42.840> role<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.500> best<00:03:43.650> sitting<00:03:43.950> is<00:03:44.040> better<00:03:44.220> than

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
the role the best sitting is better than

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
any sort of ordeal and of course the

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:47.870 
any sort of ordeal and of course the
banishing<00:03:47.100> line<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.310> think<00:03:47.489> that<00:03:47.640> this<00:03:47.760> is<00:03:47.820> a

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
banishing line I think that this is a

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.430 
banishing line I think that this is a
very<00:03:48.090> well-rounded<00:03:48.600> deck<00:03:48.959> and<00:03:49.170> actually

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
very well-rounded deck and actually

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.960 
very well-rounded deck and actually
