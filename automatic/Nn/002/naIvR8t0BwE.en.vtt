00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
my face is fine so that was the main

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.189 
my face is fine so that was the main
reason<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.470> wanted<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.769> take<00:00:29.010> biotin<00:00:29.640> then<00:00:29.910> also

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
reason I wanted to take biotin then also

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.749 
reason I wanted to take biotin then also
for<00:00:31.199> my<00:00:31.289> hair<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.679> course<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:32.040> want<00:00:32.219> my<00:00:32.250> hair<00:00:32.460> to

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
for my hair of course I want my hair to

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.209 
for my hair of course I want my hair to
grow<00:00:32.969> longer<00:00:33.540> because<00:00:33.960> my<00:00:34.079> hair<00:00:34.200> grows<00:00:34.380> so

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
grow longer because my hair grows so

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.299 
grow longer because my hair grows so
freaking<00:00:35.820> slow<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.020> will<00:00:37.649> start<00:00:37.860> talking

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
freaking slow so I will start talking

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.889 
freaking slow so I will start talking
about<00:00:38.430> does<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.790> really<00:00:39.239> help<00:00:39.450> for<00:00:39.600> your<00:00:39.690> hair

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
about does it really help for your hair

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.180 
about does it really help for your hair
because<00:00:40.020> most<00:00:40.350> people<00:00:40.590> take<00:00:40.710> biotin<00:00:41.160> for

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
because most people take biotin for

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.610 
because most people take biotin for
their<00:00:41.460> hair<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.239> can<00:00:42.270> tell<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.719> yes<00:00:43.050> my

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
their hair and I can tell you yes my

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.529 
their hair and I can tell you yes my
hair<00:00:43.860> grew<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.520> little<00:00:44.850> bit<00:00:44.940> faster<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.450> it

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
hair grew a little bit faster that it

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.209 
hair grew a little bit faster that it
usually<00:00:45.930> does<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.590> definitely<00:00:46.710> works<00:00:47.129> for

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
usually does so it definitely works for

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.209 
usually does so it definitely works for
your<00:00:47.460> hair<00:00:47.780> but<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.320> reason<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.739> stopped

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
your hair but the reason I stopped

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
taking it yes I stopped taking is

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.750 
taking it yes I stopped taking is
because<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.559> way<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.829> was<00:00:52.920> affecting<00:00:53.370> my<00:00:53.489> skin

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760

maybe I need to go down to five thousand
or<00:03:07.709> three<00:03:07.739> thousand<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.580> maybe<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:09.090> won't

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
or three thousand and maybe it won't

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.240 
or three thousand and maybe it won't
break<00:03:09.900> me<00:03:10.110> out<00:03:10.230> so<00:03:10.500> I'm<00:03:10.560> definitely<00:03:11.040> going<00:03:11.190> to

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
break me out so I'm definitely going to

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.430 
break me out so I'm definitely going to
try<00:03:11.400> at<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.760> future<00:03:12.120> not<00:03:12.269> anytime<00:03:12.720> soon<00:03:13.080> but

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
try at the future not anytime soon but

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.650 
try at the future not anytime soon but
maybe<00:03:14.010> in<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.400> future<00:03:14.489> I<00:03:14.820> will<00:03:15.000> try<00:03:15.120> that<00:03:15.450> and

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
maybe in the future I will try that and

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.160 
maybe in the future I will try that and
see<00:03:15.720> if<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:17.100> doesn't<00:03:17.730> affect<00:03:18.000> my<00:03:18.390> skin<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:18.959> it

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
see if it doesn't affect my skin and it

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.539 
see if it doesn't affect my skin and it
still<00:03:19.890> helps<00:03:20.250> my<00:03:20.459> hair<00:03:20.840> grow<00:03:22.130> so<00:03:23.130> yeah<00:03:23.310> that's

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
still helps my hair grow so yeah that's

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:24.860 
still helps my hair grow so yeah that's
pretty<00:03:23.610> much<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:23.970> for<00:03:24.120> this<00:03:24.360> video<00:03:24.540> I<00:03:24.720> just
