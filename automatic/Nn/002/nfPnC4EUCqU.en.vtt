00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.700 
i agree with revenge if it's off of one
game<00:01:45.549> if<00:01:45.909> it's<00:01:46.060> a<00:01:46.150> trend<00:01:46.540> where<00:01:47.170> this<00:01:47.320> team's

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
game if it's a trend where this team's

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.039 
game if it's a trend where this team's
personnel<00:01:48.580> do<00:01:49.090> particularly<00:01:49.570> well<00:01:49.690> against

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
personnel do particularly well against

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.080 
personnel do particularly well against
another<00:01:50.350> team's<00:01:50.619> personnel<00:01:51.220> that<00:01:51.610> makes<00:01:51.909> me

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
another team's personnel that makes me

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.580 
another team's personnel that makes me
like<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.390> team<00:01:52.570> that's<00:01:52.690> doing<00:01:52.869> better<00:01:53.200> i<00:01:53.350> went

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
like the team that's doing better i went

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.250 
like the team that's doing better i went
to<00:01:53.680> 12<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.010> 48<00:01:54.280> yeah<00:01:54.610> argue<00:01:55.600> decided<00:01:56.080> that's<00:01:56.200> a

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
to 12 and 48 yeah argue decided that's a

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260 
to 12 and 48 yeah argue decided that's a
good<00:01:56.380> point<00:01:56.560> is<00:01:56.799> that<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.640> Dallas<00:01:57.939> Cowboys

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
good point is that the Dallas Cowboys

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.670 
good point is that the Dallas Cowboys
have<00:01:58.450> shored<00:01:58.720> up<00:01:58.810> some<00:01:59.020> of<00:01:59.110> those<00:01:59.170> problems

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
have shored up some of those problems

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.929 
have shored up some of those problems
they<00:01:59.830> went<00:02:00.010> out<00:02:00.070> and<00:02:00.220> got<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:00.460> young<00:02:00.640> kid<00:02:00.909> from

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
they went out and got the young kid from

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.300 
they went out and got the young kid from
LSU<00:02:01.420> in<00:02:01.689> the<00:02:01.780> in<00:02:01.930> the<00:02:01.960> defensive<00:02:02.439> backfield<00:02:02.470> to

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
LSU in the in the defensive backfield to

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
LSU in the in the defensive backfield to
try<00:02:03.490> to<00:02:03.549> take<00:02:03.760> care<00:02:03.939> of<00:02:04.000> some<00:02:04.180> of<00:02:04.270> those

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
try to take care of some of those

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.719 
try to take care of some of those
secondary<00:02:04.869> issues<00:02:05.260> that<00:02:05.619> was<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.920> redness<00:02:06.490> I

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
secondary issues that was the redness I

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.029 
secondary issues that was the redness I
think<00:02:07.299> that<00:02:07.479> they<00:02:07.600> were<00:02:07.689> 20<00:02:08.140> that<00:02:08.349> allow<00:02:08.979> the

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
think that they were 20 that allow the

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.820 
think that they were 20 that allow the
25th<00:02:09.819> worse<00:02:10.300> but<00:02:10.569> let's<00:02:10.750> be<00:02:10.869> honest<00:02:11.200> if<00:02:11.349> a

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
25th worse but let's be honest if a

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.070 
25th worse but let's be honest if a
rookie<00:02:12.220> quarterback<00:02:12.790> is<00:02:13.000> your<00:02:13.150> salvation<00:02:13.360> and

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
rookie quarterback is your salvation and

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.670 
rookie quarterback is your salvation and
it's<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.709> first<00:02:14.740> game

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
it's the first game

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.280 
it's the first game
I'm<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.250> little<00:02:16.640> concerned<00:02:16.900> point<00:02:17.900> number<00:02:17.989> two

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
I'm a little concerned point number two

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.530 
I'm a little concerned point number two
the<00:02:18.709> other<00:02:18.859> point<00:02:19.129> is<00:02:19.370> again<00:02:19.670> not<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:20.030> beat<00:02:20.239> to

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
the other point is again not to beat to

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.660 
the other point is again not to beat to
death<00:02:20.569> last<00:02:20.989> year's<00:02:21.349> games<00:02:21.680> but<00:02:21.980> that<00:02:22.129> second

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
death last year's games but that second

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.979 
death last year's games but that second
game<00:02:22.819> when<00:02:23.030> they<00:02:23.120> played<00:02:23.359> at<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.659> end<00:02:23.810> of<00:02:23.930> the

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
game when they played at the end of the

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
banged-up hand playing in inclimate

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:30.729 
banged-up hand playing in inclimate

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:39.139 
that we're from Pittsburgh just a bad

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.679 
that we're from Pittsburgh just a bad
one<00:02:39.409> okay<00:02:39.680> bad<00:02:40.040> weather<00:02:40.310> so<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:41.209> other<00:02:41.389> part

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
one okay bad weather so the other part

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.509 
one okay bad weather so the other part
of<00:02:41.810> these<00:02:41.930> I<00:02:42.049> really<00:02:42.650> do<00:02:42.829> believe<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.340> cowboys

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
of these I really do believe the cowboys

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:44.890 
of these I really do believe the cowboys
are<00:02:43.819> going<00:02:43.969> to<00:02:44.030> be<00:02:44.120> able<00:02:44.209> to<00:02:44.389> run<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.569> ball<00:02:44.719> in

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
are going to be able to run the ball in

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.209 
are going to be able to run the ball in
this<00:02:45.139> game<00:02:45.319> and<00:02:45.469> I<00:02:45.560> think<00:02:45.799> that's<00:02:45.950> why<00:02:46.069> are

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:46.219 
this game and I think that's why are

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:47.140 
this game and I think that's why are
they<00:02:46.340> going<00:02:46.459> to<00:02:46.519> be<00:02:46.609> able<00:02:46.639> to<00:02:46.879> run<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.060> ball

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
they going to be able to run the ball

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.819 
they going to be able to run the ball
any<00:02:47.420> better<00:02:47.450> than<00:02:47.810> last<00:02:47.870> year<00:02:48.230> they<00:02:48.620> didn't

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
any better than last year they didn't

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.770 
any better than last year they didn't
have<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.069> mark<00:02:49.280> kumari<00:02:49.609> last<00:02:49.939> year<00:02:50.209> in<00:02:50.480> either

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
have the mark kumari last year in either

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.809 
have the mark kumari last year in either
