I<00:00:33.530> can't<00:00:34.219> see<00:00:34.429> a<00:00:34.460> great<00:00:34.789> distance<00:00:35.300> so<00:00:35.629> instead

I can't see a great distance so instead

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:38.560 
I can't see a great distance so instead
of<00:00:36.170> going<00:00:36.379> further<00:00:36.769> down<00:00:36.920> the<00:00:37.339> Hudson<00:00:37.539> where<00:00:38.539> I

of going further down the Hudson where I

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.660 
of going further down the Hudson where I
have<00:00:38.750> a<00:00:38.780> long<00:00:39.079> view<00:00:39.499> from<00:00:40.039> a<00:00:40.190> place<00:00:40.399> called

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
have a long view from a place called

have a long view from a place called
Rockwood<00:00:41.539> Hall<00:00:41.839> I've<00:00:42.710> come<00:00:42.920> to<00:00:43.070> senescu<00:00:43.429> Park

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
Rockwood Hall I've come to senescu Park

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.610 
Rockwood Hall I've come to senescu Park
because<00:00:44.570> the<00:00:45.440> shapes<00:00:46.339> are<00:00:46.519> relatively<00:00:46.940> simple

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
because the shapes are relatively simple

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.989 
because the shapes are relatively simple
they're<00:00:48.620> close<00:00:48.920> enough<00:00:49.309> that<00:00:49.339> they<00:00:49.760> have

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:49.999 
they're close enough that they have

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:53.139 
they're close enough that they have
definition<00:00:50.780> even<00:00:50.989> with<00:00:51.499> all<00:00:51.800> of<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:52.100> kind<00:00:53.059> of

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
definition even with all of the kind of

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.099 
definition even with all of the kind of
misty<00:00:53.510> atmosphere<00:00:55.149> and<00:00:56.149> it's<00:00:56.390> also<00:00:56.569> a<00:00:56.749> place

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
misty atmosphere and it's also a place

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.180 
misty atmosphere and it's also a place
that's<00:00:57.530> very<00:00:58.899> representative<00:00:59.899> of

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
that's very representative of

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.250 
that's very representative of
croton-on-hudson<00:01:01.190> where<00:01:01.879> I<00:01:01.909> live<00:01:02.269> and<00:01:02.659> and<00:01:02.899> so

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
croton-on-hudson where I live and and so

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.470 
croton-on-hudson where I live and and so
I<00:01:03.289> have<00:01:03.530> a<00:01:03.559> real<00:01:03.800> kind<00:01:04.040> of<00:01:04.269> interesting<00:01:05.269> this

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:05.480 
I have a real kind of interesting this

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.100 
I have a real kind of interesting this
the<00:01:06.730> peninsula<00:01:07.730> that<00:01:07.880> sticks<00:01:08.210> out<00:01:08.390> right<00:01:08.780> here

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
the peninsula that sticks out right here

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.630 
the peninsula that sticks out right here
is<00:01:09.260> protein<00:01:09.650> protein<00:01:12.070> River<00:01:13.070> meets<00:01:13.400> the

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
is protein protein River meets the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.470 
is protein protein River meets the
Hudson<00:01:14.090> River<00:01:14.170> and<00:01:15.370> it<00:01:16.370> has<00:01:16.580> historic

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
Hudson River and it has historic

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.150 
Hudson River and it has historic
significance<00:01:17.660> but<00:01:18.500> into<00:01:18.770> particular

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
significance but into particular

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.550 
significance but into particular
interest<00:01:19.700> to<00:01:19.850> me<00:01:20.000> because<00:01:20.360> of<00:01:20.510> the<00:01:20.660> variety<00:01:21.530> of

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
interest to me because of the variety of

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.460 
interest to me because of the variety of
shapes<00:01:21.650> in<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.340> distance<00:01:22.760> so<00:01:23.690> I've<00:01:23.870> blocked

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
shapes in the distance so I've blocked

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.300 
shapes in the distance so I've blocked
in<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:25.370> overall<00:01:26.360> composition<00:01:27.310> thinking

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
in the overall composition thinking

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.490 
in the overall composition thinking
mostly<00:01:28.730> about<00:01:28.880> kind<00:01:29.630> of<00:01:29.720> enlarging<00:01:30.230> the

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
mostly about kind of enlarging the

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.430 
mostly about kind of enlarging the
shapes<00:01:30.970> because<00:01:31.970> when<00:01:32.120> you<00:01:32.240> stand<00:01:33.110> in<00:01:33.350> a

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
shapes because when you stand in a

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.340 
shapes because when you stand in a
landscape<00:01:34.010> like<00:01:34.220> this<00:01:35.050> things<00:01:36.050> are<00:01:36.230> at<00:01:36.290> a

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
landscape like this things are at a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.830 
landscape like this things are at a
distance<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.160> to<00:01:37.730> present<00:01:38.090> them<00:01:38.240> literally

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
distance and to present them literally

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.970 
distance and to present them literally
would<00:01:39.050> mean<00:01:39.260> that<00:01:39.380> you've<00:01:39.590> got<00:01:39.770> some

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
would mean that you've got some

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.460 
would mean that you've got some
relatively<00:01:40.520> small<00:01:40.970> shapes<00:01:41.390> on<00:01:41.690> a<00:01:41.720> canvas<00:01:42.290> and

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
relatively small shapes on a canvas and

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.890 
relatively small shapes on a canvas and
it<00:01:42.590> doesn't<00:01:42.950> really<00:01:43.670> come<00:01:43.940> across<00:01:44.300> very<00:01:44.630> well

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
it doesn't really come across very well

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.560 
it doesn't really come across very well
so<00:01:45.680> I've<00:01:45.800> been<00:01:45.920> enlarged<00:01:46.640> them<00:01:46.880> I've<00:01:47.120> put<00:01:47.420> them

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
so I've been enlarged them I've put them

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.340 
so I've been enlarged them I've put them
into<00:01:47.720> a<00:01:47.840> square<00:01:48.290> format

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
into a square format

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.539 
into a square format
I<00:01:49.549> like<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:51.140> because<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.170> watched<00:01:52.979> my<00:01:53.159> friend

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
I like this because I watched my friend

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.640 
I like this because I watched my friend
William<00:01:54.030> hook<00:01:54.330> paint<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.840> he<00:01:54.930> does<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.200> lot<00:01:55.470> of

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
William hook paint and he does a lot of

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.320 
William hook paint and he does a lot of
square<00:01:55.950> format<00:01:56.369> paintings<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.030> they<00:01:57.150> work

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
square format paintings and they work

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.469 
square format paintings and they work
very<00:01:58.259> well<00:01:58.290> compositionally<00:01:59.190> I<00:01:59.220> think<00:01:59.610> anyway

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
very well compositionally I think anyway

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.170 
very well compositionally I think anyway
so<00:02:00.540> I've<00:02:00.840> blocked<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:01.650> and<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.940> two

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
so I've blocked this in and the the two

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.810 
so I've blocked this in and the the two
main<00:02:03.420> things<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.869> I'm<00:02:04.080> thinking<00:02:04.500> about<00:02:04.820> are

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
main things that I'm thinking about are

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.419 
main things that I'm thinking about are
the<00:02:06.450> balance<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:07.020> warm<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.500> cool<00:02:07.680> colors<00:02:07.740> I

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
the balance of warm and cool colors I

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.180 
the balance of warm and cool colors I
want<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:09.360> sky<00:02:09.660> area<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:10.440> water<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.979> be

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
want the sky area and the water to be

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.650 
want the sky area and the water to be
predominantly<00:02:11.790> warm

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
predominantly warm

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.830 
predominantly warm
whereas<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.230> want<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.680> distant<00:02:14.540> hillside<00:02:15.540> and

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
whereas I want the distant hillside and

I've<00:03:07.109> probably<00:03:07.470> got<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:08.310> divisions<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:09.000> little

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
I've probably got the divisions a little

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.880 
I've probably got the divisions a little
too<00:03:09.750> close<00:03:09.989> to<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.410> center<00:03:11.209> but<00:03:12.209> if<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.600> can

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
too close to the center but if I can

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.050 
too close to the center but if I can
shift<00:03:13.890> you<00:03:14.700> know<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.970> balance<00:03:15.180> from<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:16.590> dark

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
off that kind of symmetry so I'm going

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.940 
off that kind of symmetry so I'm going
to<00:03:25.019> get<00:03:25.170> started<00:03:25.440> or<00:03:25.769> by<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.040> way<00:03:26.190> I've<00:03:26.489> mixed

the<00:03:37.350> advantage<00:03:37.740> of<00:03:37.920> mixing<00:03:38.760> in<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.060> out<00:03:39.240> good

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
the advantage of mixing in and out good

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
medium with the oil colors is that they

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.720 
medium with the oil colors is that they
dry<00:03:41.820> very<00:03:41.850> quickly<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:43.860> helps<00:03:44.190> build<00:03:44.460> up

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
dry very quickly and that helps build up

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.870

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:50.129 
technique so I'm continuing to work the

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:54.230 
technique so I'm continuing to work the
surface<00:05:52.099> just<00:05:53.099> sort<00:05:53.339> of<00:05:53.400> layering<00:05:53.639> the<00:05:53.939> paint

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
colors a little bit doing a little bit

colors a little bit doing a little bit
of<00:06:00.629> detailing<00:06:01.110> at<00:06:01.499> the<00:06:02.479> edges<00:06:03.479> of<00:06:03.689> the<00:06:03.960> trees

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.619 

and<00:06:07.710> I'm<00:06:08.430> just<00:06:08.610> going<00:06:08.729> to<00:06:08.819> continue<00:06:09.029> in<00:06:09.449> that

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:09.629 
and I'm just going to continue in that

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:16.369 
and I'm just going to continue in that
direction<00:06:09.839> to<00:06:11.360> refine<00:06:12.360> this<00:06:14.839> so<00:06:15.839> as<00:06:16.050> I<00:06:16.199> go

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:16.379 
direction to refine this so as I go

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:18.379 
direction to refine this so as I go
further<00:06:16.710> along<00:06:16.919> with<00:06:17.249> it<00:06:17.400> actually<00:06:17.879> I'm<00:06:17.939> going

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389 
further along with it actually I'm going

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:21.489 
further along with it actually I'm going
back<00:06:18.659> to<00:06:19.159> smoothing<00:06:20.159> out<00:06:20.279> the<00:06:20.550> brushstrokes

00:06:21.489 --> 00:06:21.499 
back to smoothing out the brushstrokes

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:26.269 
back to smoothing out the brushstrokes
loading<00:06:22.499> a<00:06:22.589> brush<00:06:22.830> with<00:06:23.279> just<00:06:23.759> the<00:06:24.979> down<00:06:25.979> kid

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:26.279 
loading a brush with just the down kid

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:29.089 
loading a brush with just the down kid
liquid<00:06:26.819> medium<00:06:27.539> and<00:06:27.779> then<00:06:28.409> stroking<00:06:29.009> it

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:29.099 
liquid medium and then stroking it

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:32.959 
liquid medium and then stroking it
across<00:06:29.460> to<00:06:30.120> blend<00:06:30.839> the<00:06:31.020> colors<00:06:31.460> you<00:06:32.460> know<00:06:32.550> it's

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:32.969 
across to blend the colors you know it's

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:34.760 
across to blend the colors you know it's
at<00:06:33.120> this<00:06:33.300> point<00:06:33.599> that<00:06:33.779> it<00:06:33.899> has<00:06:34.080> less<00:06:34.349> to<00:06:34.560> do

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
at this point that it has less to do

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.670 
at this point that it has less to do
with<00:06:34.800> what<00:06:35.399> the<00:06:35.759> scene<00:06:36.120> looked<00:06:36.599> like<00:06:36.719> or<00:06:37.199> looks

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
with what the scene looked like or looks

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.769 
with what the scene looked like or looks
like<00:06:37.770> now<00:06:38.159> and<00:06:38.189> more<00:06:38.849> to<00:06:38.969> do<00:06:39.149> with<00:06:39.419> sort<00:06:39.719> of

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:39.779 
like now and more to do with sort of

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:42.350 
like now and more to do with sort of
pulling<00:06:40.529> a<00:06:40.710> picture<00:06:41.099> together<00:06:41.250> it's<00:06:42.060> over

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
pulling a picture together it's over

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.029 
pulling a picture together it's over
right<00:06:42.569> so<00:06:44.509> I<00:06:45.509> do<00:06:45.719> refer<00:06:46.319> back<00:06:46.529> to<00:06:46.589> what<00:06:46.889> I'm

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 
right so I do refer back to what I'm

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:50.450 
right so I do refer back to what I'm
what<00:06:47.460> I've<00:06:47.580> seen<00:06:47.849> but<00:06:48.149> it's<00:06:49.050> really<00:06:49.460> the

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 
what I've seen but it's really the

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.550 
what I've seen but it's really the
picture<00:06:50.639> is<00:06:50.879> sort<00:06:51.120> of<00:06:51.149> taking<00:06:51.479> on<00:06:51.599> an<00:06:51.779> identity
