00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 do not 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.779
 hello passion friends mobile and power pda 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.570
 today in our applications segment 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.849
 we have here a camera application 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.009
 to apply effects in real time as 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.619
 see here if we are in the interface 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.540
 main we can do sprite towards the 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.940
 left or right to go 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.550
 changing effect and this effect is going to 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.850
 be applied in real time so 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.860
 has this advantage and also if you slide 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.199
 up or down you're going to raise 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.050
 the contrast as you see or decrease it 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.210
 depending on your tastes so this 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.000
 same you can do in all the filters 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.579
 and flyp up to raise the 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.590
 contrast or down to decrease it 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.480
 so as you see you can apply effects 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.430
 in real time in a very simple way 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.610
 and just when you want to take the 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.759
 photograph you must press the shutter that 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.710
 is below the red and once it is 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.080
 capture you can also vary the 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.640
 filter in case the end of accounts does not 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.160
 liked the result you can still 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.390
 change and also vary all 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.330
 parameters as contrast 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.210
 the kind of effect finally down what 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.000
 you can save send or delete so 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.240
 let's put it behind to eliminate it and 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.460
 We confirm now if we press the button 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.610
 from the menu we will also see what we can 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.490
 make collages from the same camera by 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.530
 example of 2 that will tell us what 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.300
 element is what we are going to take and a 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.920
 Once we take it, let's move the 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.440
 camera to the other side to move the 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.270
 second to take the second element and 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.880
 then he will combine them in a way 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.280
 very simple let's put remove 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.800
 again to go try the other 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.600
 effect that is to split the others 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.039
 Schools are the same but you are going to ask 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.539
 But photos 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.119
 The split effect is to take 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.789
 split pictures and as you can see 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.950
 move this effect that we love it so much 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.140
 apply if we want it to be a 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.170
 very pronounced effect or that is 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.019
 degraded we can also rotate this 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.820
 effect to divide differently 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.810
 photography so for example let's 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.819
 to take here a 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.150
 and then he will ask us for the next 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.940
 that we can apply on another side of this 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.010
 way to give us as a result already 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.319
 the mix that we can also edit by 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.300
 if we did not like the result so much 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.430
 which as you see is very easy to apply 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.830
 this effect we go again to 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.250
 delete it and we return to the interface 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.650
 main where we finally have the 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.019
 normal photo that is photo in square 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.420
 as for instagram or the photo in four 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.239
 thirds in both cases you can enable 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.420
 also the flash or the blog that we're going to 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:00.030
 see that for the blog it puts us there a 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.310
 center for us to indicate where 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.220
 we want you to focus and apply a 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.230
 effect as of degraded blur and 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.940
 as you see also a small point comes out 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.030
 that with which we can vary the 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.120
 opening and also simulates a very 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.540
 nice there as if it were a real lens 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.540
 the opening of this lens so well of 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.430
 easy we can manipulate the opening and 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.650
 once we take it we will notice that 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.660
 the result is pretty good with the 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.050
 blur applied is 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.610
 we can control it in any way 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.950
 how do you see we just click where 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.980
 we want to focus and it automatically comes out 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.480
 the point to modify the opening all 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.160
 the same thing that we have mentioned is 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.350
 applicable also to the recording of 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.330
 video so as you see is a very camera 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.950
 complete do not forget to give like 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.310

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.050
