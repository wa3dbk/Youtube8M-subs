00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.290 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.160 

except<00:00:23.290> on<00:00:23.410> cetera<00:00:23.710> okay<00:00:24.700> play<00:00:25.000> this<00:00:25.150> and<00:00:25.510> you

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
except on cetera okay play this and you

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.720 
except on cetera okay play this and you
can<00:00:26.289> either<00:00:26.410> do<00:00:26.620> two<00:00:26.860> things<00:00:27.220> about<00:00:27.400> it<00:00:27.700> you

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
can either do two things about it you

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.630 
can either do two things about it you
can<00:00:27.910> go<00:00:28.060> a<00:00:28.300> quick<00:00:28.870> chromatic<00:00:29.440> scale<00:00:29.710> some<00:00:30.039> C<00:00:30.340> up

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
can go a quick chromatic scale some C up

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:39.869 
can go a quick chromatic scale some C up
to<00:00:30.700> E<00:00:30.820> or<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:35.559> can<00:00:35.710> just<00:00:35.800> go<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:39.040> starts<00:00:39.640> off<00:00:39.760> in

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
to E or you can just go so starts off in

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:55.439 
to E or you can just go so starts off in
C<00:00:40.180> sub<00:00:40.660> D<00:00:40.900> E<00:00:40.960> flat<00:00:42.989> B<00:00:43.989> flat<00:00:44.020> D<00:00:44.560> a

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.200 

that's<00:00:56.760> lucky

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
that's lucky

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:07.750 
that's lucky
you'll<00:00:59.870> see<00:01:01.510> G<00:01:02.510> and<00:01:02.660> B<00:01:02.720> flat<00:01:06.490> second<00:01:07.490> time<00:01:07.640> you

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
you'll see G and B flat second time you

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.370 
you'll see G and B flat second time you
can<00:01:07.880> either<00:01:07.970> do<00:01:08.120> that<00:01:08.150> chromatic<00:01:08.720> again<00:01:09.110> we

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
can either do that chromatic again we

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:17.200 
can either do that chromatic again we
can<00:01:09.530> just<00:01:09.650> do<00:01:09.710> a<00:01:09.770> simple<00:01:15.729> it's<00:01:16.729> quite<00:01:16.910> hard<00:01:17.150> to

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
can just do a simple it's quite hard to

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.300 
can just do a simple it's quite hard to
do<00:01:17.360> that<00:01:17.479> chromatic<00:01:17.840> scale<00:01:18.020> quite<00:01:18.410> fast<00:01:18.680> so<00:01:18.890> I

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
do that chromatic scale quite fast so I

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.680 
do that chromatic scale quite fast so I
wanna<00:01:19.940> do<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.360> simple<00:01:20.690> version<00:01:22.330> so<00:01:23.330> feed<00:01:23.540> it

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
wanna do the simple version so feed it

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:31.630 
wanna do the simple version so feed it
so<00:01:26.680> now<00:01:27.680> for<00:01:27.740> F<00:01:28.340> you<00:01:28.670> can<00:01:28.880> either<00:01:29.270> do<00:01:29.869> same<00:01:30.619> C<00:01:30.920> go

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
so now for F you can either do same C go

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:39.700 
so now for F you can either do same C go
up<00:01:31.820> from<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.149> F<00:01:32.330> to<00:01:32.660> the<00:01:32.690> a<00:01:32.780> flat<00:01:35.590> let's<00:01:36.590> go<00:01:38.710> so

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
up from the F to the a flat let's go so

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:53.560 
up from the F to the a flat let's go so
that's<00:01:39.920> F<00:01:40.250> sharp<00:01:40.820> G<00:01:42.820> flat<00:01:43.820> F<00:01:44.149> G<00:01:46.119> da<00:01:51.759> do<00:01:52.759> you<00:01:52.850> see

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
that's F sharp G flat F G da do you see

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:18.110 
that's F sharp G flat F G da do you see
anything<00:02:10.120> G

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.780 

and<00:02:19.120> then<00:02:19.209> you<00:02:19.300> go<00:02:19.560> in<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.709> do<00:02:20.860> that<00:02:20.980> once<00:02:21.190> down

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
and then you go in to do that once down

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:32.790 
and then you go in to do that once down
to<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.030> F<00:02:29.489> and<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.989> baseline<00:02:31.989> you<00:02:32.500> can<00:02:32.650> just

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
to the F and the baseline you can just

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:43.480 
to the F and the baseline you can just
do

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.550 

I'll<00:02:44.300> take<00:02:44.480> koala<00:02:44.690> practice<00:02:45.110> just<00:02:45.320> to<00:02:45.380> get

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
I'll take koala practice just to get

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:55.190 
I'll take koala practice just to get
those<00:02:45.710> two<00:02:45.920> coordinated<00:02:46.580> or<00:02:47.330> you<00:02:47.390> can<00:02:47.540> just<00:02:47.630> do

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.550 

and<00:02:56.200> there's<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.710> ref<00:02:56.860> I<00:02:57.100> have<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.370> house
