00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:21.869
 I've been here for some time now. 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:27.750
 head wondering what will give the aih 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:30.890
 tendency to get him to start 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.739
 looking for a define chan 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.890
 still thinking what garbage is required to 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:44.510
 show why I always say 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:46.620
 for you to choose a long disc 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.360
 working on it 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.340
 so the first thing to do 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.989
 is to choose a niche you like 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:58.559
 people said that chu that has more 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:00.870
 who else seeks has a niche that is 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.080
 better I think all the animals are 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:09.170
 good when you do what you like and 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.610
 knows your audience very well and 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.140
 prepare a very good offer and start 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.119
 if you relate to them any junk is 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.380
 well I've seen people come in this 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.750
 who say that it is one of the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.270
 best on the internet and gives bad as ever 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.680
 I saw and also people entering a niche 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.210
 more growth that is the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.210
 well done 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:35.610
 so you have to do is study a lot 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:55.290
 well its your niche in your environment 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:56.880
 getting on a course does not do a good job 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.860
 championship 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.650
 small business owners to get out of the 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.970
 Brazilian crisis 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.380
 one of the things that comment very much the 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.640
 people talk about crisis 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.550
 I do not understand that it targets any 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:16.260
 because elton helton niche which is one of the 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.060
 more competitive even if you go online 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.130
 Only I've been working for some time 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.610
 build a structure and what I 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.110
 I always talk while it's great when 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.330
 has crisis because it ends up being the solution 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.819
 to them that your product is the solution 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.130
 for the crisis itself is not 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.660
 try to look for a product that is the 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.360
 solution of this crisis 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:43.019
 if you sell physical product you must 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:03:13.070
 enter by buying online one more 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:03:13.070
 Bit interesting to talk about that. 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.739
 to delay
