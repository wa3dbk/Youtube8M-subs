00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
demo so you see a lot of locations here

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.450 
demo so you see a lot of locations here
but<00:04:26.020> for<00:04:26.410> a<00:04:26.440> typical<00:04:26.800> user<00:04:26.980> you<00:04:27.190> would<00:04:27.250> see

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
but for a typical user you would see

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.950

address places you go to all the time so

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.300 
address places you go to all the time so
one<00:04:31.330> tap<00:04:31.630> and<00:04:31.930> you<00:04:32.410> can<00:04:32.590> get<00:04:32.710> directions<00:04:32.980> to

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310
