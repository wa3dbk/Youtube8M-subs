00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 yes 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.200
 many people have come to play at 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.480
 famous minecraft since it is a game of 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.419
 construction where you can use all your 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.510
 creativity to the fullest at its launch 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:28.150
 has two main modes the first 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.670
 it's survival where the players 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.059
 they must acquire resources to maintain their 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.100
 health and hunger and the creative way where 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.199
 the players have unlimited access to 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.030
 the resources of the game have the 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.610
 ability to fly and do not require 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.580
 Keep your health and hunger though 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.820
 there is also hardcore mode and other 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.830
 dimensions like hell and the end and 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.869
 Of course there is also multiplayer mode 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.589
 where you can connect with friends 

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:55.589
 internet medium 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.270
 but there is a character that has come to 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.070
 scare minecraft players already 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.620
 which is said to watch over everything 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.540
 You do or sometimes just watch you 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.420
 far away without being detected or 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.790
 it just appears next to you but what 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.600
 weird is when you look at this character of 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.970
 front 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.799
 since he has white eyes and does not 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.990
 the name appears above him as 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:26.110
 usually appears in users of 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.509
 minecraft and that is what gives chills 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.980
 because no one else should appear 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:34.260
 with you unless you're in multiplayer 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.870
 this character is known by the name 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.850
 of hero brain and here the first capture 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.640
 that he managed to take this famous 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.870
 character 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.870
 tonight 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.550
 but who gerbrand there are several 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.650
 versions of him 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.330
 one of them is that night who is one 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.310
 from the creators of minecraft came to 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.350
 have a little brother who died 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.140
 and it manifests itself in the game by giving it 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.690
 big scares people do not know 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.729
 nothing of this mysterious character much 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.190
 people thought it was a simple joke or 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.470
 maybe someone in the wet stepped in 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.479
 per player what is known is that 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.030
 Wet denies that there is a character 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.090
 called hero brain and night denies having 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.670
 had a little brother a very thing 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.280
 curious in one of the updates of 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.040
 minecraft to be more concrete in the 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.880
 beta 1.6 points 6 had as 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.580
 update grass or I removed then 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.150
 it will be true that wetting did not know anything about 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.150
 hero brain 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.920
 the thing does not end here since they wet 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.240
 never eliminated hero brain from the game there 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.120
 many people who in the updates 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.250
 following has appeared to hero 20 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.850
 without using any mode in the update 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.910
 1 point 7.1 the line of hero wayne 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.040
 remove again appeared is curious 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.810
 because in an update they delete it and 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.510
 in the next one they delete it again 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.390
 but decide where you want to go or attack 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.690
 you do not see him when he walks alone he looks 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.390
 stopped hero rain is a human with the 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.060
 same skin as stibys however it has 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.190
 bright white eyes is not the 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.200
 minecraft there is no source code 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.120
 that allows anyone to 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.280
 act like him or to elaborate more 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.410
 you will die with the traps or 2 x tunnels 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.590
 2 and random constructions like 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.170
 pyramids in the middle of the ocean is a 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.870
 unknown entity considered crepe and 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.470
 pasta many times seen as a miner 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.470
 dead 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.350
 I leave you a video of the appearances of 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.350

 plus 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.600
