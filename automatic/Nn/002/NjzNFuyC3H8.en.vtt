00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.080
 we go and 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.000
 I ask him 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.000
 but first I go 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.300
 about to come out elongated 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.800
 twigs on the outside around us 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.380
 the heart 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.269
 which I get there just comes off 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.750
 another sheet for the platform instead 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.750
 here is 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.750
 on the one hand you come the leaf of one 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.570
 ivy 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:46.750
 you start you this is nice to leave 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.750
 work with photos of a poppy 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.950
 and on the other hand maybe another 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.100
 twig with on one 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.309
 a 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.519
 my boxer from a short list because here 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.629
 I can pay attention so the passage comes 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.960
 to look like 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.880
 but we have to put this together 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.159
 can't just put a thread there 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.790
 do around it but different to piece for 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.630
 piece on the street 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.159
 how we derive the experiments at approximately 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.310
 an inch 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.860
 silent and we will extend this 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.869
 for this address jumper wire pierce it in 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.869
 the trees 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:38.610
 rose and then we work together 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.610
 we finish with a piece of ready film 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.170
 and then going to work that's because we 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.880
 screws 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:53.409
 to pack that it no longer changed 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.409
 so cars of the 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:02.869
 and a street that needs excitement 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:07.479
 here in it your excess thread stinks 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.479
 to get what 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:16.610
 ivy leaf that I have been talking about 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:22.880
 these twigs and then just the length of the 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:24.319
 rose from how long should cut here and 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.970
 your two branches 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.970
 find this profile together 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.129
 and the settle with talk 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.000
 I could put it together we start with 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.240
 it listens action 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.460
 there comes at once, but note that 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.300
 the underside of the branches on the side 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:02.530
 of bronze at a point the point the city 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:07.990
 come together and you turn those two 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:11.560
 threads with a sweeper than a leaf 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.550
 on the back but also on one 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.220
 downside 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:20.569
 come to a let and now you have to 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:27.010
 make sure you go the same way 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:30.859
 the next thing again and negatives 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.230
 and turn the same way as you do that 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:37.180
 same side always goes on then 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.180
 the children's ski is required 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.629
 push device 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.909
 to give up 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.240
 quick another 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:01.240
 Men entire board sheet on here 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:05.880
 bottom but the more always different 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.880
 together in that one 10 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.650
 and the luxury 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.970
 flowers happened 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.280
 as 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.250
 that you for a moment 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.940
 that is possible on a narrow leaf 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.630
 to come to the rear 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.630
 you stay away from 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.810
 as will be seen from the passages, and 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:54.790
 we cut the bottom of the wire 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:55.960
 cut off nicely and I finish it with 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.270
 rims 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:03.180
 look here is the dim point come other 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.180
 threads together at one point 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:12.739
 at the partner movie you have to go there 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:12.739
 pull to bond well 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.919
 it gets very thin well when they do 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:22.860
 is such a person may the iron rails 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:28.310
 gemert then you can go back sometime 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:31.050
 turning stitching result 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.389
 it breaks it off just the last 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.990
 between thumb and forefinger 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:39.800
 and then it's stuck and then we have one 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.800
 kiss made 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:50.000
 we are if you can attach yourself 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.850
 and play has a disadvantage stop the blouse or 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.780
 the door damaged can also use 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:59.180
 of a decrease then this does not damage 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.759
 the fabric but magnet has a whole 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:05.590
 major disadvantage that may not be used 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:05.590
 for people with a pacemaker 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.389
 your magnet must be rather invisible 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.970
 be made and also that you are stuck to 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:17.389
 but fix that again you do with 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:20.199
 that pairs film rubber tire 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:20.199
 whatever you want 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.800
 the wraps it up 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.420
 and are you actually small but it 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.870
 is a boxer suit 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:40.070
 fast way cheap 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:42.680
 there's a nice one and that's the use 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.780
 from that joke lab 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.540
 the packet magnet earn am very small 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:51.520
 I assume that you stick on here 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.520
 bottom of 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.730
 next leaf that they are on the street 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.020
 and a little bit 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:14.669
 and then stick the magnet between the two 

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:14.669
 leaves 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.139
 press a little bit 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:26.199
 just have to wait a minute because 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.199
 then the line has dried up 

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:33.099
 you settle this with rubber band 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.099
 were film 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:45.280
 and then you do this picture with the magnet 

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:47.890
 do you behind the corsage 

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:50.140
 and then run this 

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.960
 the stalk and of course not 

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:56.120
 to buy 

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.120
 be eliminated with treadmill 

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:04.770
 look then you have very striking among the 

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:11.330
 two leaves are also a magnet 

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:11.330
 it can carry you very well
