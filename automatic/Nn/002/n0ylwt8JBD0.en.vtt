there<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.080> first<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.650> think<00:01:13.979> I've<00:01:14.100> decided<00:01:14.400> on<00:01:14.610> a

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
there is first I think I've decided on a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.550 
there is first I think I've decided on a
wing<00:01:14.939> now<00:01:15.299> normally<00:01:15.750> I'd<00:01:15.869> go<00:01:16.020> with<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> much

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
wing now normally I'd go with a much

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.429 
wing now normally I'd go with a much
bigger<00:01:16.920> gaping<00:01:17.729> wing<00:01:18.030> but<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.960> be<00:01:19.049> honest<00:01:19.320> I

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
bigger gaping wing but to be honest I

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.320 
bigger gaping wing but to be honest I
think<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.710> looks<00:01:19.860> pretty<00:01:20.070> cool<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.700> don't

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
think that looks pretty cool I don't

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.179 
think that looks pretty cool I don't
know<00:01:21.390> maybe<00:01:21.720> maybe<00:01:22.170> your<00:01:22.409> subtle<00:01:22.860> wing<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
know maybe maybe your subtle wing is the

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.010 
know maybe maybe your subtle wing is the
way<00:01:23.460> forward<00:01:23.759> with<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.090> car<00:01:24.390> these<00:01:24.689> hopes

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
way forward with this car these hopes

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.780 
way forward with this car these hopes
I'm<00:01:25.170> not<00:01:25.350> really<00:01:25.530> liking<00:01:25.860> at<00:01:26.130> all<00:01:26.250> like<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.549> want

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
I'm not really liking at all like I want

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.219 
I'm not really liking at all like I want
to<00:01:26.850> go<00:01:26.909> with<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> cold<00:01:27.330> hood<00:01:27.600> for<00:01:27.810> their<00:01:27.930> support

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
to go with a cold hood for their support

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.810 
to go with a cold hood for their support
it's<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.130> wrong

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
it's just wrong

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.819 
it's just wrong
it<00:01:30.090> doesn't<00:01:30.360> look<00:01:30.450> right<00:01:30.659> whatsoever<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.650> what

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
it doesn't look right whatsoever so what

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.280 
it doesn't look right whatsoever so what
we're<00:01:31.920> gonna<00:01:31.979> do<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.400> have<00:01:32.820> no<00:01:33.299> Haj<00:01:33.509> that's<00:01:34.049> all

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
we're gonna do is have no Haj that's all

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.749 
we're gonna do is have no Haj that's all
I<00:01:34.619> think<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.070> looks<00:01:35.340> better

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
I think that looks better

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.800 
I think that looks better
let's<00:01:35.970> go<00:01:36.090> for<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.360> nice<00:01:36.689> license<00:01:37.500> plate<00:01:37.829> I

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
let's go for a nice license plate I

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.510 
let's go for a nice license plate I
don't<00:01:39.810> know<00:01:39.930> why<00:01:40.140> you'd<00:01:40.409> want<00:01:40.439> eggs<00:01:40.860> as<00:01:41.310> your

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
will go black and this so that's that's

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.349 
will go black and this so that's that's
close<00:02:45.769> enough<00:02:45.799> like<00:02:46.220> it's<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.489> mat<00:02:46.730> hold<00:02:47.000> it'sa

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
close enough like it's a mat hold it'sa

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.990 
close enough like it's a mat hold it'sa
black<00:02:47.659> cord<00:02:48.200> instead<00:02:48.730> because<00:02:49.730> there<00:02:49.939> are

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
black cord instead because there are

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.119 
black cord instead because there are
other<00:02:50.120> thing<00:02:50.329> that<00:02:50.359> was<00:02:50.599> a<00:02:50.840> version<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:51.859> this

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
other thing that was a version of this

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.369 
other thing that was a version of this
hot<00:02:52.370> button<00:02:52.790> carbon<00:02:53.239> so<00:02:53.419> that'll<00:02:53.780> do<00:02:53.959> anyway

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
hot button carbon so that'll do anyway

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.129 
hot button carbon so that'll do anyway
but<00:02:55.129> I<00:02:55.430> think<00:02:55.849> that's<00:02:56.060> pretty<00:02:56.419> much<00:02:56.720> that

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.139 
but I think that's pretty much that

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:01.539 
but I think that's pretty much that
we<00:02:57.590> are<00:02:57.739> done<00:02:58.010> with<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.939> rx-7<00:02:59.359> save<00:03:00.260> yes<00:03:00.889> she
