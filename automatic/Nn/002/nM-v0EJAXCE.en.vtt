00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
video but if you've got the older models

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.689 
video but if you've got the older models
with<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.560> same<00:00:19.740> engine<00:00:20.039> you're<00:00:20.490> probably

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
with the same engine you're probably

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.550 
with the same engine you're probably
good<00:00:20.970> but<00:00:21.539> with<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.840> newer<00:00:22.050> one<00:00:22.260> like<00:00:22.439> this

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
good but with the newer one like this

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.320 
good but with the newer one like this
one<00:00:22.769> different<00:00:23.400> slightly<00:00:23.850> different<00:00:24.000> a

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
one different slightly different a

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.939 
one different slightly different a
intake<00:00:24.689> manifold<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.320> different<00:00:25.769> shape

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
intake manifold so a different shape

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:34.450 
intake manifold so a different shape
don't<00:00:26.490> buy<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.730> today

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.280 

Commodore<00:00:35.670> which<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.059> anything<00:00:36.600> with<00:00:36.989> this

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
Commodore which is anything with this

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.440 
Commodore which is anything with this
3.8<00:00:37.980> liter<00:00:38.190> vo-tech<00:00:38.910> engine

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
3.8 liter vo-tech engine

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.440 
3.8 liter vo-tech engine
okay<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.379> we've<00:00:40.620> got<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:41.070> plenum<00:00:41.940> insulator

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
okay so we've got the plenum insulator

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.660 
okay so we've got the plenum insulator
this<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.140> both<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.710> these<00:00:43.829> are<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.160> 12<00:00:44.430> ml

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
this is the both of these are the 12 ml

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.779 
this is the both of these are the 12 ml
version<00:00:45.059> if<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:45.989> get<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> 25<00:00:46.739> it'll<00:00:47.670> become

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
version if you get the 25 it'll become

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.959 
version if you get the 25 it'll become
too<00:00:48.270> high<00:00:49.039> okay<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.430> will<00:00:50.489> heat<00:00:50.670> your<00:00:50.760> roof

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
around the engine do all six both sides

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:31.670 
around the engine do all six both sides
for<00:02:10.450> an<00:02:10.570> inside

obviously before I put it back on I want

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.630 
obviously before I put it back on I want
it<00:02:41.170> clean<00:02:41.410> so<00:02:41.950> I'm<00:02:42.040> gonna<00:02:42.130> go<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.340> agree<00:02:42.610> to

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.380 
it clean so I'm gonna go to agree to
this<00:02:42.849> and<00:02:43.120> I'll<00:02:43.690> show<00:02:43.840> how<00:02:43.959> it<00:02:44.050> looks<00:02:44.200> on<00:02:44.319> feet

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
this and I'll show how it looks on feet

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.820 
this and I'll show how it looks on feet
okay<00:02:46.390> so<00:02:46.690> just<00:02:46.720> got<00:02:46.989> in<00:02:47.110> there<00:02:47.230> for<00:02:47.410> wire<00:02:47.560> brush

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
okay so just got in there for wire brush

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.530 
okay so just got in there for wire brush
and<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:48.100> degreaser<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:50.970> came<00:02:51.970> out<00:02:52.090> pretty<00:02:52.239> good

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
and a degreaser and came out pretty good

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.309 
and a degreaser and came out pretty good
cracked<00:02:53.200> five<00:02:53.500> bolts<00:02:57.780> take<00:02:58.780> them<00:02:58.900> out<00:02:59.050> now

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
cracked five bolts take them out now

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.860 
cracked five bolts take them out now
that<00:02:59.739> I<00:02:59.769> have<00:02:59.980> those<00:03:00.099> bolts<00:03:00.459> out<00:03:03.870> but

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
that I have those bolts out but

00:03:04.870 --> 00:04:10.900 
that I have those bolts out but
obviously<00:03:04.959> you<00:03:05.440> got<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:05.680> get<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:17.560> cloth

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.110 

take<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.030> fuel<00:04:12.240> rail<00:04:12.420> bulbs<00:04:12.780> out<00:04:13.040> now<00:04:14.060> know<00:04:15.060> if

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
take the fuel rail bulbs out now know if

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.750 
take the fuel rail bulbs out now know if
you<00:04:15.210> can<00:04:15.360> see<00:04:15.600> how<00:04:16.290> many<00:04:16.440> not<00:04:16.650> just<00:04:17.400> under

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
you can see how many not just under

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:28.760 
you can see how many not just under
there<00:04:17.970> behind<00:04:18.810> this<00:04:19.200> first<00:04:20.010> fuel<00:04:27.590> fuel<00:04:28.590> rail

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
there behind this first fuel fuel rail

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:36.920 
there behind this first fuel fuel rail
it's<00:04:28.950> felt<00:04:29.220> it's<00:04:30.210> just<00:04:30.480> below<00:04:35.690> where<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.780> old

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
it's felt it's just below where the old

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.750 
it's felt it's just below where the old
bolts<00:04:37.230> used<00:04:37.440> to<00:04:37.560> be<00:04:37.710> we're<00:04:38.280> going<00:04:38.430> to<00:04:38.520> put<00:04:38.640> this

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
bolts used to be we're going to put this

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.030 
bolts used to be we're going to put this
bowl<00:04:39.020> with<00:04:40.020> a<00:04:40.290> little<00:04:40.590> washer<00:04:40.860> that<00:04:40.980> comes

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
bowl with a little washer that comes

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.690 
bowl with a little washer that comes
with<00:04:41.370> it

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
with it

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.460 
with it
yeah<00:04:42.510> the<00:04:42.660> washers<00:04:42.960> going<00:04:43.140> to<00:04:43.200> be<00:04:43.290> on<00:04:43.380> the

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
yeah the washers going to be on the

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.340 
yeah the washers going to be on the
bottom<00:04:43.620> like<00:04:44.550> that<00:04:44.810> then<00:04:45.810> it's<00:04:45.990> gonna<00:04:46.110> go<00:04:46.320> a

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
bottom like that then it's gonna go a

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.390 
bottom like that then it's gonna go a
fuel<00:04:46.650> rail<00:04:47.990> then<00:04:48.990> this<00:04:49.170> space<00:04:49.470> up<00:04:49.800> above<00:04:49.980> the

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
fuel rail then this space up above the

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.550 
fuel rail then this space up above the
fuel<00:04:50.610> rail<00:04:50.790> then<00:04:51.630> what<00:04:51.780> screw<00:04:51.990> it<00:04:52.020> in<00:04:52.200> through

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
fuel rail then what screw it in through

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.890 
fuel rail then what screw it in through
the<00:04:52.620> magic<00:04:52.860> of<00:04:52.920> editing

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
the magic of editing

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.290 
the magic of editing
I've<00:04:54.900> now<00:04:55.320> installed<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:57.320> thingamajig<00:04:58.320> ease

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
I've now installed the thingamajig ease

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.780 
I've now installed the thingamajig ease
there<00:05:00.300> you<00:05:00.900> can<00:05:01.020> see<00:05:02.150> that<00:05:03.150> super<00:05:03.450> bit<00:05:03.600> there

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
there you can see that super bit there

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.630 
there you can see that super bit there
you<00:05:05.790> see<00:05:06.000> it<00:05:06.090> and<00:05:06.240> that<00:05:06.420> one<00:05:06.650> okay<00:05:07.650> there<00:05:08.460> the

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
you see it and that one okay there the

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.680 
you see it and that one okay there the
spacer<00:05:08.940> okay<00:05:10.010> what<00:05:11.010> you<00:05:11.100> didn't<00:05:11.430> see<00:05:11.640> is<00:05:11.850> me

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
spacer okay what you didn't see is me

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.640 
spacer okay what you didn't see is me
 up<00:05:13.080> big-time<00:05:15.020> while<00:05:16.020> putting<00:05:16.380> one<00:05:16.560> of

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
 up big-time while putting one of

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.170 
 up big-time while putting one of
those<00:05:16.740> spaces<00:05:17.040> in<00:05:17.400> okay<00:05:18.270> it<00:05:19.230> decided<00:05:19.620> to<00:05:19.860> go

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
those spaces in okay it decided to go

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:28.720 
those spaces in okay it decided to go
down<00:05:22.370> the<00:05:23.370> injector<00:05:24.150> okay<00:05:25.080> literally<00:05:26.040> down

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.700 

that<00:05:29.730> little<00:05:29.970> piece<00:05:30.120> of<00:05:30.270> green<00:05:30.450> tape<00:05:30.690> I<00:05:31.050> just

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
that little piece of green tape I just

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.350 
that little piece of green tape I just
I've<00:05:31.860> covered<00:05:32.130> them<00:05:32.310> all<00:05:32.460> up<00:05:32.640> now<00:05:32.820> just

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
I've covered them all up now just

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.600 
I've covered them all up now just
because<00:05:33.630> I'm<00:05:33.780> paranoid<00:05:34.430> yeah

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
because I'm paranoid yeah

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.360 
because I'm paranoid yeah
it<00:05:35.700> literally<00:05:36.000> went<00:05:36.300> down<00:05:36.600> the<00:05:36.810> injector<00:05:37.370> and

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
it literally went down the injector and

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.880 
it literally went down the injector and
all<00:05:39.419> I<00:05:39.690> spent<00:05:40.080> an<00:05:40.140> hour<00:05:40.320> getting<00:05:40.530> that

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
all I spent an hour getting that

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:48.340 
all I spent an hour getting that
out<00:05:41.100> and<00:05:41.310> I<00:05:42.300> tried<00:05:42.810> vacuum<00:05:43.260> cleaner<00:05:47.090> skewer

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
out and I tried vacuum cleaner skewer

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.380 
out and I tried vacuum cleaner skewer
with<00:05:49.350> blue<00:05:49.830> tack<00:05:50.040> on<00:05:50.220> it<00:05:50.250> okay

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
with blue tack on it okay

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.150 
with blue tack on it okay
it<00:05:51.750> ended<00:05:51.990> up<00:05:52.020> going<00:05:52.230> in<00:05:52.590> the<00:05:52.740> middle<00:05:52.980> of<00:05:53.070> the

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
it ended up going in the middle of the

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.909 
it ended up going in the middle of the
spacer<00:05:53.600> extreme<00:05:54.600> it<00:05:54.810> in<00:05:54.930> and<00:05:55.380> it<00:05:55.500> pull<00:05:55.740> and

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
spacer extreme it in and it pull and

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.650 
spacer extreme it in and it pull and
pulled<00:05:56.130> it<00:05:56.250> out<00:05:56.340> probably<00:05:56.940> about<00:05:57.120> 10<00:05:57.360> temps

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
pulled it out probably about 10 temps

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.630 
pulled it out probably about 10 temps
out<00:05:57.780> it<00:05:57.900> but<00:05:58.140> I<00:05:58.320> finally<00:05:58.560> got<00:05:58.680> it<00:05:58.860> out<00:05:58.950> yeah

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
out it but I finally got it out yeah

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.490 
out it but I finally got it out yeah
your<00:05:59.880> silicon<00:06:00.330> the<00:06:00.660> top<00:06:00.900> of<00:06:01.050> the<00:06:01.140> space<00:06:01.320> and

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
your silicon the top of the space and

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.990 
your silicon the top of the space and
you<00:06:01.710> know<00:06:01.830> it's<00:06:01.980> the<00:06:02.040> top<00:06:02.190> because<00:06:02.490> that<00:06:02.520> is<00:06:02.850> at

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
you know it's the top because that is at

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.050 
you know it's the top because that is at
the<00:06:03.090> back<00:06:03.240> left<00:06:03.680> okay<00:06:04.680> so<00:06:05.430> your<00:06:05.580> silicon<00:06:05.910> the

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
the back left okay so your silicon the

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.530 
the back left okay so your silicon the
top<00:06:06.240> of<00:06:06.360> this<00:06:07.310> okay<00:06:08.310> and<00:06:08.520> the<00:06:08.910> bottom<00:06:09.210> will<00:06:09.390> you

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
top of this okay and the bottom will you

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.690 
top of this okay and the bottom will you
silicon<00:06:09.960> the<00:06:10.110> car<00:06:10.560> so<00:06:11.100> when<00:06:11.190> it<00:06:11.310> goes<00:06:11.400> in<00:06:11.580> is

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.700 
silicon the car so when it goes in is

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.310 
silicon the car so when it goes in is
like<00:06:11.820> that<00:06:12.000> I<00:06:12.180> was<00:06:12.539> just<00:06:12.720> doing<00:06:12.930> this<00:06:13.020> first

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
like that I was just doing this first

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.290 
like that I was just doing this first
because<00:06:13.710> when<00:06:14.430> the<00:06:14.550> tube<00:06:14.729> starts<00:06:15.030> getting

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
because when the tube starts getting

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.800 
because when the tube starts getting
empty<00:06:15.570> it

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
empty it

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.300 
empty it
to<00:06:15.870> be<00:06:15.960> harder<00:06:16.260> to<00:06:16.290> do<00:06:16.500> it<00:06:16.620> in<00:06:16.710> there<00:06:16.889> and<00:06:17.190> it's

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
to be harder to do it in there and it's

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.409 
to be harder to do it in there and it's
going<00:06:17.460> to<00:06:17.520> be<00:06:17.610> to<00:06:17.730> do<00:06:17.850> it<00:06:17.940> on<00:06:18.030> the<00:06:18.090> other<00:06:18.150> thing

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
going to be to do it on the other thing

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:19.610 
going to be to do it on the other thing
sitting<00:06:18.630> on<00:06:18.720> the<00:06:18.780> floor<00:06:18.960> or<00:06:19.080> something<00:06:19.200> okay

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
sitting on the floor or something okay

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.320 
sitting on the floor or something okay
okay<00:06:20.220> so<00:06:20.280> you<00:06:20.430> can<00:06:20.550> see<00:06:20.639> the<00:06:20.730> silicon<00:06:21.120> there

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
okay so you can see the silicon there

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.600 
okay so you can see the silicon there
and<00:06:23.480> I've<00:06:24.480> applied<00:06:24.780> it<00:06:25.110> on<00:06:25.200> here<00:06:25.530> now<00:06:25.710> okay<00:06:26.550> so

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
and I've applied it on here now okay so

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.129 
and I've applied it on here now okay so
this<00:06:26.880> is<00:06:27.030> it

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 
this is it

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:54.560 
this is it
I'm<00:06:28.440> gonna<00:06:28.620> put<00:06:28.889> it<00:06:29.010> on<00:06:31.280> fingers<00:06:32.280> crossed

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:54.570 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.600 

okay<00:06:55.570> so<00:06:55.630> right<00:06:56.140> there<00:06:56.440> as<00:06:56.740> you<00:06:56.920> can<00:06:56.980> see<00:06:57.070> that

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:57.610 
okay so right there as you can see that

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.190 
okay so right there as you can see that
bit<00:06:57.880> that<00:06:58.150> I've<00:06:58.240> just<00:06:58.360> put<00:06:58.540> the<00:06:58.660> circle<00:06:59.050> round

00:06:59.190 --> 00:06:59.200 
bit that I've just put the circle round

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.640 
bit that I've just put the circle round
this<00:06:59.980> is<00:07:00.190> why<00:07:00.400> you<00:07:00.460> can't<00:07:01.060> use<00:07:01.180> this<00:07:01.840> spacer<00:07:02.140> on

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.650 
this is why you can't use this spacer on

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.950 
this is why you can't use this spacer on
the<00:07:03.400> vex<00:07:04.470> on<00:07:05.470> the<00:07:05.680> vex<00:07:05.890> Commodore<00:07:06.730> the<00:07:07.630> intake

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 
the vex on the vex Commodore the intake

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.930 
the vex on the vex Commodore the intake
manifold<00:07:08.380> as<00:07:08.530> you<00:07:08.650> can<00:07:08.770> see<00:07:09.010> that<00:07:09.580> little<00:07:09.790> bit

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:09.940 
manifold as you can see that little bit

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.300 
manifold as you can see that little bit
sticks<00:07:10.270> out<00:07:10.450> to<00:07:10.600> the<00:07:10.720> right<00:07:10.930> and<00:07:11.230> air<00:07:11.920> sucks

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:12.310 
sticks out to the right and air sucks

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.980 
sticks out to the right and air sucks
straight<00:07:12.580> through<00:07:12.820> it<00:07:12.970> even<00:07:13.360> if<00:07:13.690> you<00:07:13.810> use<00:07:13.960> the

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:13.990 
straight through it even if you use the

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.230 
straight through it even if you use the
gasket<00:07:14.680> a<00:07:15.130> gasket<00:07:15.730> doesn't<00:07:15.850> matter<00:07:16.120> because

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 
gasket a gasket doesn't matter because

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.490 
gasket a gasket doesn't matter because
obviously<00:07:16.450> the<00:07:16.720> top<00:07:16.900> still<00:07:17.170> going<00:07:17.320> to<00:07:17.380> have

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:17.500 
obviously the top still going to have

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.100 
obviously the top still going to have
the<00:07:17.590> gap<00:07:17.770> so<00:07:18.010> you<00:07:18.400> cannot<00:07:18.850> use<00:07:19.180> this<00:07:19.570> spacer

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.110 
the gap so you cannot use this spacer

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.120 
the gap so you cannot use this spacer
with<00:07:20.380> this<00:07:20.560> intake<00:07:21.160> manifold<00:07:22.260> so<00:07:23.260> yes<00:07:23.500> maybe

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.130 
with this intake manifold so yes maybe

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.280 
with this intake manifold so yes maybe
you<00:07:24.280> can<00:07:24.430> of<00:07:24.550> the<00:07:24.640> older<00:07:24.910> engine<00:07:25.210> same<00:07:25.870> same

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:26.290 
you can of the older engine same same

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.880 
you can of the older engine same same
engine<00:07:26.620> but<00:07:26.650> different<00:07:27.130> oh<00:07:27.630> baby<00:07:28.630> I<00:07:28.660> can't<00:07:29.650> do

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:29.890 
engine but different oh baby I can't do

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.930 
engine but different oh baby I can't do
a<00:07:29.920> bit<00:07:30.340> of<00:07:30.460> a<00:07:30.580> hassle<00:07:30.760> to<00:07:30.970> screw<00:07:32.760> screw<00:07:33.760> down

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:33.940 
a bit of a hassle to screw screw down

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.560 
a bit of a hassle to screw screw down
but<00:07:34.330> it's<00:07:34.480> it's<00:07:34.690> on<00:07:34.870> good
