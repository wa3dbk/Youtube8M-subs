 twenty five hello everyone today I bring you 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.830
 the myth the number 12 in call of duty 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.430
 cost on the map the new ones of leces already 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.020
 you know and well there's a kid I made a 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.170
 video saying that there was an interest 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.420
 that if there's a scene from the girl's 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.920
 well I do not know if you know what movie is the 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.900
 little girl from the well something like that I do not know if in 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.940
 English I do not remember the title well but 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.640
 good to leave here the cover of the 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.290
 movie and well they say that this is a 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.090
 hysterical it's worth the scene of that 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.480
 film because the soil is full of 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.090
 water there is a sofa and a television there with 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.100
 the fog is not like it is not 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.250
 tuned well the channel and good as 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.930
 you see there is a vhs tape out there and 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.680
 it is good because the soil full of water 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.879
 there are not some kids who have done the 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.920
 video saying good that these sounds 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.570
 tÃ©rek and that has to do with that 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.600
 movie worth 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.120
 I would say that it is not possible worth it is a 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.520
 myth that could be possible is worth it because 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.229
 with the theme of more than anything because of the theme 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.120
 because the michael's streak is 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.160
 myers that you were not maybe this 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.380
 map may also have made you a 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.110
 small nod to that movie but good 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.140
 also good I do not know if you know is the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.810
 well just in the other part of the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.940
 map and also a ghost comes out and good 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.430
 yes that could be worth it is a myth that in 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.840
 I do not know I leave it impossible I can not 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.660
 to say that it is false or that it is true 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.460
 but it could be possible and well I have 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.020
 seen in a video a kid who said 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.480
 that this was a mystery simply 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.710
 this is a myth as I say it is not 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.030
 that my cousin told me or that 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.360
 neither my cousin nor my friend nor such 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.070
 simply because it is a detail and good 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.200
 the truth that I find quite curious 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.920
 and it's a myth that could be possible 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.100
 I leave it there neither lie nor true nor 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.630
 false I left it there so nothing 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.100
 more I hope you like the video if you 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.690

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.230
