 Hello everyone today decided all the same 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.259
 I could not make a short video 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:15.030
 to restrain came to us today grid 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:19.490

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:23.100

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:28.590
 brought my husband went to the market on 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:32.099
 construction persuaded I persuaded him 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:37.100
 I hope the parrots will be happy too 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:42.450
 that this is of course all for them and the grid 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:46.469
 bars and i can't wait when 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:51.170
 it will all be ready well of course i say 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:54.770
 about the aviary we will do the aviary my dream 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.710
 so that the birds were comfortable there freely 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:02.430
 interesting well and also the video of course I will 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.810
 shoot here and about how we will build 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.140
 aviary and how they live there a lot 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.140
 what 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.750
 so the size of the enclosure I want to make such 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:22.800
 that's where the bars stand 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:26.370
 from here then of course there will be such 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:30.980
 not too from a friend and here about until 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:35.370
 here on the wall I show on the wall 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.500
 Well, imagine how it will be about 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.170
 but the corner won't stick out well here on 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.330
 I will only get the attention 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.229
 please apply here to find any of 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:50.910
 what kind of old monitor is there 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:55.460
 it's there watching some 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:02:00.540
 from here so here so here so here so 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.490
 then there probably will be no corner want 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.500
 so that there is no island angle from type 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:10.260
 trapezoid like this will be a little beveled 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:13.290
 up here and the wall well I tried 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.830
 submit the size of the aviary which I 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.540
 want and 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:22.800
 the amount of mesh we bought 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.440
 should be considered enough already but 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.010
 We understand little bars so much later 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.680
 still have to re-buy my husband took 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.730
 any twist points any bolts and 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.560
 screws I do not know what it's called 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.150
 when brought the grid well of course i 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.720
 approximately told what should be 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.519
 said that there were generally two words 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.310
 what is hot dip galvanized 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:54.810
 some kind of super galvanizing in general 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:58.890
 stainless steel then I separately when I will 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:02.550
 I will do separate videos about 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:06.590
 Aviary in stages I'll try it all and 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:10.290
 writer name and size and all this 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:15.480
 I will tell all this how we are 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:18.120
 did how it all comes out wants it started 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.889
 such a great time is not very much 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.680
 a little bit every day 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:26.290
 I don't know how it will be 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.359
 combined with the fact that there are parrots and 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.430
 at the same time it will be necessary to build an aviary 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:34.659
 probably some sort of sectional will 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.939
 first things in sections are somehow acceptable 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:39.129
 first there is one text there is one wall 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:41.950
 then another will somehow be collected in 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:44.459
 Generally I do not know how I will do it. 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.280
 I will just shoot 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.349
 the case of the master is afraid 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.750
 Here on all my experiences I can 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:57.239
 said don't worry everything will be feng shui 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.879
 is he joking 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:03.669
 everything and I already dream what i have 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:06.040
 will voyeur maybe i even have it 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:09.879
 somehow decorating how they will be there 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:13.840
 Birds free what will be there sticks 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:18.150
 what toys oh my thoughts so much in 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:24.240
 Generally for now, while the news is such a 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:28.389
 in general, Iâ€™m ready to do a big topic 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:32.820
 nutrition turned out that she needed more 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:36.599
 detailed topic more extensive 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.659
 try to make a deadline a 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:43.870
 today is such news 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:47.590
 Well, everybody, everybody, for the time being, I will dream further 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:52.409
 for now anyway while at work what am I 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:55.509
 husband and let us draw drawings 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:59.680
 dream well and slowly maybe 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:05.560
 start doing and everything will shoot it on 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:07.889
