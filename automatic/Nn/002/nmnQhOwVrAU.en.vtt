00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
tutorials and he was trying to create a

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.009 
tutorials and he was trying to create a
brick<00:00:11.099> wall<00:00:11.429> but<00:00:11.670> unfortunately<00:00:12.389> his<00:00:12.630> bricks

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
brick wall but unfortunately his bricks

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.640 
brick wall but unfortunately his bricks
were<00:00:13.380> far<00:00:13.860> too<00:00:13.889> big<00:00:14.580> it<00:00:14.849> was<00:00:15.150> unrealistic<00:00:15.870> now

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
don't and frankly my windows XP as a gig

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.130 
don't and frankly my windows XP as a gig
of<00:00:31.080> ram<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:32.369> would<00:00:32.610> probably<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.600> my<00:00:33.840> crash

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
of ram and it would probably in my crash

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.799 
of ram and it would probably in my crash
it<00:00:34.350> oh<00:00:34.440> I'll<00:00:34.770> install<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.430> find<00:00:35.610> out<00:00:35.809> and

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
it oh I'll install it and find out and

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.170 
it oh I'll install it and find out and
then<00:00:36.960> never<00:00:37.410> mind<00:00:37.500> um<00:00:38.600> basically<00:00:40.610> how<00:00:41.610> do<00:00:41.670> we

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
then never mind um basically how do we

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.790 
then never mind um basically how do we
scale<00:00:42.540> down<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.899> bricks<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.410> make<00:00:43.530> them<00:00:43.649> more

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
scale down the bricks and make them more

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.680 
scale down the bricks and make them more
realistic<00:00:43.980> well<00:00:44.969> I'm<00:00:45.090> going<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.239> make<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> wall

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
realistic well I'm going to make a wall

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.240 
realistic well I'm going to make a wall
out<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.170> cube<00:00:47.149> wrong<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.180> do<00:00:48.860> press<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.980> C<00:00:50.219> key

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
out of a cube wrong I do press the C key

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.610 
out of a cube wrong I do press the C key
make<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.940> editable<00:00:51.270> I'm<00:00:52.170> just<00:00:52.350> going<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.530> do

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
make it editable I'm just going to do

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.319 
make it editable I'm just going to do
this<00:00:52.710> very<00:00:52.980> quickly<00:00:53.309> because<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:54.090> whole

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
this very quickly because the whole

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.160 
this very quickly because the whole
point<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:54.899> tutorial<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:56.930> make<00:00:57.930> a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
point of this tutorial is to make a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:08.030 
point of this tutorial is to make a
realistic<00:00:58.770> brick<00:00:59.609> wall<00:01:03.260> okay<00:01:04.549> let's<00:01:05.570> big<00:01:07.040> okay

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
realistic brick wall okay let's big okay

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.380 
realistic brick wall okay let's big okay
so<00:01:08.850> we've<00:01:08.939> got<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.180> wall<00:01:10.010> like<00:01:11.010> back<00:01:11.580> then

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
so we've got this wall like back then

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.820 
so we've got this wall like back then
we're<00:01:12.540> going<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.689> make<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.869> new<00:01:13.049> texture<00:01:13.439> go

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
we're going to make a new texture go

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.280 
we're going to make a new texture go
file<00:01:14.159> new<00:01:14.549> material<00:01:15.740> double<00:01:16.740> click<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:16.979> it

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
file new material double click on it

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.530 
file new material double click on it
undercut<00:01:19.290> click<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.220> these<00:01:20.310> dots<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.330> load<00:01:21.509> a

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
undercut click on these dots to load a

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.070 
undercut click on these dots to load a
texture<00:01:21.960> then<00:01:22.830> find<00:01:23.490> yourself<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:24.030> picture<00:01:24.930> of

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
texture then find yourself a picture of

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.080 
texture then find yourself a picture of
bricks<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:27.799> then<00:01:28.799> what<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.250> do<00:01:29.400> drag<00:01:30.060> and

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
bricks and then what we can do drag and

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.620 
bricks and then what we can do drag and
drop<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.540> onto<00:01:30.869> our<00:01:31.350> square<00:01:33.110> on<00:01:34.110> tile<00:01:34.439> cube

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
drop this onto our square on tile cube

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.530 
drop this onto our square on tile cube
go<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.689> object<00:01:36.960> mode<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.770> there<00:01:38.729> we<00:01:38.880> go<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.390> as

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
go to object mode and there we go and as

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.330 
go to object mode and there we go and as
you<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:39.840> see<00:01:40.079> I've<00:01:40.350> got<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.100> same<00:01:41.310> problem

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340

you can see I've got the same problem
that<00:01:42.030> does<00:01:42.240> not<00:01:42.270> look<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> brick<00:01:43.170> wall<00:01:43.200> to

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
that does not look like a brick wall to

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.319 
that does not look like a brick wall to
me<00:01:44.509> so<00:01:45.509> what<00:01:45.899> can<00:01:46.140> we<00:01:46.350> do<00:01:46.500> about<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.920> one<00:01:47.329> what

it to a face in face mode you can apply

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.780 
it to a face in face mode you can apply
single<00:02:03.600> materials<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.290> faces<00:02:04.799> I'm<00:02:05.549> going<00:02:05.729> to

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
single materials to faces I'm going to

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.119 
single materials to faces I'm going to
grab<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.149> object<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:07.439> we're<00:02:07.619> going<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.920> say

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
got something that then what cubic means

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.850 
got something that then what cubic means
is<00:02:17.520> that<00:02:17.580> it's<00:02:18.030> gonna<00:02:18.240> just<00:02:19.140> applied<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.500> each

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
is that it's gonna just applied to each

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.930 
is that it's gonna just applied to each
face<00:02:20.630> it's<00:02:21.630> not<00:02:21.780> going<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.140> wrap<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.590> round

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
face it's not going to wrap it round

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.370 
face it's not going to wrap it round
because<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.420> can<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:24.990> can<00:02:25.110> see<00:02:25.350> the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
because you can you can see the

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.000 
because you can you can see the
difference<00:02:25.860> if<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.340> go<00:02:26.700> back<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:26.880> UVW<00:02:27.750> mapping

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
difference if I go back to UVW mapping

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.470 
difference if I go back to UVW mapping
that<00:02:29.010> it's<00:02:29.280> blurring<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.060> edges<00:02:30.450> totally<00:02:31.230> and

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
that it's blurring the edges totally and

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.170 
that it's blurring the edges totally and
cubic<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:34.230> way<00:02:34.380> forward<00:02:34.740> now<00:02:35.430> as<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:36.060> can

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
cubic is the way forward now as you can

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.020 
cubic is the way forward now as you can
see<00:02:36.240> you've<00:02:36.600> got<00:02:36.630> these<00:02:36.900> like<00:02:37.200> M<00:02:37.790> double<00:02:38.790> lines

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
see you've got these like M double lines

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.730 
see you've got these like M double lines
no<00:02:39.300> that's<00:02:39.480> because<00:02:39.780> it's<00:02:39.959> not<00:02:40.140> going<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.410> tie

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
no that's because it's not going to tie

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.030 
no that's because it's not going to tie
all<00:02:41.040> very<00:02:41.310> well<00:02:42.080> you<00:02:43.080> can<00:02:43.260> fix<00:02:43.740> that<00:02:43.830> in

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
all very well you can fix that in

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.000 
all very well you can fix that in
Photoshop<00:02:44.280> or<00:02:44.989> whatever<00:02:45.989> whatever<00:02:46.410> image

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
Photoshop or whatever whatever image

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.530 
Photoshop or whatever whatever image
editing<00:02:47.400> program<00:02:47.820> you<00:02:47.910> have<00:02:48.120> I'm<00:02:48.270> not<00:02:48.390> going

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
editing program you have I'm not going

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.760 
editing program you have I'm not going
to<00:02:48.600> go<00:02:48.720> into<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:49.050> because<00:02:49.230> that's<00:02:49.500> not<00:02:49.560> the

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
to go into that because that's not the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.740 
to go into that because that's not the
point<00:02:49.950> of<00:02:50.070> this<00:02:50.220> thing<00:02:51.209> okay

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
point of this thing okay

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.150 
point of this thing okay
so<00:02:52.050> it's<00:02:52.200> looking<00:02:52.470> pretty<00:02:52.680> good<00:02:52.800> like<00:02:53.130> that

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
so it's looking pretty good like that

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.880 
so it's looking pretty good like that
but<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:54.209> change<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.840> even<00:02:54.989> more<00:02:55.350> what<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.709> can

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
but to change it even more what you can

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.430 
but to change it even more what you can
do<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.220> you've<00:02:56.940> got<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.060> length<00:02:57.450> x<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:57.989> a<00:02:58.140> length

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
do is you've got a length x and a length

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.690 
do is you've got a length x and a length
Y<00:02:58.770> so<00:02:59.610> you<00:02:59.670> can<00:02:59.820> squash<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.360> in<00:03:00.510> like<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.350> and

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
Y so you can squash it in like that and

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.090 
Y so you can squash it in like that and
then<00:03:02.700> squash<00:03:03.209> it<00:03:03.390> in<00:03:03.540> like<00:03:04.320> that<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.650> then<00:03:04.950> it

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
then squash it in like that and then it

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.920 
then squash it in like that and then it
looks<00:03:05.280> like<00:03:05.400> it's<00:03:05.640> neat<00:03:05.880> big<00:03:06.300> a<00:03:06.330> brick<00:03:06.690> wall

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
looks like it's neat big a brick wall

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.160 
looks like it's neat big a brick wall
now<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.620> know<00:03:07.860> you<00:03:08.010> were<00:03:08.280> using<00:03:08.459> Mayer<00:03:08.820> but<00:03:09.180> as<00:03:09.420> I

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
now I know you were using Mayer but as I

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.720 
now I know you were using Mayer but as I
don't<00:03:10.230> have<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.709> I<00:03:10.770> don't<00:03:10.980> know<00:03:11.130> I'm<00:03:11.489> not<00:03:11.670> very

box load the texture just choose the

box load the texture just choose the
same<00:03:25.049> texture<00:03:25.500> it<00:03:25.590> works<00:03:25.830> better<00:03:26.070> if<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:26.400> have

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
same texture it works better if you have

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.530 
same texture it works better if you have
a<00:03:26.549> black<00:03:26.850> and<00:03:27.060> white<00:03:27.209> version<00:03:29.269> they<00:03:30.269> won't

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
a black and white version they won't

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.610 
a black and white version they won't
make<00:03:30.660> too<00:03:30.810> much<00:03:30.930> difference<00:03:30.989> I'm<00:03:31.440> going<00:03:31.560> to

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
make too much difference I'm going to

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.340 
make too much difference I'm going to
increase<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.190> strength<00:03:32.489> and<00:03:33.060> then<00:03:33.720> add<00:03:34.290> a

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
increase the strength and then add a

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.130 
increase the strength and then add a
light<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:35.519> this<00:03:36.420> is<00:03:36.600> going<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.840> start

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
light and this is going to start

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:47.720 
light and this is going to start
behaving<00:03:37.320> how<00:03:38.070> bricks<00:03:38.580> behave<00:03:46.370> because<00:03:47.370> the

behaving how bricks behave because the
