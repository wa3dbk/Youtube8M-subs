00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:24.120
 what's up he said he can not find my plane and now 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.050
 I see why 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.720
 you know what could help you that then the 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.680
 cleaning and order 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.290
 Jehovah has everything in place and thinks 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.930
 on the planets they are always 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.480
 moving but jehovah keeps them in their 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.930
 orbits and that's why they never collide 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.989
 and look at the people even though outside 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.940
 we are different inside is everything in 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:56.739
 its place the heart the lungs 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.340
 imagine if the eyes were below 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.340
 of the feet 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.560
 Jehovah even keeps the 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.860
 animals 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:11.770
 look at the little fish are cleaning the 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.770
 hippopotamus and the bird is helping 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:20.310
 I wish the animals will help me and 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.380
 me too but that's why jehovah gave us 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.350
 the hands to help us 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.100
 if you keep your things jehovah will get 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:34.439
 very happy and who knows maybe when 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.439
 you finish you find your plane 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.920
 do not 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.310
