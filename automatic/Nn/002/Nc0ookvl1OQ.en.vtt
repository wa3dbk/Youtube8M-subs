to zombies whatsoever but let's go ahead

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
and speak about what we think could be

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.649 
and speak about what we think could be
in<00:00:54.809> extinction<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.159> course<00:00:56.369> it's<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:57.000> co-op

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
in extinction so of course it's a co-op

00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:59.840 
in extinction so of course it's a co-op
survival<00:00:57.899> mode<00:00:58.440> similar<00:00:58.860> to<00:00:59.010> zombies<00:00:59.460> but<00:00:59.699> of

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
survival mode similar to zombies but of

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.770 
survival mode similar to zombies but of
course<00:01:00.059> it's<00:01:00.210> not<00:01:00.360> just<00:01:00.570> your<00:01:00.659> typical

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
course it's not just your typical

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.229 
course it's not just your typical
survival<00:01:01.619> mode<00:01:01.860> where<00:01:02.489> it's<00:01:02.640> just<00:01:02.699> waves<00:01:03.030> and

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
survival mode where it's just waves and

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.119 
survival mode where it's just waves and
waves<00:01:03.360> of<00:01:03.570> enemies<00:01:03.960> coming<00:01:04.170> after<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.679> by<00:01:05.069> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
waves of enemies coming after you by the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.800 
waves of enemies coming after you by the
looks<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.460> things<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.850> looks<00:01:06.149> like<00:01:06.330> its<00:01:06.539> waves

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
looks of things it looks like its waves

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.960 
looks of things it looks like its waves
and<00:01:07.080> waves<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.470> aliens<00:01:07.950> coming<00:01:08.159> after<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.700> but

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
and waves of aliens coming after you but

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.550 
and waves of aliens coming after you but
judging<00:01:09.479> by<00:01:09.509> the<00:01:09.690> achievements<00:01:10.200> we've<00:01:10.350> got

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
judging by the achievements we've got

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.919 
judging by the achievements we've got
fixed<00:01:10.979> objectives<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.880> do<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.390> I'm<00:01:12.630> not<00:01:12.780> sure

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:12.929 
fixed objectives to do and I'm not sure

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:14.450 
fixed objectives to do and I'm not sure
if<00:01:13.050> this<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.319> going<00:01:13.440> to<00:01:13.500> happen<00:01:13.679> so<00:01:14.039> every<00:01:14.429> time

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
if this is going to happen so every time

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.279 
if this is going to happen so every time
you<00:01:14.700> play<00:01:15.119> extinction<00:01:15.929> you're<00:01:16.020> going<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.200> be

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
you play extinction you're going to be

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:18.499 
you play extinction you're going to be
doing<00:01:16.440> the<00:01:16.649> exact<00:01:17.009> same<00:01:17.039> objectives<00:01:17.850> every

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
doing the exact same objectives every

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.029 
doing the exact same objectives every
single<00:01:18.840> time<00:01:19.080> if<00:01:19.289> that<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.679> the<00:01:19.800> case<00:01:19.830> then

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
single time if that is the case then

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:21.380 
single time if that is the case then
that<00:01:20.340> would<00:01:20.490> make<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.940> little<00:01:21.149> bit

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
that would make it a little bit

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.510 
that would make it a little bit
repetitive<00:01:21.690> but<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.619> would<00:01:22.740> still<00:01:22.890> be<00:01:23.039> awesome

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
repetitive but it would still be awesome

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.609 
repetitive but it would still be awesome
nonetheless<00:01:23.750> now<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.869> course<00:01:25.020> similar<00:01:25.440> to

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
nonetheless now of course similar to

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.800 
nonetheless now of course similar to
zombies<00:01:26.039> we<00:01:26.280> got<00:01:26.460> new<00:01:26.670> maps<00:01:26.909> with<00:01:27.090> dlc<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.659> I'm

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
zombies we got new maps with dlc and I'm

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.210 
zombies we got new maps with dlc and I'm
hoping<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.319> will<00:01:28.409> be<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.649> same<00:01:28.799> case<00:01:29.039> of

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
hoping that will be the same case of

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.190 
hoping that will be the same case of
extinction<00:01:29.789> as<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.000> will<00:01:30.149> keep<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.450> fresh

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
extinction as that will keep it fresh

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.020 
extinction as that will keep it fresh
and<00:01:31.440> exciting<00:01:31.709> now<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.399> don't<00:01:32.520> know<00:01:32.729> if<00:01:32.759> we're

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
and exciting now I don't know if we're

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.330 
and exciting now I don't know if we're
just<00:01:33.179> gonna<00:01:33.360> be<00:01:33.479> getting<00:01:33.840> one<00:01:34.500> map<00:01:34.830> with<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
different maps to play extinction on but

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.990

besides<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.500> still<00:01:40.890> sounds<00:01:41.219> really<00:01:41.520> fun<00:01:41.759> and

the same thing by having a video on

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.160

Facebook and Twitter pages and I'm

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:09.440 
Facebook and Twitter pages and I'm
feeling<00:02:08.880> that<00:02:09.000> they're<00:02:09.149> going<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.329> do

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
feeling that they're going to do

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.789 
feeling that they're going to do
something<00:02:09.810> similar<00:02:10.170> again<00:02:10.470> with<00:02:10.679> the

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
something similar again with the

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.190 
something similar again with the
extinction<00:02:11.280> seeing<00:02:11.519> as<00:02:11.670> this<00:02:11.820> is<00:02:11.880> a<00:02:12.150> very<00:02:12.840> very

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
extinction seeing as this is a very very

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.160 
extinction seeing as this is a very very
height<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.980> very<00:02:14.340> exciting<00:02:15.060> mode<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.660> think

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
height and very exciting mode I think

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.229 
height and very exciting mode I think
that<00:02:16.320> they'll<00:02:16.500> do<00:02:16.769> a<00:02:17.100> trailer<00:02:17.730> I'm<00:02:18.030> hoping

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
that they'll do a trailer I'm hoping

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.550 
that they'll do a trailer I'm hoping
that<00:02:18.480> they<00:02:18.660> have<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.870> trailer<00:02:19.230> for<00:02:19.440> this

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
that they have a trailer for this

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.110 
that they have a trailer for this
because<00:02:19.890> they<00:02:19.980> can't<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.400> leave<00:02:20.579> it<00:02:20.760> at<00:02:21.060> a

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
because they can't just leave it at a

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.880 
because they can't just leave it at a
teaser<00:02:21.510> they<00:02:21.780> have<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.109> do<00:02:22.230> something<00:02:22.500> else<00:02:22.680> to

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
teaser they have to do something else to

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.949 
teaser they have to do something else to
follow<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.250> up<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:23.760> if<00:02:23.910> there<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.299> a<00:02:24.450> trailer<00:02:24.780> of

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
follow it up so if there is a trailer of

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.050 
follow it up so if there is a trailer of
any<00:02:25.140> sorts<00:02:25.500> or<00:02:25.620> any<00:02:25.769> other<00:02:26.010> updates<00:02:26.280> on<00:02:26.700> this
