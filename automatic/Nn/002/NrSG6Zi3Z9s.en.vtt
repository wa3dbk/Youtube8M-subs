00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
let's go beats by dre it's got a webcam

00:03:51.569 --> 00:04:00.180 
let's go beats by dre it's got a webcam
obviously<00:03:52.569> that<00:03:56.310> there<00:03:57.310> we<00:03:57.400> go<00:03:58.560> I<00:03:59.560> don't<00:04:00.129> think

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
obviously that there we go I don't think

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.500 
obviously that there we go I don't think
it's<00:04:00.400> going<00:04:00.489> to<00:04:00.549> be<00:04:00.639> that<00:04:00.760> bad<00:04:00.970> it's<00:04:01.599> got<00:04:01.750> the
