00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
and I recently posted picture of the new

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.970 
and I recently posted picture of the new
whey<00:00:18.300> protein<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:18.869> I'm<00:00:18.990> taking<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.529> it

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
whey protein that I'm taking and it

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.439 
whey protein that I'm taking and it
seemed<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.369> spark<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.760> little<00:00:20.939> bit<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.119> interest

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
seemed to spark a little bit of interest

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.330 
seemed to spark a little bit of interest
this<00:00:22.380> seems<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.769> be<00:00:22.800> new<00:00:23.010> on<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.220> market

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
this seems to be new on the market

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.800 
this seems to be new on the market
doesn't<00:00:23.730> seem<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.029> be<00:00:24.150> carried<00:00:24.449> everywhere

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
doesn't seem to be carried everywhere

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.019 
doesn't seem to be carried everywhere
yet<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.230> think<00:00:25.320> they're<00:00:25.650> from<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.250> wholesale

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
yet I think they're from a wholesale

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.750 
yet I think they're from a wholesale
store<00:00:27.500> you<00:00:28.500> probably<00:00:28.890> familiar<00:00:29.310> with<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.609> name

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
store you probably familiar with a name

store you probably familiar with a name
Costco<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.390> very<00:00:30.599> similar<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.260> Sam's<00:00:31.529> Club<00:00:31.800> and

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
Costco is very similar to Sam's Club and

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.310 
Costco is very similar to Sam's Club and
essentially<00:00:33.210> what<00:00:33.390> we're<00:00:33.840> looking<00:00:34.050> at<00:00:34.140> here

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
essentially what we're looking at here

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.700 
essentially what we're looking at here
today<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.579> whey<00:00:36.180> protein<00:00:36.719> isolate<00:00:37.290> made

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
today is is a whey protein isolate made

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.319 
today is is a whey protein isolate made
by<00:00:37.890> optimal<00:00:38.250> nutrition<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:38.910> within<00:00:39.120> their

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
by optimal nutrition it's within their

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.750 
by optimal nutrition it's within their
performance<00:00:39.960> series<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.710> at<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.430> moment

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
performance series and at this moment

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.060 
performance series and at this moment
from<00:00:42.180> what<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.450> can<00:00:42.570> tell<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:43.440> only<00:00:43.649> seems<00:00:43.950> that

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
from what I can tell it only seems that

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.889 
from what I can tell it only seems that
there<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.550> vanilla<00:00:44.969> flavor<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:45.690> if<00:00:45.780> you're

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
there is a vanilla flavor so if you're

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.350 
there is a vanilla flavor so if you're
not<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.020> fan<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.500> alone<00:00:46.649> vanilla<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.360> don't

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
not a fan of it alone vanilla I don't

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.630 
not a fan of it alone vanilla I don't
know<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.539> tell<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.809> fully<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:50.100> pure

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
know to tell you fully this is a pure

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.549 
know to tell you fully this is a pure
ice<00:00:50.850> list<00:00:51.210> it's<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.420> hundred<00:00:51.719> percent<00:00:51.809> isolate

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
ice list it's a hundred percent isolate

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.670 
ice list it's a hundred percent isolate
the<00:00:53.070> actual<00:00:53.930> ingredient<00:00:54.930> profile<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.649> is

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the actual ingredient profile this is

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.950 
the actual ingredient profile this is
whey<00:00:56.430> protein<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.030> then<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.480> goes<00:00:57.629> into

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
whey protein and then it just goes into

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.660 
whey protein and then it just goes into
the<00:00:58.079> actual<00:00:58.230> flavoring<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.129> coloring<00:00:59.550> and

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
the actual flavoring and coloring and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.609 
the actual flavoring and coloring and
all<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.940> good<00:01:00.120> stuff<00:01:00.440> this<00:01:01.440> as<00:01:01.879> far<00:01:02.879> as

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
all that good stuff this as far as

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.050 
all that good stuff this as far as
protein<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.739> probably<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> highest<00:01:05.339> quality

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
protein is probably the highest quality

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.140 
protein is probably the highest quality
you<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.420> get<00:01:06.770> usually<00:01:07.770> for<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> 5<00:01:08.400> pound<00:01:08.729> bucket

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
you can get usually for a 5 pound bucket

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.899 
you can get usually for a 5 pound bucket
of<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:10.500> gold<00:01:10.740> standard<00:01:11.280> whey<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.580> were

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
of the gold standard whey you were

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.030 
of the gold standard whey you were
looking<00:01:12.270> at<00:01:12.390> about<00:01:12.600> 45<00:01:13.320> bucks<00:01:13.530> depending<00:01:13.979> on

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
looking at about 45 bucks depending on

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.800 
looking at about 45 bucks depending on
where<00:01:14.189> you're<00:01:14.310> shopping<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:15.210> guy<00:01:15.450> comes

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
where you're shopping this guy comes

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.230 
where you're shopping this guy comes
only<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.350> four<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.890> half<00:01:17.130> pound<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.909> this

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
only in a four and a half pound and this

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.109 
only in a four and a half pound and this
retails<00:01:18.900> about<00:01:19.110> $52<00:01:19.920> give<00:01:20.220> or<00:01:20.340> take<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:21.030> you

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
retails about $52 give or take so you

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.149 
retails about $52 give or take so you
are<00:01:21.240> paying<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.630> higher<00:01:21.840> price<00:01:22.200> point<00:01:22.229> for<00:01:22.860> pure

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
are paying a higher price point for pure

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.359 
are paying a higher price point for pure
isolate<00:01:23.640> protein<00:01:23.930> with<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.080> being<00:01:25.259> said<00:01:25.380> I

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
isolate protein with that being said I

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.340 
isolate protein with that being said I
think<00:01:26.549> optimal<00:01:27.330> nutrition<00:01:27.420> has<00:01:28.020> their

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
think optimal nutrition has their

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.249 
think optimal nutrition has their
vanilla<00:01:28.860> flavor<00:01:29.220> down<00:01:29.610> pat<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.240> mean<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.720> can

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
vanilla flavor down pat I mean it I can

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.170 
vanilla flavor down pat I mean it I can
take<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> difference<00:01:31.860> between<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.729> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
take the difference between this and the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.910 
take the difference between this and the
gold<00:01:33.390> standard<00:01:33.869> whey<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.680> most<00:01:34.799> part

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
gold standard whey so for the most part

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.770 
gold standard whey so for the most part
if<00:01:35.159> you've<00:01:35.310> had<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.700> vanilla<00:01:36.060> gold<00:01:36.270> standard

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
if you've had the vanilla gold standard

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.200 
if you've had the vanilla gold standard
pretty<00:01:37.500> much<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.950> taste<00:01:38.159> as<00:01:38.310> far<00:01:38.790> as<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> mix

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
pretty much the taste as far as a mix

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.620 
pretty much the taste as far as a mix
ability<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.380> mix<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.710> quite<00:01:41.009> well<00:01:41.280> no<00:01:41.820> no<00:01:42.150> big

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
ability and mix is quite well no no big

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.010 
ability and mix is quite well no no big
difference<00:01:43.110> compared<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.979> original

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020

you're<00:03:01.000> also<00:03:01.120> looking<00:03:01.359> at<00:03:01.569> 3<00:03:01.840> grams<00:03:02.019> of<00:03:02.200> carbs

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
you're also looking at 3 grams of carbs

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
but you know most do anyways but I think

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.909 
but you know most do anyways but I think
about<00:03:09.760> it's<00:03:09.969> a<00:03:10.000> solid<00:03:10.359> protein<00:03:11.139> the<00:03:11.319> biggest

about it's a solid protein the biggest
factor<00:03:12.340> for<00:03:12.579> most<00:03:12.700> people<00:03:13.150> is<00:03:13.239> going<00:03:13.359> to<00:03:13.450> be

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.599

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:35.229 
muscle mass so it really all comes down

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:36.990
