-<00:02:24.940> attack<00:02:25.239> a<00:02:25.269> lot<00:02:25.450> so<00:02:25.660> my<00:02:25.780> amoeba<00:02:26.019> would<00:02:26.230> just

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
- attack a lot so my amoeba would just

tried I usually don't use my shield very
much<00:02:30.040> but<00:02:30.220> my<00:02:30.250> amiibo<00:02:30.640> used<00:02:30.849> it<00:02:30.970> all<00:02:31.120> the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
much but my amiibo used it all the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.390 
much but my amiibo used it all the
freaking<00:02:31.780> time<00:02:31.810> he<00:02:32.620> even<00:02:32.860> figured<00:02:33.099> out<00:02:33.190> how<00:02:33.370> I

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400

that<00:03:03.130> it<00:03:03.220> thinks<00:03:03.430> are<00:03:03.489> beneficiary<00:03:04.180> in<00:03:04.390> battle

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
that it thinks are beneficiary in battle

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.270 
that it thinks are beneficiary in battle
in<00:03:04.870> other<00:03:05.260> words<00:03:05.500> if<00:03:05.739> it<00:03:05.829> doesn't<00:03:06.099> think<00:03:06.190> it

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
in other words if it doesn't think it

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.039 
in other words if it doesn't think it
will<00:03:06.340> help<00:03:06.489> it<00:03:06.670> win<00:03:06.849> the<00:03:07.269> amiibo<00:03:07.599> probably

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
will help it win the amiibo probably

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.630 
will help it win the amiibo probably
won't<00:03:08.260> retain<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.680> trade<00:03:08.920> it's<00:03:09.310> kind<00:03:09.489> of<00:03:09.549> a

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
won't retain the trade it's kind of a

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.949 
won't retain the trade it's kind of a
bummer<00:03:09.790> if<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:10.030> wanted<00:03:10.360> one<00:03:10.510> that<00:03:10.630> just<00:03:10.780> acts

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
bummer if you wanted one that just acts

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.780 
bummer if you wanted one that just acts
like<00:03:11.049> a<00:03:11.200> dumb<00:03:11.380> jerk<00:03:11.620> but<00:03:12.010> luckily<00:03:12.250> you<00:03:12.670> can

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
like a dumb jerk but luckily you can

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.069 
like a dumb jerk but luckily you can
make<00:03:13.000> him<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.239> jerk<00:03:13.420> by<00:03:13.540> just<00:03:13.750> making<00:03:13.989> him

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
make him a jerk by just making him

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.350 
make him a jerk by just making him
insanely<00:03:14.470> good<00:03:14.709> so<00:03:15.069> that's<00:03:15.730> something<00:03:16.090> I

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
insanely good so that's something I

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.900 
insanely good so that's something I
guess<00:03:16.569> now<00:03:17.440> I'll<00:03:17.829> admit<00:03:18.100> after<00:03:18.459> I<00:03:18.639> trained

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
guess now I'll admit after I trained

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.430 
guess now I'll admit after I trained
this<00:03:19.000> first<00:03:19.239> amiibo<00:03:19.600> I<00:03:19.810> almost<00:03:19.959> gave<00:03:20.230> up<00:03:20.260> on

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
this first amiibo I almost gave up on

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.020 
this first amiibo I almost gave up on
the<00:03:20.530> toys<00:03:20.739> entirely<00:03:21.100> after<00:03:21.730> my<00:03:21.850> failed

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
the toys entirely after my failed

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.460 
the toys entirely after my failed
attempts<00:03:22.389> of<00:03:22.480> making<00:03:22.720> an<00:03:22.810> amiibo<00:03:23.109> really

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
attempts of making an amiibo really

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.410 
attempts of making an amiibo really
weird<00:03:24.069> I<00:03:24.400> thought<00:03:24.760> they'd<00:03:24.910> all<00:03:25.000> just<00:03:25.209> end<00:03:25.359> up

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
weird I thought they'd all just end up

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.090 
weird I thought they'd all just end up
playing<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.810> same<00:03:26.019> so<00:03:26.470> in<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:26.620> fit<00:03:26.799> of<00:03:26.829> anger

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
playing the same so in a fit of anger

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.559 
playing the same so in a fit of anger
I'm<00:03:27.370> going<00:03:27.579> to<00:03:27.670> get<00:03:27.790> as<00:03:27.880> many<00:03:27.970> coins<00:03:28.359> and

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
I'm going to get as many coins and

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.059 
I'm going to get as many coins and
trophies<00:03:28.750> out<00:03:28.989> of<00:03:29.079> this<00:03:29.170> thing<00:03:29.319> as<00:03:29.440> possible<00:03:29.650> I

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
trophies out of this thing as possible I

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.220 
trophies out of this thing as possible I
decided<00:03:30.579> to<00:03:30.700> train<00:03:30.910> one<00:03:31.090> against<00:03:31.540> nothing<00:03:31.959> but

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
decided to train one against nothing but

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.440 
decided to train one against nothing but
CPUs<00:03:32.739> at<00:03:33.040> first<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.670> level<00:03:33.910> 9s<00:03:34.090> were<00:03:34.180> wrecking

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
CPUs at first the level 9s were wrecking

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.809 
CPUs at first the level 9s were wrecking
him<00:03:34.600> of<00:03:34.750> course<00:03:34.989> but<00:03:35.260> once<00:03:35.709> again<00:03:35.829> by<00:03:36.220> level<00:03:36.489> 50

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
him of course but once again by level 50

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.210 
him of course but once again by level 50
it<00:03:37.030> was<00:03:37.359> always<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:37.959> victor<00:03:38.260> after<00:03:38.889> that<00:03:39.040> I

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
it was always the victor after that I

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.099 
it was always the victor after that I
tried<00:03:39.459> a<00:03:39.639> player<00:03:39.880> smash<00:03:40.150> with<00:03:40.329> it<00:03:40.450> once<00:03:40.840> again

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
tried a player smash with it once again

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.080 
tried a player smash with it once again
won<00:03:41.440> a<00:03:41.470> twenty<00:03:41.829> five<00:03:41.980> stock<00:03:42.250> match<00:03:42.459> by<00:03:42.639> huge

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
won a twenty five stock match by huge

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.940 
won a twenty five stock match by huge
amount<00:03:43.329> of<00:03:43.389> lives<00:03:43.630> but<00:03:44.200> then<00:03:44.350> for<00:03:44.530> a<00:03:44.560> final

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
amount of lives but then for a final

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.770 
amount of lives but then for a final
test<00:03:45.130> I<00:03:45.340> put<00:03:45.609> it<00:03:45.700> in<00:03:45.819> a<00:03:45.910> one<00:03:46.150> beat<00:03:46.359> three<00:03:46.600> match

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
test I put it in a one beat three match

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.440 
test I put it in a one beat three match
with<00:03:46.989> team<00:03:47.230> damage<00:03:47.590> on<00:03:47.799> and<00:03:48.100> the<00:03:48.880> amiibo<00:03:49.209> lost

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
with team damage on and the amiibo lost

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.240 
with team damage on and the amiibo lost
I<00:03:49.780> tried<00:03:50.049> like<00:03:50.380> 10<00:03:50.590> times<00:03:50.769> to<00:03:50.950> see<00:03:51.069> if<00:03:51.160> it

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
I tried like 10 times to see if it

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.949 
I tried like 10 times to see if it
learning<00:03:51.489> new<00:03:51.579> things<00:03:51.609> but<00:03:52.030> it<00:03:52.450> would<00:03:52.600> almost

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
learning new things but it would almost

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.599 
learning new things but it would almost
always<00:03:53.200> lose<00:03:53.530> it<00:03:53.709> the<00:03:53.799> same<00:03:53.980> amount<00:03:54.250> of<00:03:54.310> chaos

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
always lose it the same amount of chaos

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.430 
always lose it the same amount of chaos
so<00:03:55.239> it<00:03:55.359> seems<00:03:55.540> that<00:03:55.630> in<00:03:55.810> this<00:03:55.930> kind<00:03:56.200> of<00:03:56.260> battle

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
so it seems that in this kind of battle

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.860 
so it seems that in this kind of battle
the<00:03:56.889> amiibo<00:03:57.280> reached<00:03:57.609> its<00:03:57.849> limit<00:03:58.150> but<00:03:58.690> then<00:03:58.810> I

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
the amiibo reached its limit but then I

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.210 
the amiibo reached its limit but then I
put<00:03:59.019> items<00:03:59.319> on<00:03:59.380> high<00:03:59.590> and<00:03:59.739> chose<00:03:59.889> the<00:04:00.040> gamer

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
put items on high and chose the gamer

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.259 
put items on high and chose the gamer
stage<00:04:00.489> to<00:04:00.579> see<00:04:00.700> if<00:04:00.790> that<00:04:00.910> make<00:04:01.030> a<00:04:01.060> difference

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
stage to see if that make a difference

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.990 
stage to see if that make a difference
and<00:04:01.690> he<00:04:02.380> won<00:04:02.590> so<00:04:03.250> I<00:04:03.280> guess<00:04:03.519> it<00:04:03.639> really<00:04:03.670> just

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
and he won so I guess it really just

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.509 
and he won so I guess it really just
depends<00:04:04.329> on<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:04.630> situation<00:04:05.010> anyway<00:04:06.010> after

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
depends on the situation anyway after

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.520 
depends on the situation anyway after
about<00:04:06.549> a<00:04:06.730> day<00:04:06.940> of<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.150> CPU<00:04:07.569> fighting<00:04:08.079> I<00:04:08.109> tried

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
about a day of the CPU fighting I tried

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.740 
about a day of the CPU fighting I tried
fighting<00:04:08.859> it<00:04:08.980> and<00:04:09.130> unfortunately<00:04:10.030> I<00:04:10.299> lost<00:04:10.599> by

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
fighting it and unfortunately I lost by

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.330 
fighting it and unfortunately I lost by
about<00:04:10.959> the<00:04:11.139> same<00:04:11.169> amount<00:04:11.380> of<00:04:11.709> lives<00:04:11.950> which

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
about the same amount of lives which

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.009 
about the same amount of lives which
didn't<00:04:12.609> really<00:04:12.849> sell<00:04:13.030> me<00:04:13.120> that<00:04:13.269> CPU<00:04:13.569> training

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
didn't really sell me that CPU training

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.210 
didn't really sell me that CPU training
makes<00:04:14.169> more<00:04:14.349> of<00:04:14.410> a<00:04:14.530> difference<00:04:14.560> in<00:04:14.919> normal

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
makes more of a difference in normal

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.400 
makes more of a difference in normal
training<00:04:15.579> however<00:04:15.970> for<00:04:16.510> one<00:04:16.750> more<00:04:16.989> test

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
training however for one more test

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.229 
training however for one more test
I<00:04:17.440> pitted<00:04:17.859> the<00:04:17.950> Pikachu<00:04:18.340> I<00:04:18.370> trained<00:04:18.789> and<00:04:19.030> the

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
I pitted the Pikachu I trained and the

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.599 
I pitted the Pikachu I trained and the
one<00:04:19.389> train<00:04:19.630> by<00:04:19.780> CPUs<00:04:20.260> in<00:04:20.410> a<00:04:20.560> 25<00:04:21.039> stock<00:04:21.340> match

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
one train by CPUs in a 25 stock match

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.089 
one train by CPUs in a 25 stock match
and<00:04:21.880> Pikachu<00:04:22.479> destroyed<00:04:23.169> so<00:04:23.740> long<00:04:23.919> story

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
and Pikachu destroyed so long story

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:25.800 
and Pikachu destroyed so long story
short<00:04:24.250> it<00:04:24.580> seems<00:04:24.789> it<00:04:24.909> amiibo<00:04:25.210> only<00:04:25.510> reach<00:04:25.659> her

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810

how<00:04:42.340> to<00:04:42.370> beat<00:04:42.670> you<00:04:42.880> but<00:04:43.300> when<00:04:43.420> you<00:04:43.510> team<00:04:43.720> up

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
how to beat you but when you team up

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.630 
how to beat you but when you team up
with<00:04:43.960> an<00:04:44.200> amiibo<00:04:44.560> they<00:04:44.890> learn<00:04:45.070> how<00:04:45.280> to<00:04:45.310> play

with an amiibo they learn how to play

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.300 
with an amiibo they learn how to play
just<00:04:46.000> like<00:04:46.300> you<00:04:46.540> well<00:04:47.290> most<00:04:47.890> of<00:04:48.010> the<00:04:48.130> time

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310

eventually<00:04:49.000> peach<00:04:49.360> was<00:04:49.510> getting<00:04:49.720> way<00:04:49.870> more

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
eventually peach was getting way more

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.450 
eventually peach was getting way more
chaos<00:04:50.410> than<00:04:50.560> me<00:04:50.650> and<00:04:50.800> essentially<00:04:51.100> became<00:04:51.400> a

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
chaos than me and essentially became a

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.190 
chaos than me and essentially became a
better<00:04:51.700> smash<00:04:52.090> version<00:04:52.450> to<00:04:52.510> me<00:04:52.630> and<00:04:52.870> it<00:04:53.110> was

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
better smash version to me and it was

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.080 
better smash version to me and it was
super<00:04:53.380> cool<00:04:53.710> to<00:04:53.830> see<00:04:53.950> a<00:04:53.980> toy<00:04:54.340> emulate<00:04:54.970> my

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
super cool to see a toy emulate my

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.940 
super cool to see a toy emulate my
fighting<00:04:55.480> style<00:04:55.690> after<00:04:56.020> this<00:04:56.530> I<00:04:56.740> tried

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
fighting style after this I tried

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.620 
fighting style after this I tried
fighting<00:04:57.190> her<00:04:57.430> and<00:04:57.610> go<00:04:57.790> figure<00:04:58.030> I<00:04:58.300> lost<00:04:58.510> by

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
fighting her and go figure I lost by

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.840 
fighting her and go figure I lost by
about<00:04:58.840> the<00:04:59.020> same<00:04:59.050> amount<00:04:59.230> of<00:04:59.590> stock<00:04:59.800> again<00:05:00.340> but

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
about the same amount of stock again but

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.070 
about the same amount of stock again but
what<00:05:00.970> intrigued<00:05:01.300> me<00:05:01.330> was<00:05:01.450> that<00:05:01.690> when<00:05:01.840> I<00:05:01.870> had

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
what intrigued me was that when I had

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.200 
what intrigued me was that when I had
peach<00:05:02.320> bite<00:05:02.530> my<00:05:02.650> sparring<00:05:02.950> amiibo<00:05:03.370> Pikachu

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
peach bite my sparring amiibo Pikachu

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.630 
peach bite my sparring amiibo Pikachu
they<00:05:04.600> were<00:05:04.660> about<00:05:05.020> evenly<00:05:05.410> matched<00:05:05.680> so<00:05:06.400> from

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
they were about evenly matched so from

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.100 
they were about evenly matched so from
what<00:05:06.760> I<00:05:06.790> saw<00:05:07.030> they<00:05:07.360> both<00:05:07.510> had<00:05:07.690> very<00:05:07.720> different

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
what I saw they both had very different

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.170 
what I saw they both had very different
play<00:05:08.380> styles<00:05:08.770> but<00:05:08.980> seem<00:05:09.190> to<00:05:09.340> be<00:05:09.430> on<00:05:09.610> almost<00:05:10.000> the

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
play styles but seem to be on almost the

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.940 
play styles but seem to be on almost the
exact<00:05:10.540> same<00:05:10.570> level<00:05:11.050> of<00:05:11.140> skill<00:05:11.380> it's<00:05:11.830> not

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
exact same level of skill it's not

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.500 
exact same level of skill it's not
really<00:05:12.130> conclusive<00:05:12.310> evidence<00:05:12.700> or<00:05:13.120> anything

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
really conclusive evidence or anything

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.670 
really conclusive evidence or anything
but<00:05:13.720> at<00:05:13.840> least<00:05:13.990> that's<00:05:14.230> what<00:05:14.350> it<00:05:14.440> looked<00:05:14.590> like

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
but at least that's what it looked like

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.159 
but at least that's what it looked like
to<00:05:14.890> me<00:05:14.919> which<00:05:15.669> brings<00:05:15.940> me<00:05:16.120> to<00:05:16.300> my<00:05:16.419> last<00:05:16.510> amiibo

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
to me which brings me to my last amiibo

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:18.900 
to me which brings me to my last amiibo
now<00:05:17.560> with<00:05:17.680> Kirby<00:05:18.010> I<00:05:18.160> really<00:05:18.580> didn't<00:05:18.820> know<00:05:18.880> what

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
now with Kirby I really didn't know what

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:19.590 
now with Kirby I really didn't know what
to<00:05:19.060> do<00:05:19.180> with<00:05:19.300> him

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
to do with him

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.630 
to do with him
maybe<00:05:19.810> expose<00:05:20.140> him<00:05:20.260> to<00:05:20.320> CPUs<00:05:20.890> team<00:05:21.250> battles

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
maybe expose him to CPUs team battles

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.820 
maybe expose him to CPUs team battles
and<00:05:21.790> smash<00:05:22.120> battles<00:05:22.510> well<00:05:23.050> at<00:05:23.350> this<00:05:23.560> point<00:05:23.770> I

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
and smash battles well at this point I

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:24.990 
and smash battles well at this point I
was<00:05:23.919> really<00:05:23.980> sick<00:05:24.310> of<00:05:24.340> playing<00:05:24.550> so<00:05:24.790> I<00:05:24.850> just

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
was really sick of playing so I just

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.520 
was really sick of playing so I just
left<00:05:25.180> them<00:05:25.300> in<00:05:25.390> a<00:05:25.450> 99<00:05:25.840> minute<00:05:26.110> match<00:05:26.260> with<00:05:26.470> my

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
left them in a 99 minute match with my

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.930 
left them in a 99 minute match with my
character<00:05:26.890> repeatedly<00:05:27.460> running<00:05:27.790> off<00:05:27.910> the

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
character repeatedly running off the

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.760 
character repeatedly running off the
edge<00:05:28.210> but<00:05:28.870> when<00:05:28.990> I<00:05:29.020> came<00:05:29.110> back<00:05:29.290> the<00:05:29.560> next

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
edge but when I came back the next

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.070 
edge but when I came back the next
morning<00:05:29.830> the<00:05:30.520> results<00:05:30.640> kind<00:05:31.419> of<00:05:31.510> shocked<00:05:31.690> me

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
morning the results kind of shocked me

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.659 
morning the results kind of shocked me
female<00:05:32.500> Bo<00:05:32.620> of<00:05:32.740> course<00:05:32.950> didn't<00:05:33.220> run<00:05:33.370> off<00:05:33.490> edges

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
female Bo of course didn't run off edges

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.340 
female Bo of course didn't run off edges
like<00:05:33.910> I<00:05:34.060> did<00:05:34.270> but<00:05:34.570> he<00:05:34.660> became<00:05:34.930> a<00:05:34.990> super

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
like I did but he became a super

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.840 
like I did but he became a super
defensive<00:05:35.740> player<00:05:35.979> that<00:05:36.280> shields<00:05:36.700> and

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
defensive player that shields and

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.700 
defensive player that shields and
strikes<00:05:37.210> at<00:05:37.419> just<00:05:37.720> the<00:05:37.810> right<00:05:37.930> moments<00:05:38.320> but

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
strikes at just the right moments but

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.260 
strikes at just the right moments but
what's<00:05:38.860> even<00:05:39.070> weirder<00:05:39.220> is<00:05:39.460> I<00:05:39.550> beat<00:05:39.880> the<00:05:39.970> crap

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
what's even weirder is I beat the crap

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.360 
what's even weirder is I beat the crap
out<00:05:40.450> of<00:05:40.479> this<00:05:40.630> guy<00:05:40.810> in<00:05:40.930> a<00:05:40.990> 25<00:05:41.410> stock<00:05:41.650> match<00:05:41.890> but

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
out of this guy in a 25 stock match but

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.800 
out of this guy in a 25 stock match but
when<00:05:42.490> I<00:05:42.520> did<00:05:42.700> a<00:05:42.729> four-player<00:05:43.180> battle<00:05:43.540> way<00:05:43.630> out

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
when I did a four-player battle way out

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.050 
when I did a four-player battle way out
with<00:05:43.960> all<00:05:44.140> for<00:05:44.470> my<00:05:44.650> amiibo<00:05:45.070> he<00:05:45.520> freaking<00:05:45.850> won

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
with all for my amiibo he freaking won

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.000 
with all for my amiibo he freaking won
so<00:05:46.690> all<00:05:46.810> that<00:05:46.960> work<00:05:47.140> training<00:05:47.560> other<00:05:47.710> amiibo

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
so all that work training other amiibo

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.520 
so all that work training other amiibo
for<00:05:48.190> hours<00:05:48.520> was<00:05:48.880> all<00:05:49.120> for<00:05:49.540> nothing<00:05:49.690> to<00:05:50.260> get<00:05:50.380> the

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
for hours was all for nothing to get the

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.260 
for hours was all for nothing to get the
best<00:05:50.680> kind<00:05:50.890> of<00:05:50.979> amiibo<00:05:51.310> all<00:05:51.520> you<00:05:51.880> have<00:05:51.970> to<00:05:52.090> do

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
best kind of amiibo all you have to do

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.140 
best kind of amiibo all you have to do
is<00:05:52.450> expose<00:05:53.020> him<00:05:53.229> to<00:05:53.500> nothing<00:05:53.890> but<00:05:54.040> death<00:05:54.310> over

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
is expose him to nothing but death over

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.890 
is expose him to nothing but death over
and<00:05:55.330> over<00:05:55.990> and<00:05:56.169> over<00:05:57.120> 1192<00:05:58.120> times<00:05:58.330> to<00:05:58.450> be<00:05:58.540> exact

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
and over and over 1192 times to be exact

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.020 
and over and over 1192 times to be exact
so<00:05:59.169> yeah<00:05:59.650> in<00:05:59.860> the<00:05:59.919> end<00:06:00.130> I<00:06:00.460> don't<00:06:00.520> really<00:06:00.880> feel

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
so yeah in the end I don't really feel

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.250 
so yeah in the end I don't really feel
like<00:06:01.090> I<00:06:01.390> learn<00:06:01.600> anything<00:06:01.870> oh<00:06:02.310> well<00:06:03.930> anyway<00:06:04.930> in

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
like I learn anything oh well anyway in

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.050 
like I learn anything oh well anyway in
conclusion<00:06:05.620> I<00:06:05.860> really<00:06:06.190> feel<00:06:06.340> like<00:06:06.370> amiibo<00:06:06.850> are

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
conclusion I really feel like amiibo are

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.550 
conclusion I really feel like amiibo are
worth<00:06:07.270> your<00:06:07.419> time<00:06:07.630> each<00:06:08.020> figure<00:06:08.229> lets<00:06:08.500> you

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
worth your time each figure lets you

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.200 
worth your time each figure lets you
choose<00:06:08.680> a<00:06:08.740> new<00:06:08.919> strategy<00:06:09.400> to<00:06:09.430> give<00:06:09.669> them<00:06:09.850> it's

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
choose a new strategy to give them it's

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.790 
choose a new strategy to give them it's
fun<00:06:10.360> to<00:06:10.450> see<00:06:10.570> how<00:06:10.660> it<00:06:10.810> tries<00:06:11.110> to<00:06:11.290> adapt<00:06:11.560> to<00:06:11.590> your

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
fun to see how it tries to adapt to your

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.530 
fun to see how it tries to adapt to your
fighting<00:06:12.010> style<00:06:12.310> even<00:06:13.060> though<00:06:13.150> you<00:06:13.210> don't<00:06:13.479> get

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540 
fighting style even though you don't get

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.450 
fighting style even though you don't get
your<00:06:13.690> desired<00:06:14.020> result<00:06:14.410> half<00:06:14.560> the<00:06:14.710> time<00:06:14.919> it<00:06:15.130> is

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
your desired result half the time it is

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.130 
your desired result half the time it is
pretty<00:06:15.669> cool<00:06:15.880> to<00:06:16.000> see<00:06:16.030> what<00:06:16.270> happens<00:06:16.630> now

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
pretty cool to see what happens now

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.450 
pretty cool to see what happens now
you're<00:06:17.290> probably<00:06:17.440> thinking<00:06:17.620> if<00:06:18.130> there's<00:06:18.400> a

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
you're probably thinking if there's a

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.650 
you're probably thinking if there's a
limited<00:06:18.760> amount<00:06:18.850> of<00:06:19.060> ways<00:06:19.180> to<00:06:19.330> teach<00:06:19.510> an

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 
limited amount of ways to teach an

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.090 
limited amount of ways to teach an
amiibo<00:06:20.020> why<00:06:20.320> would<00:06:20.500> people<00:06:20.620> want<00:06:20.890> to<00:06:20.979> collect

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 
amiibo why would people want to collect

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.980 
amiibo why would people want to collect
them<00:06:21.340> all<00:06:21.490> but<00:06:21.940> with<00:06:22.060> each<00:06:22.270> character<00:06:22.690> you<00:06:22.810> get

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
them all but with each character you get

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.480 
them all but with each character you get
their<00:06:23.380> interpretation<00:06:24.040> of<00:06:24.130> your<00:06:24.280> style

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
their interpretation of your style

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:25.980 
their interpretation of your style
becomes<00:06:24.820> different<00:06:25.060> since<00:06:25.360> every<00:06:25.660> character

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
becomes different since every character

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.540 
becomes different since every character
has<00:06:26.169> different<00:06:26.200> move<00:06:26.590> sets<00:06:26.860> and<00:06:27.070> strengths

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
has different move sets and strengths

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.490 
has different move sets and strengths
for<00:06:27.970> instance<00:06:28.360> a<00:06:28.450> Kirby<00:06:28.810> amiibo<00:06:29.140> may<00:06:29.290> just

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
for instance a Kirby amiibo may just

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.440 
for instance a Kirby amiibo may just
shield<00:06:29.770> roll<00:06:30.010> a<00:06:30.040> lot<00:06:30.220> to<00:06:30.370> protect<00:06:30.520> itself<00:06:31.000> but

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:31.450 
shield roll a lot to protect itself but

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.090 
shield roll a lot to protect itself but
a<00:06:31.479> Marth<00:06:31.780> amiibo<00:06:32.140> may<00:06:32.290> just<00:06:32.500> use<00:06:32.650> this<00:06:32.770> counter

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.100 
a Marth amiibo may just use this counter

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.710 
a Marth amiibo may just use this counter
move<00:06:33.250> a<00:06:33.370> lot<00:06:33.550> there's<00:06:33.970> a<00:06:34.060> seemingly<00:06:34.390> infinite

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
move a lot there's a seemingly infinite

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.000 
move a lot there's a seemingly infinite
amount<00:06:35.169> of<00:06:35.229> things<00:06:35.440> you<00:06:35.560> can<00:06:35.710> do<00:06:35.860> with<00:06:35.979> a

amount of things you can do with a
