00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:46.950 
and going to up break the sonic wave

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:56.570 
and going to up break the sonic wave
guitar<00:06:52.520> all<00:06:53.520> right<00:06:53.850> so<00:06:54.270> the<00:06:54.810> phonics<00:06:55.230> ball<00:06:55.580> is

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:02.040 
electricity upon impact and the sonic

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:07.340 
electricity upon impact and the sonic
wave<00:07:02.190> guitar<00:07:02.610> is<00:07:02.790> basically<00:07:03.350> this<00:07:05.810> you<00:07:06.810> can<00:07:07.020> I

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:07.350
