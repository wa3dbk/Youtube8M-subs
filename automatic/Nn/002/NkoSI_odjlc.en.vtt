00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.920 

case<00:00:24.230> is<00:00:24.440> pretty<00:00:24.620> big<00:00:24.920> for<00:00:24.980> a<00:00:25.690> guitar<00:00:26.690> that

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
case is pretty big for a guitar that

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.220 
case is pretty big for a guitar that
doesn't<00:00:27.740> look<00:00:27.860> like<00:00:28.070> it's<00:00:28.250> that<00:00:28.400> big<00:00:28.700> at<00:00:28.850> all

of<00:00:32.900> the<00:00:32.989> actual<00:00:33.140> guitar

pretty slim as well which I noticed is

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.410 
pretty slim as well which I noticed is
that<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.710> neck<00:01:27.710> profile<00:01:28.130> on<00:01:28.400> the<00:01:28.520> vm<00:01:28.759> NT<00:01:29.150> and

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
that the neck profile on the vm NT and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.190 
that the neck profile on the vm NT and
the<00:01:29.990> vm<00:01:30.200> ntx<00:01:30.680> are<00:01:31.100> a<00:01:31.130> little<00:01:31.310> bit<00:01:31.550> different

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.070

I<00:01:34.700> think<00:01:35.000> it's<00:01:35.119> due<00:01:35.300> to<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.540> fact<00:01:35.690> that<00:01:35.869> this

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
I think it's due to the fact that this

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.570
