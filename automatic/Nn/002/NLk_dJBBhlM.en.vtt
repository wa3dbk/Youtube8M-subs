00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.439 
right on the front of a kick drum here
and<00:00:53.739> get<00:00:54.280> all<00:00:54.400> the<00:00:54.519> sound<00:00:54.729> we<00:00:54.909> need<00:00:55.089> with<00:00:55.299> it

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
and get all the sound we need with it

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:56.969 
and get all the sound we need with it
and<00:00:55.629> it's<00:00:55.690> the<00:00:55.900> perfect<00:00:56.049> starting<00:00:56.589> point<00:00:56.650> to

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
get it into our system from there let's

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.250 
get it into our system from there let's
see<00:01:01.000> if<00:01:01.089> we<00:01:01.210> can<00:01:01.360> walk<00:01:01.540> over<00:01:01.809> and<00:01:01.930> check<00:01:01.989> out

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
see if we can walk over and check out

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.820 
see if we can walk over and check out
the<00:01:02.409> preamps<00:01:02.979> there<00:01:03.400> a<00:01:03.699> dual<00:01:03.970> mic<00:01:04.239> pre<00:01:04.830> phantom

the preamps there a dual mic pre phantom
power<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:07.240> can<00:01:07.420> choose<00:01:07.810> between<00:01:07.840> Mike<00:01:08.439> line

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
power you can choose between Mike line

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.770 
power you can choose between Mike line
or<00:01:09.010> a<00:01:09.040> high<00:01:09.400> impedance<00:01:09.700> input<00:01:10.030> so<00:01:10.390> you<00:01:10.450> can<00:01:10.659> go

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
or a high impedance input so you can go

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.840 
or a high impedance input so you can go
directly<00:01:11.229> into<00:01:11.320> that<00:01:11.799> if<00:01:12.250> you<00:01:12.400> want<00:01:12.549> to<00:01:12.610> track

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
directly into that if you want to track

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.520 
directly into that if you want to track
some<00:01:13.030> bass<00:01:13.180> or<00:01:13.360> anything<00:01:13.659> through<00:01:13.899> it<00:01:13.990> we've

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
some bass or anything through it we've

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.709 
some bass or anything through it we've
got<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.920> analog<00:01:15.759> view<00:01:16.000> meters<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:16.630> then

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:16.719 
got the analog view meters and then

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:19.830 
got the analog view meters and then
digital<00:01:17.079> peak<00:01:17.229> meters<00:01:17.619> and<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:19.509> has<00:01:19.659> also

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
digital peak meters and this has also

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.380 
digital peak meters and this has also
got<00:01:20.109> digital<00:01:20.469> output<00:01:20.890> so<00:01:21.130> you<00:01:21.189> got<00:01:21.399> spdif<00:01:22.179> and

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
got digital output so you got spdif and

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.989 
got digital output so you got spdif and
an<00:01:22.539> Aes<00:01:22.899> output<00:01:23.409> delivering<00:01:24.340> ultra<00:01:24.759> clean

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
signal into your system we're running

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.440 
signal into your system we're running
the<00:01:28.030> HD<00:01:28.810> Omni<00:01:29.439> above<00:01:30.249> this<00:01:30.399> it's<00:01:30.609> an<00:01:30.759> HD<00:01:31.119> native

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
the HD Omni above this it's an HD native

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.770 
the HD Omni above this it's an HD native
system<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.049> it's<00:01:32.859> got<00:01:33.130> a<00:01:33.159> 1.5<00:01:34.060> millisecond

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
system and it's got a 1.5 millisecond

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.649 
system and it's got a 1.5 millisecond
latency<00:01:35.020> round<00:01:36.009> trip<00:01:36.369> so<00:01:37.270> that's<00:01:37.450> pretty

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
latency round trip so that's pretty

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.090 
latency round trip so that's pretty
reasonable<00:01:37.899> you're<00:01:38.619> not<00:01:38.740> going<00:01:38.859> to<00:01:38.920> hear<00:01:39.039> that

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
reasonable you're not going to hear that

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.580 
reasonable you're not going to hear that

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.430 
condenser style mics and then we're also
doing<00:02:05.770> some<00:02:06.280> dynamic<00:02:06.969> mics<00:02:07.209> like<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.749> S<00:02:08.140> kick

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
doing some dynamic mics like the S kick

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.040 
doing some dynamic mics like the S kick
here<00:02:08.770> and<00:02:09.009> some<00:02:09.490> other<00:02:09.640> cool<00:02:09.880> stuff<00:02:09.940> so<00:02:10.660> the

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
here and some other cool stuff so the

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.510 
here and some other cool stuff so the
possibilities<00:02:11.680> for<00:02:11.890> what<00:02:12.069> we're<00:02:12.220> able<00:02:12.370> to

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
possibilities for what we're able to

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.580 
possibilities for what we're able to
model<00:02:12.790> in<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.030> mic<00:02:13.180> end<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.540> things<00:02:13.720> is<00:02:14.020> really

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
model in the mic end of things is really

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.390 
model in the mic end of things is really
endless<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:15.100> know

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
endless you know

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.080 
it's going to be a really cool
development<00:02:20.890> being<00:02:21.610> able<00:02:21.849> to<00:02:21.909> watch<00:02:22.060> it

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
development being able to watch it

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.240 
development being able to watch it
expand<00:02:22.720> into<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.799> future<00:02:24.010> of<00:02:24.129> the
