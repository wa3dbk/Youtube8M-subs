00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.610
 you people said to john doe young 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.139
 years are found for a small video 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.520
 on estonia just for the canvas for 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.320
 you that it's fine for like a 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.760
 study on a crate I have the potato and 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.090
 we left for a short video on 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.269
 slits the crunches the whole body 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.240
 callous copti the coca at two levels 33 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.529
 voice there and he's finally going again 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.700
 I will not call it a tutorial 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.010
 because it's not really a 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.840
 but I just give you the point of 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.460
 view of the dps and to say the one she likes 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.110
 in the hands that's so what have 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.460
 never made of red crow pta or those who 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.870
 have already been proven to 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.170
 hundreds of times without ever taking the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.579
 blade 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.100
 here you go to see a little bit 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.829
 what does it look like and g or stop you 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.649
 give the maximum amount of information for 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.350
 how to handle the blade in this raid opta 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.640
 hard 33 of course it's not worth it for the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.480
 30 you can do it in May 30 it's 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.190
 a waste of time 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.559
 there I really do you for the raid 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.260
 hollow of the ear as to how 33 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.049
 manage the blade the best in the world what 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.850
 So here is already first thing it is 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.369
 with a hunter I'm going to handle this 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.619
 blade and this way there is not going to be 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.380
 possible with a hunter 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.380
 will have to use invisibility and 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.820
 tomorrow I'll put you a video like this 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.830
 with another time we did too much 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.530
 scared where I'm a bubble setter and 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.009
 precisely for an organist who will manage 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.290
 the blade 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.640
 so to show you that I 'm fine 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.740
 advise anyway manage the blade with 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.540
 any type of person but I 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.450
 you do a tutorial today on this 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.369
 special video hunters recess that 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.119
 will be for others so here is so 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.799
 how to be able 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.600
 how to know how to handle the blade with a 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.680
 hunter and I can guarantee you that the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.930
 hunter on this raid 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.659
 he's exceptionally good with this 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.909
 blade it is essential limit it is 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.860
 loved y easy simple is it life time 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.450
 without when you have the blade with a 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.280
 hunter rather than with another person 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.680
 So here is already the first step 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.030
 you've seen it messed up if you 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.500
 have watched the video shows you 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.500
 tells you how to do as you heard 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.270
 the complete tutorial you know that these are the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.310
 orbs are made to regenerate life 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.420
 and for the bubble setter in this case 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.830
 where there was no bull setters 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.720
 since I was hunters so 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.830
 invisibility so no need of guys who 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.450
 like to put a bubble behind me 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.270
 This is wasted time and a shooter 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.850
 less so the orders are there only 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.870
 to recover his life especially 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.720
 for me since I'm going 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.760
 especially forward so stopped d 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.620
 offers that will serve me america eric 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.330
 and regenerate my life forgiveness between 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.220
 phases where I will return from krt 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.530
 october so knowing that I'm going to the 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.060
 blade I use my gala so for the 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.739
 wear soul since I do not use 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.810
 for the kraft shield a and at this 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.160
 moment it's very simple you go up 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.420
 on the right me I'm used to 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.190
 right you squat on the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.390
 first stone is just before 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.180
 become invisible or ask your 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.920
 teammates shoot and when he shoots you 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.360
 are anyway straight train 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.819
 go up he puts down 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.470
 three sword strikes you let go of the sword 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.060
 as own task falls you put a 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.790
 stabbing to become invisible 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.500
 you recover the relic and you 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.940
 ask your years to shoot once 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.590
 that cocteau just before croft has 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.390
 shield person to fall back 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.850
 instantly and I give it back 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.380
 inflicts three sword blows to know that 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.049
 as you know about retracts to 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.400
 the insurer automatically triggers 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.130
 when there are three sword strokes left 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.690
 put in time croc so simply 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.329
 what I advise you when you are 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.799
 the dp wearer is simply there 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.690
 go three shots sometimes hit at each 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.700
 passage you put him three strokes and 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.060
 they fall perfectly well here it is 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.410
 there is no 6.6 c123 per pass 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.760
 if you do not need to go too much 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.470
 quickly but must not be too 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.790
 slow and normally it should never be there 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.650
 have trouble with his 3 blade strokes 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.690
 they will pass each time so really 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.190
 you have a sudden blow of delay 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.269
 imagine on a cocteau passage you 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.680
 have arrived too late you have 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.209
 more cost masters do you 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.560
 do not worry what I advise you 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.820
 is that at some point when you 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.440
 feel that you have the time you 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.359
 put three big shots and a little bit 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.459
 brake behind that is going to be very fast 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.840
 inflicted and who will remove the little 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.269
 corner of life precisely that will miss at 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.070
 croupons for the end here and so we 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.019
 start over you see it by the video 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.400
 we come back we spring we put ourselves on the 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.230
 lurking choice to wear the fastest 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.790
 possible very important and you saw 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.989
 that lol I was wrong but I can 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.610
 precisely thanks to that I can you 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.409
 show that this technique can work 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.600
 that any personal there in fact I 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:13.760
 I was wrong because I 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.470
 raw in game sweetening the guy downright 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.270
 I completely failed to become 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.980
 invisible so I completely forgot 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:20.450
 to release the relic and the croft carpet 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.070
 with my knife to become invisible 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.570
 so I left you saw for 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.010
 that it was not for all that I had 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.470
 problems coming to them the type the 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.850
 knights did not tell me but it's 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.770
 still more dangerous because the 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.120
 knights here knowing that they have 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.190
 nobody else shot my focus 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.920
 really quickly the carrier of the 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.390
 hand and once it's done once 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.670
 that the first two passages of croft 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.710
 on kropotov are put as usual 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.030
 we will receive the ogres directly 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.420
 at their exit too much left to 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.700
 right 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.310
 the ogre that will come out directly on 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.570
 this door there and so in fact he goes to 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.250
 hardly have time to go out who's going 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.590
 to eat so much that he is going to die 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.570
 extremely fast it's already done so 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.580
 the other side is the same and there 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.810
 attention I repeat because the 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.280
 last time I did the tutorial 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.990
 others to come extremely long to 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.940
 come in there they came right away and 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.900
 since the since this week it's 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.590
 like that they come right now 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.040
 now there is no time 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.440
 expectations 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.580
 so here I am here to clarify who will 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.980
 happen now because it has 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.080
 changed when we go back here 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.450
 we will clear the room of all these 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.760
 month slaves I emptied my super see 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.650
 to be able to recover orbs is 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.020
 so recommended my life and there you see 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.790
 khroma is on the left croft is on the left 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.830
 so crazy what it really takes 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.360
 lifted right side even those who 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.350
 were on the left ogres it takes 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.900
 really it had to be done 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.820
 really in the middle and that goes back 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.290
 by the stairs right side it is necessary 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.780
 wait for encryption to return to 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.610
 center and that croft reach right 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.830
 look at June you accelerate it prompting 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.510
 x 8 so you go you have about 2 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.610
 to 3 minutes of expectations in dance is helped 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.870
 in this stage it is very long so 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.820
 to refill the cartridges to you 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.050
 leaves time for gunners and 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.180
 once only cropped to is to 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.120
 right and that goes back to the center there you 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.250
 come out and there you have to be very fast 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.600
 because in general the wearer is well 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.130
 hidden for this last wave is in 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.230
 general if we magnify his cause of this 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.550
 battle that is well hidden there for the 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.140
 blow it's all wind not cut off the 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.180
 miss and there the goal is really 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.380
 tear as soon as possible wear 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.970
 because the little the next step 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.890
 like that will move very quickly to the left 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.600
 so you really have to finish it on this 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.550
 blade there and there as usual one 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.590
 the invisibility that will serve when 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.540
 it takes extremely well and so three 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.340
 shots three shots by three shots 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.560
 so it's going to fuck there is no soucy 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.150
 big my mouth you saw so and then 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.500
 becomes visible again especially lachor himself 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.850
 triggers panic people do it 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.560
 as if and not the most of the fury one 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.840
 act as if the moon did not exist 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.990
 play quietly his game and poum

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.180
 fell on that time so that 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.250
 pleases 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.570
 the two red beards that I had done 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.550
 before that man had nothing to give 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.050
 still cases what I already had on 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.360

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.710

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.480

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.840

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.990
 pleasure to have this little headset microphone 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.700
