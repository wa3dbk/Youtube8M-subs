00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
to do pairing for a couple of reasons

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.649 
to do pairing for a couple of reasons
the<00:01:37.259> first<00:01:37.290> reason<00:01:37.619> being<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.340> were<00:01:39.150> that

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
the first reason being that were that

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.240 
the first reason being that were that
it's<00:01:39.780> time<00:01:40.049> management<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:40.950> get<00:01:41.070> in

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
it's time management so you can get in

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.160 
it's time management so you can get in
and<00:01:41.400> out<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:42.060> can<00:01:42.299> get<00:01:42.509> actually<00:01:42.750> get<00:01:42.899> through

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
and out you can get actually get through

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.080 
and out you can get actually get through
this<00:01:43.320> workout<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.950> 30<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.340> 40<00:01:44.579> minutes<00:01:44.729> that's

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
this workout in 30 to 40 minutes that's

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.880 
this workout in 30 to 40 minutes that's
actually<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.509> main<00:01:45.689> reason<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.649> then<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
actually the main reason and then the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.660 
actually the main reason and then the
other<00:01:47.009> thing<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.280> you're<00:01:47.399> going<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.549> be

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
other thing is you're going to be

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.060 
other thing is you're going to be
hitting<00:01:47.880> instead<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.750> instead<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.530> limiting

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
hitting instead of instead of limiting

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.609 
hitting instead of instead of limiting
yourself<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.030> 30<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.420> 40<00:01:51.689> minutes<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:52.110> one

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
yourself in that 30 to 40 minutes to one

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.410 
yourself in that 30 to 40 minutes to one
or<00:01:52.770> two<00:01:52.890> body<00:01:53.100> parts<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:53.909> do<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> total

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
or two body parts you can do a total

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.020 
or two body parts you can do a total
body<00:01:54.540> routine<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.140> 30<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.409> 40<00:01:55.710> minutes<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.369> so

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
body routine in 30 to 40 minutes and so

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.789 
body routine in 30 to 40 minutes and so
that's<00:01:57.210> that's<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.689> benefits<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.290> so

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
that's that's the benefits of this so

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.450 
that's that's the benefits of this so
let's<00:01:58.979> talk<00:01:59.159> about<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.549> alright<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.180> 1<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> 2<00:02:01.079> B<00:02:01.590> 1

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
let's talk about it alright a 1 a 2 B 1

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.839 
let's talk about it alright a 1 a 2 B 1
B<00:02:03.000> 2<00:02:03.140> C<00:02:04.140> 1<00:02:04.380> C<00:02:05.340> 2<00:02:05.450> D<00:02:06.450> 1<00:02:06.689> D<00:02:07.530> 2<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:08.039> each<00:02:08.399> one<00:02:08.729> of

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
B 2 C 1 C 2 D 1 D 2 and each one of

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.969 
B 2 C 1 C 2 D 1 D 2 and each one of
these<00:02:09.000> represents<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:10.170> different<00:02:10.739> exercise

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
these represents a different exercise

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.640 
these represents a different exercise
and<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:11.670> we<00:02:11.790> pair<00:02:12.060> these<00:02:12.270> this<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:12.989> one<00:02:13.200> pair

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
and so we pair these this is one pair

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.270 
and so we pair these this is one pair
two<00:02:13.860> pair<00:02:14.189> three<00:02:14.640> pair<00:02:15.260> for<00:02:16.260> total<00:02:16.709> pair<00:02:16.920> all

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
two pair three pair for total pair all

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.759 
two pair three pair for total pair all
right<00:02:17.430> what<00:02:18.269> I<00:02:18.299> like<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.720> do<00:02:18.900> again<00:02:19.409> we're

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
right what I like to do again we're

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.649 
right what I like to do again we're
talking<00:02:19.950> about<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.370> beginner<00:02:20.790> we're<00:02:21.269> talking

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
talking about a beginner we're talking

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
example you've got a press here you've

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.550 
example you've got a press here you've
got<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.430> squat<00:02:48.120> here<00:02:48.599> all<00:02:49.019> right<00:02:49.139> that's<00:02:49.349> what<00:02:49.530> I

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
got a squat here all right that's what I

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.140 
got a squat here all right that's what I
mean<00:02:49.709> by<00:02:49.769> upper<00:02:50.159> body<00:02:50.340> lower<00:02:50.519> body<00:02:50.670> when<00:02:51.060> you

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
mean by upper body lower body when you

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.140 
mean by upper body lower body when you
get<00:02:51.299> it<00:02:51.420> down<00:02:51.659> to<00:02:51.690> core<00:02:52.109> you've<00:02:52.650> got<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:53.459> sit-up

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
get it down to core you've got a sit-up

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.460 
get it down to core you've got a sit-up
and<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:55.109> leg<00:02:55.319> raise<00:02:55.560> all<00:02:56.400> right<00:02:57.230> so<00:02:58.230> that's

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
and a leg raise all right so that's

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.020 
and a leg raise all right so that's
that's<00:02:58.799> essentially<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.459> protocol<00:02:59.849> that<00:02:59.970> I

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
that's essentially the protocol that I

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.500 
that's essentially the protocol that I
recommend<00:03:00.480> now<00:03:00.569> let's<00:03:00.780> talk<00:03:00.959> about<00:03:01.019> sets<00:03:01.590> rest

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
recommend now let's talk about sets rest

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.879 
recommend now let's talk about sets rest
if<00:03:03.510> we're<00:03:03.720> if<00:03:03.810> we're<00:03:03.959> talking<00:03:04.109> about<00:03:04.319> sets<00:03:04.709> I'd

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
if we're if we're talking about sets I'd

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.160 
if we're if we're talking about sets I'd
like<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.189> to<00:03:05.280> keep<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.970> sets<00:03:06.239> around<00:03:06.720> three

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
like you to keep the sets around three

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.559 
like you to keep the sets around three
to<00:03:07.290> four<00:03:07.340> initially<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.370> like<00:03:08.639> I<00:03:08.790> like<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.239> idea

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
to four initially I like I like the idea

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.000 
to four initially I like I like the idea
the<00:03:09.989> idea<00:03:10.319> of<00:03:10.530> three<00:03:10.859> sets<00:03:11.159> times<00:03:12.030> 10<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.709> 12

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
the idea of three sets times 10 to 12

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.339 
the idea of three sets times 10 to 12
reps<00:03:14.250> per<00:03:14.549> so<00:03:15.120> you're<00:03:15.239> doing<00:03:15.480> this<00:03:15.689> as<00:03:15.930> well

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
reps per so you're doing this as well

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.129 
reps per so you're doing this as well
three<00:03:17.329> so<00:03:18.329> this<00:03:18.480> is<00:03:18.599> what<00:03:18.720> you're<00:03:18.840> doing<00:03:19.019> so

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
three so this is what you're doing so

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:20.420 
three so this is what you're doing so
this<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.530> pair<00:03:19.739> you're<00:03:19.949> going<00:03:20.069> to<00:03:20.129> do<00:03:20.280> this

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
this is the pair you're going to do this

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.640 
this is the pair you're going to do this
one<00:03:20.819> time<00:03:21.090> you're<00:03:22.079> going<00:03:22.199> to<00:03:22.260> do<00:03:22.379> ups<00:03:22.530> are

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
one time you're going to do ups are

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.869 
one time you're going to do ups are
you're<00:03:22.739> going<00:03:22.829> to<00:03:22.919> do<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.099> three<00:03:23.370> times<00:03:23.400> but

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
you're going to do it three times but

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.819 
you're going to do it three times but
the<00:03:24.030> idea<00:03:24.269> is<00:03:24.359> is<00:03:24.569> you<00:03:24.690> do<00:03:24.840> 10<00:03:25.049> to<00:03:25.139> 12<00:03:25.379> reps

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
the idea is is you do 10 to 12 reps

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.110 
the idea is is you do 10 to 12 reps
all<00:03:26.040> right<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:26.790> rest<00:03:28.010> 60<00:03:29.010> seconds<00:03:29.489> all<00:03:30.030> right

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
all right you rest 60 seconds all right

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.860 
all right you rest 60 seconds all right
then<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:30.959> do<00:03:31.199> at<00:03:31.769> a<00:03:32.069> to<00:03:32.129> 10<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.120> 12<00:03:33.359> reps<00:03:33.419> and

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
then you do at a to 10 to 12 reps and

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.780 
then you do at a to 10 to 12 reps and
then<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:34.379> go<00:03:34.500> back<00:03:34.769> and<00:03:35.069> you're<00:03:35.400> just<00:03:35.459> resting

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
then you go back and you're just resting

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.089 
then you go back and you're just resting
60<00:03:36.389> seconds<00:03:36.810> in<00:03:36.900> between<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.530> then<00:03:37.949> you

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
60 seconds in between and then you

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.920 
60 seconds in between and then you
rotate<00:03:38.579> back<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:38.970> forth<00:03:39.150> once<00:03:39.419> you<00:03:39.540> finish

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
rotate back and forth once you finish

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.659 
rotate back and forth once you finish
the<00:03:40.079> three<00:03:40.349> of<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.680> six<00:03:40.919> sets<00:03:41.159> in<00:03:41.310> this<00:03:41.430> case

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
the three of the six sets in this case

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.089 
the three of the six sets in this case
you<00:03:42.150> come<00:03:42.329> down<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.690> b1<00:03:43.109> and<00:03:43.319> you<00:03:43.650> move<00:03:43.829> all<00:03:44.010> the

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
you come down to b1 and you move all the

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.559 
you come down to b1 and you move all the
way<00:03:44.220> through<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.549> workout<00:03:44.909> all<00:03:45.269> right<00:03:45.389> so

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
way through the workout all right so

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.770 
way through the workout all right so
that's<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.900> sets<00:03:46.260> that's<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.739> rest<00:03:47.599> if<00:03:48.599> we're
