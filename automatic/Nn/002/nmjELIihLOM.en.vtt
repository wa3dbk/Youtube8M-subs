00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.100
 well let's work the next 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.890
 ask what are we going to do with a 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.869
 technique that is called pencils to the center 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.110
 then the technique consists of what 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.960
 next you have some graphics and a 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.840
 series of questions about these grains 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.090
 so when I say time all the 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.270
 world leaves the pencil in the center of 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.360
 hands and then we talk about the 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.570
 answer that you have these questions and 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.780
 we approached it more but without writing anything 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.729
 We can not use the pencil for 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.629
 write on a computer look is to say 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:54.729
 that we have to agree 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.470
 nothing more than talking because I think that 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.330
 this question the answer is this 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.760
 yes no, then we come to a decision 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.190
 because it will be very well spent was a 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.950
 the next one for that is going to have five 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.229
 minutes without writing when the 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.020
 five minutes I say time and then 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.360
 each one takes the pencil and in his paper 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.020
 they write the answers but can no longer 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.929
 talk with those from behind 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.420
 you have to remember what you have 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:24.049
 agreed in the previous five minutes 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.119
 agree five minutes without power 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.549
 write nothing but talking to 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.829
 think the answers and then three 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:34.929
 minutes so that each one is first 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.929
 answer is without talking to others 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.229
 Well then you see the questions 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.229
 the internet 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.540
 go down a little bit here there are some 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.540
 graphics 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.810
 good time have passed the three minutes 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.810
 and then now everyone takes 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.110
 without talking to others 2 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.180
 good time very well you have done 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.010
 very good also now what are we going to 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.800
 to do is always that we make a 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.180
 cooperative work strategy 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.310
 we have to reflect the in our 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.150
 computer notebook then how do you 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.730
 let's do then let's take one of 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.920
 the files that we have to record 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.300
 the activities that we do that are 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.960
 these 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.720
 these chips are worth the one that puts diary of 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.730
 sessions and the secretary who is the 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.540
 responsible for filling this has to 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.970
 put here area to that the because the 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.120
 activity in the social field day 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.200
 today's date that we have done since there is 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.660
 to make a summary of what we have 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.870
 made the booklet of the year expected with 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.610
 this series of strategies that we have 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.160
 used and this is the most 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.710
 important how the whole group has gone 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.010
 chat and you have to collect and how has 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.320
 gone for example there has been a 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.299
 person who is so-and-so who has not 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.739
 participated percent has only 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.600
 we want you to pick up because it's one thing 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.000
 what needs to be improved is a problem 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.160
 team that has to improve vale has gone 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.780
 wrong because they have had little time 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.090
 gone well because he has given us time 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.590
 gone more because we have not met in the 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.210
 The team's rule to respect others 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.600
 as it has gone, it matters 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.370
 that you reflect that every time 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.520
 that you make a work strategy 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.069
 cooperative fill 'aces' a fichita 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.940
 of these and this must be done in two or 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:47.990
 three minutes has to be fast 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:53.050
 then they give two or three minutes of 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.050
 time to arrive according so come 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.550
 two 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.850
 very well why
