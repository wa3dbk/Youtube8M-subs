00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.629
 november to discuss the film factory today 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.940
 i for you captain philips is the 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.370
 new movie with tom hanks by paul 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.480
 greengrass and he already has that 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.580
 bourne ultimatum 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.960
 staged the whole series and the 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.220
 history here is extremely short 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.470
 summarize 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.140
 Tom Hanks plays Captain Richard 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.300
 Phillips and he is on the high seas in 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.970
 africa on the way and only becomes ship 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.230
 suddenly pirated by pirates and so on 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.570
 I do not mean jack sparrow right now 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.520
 but really African pirates 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.950
 They want to take the ship apart 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.559
 sell everything and take the complete 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.809
 crew is offered as hostage sacrifices 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.520
 a bit too heroic but the danger 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.300
 just now they will be the hostages all 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.399
 kill 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.390
 and what happens just like the whole 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.390
 Looks you can see here 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.520
 but 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.719
 we have a problem with the ship 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.409
 too stressed we have none 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.509
 more power 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.649
 that means the computer is now 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.020
 put online 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.729
 the ship is broken nobody 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.689
 david hurt if you do not 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.460
 power games 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.140
 I was a bit skeptical at first 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.319
 Can a movie of yes only on 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.329
 a boat plays for 135 minutes 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.189
 not really complete the whole 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.240
 runtime entertained on the other 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:09.429
 I was very happy again 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.440
 hopeful with tom hanks is playing 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.760
 that has the traffic trail made was 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.260
 the whole movie alone has been with 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.010
 volleyball entertained even that was 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.810
 entertaining 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.640
 So he should be able to do that 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.860
 I can say in advance that he 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.959
 but unfortunately I have to 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.190
 also say that the beginning a bit 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.319
 slow he is somehow even 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.390
 not out of order and everything in the 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.400
 told first fifteen minutes 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.200
 is completely irrelevant so me 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.849
 do not learn the captain now 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.680
 know what else in the other 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.690
 Course of action is important to me 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.860
 It would be a mistake if it was right on 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.000
 would start more 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.890
 if it is a blatant for you now 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.120
 is spoiler I am sorry saves has 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.810
 not directly on the ship but 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.769
 just comes a bit 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.420
 VorgeplÃ¤nkel 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.010
 that would be complete for me 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.170
 The film could almost be deleted 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.760
 perfect was not deleted 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.730
 but is also alright then just the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.609
 second half is so abnormally crass 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.200
 exciting that you really like that 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.430
 Fingernails his wants to get away like 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.980
 such a corncob 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.690
 that's extremely good and tom hanks delivers 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.060
 his best performance really again 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.370
 guests from so this comparison is the 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.470
 not unfounded since eleven 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.120
 Tom finally has stallion again 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.829
 his big role in kempten philips 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.209
 found and that makes me very happy 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.370
 It used to be like that for me in the past 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.900
 absolute you have to go to the cinema if 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.579
 tom stallions has made new film and 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.319
 maybe he will come to that level 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.150
 then yes back again now I have 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.680
 but extremely praised by the stallion and that 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.720
 is also because I have the names of 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.880
 the African pirates just not 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.630
 can pronounce yes so could read 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.030
 or it does not work 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.609
 And they are also extremely good 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.040
 So just occupied this torn 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.019
 also comes between these characters 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.519
 very good and I have him in the 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.530
 Originally seen there you have to say that 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:48.269
 just this mother tongue and 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.269
 broken english to tom hanks 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.730
 that he has become extremely horny because of it 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.050
 fits well and I can not 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.100
 imagine that in the synchro 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.830
 should work 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.120
 also because everyone kind of moma and the question 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.980
 from tom hanks when he was from the pirates 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.380
 importantly that sounds kinda weird 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.790
 but just by how is it breathed or 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.950
 what is left for noises? 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.240
 By the way, I can do that 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.680
 really just imagine that 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.850
 works if you are exactly in 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.400
 the cell was crying and not in his 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.170
 studio I'm curious what 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.390
 but like to teach me a better 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.950
 but also the music is very good 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.120
 chosen so that's all right 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.610
 that's not over the top 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.350
 You also save on the whole 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.710
 runtime actually with pathos that is 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.360
 insane 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.220
 The American flag does not come at all 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.350
 so often in the picture but always when 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.120
 it is all right a little 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.500
 teeny tiny little problem have 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.510
 I still with the film because of the film 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.010
 but not for that but that's something 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.900
 if you know it's a true one 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.520
 history and reads a bit already 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.890
 in advance, that 's the story 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.990
 captain phillips was here in 2009 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.630
 I know already roughly how it 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.270
 if it is on the book of 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.190
 the same captain based there is then 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.420
 just a bit of tension when you get out 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.470
 has always remembered that 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.240
 somehow that will already be 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.830
 it's kinda stupid because of that 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.630
 that takes a bit in the meantime 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.610
 but the tension is out there overall 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.580
 so well staged and just at the end 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:07.970
 if tom hanks really so completely 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.380
 I want to solve them 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.000
 really take in the arm and say it 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.380
 it will be fine somehow 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.030
 is only called acting on the 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.740
 hit point and I can with 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.950
 quite imagine that this year 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.810
 or 2014 for the stallion 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.760
 again an oscar nomination is due 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.410
 We are waiting for everyone 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.090
 case a recommendation for captain philips 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.160
 who is now for captain philips one 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.710
 Buy tickets for the cinema are the people 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.930
 thrillers in confined spaces like so 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.430
 really not much space is this like 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.440
 if you are concentrated in the cinema seat 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.090
 feels it is just right for you 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.040
 also for people the history at that time 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.570
 maybe have tracked or that 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.070
 like general if so true 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.750
 stories to the cinema are also times 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.040
 get a feel for what's up 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.690
 actually still in this so-called 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.530
 reality then it is just right 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.600
 for you 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.400
 who should not watch the movie? 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.290
 People are a bit scared 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.640
 at the same time have this close 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.860
 say good if it's a true story 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.050
 is because so roughly how it turns out there 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.050
 also rather uninteresting but also people 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.180
 a little bit 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.129
 to be afraid of this whole topic and 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.139
 I say that now quite consciously because he 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:08.960
 is a bit scary and me 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:12.150
 This movie would not necessarily be 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.220
 on a cruise in the cabin 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.870
 I would really let it show 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.970
 and who also feels that way 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.409
 not who it is what it should be 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.819
 leave and then rather at home completely 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:22.710
 sure times on the sofa this film 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:24.750
 enjoy because for the cinema he is then for 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.789
 you too intense my personal 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.310
 Rating are sour good saustark 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:31.229
 8 out of 10 score tiny weaknesses 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.819
 has the film just as I said at the beginning 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:34.860
 just a little something to paint out 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:36.710
 then the movie would be better and would 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.520
 nevertheless this same 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.530
 cause identification potential 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.539
 what you need to get with the captain 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.030
 to cheer on but played it extremely well 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:46.800
 very oppressive great pictures right 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.090
 good director great cut that is 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.349
 really everything turned out well small 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.659
 weaken it's then just a 

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:53.129
 a little deduction is at the end at eight of 

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:55.080
 ten points that was my love for 

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:56.460
 captain philips and of you i would like 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.830
 Now know where the little comeback of 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.240
 tom hanks there is what actor 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.620
 you have not seen for a long time and me from 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.599
 you would like him one more time 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.620
 great movie wish actresses 

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:06.060
 are of course also allowed writes 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.289
 that my comments are pure 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.909
 But who would you prefer that again? 

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:10.740
 want to see the coach looking from the left 

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:12.750
 There is another review below 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.120
 right you know the game as well 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.770
 how to subscribe to the channel or to 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.539
 facebook instagram and twitter are coming 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.669
 If all this already works I am glad 

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:22.500
 soon to welcome there too 

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:23.969
 may as well as soon here again 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.860
 the film factory at a new 

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:27.860
 Film criticism with me the dornick
