the black sex into the case itself a lot

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.160 
the black sex into the case itself a lot
of<00:02:05.620> cases<00:02:05.800> like<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.250> v<00:02:06.400> 9<00:02:07.710> V<00:02:08.710> 5<00:02:09.040> V<00:02:09.270> 3<00:02:10.270> this<00:02:10.930> is<00:02:10.990> a

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
of cases like the v 9 V 5 V 3 this is a

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.320 
of cases like the v 9 V 5 V 3 this is a
lot<00:02:11.380> of<00:02:11.440> cases<00:02:11.650> has<00:02:11.950> been<00:02:12.270> implementing<00:02:13.270> this

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
lot of cases has been implementing this

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.480 
lot of cases has been implementing this
system<00:02:13.750> so<00:02:14.020> we<00:02:14.050> think<00:02:14.530> something<00:02:15.040> like<00:02:15.250> that

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
system so we think something like that

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.420 
system so we think something like that
should<00:02:16.210> add<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.600> bonus<00:02:17.050> for<00:02:17.560> user<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:18.250> get

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
should add the bonus for user to get

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.660 
should add the bonus for user to get
create<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.790> transfer<00:02:19.330> movie<00:02:20.110> transfer<00:02:20.620> or<00:02:21.010> just

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
create a transfer movie transfer or just

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.880 
create a transfer movie transfer or just
have<00:02:22.240> an<00:02:22.420> extra<00:02:22.750> hard<00:02:23.080> drive<00:02:23.170> for<00:02:23.500> backing<00:02:23.800> up

have an extra hard drive for backing up
your<00:02:23.920> system<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:25.630> we<00:02:26.640> take<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.700> step<00:02:28.000> further<00:02:28.210> to

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
your system so we take a step further to

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.970 
your system so we take a step further to
put<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.720> USB<00:02:29.200> 3.0<00:02:29.770> not<00:02:30.520> one<00:02:30.790> but<00:02:31.150> two<00:02:31.420> of<00:02:31.770> okay<00:02:32.770> if

put a USB 3.0 not one but two of okay if

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.500 
put a USB 3.0 not one but two of okay if
you're<00:02:33.400> afraid<00:02:33.610> that's<00:02:33.850> something<00:02:34.210> you<00:02:34.300> can

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
you're afraid that's something you can

use you have still USB 2.0 and remember

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.430 
use you have still USB 2.0 and remember
guys<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.230> girls<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:39.250> USB<00:02:39.640> 3.0<00:02:40.150> is<00:02:40.450> reversible

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
guys and girls the USB 3.0 is reversible

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.830 
guys and girls the USB 3.0 is reversible
to<00:02:41.650> two<00:02:41.800> point<00:02:42.010> oh<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.460> of<00:02:43.120> course<00:02:43.150> we<00:02:43.510> include

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
to two point oh and of course we include

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.250 
to two point oh and of course we include
original<00:02:44.110> data<00:02:44.530> speed<00:02:44.890> transfer<00:02:45.310> esata<00:02:46.260> to

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
original data speed transfer esata to

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.290 
original data speed transfer esata to
make<00:02:47.440> your<00:02:47.620> data<00:02:47.830> center<00:02:48.040> away<00:02:48.550> quicker<00:02:49.120> than

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
make your data center away quicker than

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.900 
make your data center away quicker than
ever<00:02:49.600> and<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.740> next<00:02:51.010> one<00:02:51.220> is<00:02:51.250> actually<00:02:51.610> its

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
ever and the next one is actually its

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.750 
ever and the next one is actually its
top<00:02:52.180> chasis<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:54.000> easily<00:02:55.000> removed<00:02:55.410> okay<00:02:56.760> the

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
top chasis is easily removed okay the

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.540 
top chasis is easily removed okay the
reason<00:02:58.150> is<00:02:58.270> that<00:02:58.300> we<00:02:58.810> have<00:02:59.110> the<00:03:00.010> ability<00:03:00.430> to

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
reason is that we have the ability to

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.030 
reason is that we have the ability to
put<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:00.910> water-cooling<00:03:01.750> up<00:03:02.050> there<00:03:02.260> or<00:03:02.560> the

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
put a water-cooling up there or the

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.729 
put a water-cooling up there or the
radiator<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:04.480> can<00:03:04.660> put<00:03:04.870> up<00:03:04.989> to<00:03:05.140> 36

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
radiator you can put up to 36

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.610 
radiator you can put up to 36
centimeters<00:03:06.280> radiator<00:03:07.090> up<00:03:07.330> there<00:03:07.510> so<00:03:08.050> these

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
centimeters radiator up there so these

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.790 
centimeters radiator up there so these

put<00:03:58.380> it<00:03:58.470> on<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.590> site<00:03:58.890> but<00:03:59.400> it<00:03:59.520> looks<00:03:59.820> really

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
put it on a site but it looks really

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.230 
put it on a site but it looks really
messy<00:04:00.360> so<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.950> inner<00:04:02.130> where<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:03.060> innovation

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
messy so the inner where the innovation

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.940 
messy so the inner where the innovation
of<00:04:03.720> thermaltake<00:04:04.290> we<00:04:04.410> actually<00:04:04.710> create

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
of thermaltake we actually create

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.340 
of thermaltake we actually create
something<00:04:05.160> better<00:04:05.430> a<00:04:05.880> site<00:04:06.600> holder<00:04:06.990> for<00:04:07.230> your

something better a site holder for your
headset<00:04:08.810> ok<00:04:09.810> if<00:04:10.290> you<00:04:10.380> don't<00:04:10.470> want<00:04:10.800> it<00:04:10.890> you<00:04:10.950> can

actually close it up to create something

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.400 
actually close it up to create something
like<00:04:14.280> that<00:04:14.430> a<00:04:14.459> lot<00:04:14.670> of<00:04:14.730> user<00:04:15.060> might<00:04:15.990> mistakenly

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
like that a lot of user might mistakenly

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.580 
like that a lot of user might mistakenly
breaks<00:04:17.040> any<00:04:17.400> plastic<00:04:18.299> parts<00:04:18.660> but<00:04:19.320> today

breaks any plastic parts but today

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.180 
breaks any plastic parts but today
thermaltake<00:04:20.579> use<00:04:20.760> a<00:04:21.060> really<00:04:21.750> rigid<00:04:21.959> system<00:04:22.290> it

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
thermaltake use a really rigid system it

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.820 
thermaltake use a really rigid system it
won't<00:04:23.520> break<00:04:23.730> it<00:04:24.030> would<00:04:24.450> just<00:04:24.570> come<00:04:24.840> out<00:04:24.870> so

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
won't break it would just come out so

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.190 
won't break it would just come out so
