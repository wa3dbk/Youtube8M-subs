00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:17.259 
using some really heavy weight you need
a<00:03:56.300> rest<00:03:56.510> a<00:03:56.599> little<00:03:56.810> longer

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:28.879

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
and the trick I like to do sometimes is

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.910 
and the trick I like to do sometimes is
I'd<00:04:49.970> like<00:04:50.060> to<00:04:50.120> look<00:04:50.360> down<00:04:50.420> and<00:04:51.170> it<00:04:51.680> kind<00:04:51.770> of

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
I'd like to look down and it kind of

00:04:51.920 --> 00:05:06.419 
I'd like to look down and it kind of
helps<00:04:52.760> me<00:04:52.820> flush<00:04:53.120> my<00:04:53.270> traps
