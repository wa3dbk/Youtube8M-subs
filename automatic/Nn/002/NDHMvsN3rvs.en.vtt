what I want to show you is my crease
brush<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:26.390> how<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.540> makes<00:01:28.170> life<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.740> much

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
brush and how this makes life so much

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.980 
brush and how this makes life so much
easier<00:01:28.920> watch<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:30.030> result<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.630> get<00:01:30.810> from

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
easier watch the result you get from

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.460 
easier watch the result you get from
this

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.060 

all<00:01:36.100> right<00:01:36.190> isn't<00:01:36.340> that<00:01:36.430> so<00:01:36.700> much<00:01:36.880> nicer<00:01:38.070> all

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
all right isn't that so much nicer all

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.290 
all right isn't that so much nicer all
right<00:01:39.160> just<00:01:39.460> a<00:01:39.490> little<00:01:39.520> bit<00:01:39.700> of<00:01:39.820> smooth<00:01:40.060> on<00:01:40.210> the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
right just a little bit of smooth on the

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.130 
right just a little bit of smooth on the
edges<00:01:40.630> make<00:01:40.900> a<00:01:40.930> nice<00:01:41.110> fall<00:01:41.380> off<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:44.020> was

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
edges make a nice fall off and that was

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.920 
edges make a nice fall off and that was
so<00:01:44.410> fast<00:01:44.710> and<00:01:44.980> it<00:01:45.340> looks<00:01:45.580> better<00:01:45.760> than<00:01:46.060> then

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
so fast and it looks better than then

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.840 
so fast and it looks better than then
all<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.230> work<00:01:47.410> that<00:01:47.440> I<00:01:47.590> put<00:01:47.830> into<00:01:47.950> that<00:01:48.220> so<00:01:48.700> let

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
all the work that I put into that so let
