mixture and you can actually pop it
straight<00:02:41.519> on<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.329> tray<00:02:42.540> if<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:42.870> like<00:02:43.110> or

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
straight on to the tray if you like or

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.319 
straight on to the tray if you like or
you<00:02:44.040> can<00:02:44.070> give<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:44.579> quick<00:02:44.730> roll<00:02:45.000> in<00:02:45.209> your

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
you can give it a quick roll in your

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:46.910 
you can give it a quick roll in your
hands<00:02:45.630> it's<00:02:45.750> entirely<00:02:46.140> up<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:46.769> think

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
hands it's entirely up to you I think

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.220 
hands it's entirely up to you I think
they're<00:02:47.250> slightly<00:02:48.239> more<00:02:48.420> uniform<00:02:48.989> if<00:02:49.110> you

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
they're slightly more uniform if you

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.960 
they're slightly more uniform if you
roll<00:02:49.440> them<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:49.829> then<00:02:49.980> press<00:02:50.280> them<00:02:50.519> alright

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
roll them and then press them alright

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.240 
roll them and then press them alright
we'll<00:02:51.630> roll<00:02:51.870> though<00:02:52.110> go<00:02:52.350> tidy<00:02:52.769> and<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.070> they're

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
we'll roll though go tidy and so they're

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.039 
we'll roll though go tidy and so they're
gonna<00:02:53.340> spread<00:02:53.880> quite<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.239> lot<00:02:54.480> are<00:02:54.630> there<00:02:54.870> so

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
gonna spread quite a lot are there so

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.240 
gonna spread quite a lot are there so
you<00:02:55.110> give<00:02:55.320> that<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.560> little<00:02:55.739> bit<00:02:55.829> of<00:02:55.920> space<00:02:56.220> in

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
you give that a little bit of space in

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.370 
you give that a little bit of space in
between<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.880> certainly<00:02:57.390> they<00:02:57.660> will<00:02:57.870> they<00:02:58.170> will

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
between it certainly they will they will

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.630 
between it certainly they will they will
spread<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.680> little<00:02:58.829> and<00:02:59.100> they<00:02:59.160> go<00:02:59.280> straight<00:02:59.340> the

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
spread a little and they go straight the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.130 
spread a little and they go straight the
other<00:02:59.760> that's<00:03:00.150> rice<00:03:00.480> they<00:03:00.810> go<00:03:00.900> into<00:03:01.049> a

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
other that's rice they go into a

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.140 
other that's rice they go into a
moderate<00:03:01.530> oven<00:03:01.680> for<00:03:02.190> around<00:03:02.250> 10<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.790> 15

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
moderate oven for around 10 to 15

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.050 
moderate oven for around 10 to 15
minutes<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:04.440> trick<00:03:04.739> with<00:03:04.920> biscuits<00:03:05.910> of

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
minutes and the trick with biscuits of

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.030 
minutes and the trick with biscuits of
course<00:03:06.269> is<00:03:06.420> they're<00:03:06.600> twice<00:03:06.870> cooked<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.920> they

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
course is they're twice cooked so they

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.890 
course is they're twice cooked so they
get<00:03:08.190> cooked<00:03:08.400> in<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.760> oven<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:09.090> course<00:03:09.329> but

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
get cooked in the oven of course but

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.270 
get cooked in the oven of course but
then<00:03:10.019> you<00:03:10.170> allow<00:03:10.530> them<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:10.890> finish<00:03:11.010> the

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
then you allow them to finish the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.120 
then you allow them to finish the
cooking<00:03:11.400> on<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.790> tray

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
cooking on the tray

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.590 
cooking on the tray
cause<00:03:12.340> they're<00:03:12.670> nice<00:03:12.880> and<00:03:12.910> soft<00:03:13.210> and<00:03:13.390> we'll

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
cause they're nice and soft and we'll

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.060 
cause they're nice and soft and we'll
say<00:03:13.750> that<00:03:13.930> when<00:03:14.050> we<00:03:14.170> bring<00:03:14.320> them<00:03:14.470> out<00:03:14.830> of<00:03:14.980> the

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
say that when we bring them out of the

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:36.430 
say that when we bring them out of the
oven

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.690 

so<00:03:37.440> we've<00:03:37.560> taken<00:03:37.740> them<00:03:37.980> out<00:03:38.070> of<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.220> oven<00:03:38.280> and

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
so we've taken them out of the oven and

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.730 
so we've taken them out of the oven and
