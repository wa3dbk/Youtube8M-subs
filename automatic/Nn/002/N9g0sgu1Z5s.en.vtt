this in half my favorite waiting it is

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.680 
this in half my favorite waiting it is
folding<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.580> half<00:00:26.670> like<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:29.269> and<00:00:30.269> then<00:00:32.600> open<00:00:33.600> it

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
folding in half like so and then open it

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.430 
folding in half like so and then open it
up<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.590> can<00:00:34.620> get<00:00:35.570> quite<00:00:36.570> simple<00:00:37.190> and<00:00:38.190> make

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
up and you can get quite simple and make

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:47.750 
up and you can get quite simple and make
packing<00:00:44.450> there<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.539> go<00:00:46.160> so<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.219> should<00:00:47.550> have

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
packing there you go so you should have

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.010 
packing there you go so you should have
to<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.450> five<00:00:49.230> pieces<00:00:49.710> now<00:00:50.780> so<00:00:51.780> what<00:00:51.870> you're

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
to a five pieces now so what you're

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.080 
to a five pieces now so what you're
going<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.199> be<00:00:52.350> going<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.620> put<00:00:52.800> one<00:00:53.039> but<00:00:53.610> two<00:00:53.969> one

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
going to be going to put one but two one

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.420 
going to be going to put one but two one
side<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.660> minute<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.949> then<00:00:56.100> with<00:00:56.280> this

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
side of the minute and then with this

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.619 
side of the minute and then with this
one<00:00:56.699> you're<00:00:57.090> going<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.539> fold<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:58.020> half<00:00:59.629> right

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
one you're going to fold in half right

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:10.910 
one you're going to fold in half right
so<00:01:03.619> and<00:01:04.619> then<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.820> half<00:01:06.090> again<00:01:09.619> so<00:01:10.619> then<00:01:10.799> you

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
so and then in half again so then you

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.929 
so and then in half again so then you
should<00:01:11.159> end<00:01:11.430> up<00:01:11.610> on<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> thin<00:01:12.180> strips<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.869> bow

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
should end up on the thin strips I bow

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.600 
should end up on the thin strips I bow
have<00:01:14.939> an<00:01:15.090> after<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.920> you<00:01:16.920> will<00:01:17.100> fold<00:01:17.369> it

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
have an after to that you will fold it

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.219 
have an after to that you will fold it
in<00:01:17.700> half<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:18.509> way<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:20.220> just<00:01:21.000> make<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.659> simple

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
in half this way and just make a simple

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.270 
in half this way and just make a simple
creaser<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.820> click<00:01:24.060> one<00:01:24.799> so<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.860> should<00:01:26.100> be<00:01:26.130> a

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
creaser just click one so it should be a

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.140 
creaser just click one so it should be a
piece<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.820> middle<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:28.380> then<00:01:28.939> fold<00:01:29.939> up<00:01:30.119> a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
piece in the middle and then fold up a

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.770 
piece in the middle and then fold up a
cow<00:01:30.680> and<00:01:31.680> then<00:01:31.829> fold<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.340> outwards<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.479> way

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
cow and then fold it outwards this way

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.679 
cow and then fold it outwards this way
so<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.500> side<00:01:35.040> gives<00:01:35.400> down<00:01:35.700> along<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.390> crease

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
so that side gives down along the crease

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.740 
so that side gives down along the crease
in<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> center<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:38.180> then<00:01:39.180> actually<00:01:39.420> make<00:01:39.720> a

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
in the center and then actually make a

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.710 
in the center and then actually make a
right<00:01:40.049> angle<00:01:40.619> there<00:01:43.130> okay<00:01:44.210> and<00:01:45.210> then<00:01:45.420> turn<00:01:45.689> it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
right angle there okay and then turn it

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.859 
right angle there okay and then turn it
over<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.470> do<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.549> same<00:01:47.790> thing<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.810> other

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
over and do the same thing on the other

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.149 
over and do the same thing on the other
side

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.859 

so<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.789> should<00:01:54.060> have<00:01:54.090> something<00:01:54.539> that

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
so you should have something that

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.239 
so you should have something that
resembles<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:56.749> okay<00:01:57.749> and<00:01:58.649> then<00:01:58.890> you're

00:01:59.239 --> 00:01:59.249 
resembles that okay and then you're

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:04.039 
resembles that okay and then you're
going<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.179> turn<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.659> over<00:02:01.520> so<00:02:02.520> some<00:02:03.479> back<00:02:03.719> side

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
going to turn it over so some back side

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.080 
going to turn it over so some back side
now<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:05.479> fold<00:02:06.479> lickspittle<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.340> makes<00:02:08.610> a

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
now and fold lickspittle so it makes a

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.800 
now and fold lickspittle so it makes a
square<00:02:09.780> there<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:11.220> must<00:02:11.879> be<00:02:12.090> as<00:02:12.180> close<00:02:12.480> to

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
square there that must be as close to

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.190 
square there that must be as close to
the<00:02:12.870> square<00:02:13.260> as<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:14.310> can<00:02:14.549> get<00:02:14.900> Eliza<00:02:15.900> the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
the square as you can get Eliza the

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.410 
the square as you can get Eliza the
points<00:02:16.739> on<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.010> ninja<00:02:17.340> star<00:02:17.580> will<00:02:18.060> be<00:02:18.090> very

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
points on the ninja star will be very

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.770 
points on the ninja star will be very
good<00:02:19.910> so<00:02:20.910> what<00:02:21.000> you're<00:02:21.120> going<00:02:21.269> to<00:02:21.360> do<00:02:21.569> then

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
good so what you're going to do then

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.860 
good so what you're going to do then
you're<00:02:22.049> going<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.319> fold<00:02:22.709> that<00:02:23.040> over<00:02:23.099> there<00:02:23.870> and

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
you're going to fold that over there and

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.180 
you're going to fold that over there and
pull<00:02:25.140> me<00:02:25.349> across<00:02:26.450> by<00:02:27.450> itself<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:28.920> end<00:02:29.129> up

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
pull me across by itself so you end up

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.229 
pull me across by itself so you end up
with<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.370> point<00:02:29.670> should<00:02:30.299> form<00:02:30.660> triangle<00:02:32.239> and

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
with a point should form triangle and

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.020 
with a point should form triangle and
then<00:02:33.390> just<00:02:33.599> follow<00:02:33.780> up<00:02:35.810> like<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.670> have<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.700> new

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
then just follow up like so have a new

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.770 
then just follow up like so have a new
the<00:02:39.209> same<00:02:39.480> with<00:02:39.900> Miss<00:02:40.140> Piggy<00:02:40.170> wet<00:02:41.269> so<00:02:42.269> fold<00:02:42.629> it

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
the same with Miss Piggy wet so fold it

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.130 
the same with Miss Piggy wet so fold it
up<00:02:42.959> so<00:02:43.799> it<00:02:43.890> makes<00:02:44.069> a<00:02:44.280> square<00:02:44.700> as<00:02:45.180> close<00:02:45.629> as<00:02:45.870> well

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
up so it makes a square as close as well

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:55.250 
up so it makes a square as close as well
you<00:02:46.290> can<00:02:46.500> get<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:49.099> and<00:02:50.099> then<00:02:50.959> across<00:02:53.000> like<00:02:54.260> so

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
you can get it and then across like so

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.069 
you can get it and then across like so
so<00:02:56.010> try<00:02:56.549> and<00:02:56.760> go<00:02:56.910> once<00:02:57.389> again<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.709> then<00:03:00.079> fold

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
so try and go once again and then fold

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.750 
so try and go once again and then fold
over<00:03:01.620> like<00:03:02.340> that<00:03:03.560> so<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:05.040> make<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.459> ninja

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
over like that so to make the ninja

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.199 
over like that so to make the ninja
stuff<00:03:06.030> you're<00:03:06.720> going<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:06.900> want<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.620> would<00:03:07.829> then

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
stuff you're going to want to would then

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.819 
stuff you're going to want to would then
so<00:03:09.209> basically<00:03:09.750> it<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.139> you<00:03:10.200> get<00:03:10.410> out<00:03:10.530> for<00:03:10.739> that

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
so basically it and you get out for that

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.360 
so basically it and you get out for that
one<00:03:11.130> side<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:12.030> get<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.389> other<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:13.370> five-piece

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
one side you get the other a five-piece

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.440 
one side you get the other a five-piece
and<00:03:15.410> do<00:03:16.410> exactly<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:17.040> same<00:03:17.099> thing<00:03:17.310> how<00:03:18.239> does

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
and do exactly the same thing how does

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.650 
and do exactly the same thing how does
one<00:03:18.660> do<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.109> then<00:03:19.319> you<00:03:20.099> fold<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.519> in<00:03:20.639> half<00:03:20.669> I

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:33.210 

like<00:03:24.660> in<00:03:24.900> half<00:03:25.139> again<00:03:28.549> like<00:03:29.549> so

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:41.730 

fold<00:03:34.220> it<00:03:34.430> again<00:03:34.490> that<00:03:35.360> way<00:03:36.220> I'm<00:03:37.220> done<00:03:38.170> download

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:49.800 

down<00:03:42.740> here<00:03:44.200> turn<00:03:45.200> over<00:03:46.090> so<00:03:47.090> zippleback<00:03:47.870> again

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
down here turn over so zippleback again

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.990 
down here turn over so zippleback again
fold<00:03:50.810> them<00:03:51.080> up<00:03:51.170> to<00:03:51.350> meet<00:03:51.500> squares<00:03:52.010> and<00:03:52.940> then

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
fold them up to meet squares and then

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.460 
fold them up to meet squares and then
fold<00:03:53.480> them<00:03:53.630> over<00:03:53.860> to<00:03:54.860> make<00:03:55.040> triangles<00:03:56.470> come

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
fold them over to make triangles come

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.880 
fold them over to make triangles come
back<00:03:57.680> up<00:03:57.890> again<00:03:58.870> so<00:03:59.870> do<00:04:00.080> I<00:04:00.110> get<00:04:00.470> up<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:00.770> other

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
back up again so do I get up the other

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.190 
back up again so do I get up the other
side<00:04:01.270> up<00:04:03.130> click<00:04:04.130> square<00:04:04.810> across<00:04:05.810> make

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
side up click square across make

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.350 
side up click square across make
triangle

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.670 

stop<00:04:13.050> fighting<00:04:13.260> with<00:04:13.620> me<00:04:14.270> so<00:04:15.290> now<00:04:16.290> you<00:04:16.350> should

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
stop fighting with me so now you should

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.000 
stop fighting with me so now you should
have<00:04:16.709> two<00:04:17.519> of<00:04:17.670> these<00:04:19.650> shape<00:04:21.950> so<00:04:22.950> two

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
have two of these shape so two

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.320 
have two of these shape so two
of<00:04:23.250> them<00:04:23.610> now<00:04:24.330> this<00:04:24.630> bit<00:04:25.050> is<00:04:25.290> the<00:04:25.620> tricky<00:04:25.920> bit

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
of them now this bit is the tricky bit

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:32.210 
of them now this bit is the tricky bit
so<00:04:27.330> exactly<00:04:27.840> zoom<00:04:28.380> in<00:04:28.590> a<00:04:28.620> bit<00:04:30.890> you<00:04:31.890> need<00:04:32.040> to

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
so exactly zoom in a bit you need to

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.850 
so exactly zoom in a bit you need to
watch<00:04:32.400> this<00:04:32.640> bet<00:04:32.940> very<00:04:33.540> carefully<00:04:35.570> and<00:04:36.570> so<00:04:36.860> you

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
watch this bet very carefully and so you

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.960 
watch this bet very carefully and so you
get<00:04:38.040> them<00:04:38.370> like<00:04:38.880> that<00:04:40.130> put<00:04:41.130> them<00:04:41.310> across<00:04:41.460> each

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
get them like that put them across each

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.310 
get them like that put them across each
other<00:04:44.240> so<00:04:45.240> they<00:04:45.300> kind<00:04:45.330> of<00:04:45.720> resembles<00:04:46.200> a

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
other so they kind of resembles a

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.810 
other so they kind of resembles a
swastika<00:04:48.560> yeah<00:04:49.560> would<00:04:50.160> you<00:04:50.280> give<00:04:50.430> up<00:04:50.520> talking

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
swastika yeah would you give up talking

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.480 
swastika yeah would you give up talking
about<00:04:51.230> no<00:04:52.230> it's<00:04:52.500> like<00:04:52.680> I<00:04:52.800> when<00:04:53.040> you<00:04:53.130> fold<00:04:53.340> it

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
about no it's like I when you fold it

00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:01.070 
about no it's like I when you fold it
down<00:04:54.380> or<00:04:57.800> across<00:04:59.180> and<00:05:00.180> then<00:05:00.300> this<00:05:00.480> last<00:05:00.720> one

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
down or across and then this last one

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.350 
down or across and then this last one
this<00:05:01.800> is<00:05:01.980> the<00:05:02.130> hardest<00:05:02.460> bit<00:05:02.730> find<00:05:03.090> every

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
this is the hardest bit find every

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.140 
this is the hardest bit find every
single<00:05:03.720> one<00:05:03.810> you're<00:05:03.990> gonna<00:05:04.230> make<00:05:05.000> some<00:05:06.000> of<00:05:06.090> the

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
single one you're gonna make some of the

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.450 
single one you're gonna make some of the
work<00:05:06.360> of<00:05:06.570> it<00:05:07.190> so<00:05:08.190> to<00:05:08.250> start<00:05:08.430> again<00:05:10.010> keep<00:05:11.010> across

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
work of it so to start again keep across

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:18.580 
work of it so to start again keep across
so<00:05:12.030> like<00:05:12.990> that<00:05:13.230> crops<00:05:13.800> kind<00:05:14.130> of<00:05:14.250> thing<00:05:14.720> down<00:05:16.160> or

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
so like that crops kind of thing down or

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.690 
so like that crops kind of thing down or
across<00:05:20.120> and<00:05:21.120> this<00:05:21.330> should<00:05:21.630> work<00:05:22.130> you<00:05:23.130> look

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
across and this should work you look

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.290 
across and this should work you look
like<00:05:25.040> and<00:05:26.040> then<00:05:26.070> this<00:05:26.400> bet<00:05:26.700> you've<00:05:26.910> got<00:05:26.940> to

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
like and then this bet you've got to

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.350 
like and then this bet you've got to
talk<00:05:27.979> into<00:05:28.979> the<00:05:29.880> first<00:05:30.300> one<00:05:30.840> you<00:05:31.140> did<00:05:32.360> this

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
talk into the first one you did this

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.980 
talk into the first one you did this
like<00:05:33.990> say<00:05:34.320> is<00:05:35.040> the<00:05:35.310> hardest<00:05:35.820> and<00:05:36.270> we'll<00:05:37.280> take

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
like say is the hardest and we'll take

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.810 
like say is the hardest and we'll take
some<00:05:39.990> this<00:05:40.229> time<00:05:40.470> to<00:05:40.620> do<00:05:40.740> sometimes<00:05:41.250> your<00:05:41.460> drug

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
some this time to do sometimes your drug

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.240 
some this time to do sometimes your drug
two<00:05:42.060> or<00:05:42.150> three<00:05:42.360> goes<00:05:42.600> it<00:05:42.930> sometimes<00:05:43.919> it<00:05:44.070> works

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
two or three goes it sometimes it works

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:50.270 
two or three goes it sometimes it works
straight<00:05:44.610> down<00:05:44.820> straight<00:05:45.419> away

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.550 

okay<00:05:51.510> that's<00:05:52.510> why<00:05:52.810> I'm<00:05:52.870> up<00:05:53.140> it's<00:05:53.350> a<00:05:53.440> bit

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
okay that's why I'm up it's a bit

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.740 
okay that's why I'm up it's a bit
creased<00:05:53.830> exactly<00:05:54.430> so<00:05:54.670> if<00:05:55.090> you<00:05:55.240> have<00:05:55.330> to<00:05:55.570> do<00:05:55.630> it

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
creased exactly so if you have to do it

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.960 
creased exactly so if you have to do it
few<00:05:55.990> times<00:05:56.130> you<00:05:57.130> make<00:05:57.310> sure<00:05:57.460> you<00:05:57.610> hold<00:05:57.760> it

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
few times you make sure you hold it

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:04.220 
few times you make sure you hold it
straight<00:05:58.530> it<00:05:59.530> shouldn't<00:05:59.950> be<00:06:00.130> okay<00:06:02.790> wrong<00:06:03.790> way

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 
straight it shouldn't be okay wrong way

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:10.340 
straight it shouldn't be okay wrong way
