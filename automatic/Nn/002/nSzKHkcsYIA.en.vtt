 hello snail and snail and we are 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.450
 here in a new video of jeta five 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.470
 holes I come to teach weird colors 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.020
 strange colors that in the game we 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.689
 it comes but we can do it 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:35.239
 well we started for it we get 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.239
 the saints and let's start 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.230
 for example let's put a chrome 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.660
 with color there are many subscribers 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.270
 that tell me how to put that color in 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.180
 my cars as easily give you 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.700
 first to chrome and once we have 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.430
 the chromed we have to go to the color of the 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.370
 crepe maybe with what you have the believes 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.190
 it will be green yellow red or orange by 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.559
 example now has it in green as 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.369
 you see let's go out is a green chrome 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.369
 lets go see it 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.920
 let's put it on the sun 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.570
 if it gives in a way it looks like silver 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.150
 and if it was from another it looks green 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.260
 good 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.260
 next color 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.790
 let's do it 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.900
 the next color we are going to make a 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:39.450
 matte color with a face do as now what 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:42.070
 We will see for example let's paintings worth 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.990
 once we enter the paintings we go 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.990
 to mate for example let's catch 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.220
 bird 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.220
 this is the a non-stop faces 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.670
 butts are very good a lilac and 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.250
 now we have to go to metallized him 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.799
 We give metallized we are here but not 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.560
 we buy nothing now we give the circle 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.539
 again to the circle again circle and 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.980
 we are going to register and we buy a 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:14.200
 license plate we give to the painting circle 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:17.019
 color the main one and now we give to 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.450
 pearly and as you will see let me in 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.989
 pearly 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.360
 and we are going to catch a white frost or 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:29.970
 look at the red torino looks super nice 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:32.310
 the car that is already you and taking 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.069
 the colors that you want and so 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.560
 you will see how the cars are 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.599
 for example let's put a yellow 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.370
 race is also beautiful we are going to 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.370
 see it in the sun to see how it looks 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.980
 as you can see the color that is left is 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:58.420
 spectacular the truth 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:01.090
 It looks super nice, let's go 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.650
 to make the last color 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.650
 we get in and 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.450
 let's make another color 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.590
 let's paint 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:23.709
 main color for example other color 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.709
 mate but base a color 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.130
 orange orange goes from sybase tomato the 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.560
 colour 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.320
 and if we go to pearl it tells us that this 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.970
 color you can not put nacreous not 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:41.130
 nothing happens we get into the metallic 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.680
 we are here a little while we give to 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.610
 circle again the circle again the 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.320
 circle we are going to enroll we buy 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.620
 a license plate whether you 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.800
 you want we give you to work circle 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:04:00.480
 Now we are going to paint main color and 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:05.000
 pearly and as you see and it leaves me good 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.000
 for now let's put in this orange 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.760
 red torino is not appreciated to see another 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.760
 colour 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.709
 let's put another color that is left without 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.709
 More striking 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.310
 for example this is a tone 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.539
 whitish to the orange color that remains 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.539
 very very nice the truth 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.870
 let's take a 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.220
 cream color was something nice that was 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.220
 as well 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.110
 Well, let's choose what I know 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.860
 This is a reddish color if you give 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.860
 count to change the tonality 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:04.160
 in this color it is not appreciated much but 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.230
 in other colors and earlier you have to 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.840
 appreciate on the nose is also can be 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:12.230
 do with the ac with the metallic color 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:15.800
 for example let's take a black steel 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:18.320
 polished we give it to go pearly 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.750
 As you can see, it does not leave us but we give 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.750
 buy license plate we buy the license plate 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.260
 we are not going to paint 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.610
 and then we 're going to pearl 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.360
 lets us know that step has been taken care of 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.610
 to go to 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.930
 we have bought the metallic one we have to 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:42.289
 go now to metalized be here a while 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.220
 give the circle circle circle 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:46.700
 enrollment 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.140
 and here he bought some license plates 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.590
 and once we have purchased license plate 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:55.710
 with a painting and we're going to pearl 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:58.360
 and now if he leaves us and as you can see 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:01.240

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.120
