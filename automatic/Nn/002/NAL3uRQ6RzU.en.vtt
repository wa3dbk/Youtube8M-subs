00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
a perfect challenge a lot of the

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.590 
a perfect challenge a lot of the
insights<00:00:33.950> were<00:00:34.950> based<00:00:35.489> around<00:00:35.700> his<00:00:36.210> desire<00:00:36.570> to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
insights were based around his desire to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.810 
insights were based around his desire to
become<00:00:36.840> more<00:00:37.200> explosive<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.309> one<00:00:38.489> thing<00:00:38.670> he

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
become more explosive the one thing he

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.060 
become more explosive the one thing he
said<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.059> us<00:00:39.239> early<00:00:40.110> on<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.500> meeting<00:00:40.860> was

if<00:00:41.399> my<00:00:41.730> arch<00:00:41.969> isn't<00:00:42.300> supported<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.899> don't<00:00:43.140> feel

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
if my arch isn't supported I don't feel

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.779 
if my arch isn't supported I don't feel
like<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.500> can<00:00:43.559> be<00:00:43.800> explosive<00:00:44.070> off<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.579> line

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
like I can be explosive off the line

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.639 
like I can be explosive off the line
what<00:00:45.450> we<00:00:45.510> took<00:00:45.660> away<00:00:45.899> from<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.230> as<00:00:46.440> well

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
what we took away from that as well

what we took away from that as well
let's<00:00:46.950> give<00:00:47.100> Kelvin<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.640> strapping<00:00:48.149> system

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
let's give Kelvin the strapping system

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.600 
let's give Kelvin the strapping system
as<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:49.079> hold<00:00:49.410> tension<00:00:49.710> on<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> strap<00:00:50.340> it

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
as you hold tension on the strap it

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.939 
as you hold tension on the strap it
grabs<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.270> lifts<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> arch<00:00:51.750> but<00:00:52.590> then<00:00:52.739> as<00:00:52.860> you

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
grabs and lifts the arch but then as you

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.590 
grabs and lifts the arch but then as you
pull<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.280> across<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.820> not<00:00:53.969> only<00:00:54.120> locks<00:00:54.420> the

foot down side to side but it also pulls
