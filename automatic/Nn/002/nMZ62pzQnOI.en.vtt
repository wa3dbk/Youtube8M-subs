00:00:02.794 --> 00:00:04.370
 Certificate of the Holy Quran. 

00:00:04.728 --> 00:00:06.574
 Several texts in the Holy Quran, 

00:00:06.785 --> 00:00:08.629
 It does not make sense, 

00:00:08.736 --> 00:00:13.604
 If there is a distortion in the text itself: 

00:00:13.838 --> 00:00:15.122
 For example, 

00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:18.250
 O People of the Book! It has been said in Surat Al-Maida, 

00:00:18.344 --> 00:00:19.565
 Aya 68, 

00:00:19.639 --> 00:00:20.723
 O People of the Book! 

00:00:20.793 --> 00:00:22.432
 You are not a thing, 

00:00:22.576 --> 00:00:24.468
 Until you establish the Torah, 

00:00:24.604 --> 00:00:25.395
 The Gospel, 

00:00:25.508 --> 00:00:29.154
 And what is revealed to you from your Lord, 

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:31.956
 This is meaningless, 

00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:33.426
 If there is, 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.870
 Distortion of the word, 

00:00:37.428 --> 00:00:40.854
 In verse 47 of Surat Al-Maida we read 

00:00:40.932 --> 00:00:43.405
 And to rule the people of the Gospel 

00:00:43.483 --> 00:00:47.116
 As God revealed it. 

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:48.898
 This induction, 

00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:50.518
 It is not possible, 

00:00:50.677 --> 00:00:53.405
 If the text is distorted, 

00:00:53.515 --> 00:00:55.574
 ... We read in Surat Yunus, 

00:00:55.635 --> 00:00:57.444
 Aya 94, 

00:00:57.543 --> 00:00:58.382
 If you are, 

00:00:58.446 --> 00:00:59.820
 (Here he talks about Muhammad (PBUH) 

00:00:59.884 --> 00:01:03.893
 In doubt of what we have revealed to you, 

00:01:04.058 --> 00:01:08.379
 Ask those who read the book before you, 

00:01:08.458 --> 00:01:09.820
 People of the Book. 

00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:10.595
 that, 

00:01:10.676 --> 00:01:14.268
 There was a text in the hands of the people of the Book 

00:01:14.338 --> 00:01:17.600
 Which character is not reliable at all, 

00:01:17.724 --> 00:01:18.817
 This induction, 

00:01:18.928 --> 00:01:21.240
 Does not have any meaning, 

00:01:21.344 --> 00:01:22.382
 In any case. 

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:25.372
 The Koran itself documents that, 

00:01:25.513 --> 00:01:28.061
 People can recite the meaning, 

00:01:28.146 --> 00:01:30.926
 They can not really change it, 

00:01:30.984 --> 00:01:33.935
 And cause him to lose ... 

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:37.088
 He says in Surat Yunus, verse 64, 

00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:41.846
 Do not switch to the words of God, 

00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:44.888
 That is a great win 

00:01:51.973 --> 00:01:54.701
 This is a very strong text, 

00:01:54.806 --> 00:01:55.585
 he says to us, 

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:57.399
 That no change, 

00:01:57.504 --> 00:01:58.987
 Not a possibility, 

00:01:59.081 --> 00:02:01.670
 To change the words of God. 

00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:03.906
 Since the original, 

00:02:03.994 --> 00:02:05.234
 The Torah, 

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:06.418
 Zubour, 

00:02:06.495 --> 00:02:07.919
 The Gospel, 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.930
 They say, 

00:02:09.026 --> 00:02:12.840
 In the Quran as the Word of God, 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.036
 If as the Quran must be preserved and lasting forever, 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.285
 Because they both have the same status. 

00:02:20.376 --> 00:02:21.705
 Pay attention to what he says, 

00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:23.622
 This is very, very important, 

00:02:23.713 --> 00:02:24.969
 My friends., 

00:02:25.091 --> 00:02:30.852
 He says that this is God's great victory. 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:32.356
 He tells us clearly, 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:35.339
 this is the supreme triumph 

00:02:35.444 --> 00:02:36.459
 Which means, 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.709
 The greatest, 

00:02:38.771 --> 00:02:40.737
 Great victory, 

00:02:40.842 --> 00:02:42.487
 God's victory, 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:44.386
 He is capable of that, 

00:02:44.493 --> 00:02:48.132
 To save his word.
