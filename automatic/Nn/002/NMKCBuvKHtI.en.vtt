00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.860
 welcome to another 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.900
 series criticism here on the film factory 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.130
 when a player brings out a series 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.410
 then this is for me directly 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.100
 a good sign and silicon valley is 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.360
 from age bio 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.050
 what is the comedy series about ? 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.800
 Richard Hendrix is ​​a 26-year-old 

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.380
 Software developer in Silicon Valley 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.150
 in sam francis I have to go there 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.039
 companies frolic in things computer 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.140
 technology to say that in his 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.510
 Richard works one-time 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.910
 called piper a project where you 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.829
 mp3s can upload to their similarity 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.749
 with existing songs 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.210
 to be analyzed in principle 

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:39.219
 project that hardly anyone cares 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.530
 and not excited but still 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:44.079
 Two big investors are paying attention 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.969
 why in the coaching process has richard 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.920
 an algorithm that writes it 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.499
 creates all possible files on one 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.839
 not yet achievable low 

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:54.519
 size to compress how awesome its 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.379
 Achievement is first noticed 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.089
 when the two billionaires pointed him out 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.709
 to point out the one offers them first 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.329
 three million dollars and the patent 

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:03.760
 for it to buy and even with it 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.620
 the other make $ 200,000 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.480
 but this will establish a company and 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.010
 can establish his invention 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.870
 Silicon Valley is about life 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.060
 from richard our very special 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.070
 friends make their adventures in silicon 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.050
 Valley and the daily problems of 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.480
 Software developers come without 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.950
 end jokes and scores on known 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.470
 Companies like Apple Google and Microsoft 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.180
 the whole has the character of a satire 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.130
 At the same time you get an insight into that 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.440
 live by rich software developers 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.080
 and at the same time patterns are formed many 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.090
 talented intelligent successful 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.430
 but programmers do not have any 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.200
 clearly already seen social skills 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.110
 sounds like the best same as big bang 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.880
 theory or no by no means 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.100
 So first silicon valley no live 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.720
 dirt and no such high density 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.940
 jokes are so much more isolated 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.340
 scattered and much rarer for it 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.080
 but as good as any pointe in hits 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.970
 it's often absurd 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.830
 create situation as your time 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.500
 need to unfold the joke 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.210
 Silicon Valley just has more substance 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.190
 as a big bang theory and a lot 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.750
 more detailed figures and edge bio 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.690
 typically also a higher production 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.939
 value that means more locations better 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.470
 more creative camera work and also one 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:14.510
 damn good cut what i quite quite 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.710
 Priority was a series is that too 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.380
 if here and there a few small things 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.090
 not 100 percent exactly one notices 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.200
 that was a bit geflunkert and 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.120
 that dramaturgy a few 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.310
 little things are invented cues 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.190
 white score remains everything anyway 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.020
 fairly factual and correct as soon as it does 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.130
 something technical would be about processes 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.930
 in programming or in the 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.750
 company management remains the series 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.130
 Precisely there is no techno barbel so 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.600
 techno bärbel is if you just 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.980
 scientific words back and forth 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.360
 Throws it sounds like you would 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.830
 just about a technological 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.300
 speak challenging topic 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.220
 and we have that at Silicon Valley 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.740
 That's not a big thing 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.030
 performance of showrunner mike judge and 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.950
 this is no unknown 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.170
 that's the head behind beavis 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.880
 and butthead and that at least in the 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.709
 first half extremely funny and 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.540
 successful movie eat your pussy in 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.370
 Silicon Valley is nothing down 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.470
 so dimmed the last spectator 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.090
 understands no the show requires of 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.950
 spectator that he thinks with 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.690
 Actors are fantastic the 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.520
 figurines are only on the one on the other 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.590
 At first glance, this is cliché 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.780
 Comedic timing is perfect and 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.660
 at the same time the action is at the latest 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.980
 starting from three I am quite thrilling myself 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.480
 the jay miller knew one of the 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.610
 main actor already about diverse 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.620
 stands appearances of youtube and makes 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.690
 them not at all times but risks so 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.970
 I love him and his rally 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.330
 strangely charismatic asshole 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.100
 role 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.510
 great you also feel that the 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.519
 main actor for years 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.190
 From early stand times from Chicago 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.260
 because he knows a wonderful chemistry 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.970
 among themselves is silicon valley gets 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.080
 at least the first season of mine 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.110
 two days not seen 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.030
 strong 9 out of 10 points I'm going to 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.470
 definitely not scale 2 and watch 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.080
 do not look forward to a third 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.610
 Season planned for 2016 is the first 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.980
 Season has anyway only eight following 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.420
 30 minutes and the second ten follow 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.700
 Silicon Valley is just scary 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.260
 successful satire but also completely 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.180
 certainly not for everyone but 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.820
 my classic underdog story likes 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.560
 something for computers and the world 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.630
 interested in it and bock on 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.650
 damn funny gags and insane 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.840
 well- embodied figures within 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.670
 a very intelligent act 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.280
 a lot is demanded then 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.199
 silicon valley just the right organic 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.489
 has outdone itself again 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.199
 I made a criticism about 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.750
 arthur ashe the movie to 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:26.520
 eponymous tv series takes place here 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.380
 whether I like it as well 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.240
 has risk rallying in your once 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.860
 right up here I hope we can 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.440
 See you again next time 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.770
 the film factory also watched the film 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.320
 movie theater 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.320
 until next time with the rp cinema
