 new flight school tfc out and for that 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.310
 you just need a lot of money for that 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.840
 All new planes will be on 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.300
 each cost a lot and if one 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.769
 new dlc that's because it takes a while 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.270
 bit to get used again to the money 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.700
 can succeed and that's why I would like everyone 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.320
 recommend this view again today 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.270
 use a lot of money too 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.100
 erklatschen and tomorrow simply 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.059
 to beat out for all the objects that 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.190
 you want to have 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.840
 At the beginning , a buddy puts you in one 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.120
 meeting only for players with invitation 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.219
 and then you invite him into yours 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.500
 garage now it is important that yours 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.360
 vehicle with which he performs the trick 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.910
 at the far left in the garage 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.949
 next to the blue spot where you have the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.719
 Position of the vehicles in the garage 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.579
 furthermore it came with me it is just the 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.899
 panther right there must be the vehicle 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.610
 stand and I will be on the 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.100
 panthers recommend this one again 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.979
 man with her the vehicle against 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.909
 a fireplace rebellion swaps and 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.850
 Duplicated and gets directly at the end 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.229
 not the money the vehicle is worth 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.390
 then the money that the tuning utensils 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.009
 is worth and this panto was the rope 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.540
 the vehicle that and most online 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.159
 must do even more than in the bugatti 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.710
 and therefore seeks to get with him 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.040
 another 50,000 more than anyone 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.689
 other vehicle must spot the spot 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.340
 put her on the garage by the 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.170
 trick by fit now turns your 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.090
 buddy next to your vehicle with the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.070
 want to make impression and goes into this 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.689
 message purely he does it by himself 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.240
 an offline character is trevor 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.820
 michael or franklin chooses which 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.380
 he does not care about that as long as he is at this 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.140
 message in it is easy 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.119
 fast in the playstation or in the 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.430
 xbox sound from these goes directly afterwards 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.829
 back out now it may be yours 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.700
 Buddy at this point Feelings and yourself 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.500
 can not move 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.320
 that could be someone in a blue one 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.240
 circle enters the hunter once against 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.219
 he exchanges an empty spot 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.530
 next to it and then again 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.690
 is sitting down to the old spot now 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.280
 your buddy of these put away 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.569
 pushed to make room now can 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.060
 he moves normally again 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.010
 is that the case then you go with yours 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.530
 Mobile now easy in the internet and 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.450
 2 Karin Rebell really buys himself 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.950
 only with two make it more 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.510
 At the beginning you can not do that 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.249
 wait until two then wait 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.139
 and then directly again with 2 1 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:31.120
 because you have to do the vehicles 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.409
 replace as long as you have not 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.540
 are delivered and you buy now 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:36.129
 Ten vehicles then you can not get that 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.659
 out after two minutes only way 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.349
 the vehicles already in the garage 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:41.079
 in it 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.879
 did you buy 2 karin rebells? 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.249
 then they will be right in theirs 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.719
 garage delivered to the empty spots the 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:48.700
 to be here with me the 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:50.310
 both of them are right next to the panto 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.510
 already located 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.010
 Now you have to contribute something to them 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.930
 the next step is through film 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.939
 before the vehicle in your garage 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.919
 it appeared a buddy turns up 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:01.659
 the garage door of Porto pushes the 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:03.819
 whole time triangle to try the 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.590
 open the door to change the vehicle 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.019
 is delivered against the rebels and 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.959
 then put yourself in the vehicle 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.870
 Now you're leaving the garage 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.699
 out and then right back into the 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.829
 garage in and that's it 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:20.139
 You have duplicated the vehicle now 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.549
 you have the panto twice in the one 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.959
 he just sat in it is now 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.629
 but he will be right back 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.579
 so it's all in the lot 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.620
 only makes her whole again with the 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.329
 second career bella buddy had 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.549
 of course, three experts around 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.810
 Do as try in the car 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.220
 It must come eventually 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.139
 stop three acts of spam again 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.489
 namely then if you in the vehicle 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.349
 you want to see I'm just coming 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.329
 not on the driver is still there 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.159
 triangle has continued to press like 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.109
 he just has to stop that 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.739
 if you try purely in the vehicle- 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.389
 get 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.040
 and now it was also with this vehicle 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.959
 just jump back out of the garage 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.939
 out right now the game is still thinking there 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.250
 is a karen rebels in there but if 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:58.629
 you reinfeldt then has the game 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.699
 realized that the vehicle is a 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.409
 panthers and then it will be the same 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:04.840
 the third panto appear 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.829
 Now you could have vehicle three times 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.079
 Of course, at the beginning of the 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.150
 sell vehicles or he does that 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:12.969
 just trick your garage so often 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.500
 but I am full of this vehicle 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:16.120
 show you only the whole thing works 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.229
 that's why I will not do that now 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.940
 it will take just too long 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.430
 In any case, I will only with the 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.440
 left vehicle in the box 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.419
 when is that usually yours? 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.800
 city vehicle the vehicle was still there 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.250
 the highest selling price 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.440
 you saw it's the vehicle 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.940
 Worth $ 230,000 and the vehicle that 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.860
 I would not sell that I will 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.930
 keep this one trick 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.270
 The wink can be done again 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.460
 with the vehicle also back to the ls 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.530
 customs now have as said 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.750
 found out what of three vehicles 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.129
 our start vehicle was and the others 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.139
 Of course, the vehicles are there 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:51.879
 duplicate version and catch with them 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.069
 now just to the nearest ls 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:57.280
 customs and can knock them there 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:59.560
 We'll get 180 to 200,000 for that 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.000
 dollar when the vehicles are fully on 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.190
 us and that is good in any case 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.080
 money what you can do with it 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.030
 that 's it from this tutorial 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.919
 you like it and you 're gonna do some golfing 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.699
 thumb up there you are out people

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:30.199
 osbournes with permanent faction 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.199
 the 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:38.889
 the little boy is just what the boys are 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:38.889
 I am still young
