00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
play in the plastic kind of makes it

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.410

feel a little cheap broke rotating gear
cups<00:02:56.690> don't<00:02:56.870> know<00:02:57.020> why<00:02:57.140> they<00:02:57.290> rotate<00:02:57.620> that<00:02:57.950> way

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
cups don't know why they rotate that way

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.920 
cups don't know why they rotate that way
I<00:02:58.550> figured<00:02:59.150> if<00:02:59.240> I<00:02:59.300> was<00:02:59.420> wearing<00:02:59.570> them<00:02:59.750> like

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
I figured if I was wearing them like

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.660 
I figured if I was wearing them like
this<00:03:00.140> I'd<00:03:00.410> want<00:03:00.709> them<00:03:00.800> to<00:03:00.950> rotate<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.459> other

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
this I'd want them to rotate the other

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.540 
this I'd want them to rotate the other
way<00:03:01.959> that's<00:03:02.959> probably<00:03:03.080> just<00:03:03.350> for<00:03:03.590> for

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
way that's probably just for for

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.650 
way that's probably just for for
traveling<00:03:05.030> most<00:03:05.450> likely<00:03:05.810> so<00:03:06.550> on<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:08.090> cable

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
traveling most likely so on the cable

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.030 
traveling most likely so on the cable
right<00:03:08.750> there<00:03:08.959> we<00:03:09.230> have<00:03:09.260> volume<00:03:09.560> up<00:03:09.830> volume

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
right there we have volume up volume

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.240 
right there we have volume up volume
down<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.390> I<00:03:11.900> guess<00:03:12.440> that's<00:03:12.650> a<00:03:12.740> my<00:03:12.920> commute

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
down and the I guess that's a my commute

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.400 
down and the I guess that's a my commute
at<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.270> other<00:03:14.420> end<00:03:14.600> of<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.810> nine<00:03:14.959> foot<00:03:15.200> cable

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
at the other end of the nine foot cable

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.130 
at the other end of the nine foot cable
boom<00:03:16.310> we<00:03:16.580> got<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:16.790> USB<00:03:17.090> so<00:03:17.870> there's<00:03:18.050> some

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
boom we got the USB so there's some

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.199 
boom we got the USB so there's some
software<00:03:18.530> on<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.680> website<00:03:19.100> I'm<00:03:20.030> gonna

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
software on the website I'm gonna

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.540 
software on the website I'm gonna
install<00:03:20.390> it<00:03:20.570> I'm<00:03:21.080> gonna<00:03:21.230> do<00:03:21.320> some<00:03:21.470> gaming<00:03:21.709> let

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
install it I'm gonna do some gaming let

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.040 
install it I'm gonna do some gaming let
me<00:03:22.670> get<00:03:22.820> back<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:23.239> guys<00:03:23.360> with<00:03:23.420> a<00:03:23.600> mic<00:03:23.810> test

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
me get back to you guys with a mic test

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.370 
me get back to you guys with a mic test
and<00:03:24.200> a<00:03:24.260> reveal<00:03:24.500> hang<00:03:24.769> tight

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
and a reveal hang tight

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.530 
and a reveal hang tight
all<00:03:26.980> right<00:03:27.100> so<00:03:27.250> this<00:03:27.340> is<00:03:27.490> the<00:03:27.550> part<00:03:27.760> where<00:03:28.510> I

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
all right so this is the part where I

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.000 
all right so this is the part where I
let<00:03:28.720> you<00:03:28.810> kind<00:03:28.960> of<00:03:29.050> hear<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.290> mic<00:03:29.470> I'm<00:03:29.830> also

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
let you kind of hear the mic I'm also

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.950 
let you kind of hear the mic I'm also
going<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.220> show<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:30.400> software<00:03:30.790> at<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.120> same

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
going to show you software at the same

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.020 
going to show you software at the same
time<00:03:32.680> so<00:03:33.070> this<00:03:33.520> kind<00:03:33.700> of<00:03:33.760> gives<00:03:33.880> you<00:03:33.910> an<00:03:34.000> idea

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
time so this kind of gives you an idea

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.610
