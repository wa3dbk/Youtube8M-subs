almost about tricolor yeah that is the

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.140 
almost about tricolor yeah that is the
hardest<00:00:14.700> one<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.410> answer<00:00:16.410> it's<00:00:17.220> it's<00:00:17.699> really

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
hardest one to answer it's it's really

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.240 
hardest one to answer it's it's really
weird<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.779> think<00:00:19.740> it's<00:00:19.859> just<00:00:19.920> about<00:00:20.189> if<00:00:22.250> it's

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
weird I think it's just about if it's

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.720 
weird I think it's just about if it's
about<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> feeling<00:00:24.800> of<00:00:25.800> wanting<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.519> be

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
about a feeling of wanting to be

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.169 
about a feeling of wanting to be
inspired<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.720> suppose<00:00:28.310> or<00:00:29.310> enjoying<00:00:29.880> being

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
inspired I suppose or enjoying being

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.680 
inspired I suppose or enjoying being
inspired<00:00:30.599> by<00:00:30.810> just<00:00:31.170> little<00:00:31.650> everyday<00:00:32.009> things

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 
inspired by just little everyday things

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.340 
inspired by just little everyday things
like<00:00:33.690> good<00:00:33.989> food<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:35.780> think<00:00:36.780> part<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.290> was

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
like good food I think part of it was

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.270 
like good food I think part of it was
like<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> celebration<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.640> multi-culture<00:00:40.129> if<00:00:41.129> I

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
like a celebration of multi-culture if I

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.709 
like a celebration of multi-culture if I
have<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.550> articulate<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.570> way<00:00:42.690> that's

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
have to articulate it in a way that's

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.029 
have to articulate it in a way that's
understandable<00:00:43.469> like<00:00:44.210> just<00:00:45.530> the<00:00:46.530> difference

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
understandable like just the difference

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.760 
understandable like just the difference
that<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:48.030> color<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.840> difference<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:49.379> bring

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
that the color that difference can bring

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.939 
that the color that difference can bring
to<00:00:50.129> your<00:00:50.850> life<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.449> it's<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.410> context<00:00:52.890> of

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
to your life and it's in the context of

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.410 
to your life and it's in the context of
Australia<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.489> suppose<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:54.030> i<00:00:54.090> think<00:00:54.300> it's

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
Australia I suppose but i think it's

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.869 
Australia I suppose but i think it's
valid<00:00:54.750> anywhere<00:00:55.110> else<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:56.280> particularly

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
valid anywhere else like we particularly

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.840 
valid anywhere else like we particularly
come<00:00:57.480> from<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.750> pretty<00:00:57.930> young<00:00:58.850> racist

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
come from a pretty young racist

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.889 
come from a pretty young racist
background<00:01:00.449> having<00:01:00.750> been<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:02.899> white

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
background having been in a white

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.550 
background having been in a white
country<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:05.510> colonial<00:01:06.510> nation<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.110> middle

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
country of colonial nation in the middle

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.780 
country of colonial nation in the middle
of<00:01:07.650> asia<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:08.580> had<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> more<00:01:09.210> acute<00:01:10.049> fear<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
of asia we had a more acute fear of the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.080 
of asia we had a more acute fear of the
other<00:01:12.000> than<00:01:12.510> perhaps<00:01:13.430> Europeans<00:01:14.430> did<00:01:14.580> because

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
other than perhaps Europeans did because

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.260 
other than perhaps Europeans did because
we<00:01:16.049> really<00:01:16.409> were<00:01:16.590> alone<00:01:17.070> down<00:01:17.580> there<00:01:17.610> as<00:01:18.030> white

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
we really were alone down there as white

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.330 
we really were alone down there as white
Australians<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.320> we<00:01:19.409> had<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.650> policy

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
Australians and so we had this policy

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.469 
Australians and so we had this policy
called<00:01:20.549> why<00:01:20.790> does<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.180> White<00:01:21.360> Australia

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
called why does the White Australia

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.050 
called why does the White Australia
Policy<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.770> was<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:23.100> probably<00:01:23.759> until<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
Policy that was for probably until the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.530 
Policy that was for probably until the
60s<00:01:24.810> or<00:01:24.900> 70s<00:01:24.960> yeah<00:01:25.799> really<00:01:26.130> quite<00:01:26.549> late<00:01:26.850> even

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
60s or 70s yeah really quite late even

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.359 
60s or 70s yeah really quite late even
Britain<00:01:27.990> was<00:01:28.170> like<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.829> guys<00:01:28.979> have<00:01:29.189> got<00:01:29.340> to

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
Britain was like you guys have got to

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.719 
Britain was like you guys have got to
stop<00:01:29.610> being<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:29.880> racist<00:01:30.180> yeah<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:30.869> did<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.729> and

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
stop being so racist yeah we did and and

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.899 
stop being so racist yeah we did and and
I<00:01:33.030> think<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:34.290> still<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.790> know

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
I think that still is a like you know

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.399 
I think that still is a like you know
there<00:01:36.119> was<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.270> fear<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.600> an<00:01:36.780> Asian<00:01:37.140> invasion

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
there was a fear of an Asian invasion

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.030 
there was a fear of an Asian invasion
and<00:01:37.829> yet<00:01:38.040> being<00:01:38.759> young<00:01:39.000> people<00:01:39.450> now<00:01:39.860> we<00:01:40.860> can

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
and yet being young people now we can

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.630 
and yet being young people now we can
see<00:01:41.280> how<00:01:42.829> much<00:01:44.000> Asians<00:01:45.000> or<00:01:45.479> any<00:01:46.049> other

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
see how much Asians or any other

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.249 
see how much Asians or any other
immigrant<00:01:47.640> group<00:01:47.939> have<00:01:48.299> added<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.229> our

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
immigrant group have added to our

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.399 
immigrant group have added to our
culture<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:49.920> how<00:01:50.009> boring<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.610> would<00:01:50.759> be<00:01:51.200> if<00:01:52.200> it

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
culture and how boring it would be if it

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.109 
culture and how boring it would be if it
didn't<00:01:52.680> have<00:01:52.829> those<00:01:53.040> people<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:54.030> think

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
didn't have those people and I think

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.060 
didn't have those people and I think
they're<00:01:54.390> part<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:54.990> our<00:01:55.170> identity<00:01:55.229> now<00:01:55.829> yeah

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
they're part of our identity now yeah

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.609 
they're part of our identity now yeah
particularly<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.600> everyday<00:01:58.020> like<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
particularly just the everyday like the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.600 
particularly just the everyday like the
food<00:01:59.210> music<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:01.049> it's<00:02:01.530> just<00:02:01.770> like<00:02:01.799> about<00:02:02.189> kind

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
food music it it's just like about kind

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.350 
food music it it's just like about kind
of<00:02:02.700> being<00:02:02.939> what<00:02:03.240> one<00:02:03.630> world

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
of being what one world

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.490 
of being what one world
stead<00:02:04.570> of<00:02:05.100> fearful<00:02:06.100> little<00:02:06.550> nations<00:02:07.540> but<00:02:07.840> then

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
stead of fearful little nations but then

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.660 
stead of fearful little nations but then
also<00:02:10.020> that's<00:02:11.020> a<00:02:11.350> kind<00:02:11.860> of<00:02:12.010> bigger<00:02:12.250> picture

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
also that's a kind of bigger picture

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.810 
also that's a kind of bigger picture
vision<00:02:13.060> of<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:13.330> it's<00:02:13.450> like<00:02:13.600> also<00:02:13.960> about<00:02:14.820> the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
vision of it it's like also about the

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.120 
vision of it it's like also about the
individual<00:02:16.510> being<00:02:16.810> not<00:02:17.050> so<00:02:17.080> scared<00:02:17.830> of<00:02:17.980> the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
individual being not so scared of the

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.850 
individual being not so scared of the

like<00:04:17.299> the<00:04:17.419> video<00:04:17.690> it's<00:04:17.840> quite<00:04:18.109> simple<00:04:18.380> but

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
like the video it's quite simple but

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.270 
like the video it's quite simple but
it's<00:04:18.880> simple<00:04:19.880> but<00:04:20.060> effective<00:04:20.299> yes<00:04:21.250> yeah<00:04:22.250> I

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
it's simple but effective yes yeah I

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.790 
it's simple but effective yes yeah I
think<00:04:22.580> I<00:04:22.850> find<00:04:23.180> the<00:04:23.389> way<00:04:23.510> they<00:04:23.780> used<00:04:23.990> lighting

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
think I find the way they used lighting

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.830 
think I find the way they used lighting
to<00:04:25.010> be<00:04:25.130> kind<00:04:25.430> of<00:04:25.550> um<00:04:25.669> well<00:04:26.330> it's<00:04:26.360> like<00:04:26.570> black

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
to be kind of um well it's like black

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.740 
to be kind of um well it's like black
and<00:04:27.050> white<00:04:27.200> but<00:04:27.500> then<00:04:27.710> little<00:04:28.010> bits<00:04:28.220> of<00:04:28.370> color

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
and white but then little bits of color

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.390 
and white but then little bits of color
and<00:04:29.750> yeah<00:04:30.169> it<00:04:30.410> wasn't<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:30.800> obvious<00:04:31.190> like

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
and yeah it wasn't the obvious like

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.950 
and yeah it wasn't the obvious like
let's<00:04:31.610> go<00:04:31.760> for<00:04:31.940> this<00:04:32.000> colorful<00:04:32.479> thing<00:04:32.660> it<00:04:32.840> was

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:06.869 

you<00:06:05.529> know<00:06:05.649> the<00:06:05.800> state<00:06:06.069> of<00:06:06.279> being<00:06:06.460> oppressed

you know the state of being oppressed
inside<00:06:07.360> yourself<00:06:07.809> rather<00:06:08.020> than<00:06:08.169> you<00:06:08.949> know

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 
inside yourself rather than you know

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:13.439 
inside yourself rather than you know
external<00:06:10.479> forms<00:06:10.899> of<00:06:11.080> oppression<00:06:11.199> and<00:06:12.449> the

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:13.449 
external forms of oppression and the

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.339 
external forms of oppression and the
first<00:06:13.960> track<00:06:14.409> prisoner<00:06:15.039> was<00:06:15.869> almost<00:06:16.869> sort<00:06:17.199> of

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:17.349 
first track prisoner was almost sort of

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:19.109 
first track prisoner was almost sort of
me<00:06:17.499> questioning<00:06:18.129> this<00:06:18.279> prisoner<00:06:18.729> about

00:06:19.109 --> 00:06:19.119 
me questioning this prisoner about

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:21.859 
me questioning this prisoner about
whether<00:06:19.599> they<00:06:19.839> actually<00:06:19.990> are<00:06:20.379> a<00:06:20.499> prisoner<00:06:20.740> and

00:06:21.859 --> 00:06:21.869 
whether they actually are a prisoner and

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:25.409 
whether they actually are a prisoner and
wasn't<00:06:22.869> necessarily<00:06:23.379> to<00:06:23.860> myself<00:06:24.339> or<00:06:24.669> anyone

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:25.419 
wasn't necessarily to myself or anyone

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:28.850 
wasn't necessarily to myself or anyone
in<00:06:25.599> particular<00:06:25.719> but<00:06:26.289> I<00:06:26.379> think<00:06:26.649> it<00:06:26.740> could<00:06:26.770> be<00:06:27.129> um

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
in particular but I think it could be um

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.489 
in particular but I think it could be um
it's<00:06:29.999> yeah<00:06:30.999> does<00:06:31.539> that<00:06:31.659> answer<00:06:31.719> it<00:06:32.169> slightly

00:06:32.489 --> 00:06:32.499 
it's yeah does that answer it slightly

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:35.339 
it's yeah does that answer it slightly
yeah<00:06:32.949> I<00:06:33.009> think<00:06:33.069> so<00:06:33.369> yeah<00:06:33.490> did<00:06:34.270> did<00:06:34.779> all<00:06:34.930> the

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:35.349 
yeah I think so yeah did did all the

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:38.399 
yeah I think so yeah did did all the
band<00:06:35.499> members<00:06:35.529> and<00:06:35.860> maybe<00:06:35.979> ask<00:06:36.279> you<00:06:37.199> agreed<00:06:38.199> to
