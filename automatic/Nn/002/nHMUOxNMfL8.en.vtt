00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.270
 in time of day 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.700
 Hello oak, dear fishermen 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.020
 hello to everyone who watches me 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:34.410
 hello to my followers 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:40.590
 channel today we will deal very 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:45.970
 interesting in my opinion experiment 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:51.360
 compared types of turntables you know 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:54.370
 what are aglia and aglia long turntables 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:02.670
 Well, I will do this by example 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:04.750
 swedish turntables will use 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.720
 aglia pinwheel 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:13.740
 we already have a well-known turntable 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.740
 black is the world of vip 7 grams and 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.060
 also swedish turntable she called 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.490
 Tony 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.340
 these are completely different turntables well in 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.470
 first in the form of a petal in tony petal 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.869
 more elongated and natural when 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:44.259
 wiring it has a different deflection angle 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:48.250
 and petal rotation speed we 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:53.590
 let's see which turntable is bigger 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:55.820
 like it in this plan will 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.170
 check 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:03.770
 Well, well, let's start the experiment 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:13.970
 the result of it, I already in advance to vip black 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:18.950
 pinwheel view 10 favor beep fluff 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:24.280
 of course my little ones let go of course 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:28.160
 Now shoot on Tony was but all the same 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:34.690
 Passed all 21 seems to put forward 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.690
 thunderstorm and bite perch strongly subsided 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.340
 up 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:03:04.540
 So 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:08.280
 vip compares 22 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:14.050
 bigger on vip of course perfect 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:19.330
 different turntables absolutely vip y 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:22.890
 porous and tony because she has 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:28.290
 petal of the bay 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:31.290
 I 'll pull out a bit of my horse 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.290
 at the same time 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:52.540
 Moto water lily it costs vip score 22 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:59.320
 windows grabbed tony pony breaks ahead 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:03.090
 score three war blesses in burma score 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.090
 becomes 43 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.910
 accounting and 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.860
 prague climbs 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.040
 vip world 7 grams 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.420
 44 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.660
 straight nostril go nostril 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:47.160
 a score of 77 such different turntables and about 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:50.970
 as a tow like the drum is 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:57.750
 petal rotation speed tilt angle 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:05:01.320
 its generally strange it is very i thought everything 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:04.370
 Yet they differ somewhat carts 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.370
 right hooked 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:18.229
 good sharks on tawny up compares the score 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:22.130
 77 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.130
 vip comes forward 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:34.289
 998 apparently today we will not reveal 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:37.169
 which of the turntables has a preference for 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:40.470
 perch either 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:44.360
 vip or tony 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:52.729
 whose elongated petal in this 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:52.729
 elephant, but in my opinion it is time to take stock 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:06:02.010
 summarize today's game which 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:05.030
 called perch earlier we found out that 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:08.820
 black turntables black 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:13.500
 have preferences through before light 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:16.710
 and today compared 2 black turntables 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:21.510
 but they are fundamentally different 1 like me 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:24.560
 already showed this swivel swedish 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:27.270
 pinwheel look protected by q &amp; a itself 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:30.690
 7 grams 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:33.000
 I painted her tip too for 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:36.120
 leveling he was red I made him 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.240
 black in general is also processed flow 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.970
 felt the same way I did 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:47.640
 Naturally I did not have and 7 gram 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:51.150
 turntables black 7 gram black 

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:53.580
 turntables toni i made black of it 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:56.400
 having painted with a felt-tip pen also set 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.470
 hook course I already said not 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.410
 fundamentally different from one to tony 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:02.310
 elongated petal uvipe wider 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:08.460
 this 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:09.780
 aglia long vip just ogli but it's like 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.820
 not swedish 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:16.320
 Well, for special does not matter 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:19.950
 the main thing in the other here is that perch 

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:24.240
 turned out to be indifferent to the speed of rotation 

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:28.770
 petal and its slope with respect to the axis 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:32.640
 turntables more important to him is the color 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:37.680
 the moment turn out to be very interesting by 

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:39.900
 the simple reason that the score is 1110 favor 

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.370
 vip but that is all within the statistical 

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:45.870
 errors 

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:48.860
 And if you consider that I caught another pike on 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:52.230
 Tony when I entered this Russian duct 

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:53.930
 which i didn't shoot then they generally 

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:57.650
 absolutely equal 

00:07:53.930 --> 00:08:01.110
 perhaps that's all good to you 

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:06.150
 subscribe to my channel I have a lot 

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:10.700
 still a lot of interesting things for you to 

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:10.700
 goodbye for the next time
