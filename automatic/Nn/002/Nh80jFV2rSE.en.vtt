similarly<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.740> way<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.949> works<00:00:29.130> on<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> car

similarly to the way it works on a car
let's<00:00:29.849> look<00:00:29.910> at<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.119> apparatus<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:31.199> ring

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
let's look at the apparatus this ring

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.690 
let's look at the apparatus this ring
right<00:00:31.619> here<00:00:31.679> with<00:00:31.949> these<00:00:32.070> holes<00:00:32.189> punched<00:00:32.520> in

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
right here with these holes punched in

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.880 
right here with these holes punched in
it<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.940> rotating<00:00:33.480> with<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.050> wheel<00:00:34.230> obviously

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
it is rotating with the wheel obviously

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.500 
it is rotating with the wheel obviously
and<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.130> little<00:00:35.280> detector<00:00:35.820> back<00:00:36.059> here<00:00:36.390> is

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
and this little detector back here is

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.209 
and this little detector back here is
looking<00:00:36.809> for<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> very<00:00:37.260> smooth<00:00:37.680> rhythmic

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
looking for a very smooth rhythmic

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.430 
looking for a very smooth rhythmic
passing<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.850> those<00:00:39.000> holes<00:00:39.360> if<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:40.020> changes

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
passing of those holes if that changes

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.470 
passing of those holes if that changes
that<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.070> telling<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.610> abs<00:00:42.000> pump<00:00:42.239> and

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
that is telling the abs pump and

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.690 
that is telling the abs pump and
computer<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.620> detects<00:00:44.040> some<00:00:44.280> stutter

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
computer that it detects some stutter

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.880 
computer that it detects some stutter
when<00:00:44.940> there's<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.210> skid<00:00:45.570> then<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.350> pump<00:00:46.559> begins

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
when there's a skid then the pump begins

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.290 
when there's a skid then the pump begins
to<00:00:47.039> modulate<00:00:47.460> pressure<00:00:47.760> up<00:00:47.969> here<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
to modulate pressure up here to the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.970 
to modulate pressure up here to the
caliper<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.870> whole<00:00:48.989> idea<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.530> back<00:00:49.739> off<00:00:49.950> a

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
caliper the whole idea is to back off a

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.799 
caliper the whole idea is to back off a
little<00:00:50.250> bit<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.640> little<00:00:50.850> micro<00:00:51.180> slices<00:00:51.629> until

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
little bit in little micro slices until

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.510 
little bit in little micro slices until
you've<00:00:52.170> got<00:00:52.199> traction<00:00:52.649> again<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.190> then<00:00:53.280> put

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
you've got traction again and then put

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.819 
you've got traction again and then put
the<00:00:53.610> pressure<00:00:53.820> back<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.750> those<00:00:55.289> respects

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
the pressure back on in those respects

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.830 
the pressure back on in those respects
ABS<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.460> very<00:00:56.850> similar<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> way<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.809> on
