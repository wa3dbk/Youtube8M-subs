 active bullshit these approaches again people 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.940
 radioactive waste drove friends 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.360
 farther 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.430
 Dunno what that nonsense right now 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.200

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.610
 Should that good could and Egor you 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.830
 lucky actually say so 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:39.370
 Anything was lucky in life 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:41.830
 was related I was born to me 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.660
 bbc yesterday it was me I was born one of 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.269
 million sperm which 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.450
 made my way to the light I'm already lucky it on 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:52.120
 so friends drove on 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.060
 open the set and you blocks the blocks 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.390

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.739
 never really lucky really all 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.900
 time some garbage dropped out souvenirs 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.549
 recruitment is generally like a waste of money 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.400
 Like friends too 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:14.290
 waste is already the most complete and expensive they are 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:17.019
 Kapets just a little more expensive 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.030
 rubles you need one hundred two hundred on the cancer set 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.709
 There is a souvenir set that costs 6 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.180
 thousand rubles that is opened the box 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.430
 which can cost thousands of rubles 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.420
 looked exactly the same before you open on 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.970
 6 rubles worth it count irrational 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.489
 a waste of money I am very irrational 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.530
 but there can drink a cool pen but how 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.780
 the chance is said is very small therefore 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.910
