00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.320
 many people dream to open their own business to get out of financial suffocation 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.810
 with the hard work of finding the solution is to survive everything 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.200
 own talent 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.500
 one of the outputs is to start small investment but with return 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.400
 easy 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.020
 among the options of the future target entrepreneurs are the machines that 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.150
 produce various types of products and easy handling services with 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.210
 cheap stuff the machines nobody spreads across Brazil 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.290
 has machine to extract and pulp of fruits and to make seasoning of garlic 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.140
 who has a manual skill can think of an embroidery machine or of making 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.180
 yoke 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.200
 it was also possible to send objects at the client's house or even do 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.510
 bags diapers and slippers of various sizes colors and models 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.050
 by the way, sex machines 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.820
 It's our strategy today. 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.659
 it is in the air 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.799
 Small business 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.370
 great advances 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.610
 for the fourth round 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.710
 ecological product with streams 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.710
 then I come back motivated industrialized 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.360
 a small company from the interior of sÃ£o paulo launched a product ecologically 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.460
 correct and challenges the power of major automotive paint manufacturers 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.229
 now the new product conquers space in the market see 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.610
 the new paint was only manufactured because the track was kept by the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.760
 moment that carlos cardozo 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.910
 in 1992 they bet on a diet from now on 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.780
 change input only by water based paint 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.910
 this is up to a very important differential in the viuniski market market 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.500
 not exploited by the large ones due to the limit of the low scale of production 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.190
 were two years of testing to reach the end product investment of 200 thousand 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.049
 real 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.180
 entrepreneurs hired chemicals and bought new equipment like these 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.419
 subway risks to control the fluency of the tijuca 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:36.979
 with the challenge was not to have more expensive product that today costs 50% more 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:42.279
 because conventional ink will test new raw material alternatives with 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:43.620
 lower costs 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.409
 another important point was 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:50.609
 with the gain of scale should name a mineral point that we have increased our 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.039
 sales we have been able to reduce the costs of raw materials as well 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:58.459
 over time the competing brands also launch measures from 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:59.239
 now 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.750
 luis and carlos looked for new differentials to compete in the market 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.409
 in the middle of large stocks paints produced in very small quantities 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:09.850
 calls people's attention 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.140
 as is especially done by an unrestricted engine block factory 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.130
 put on scale are for sale that does not make up because the factory buys 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.870
 only five pounds of this attitude per month actually at home so the company 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.850
 has learned that it is worth to forget the profit of the moment to gain customer and 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.460
 conquer the market up front this year is to prove the company by 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.120
 various opportunities 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.170
 where clients began with volumes of inexpressive columnist and for the 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.310
 large companies were not at all interested and that these customers 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.639
 from the moment they felt the quality 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.199
 lots of water for wine 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:50.510
 throughout your life for the consultant Mario Pessoa 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.249
 creating specific products is a way people 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:57.049
 discover little explored markets 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.059
 small businesses have 

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:02.149
 the big ones can hardly customize 

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:05.419
 the customer service with the creation of a product 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:09.729
 then you're a parent art you can not do little of the letuce that a 

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:14.030
 killing a dossier with the developer the standard in big stores 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.440
 so the tailors they really one continues to exist and paint tailors 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.930
 tailor defenses the supply of consumer products but always focused on niches 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.289
 the strategy worked out 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:30.629
 today the company sells 40 thousand liters of water-based paint per month 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.140
 which has won large clients as multinationals in the automotive sector 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.840
 artist is used in front patients 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.180
 a small supplier it answers us with enough fertility agility either 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.580
 tell 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.169
 it serves as a great variety of purist types a speed well 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.430
 this is a very important factor a type of business in the 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.340
 rails 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.440
 still according to the consultant the history of this company is an example to be 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.559
 followed by small 

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:05.369
 you need to be aware of everything competitors are doing 

00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:08.369
 mainly because they are not doing 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:12.370
 I can give the example of the abandonment of positions in rio de janeiro 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.910
 when dutra snow what everyone opened a car wash it opened again 

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:22.779
 which is a way of the local with much calmer and with much more caprice law 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:25.779
 was successful because he was doing 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.000
 did you know 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.520
 water-based paints are applied to almost 50% of automobiles 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.010
 produced in europe the information is from Bernardino by the specialist in 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.349
 automotive market

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:48.249
