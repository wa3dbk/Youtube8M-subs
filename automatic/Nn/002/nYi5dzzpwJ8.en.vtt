homemade<00:00:01.890> antenna<00:00:02.399> tip<00:00:02.730> I<00:00:03.030> wanted<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:03.899> show

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
homemade antenna tip I wanted to show

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.170 
homemade antenna tip I wanted to show
you<00:00:04.110> my<00:00:04.200> beat-up<00:00:04.799> GoPro<00:00:05.250> this<00:00:05.460> one's<00:00:05.640> been

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
you my beat-up GoPro this one's been

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.299 
you my beat-up GoPro this one's been
with<00:00:06.359> me<00:00:06.540> since<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.899> beginning<00:00:07.020> and<00:00:08.010> see<00:00:08.189> the

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
with me since the beginning and see the

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.759 
with me since the beginning and see the
LCDs<00:00:08.700> cracked<00:00:09.059> but<00:00:10.050> if<00:00:10.139> you<00:00:10.260> plug<00:00:10.500> in<00:00:10.530> the

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
LCDs cracked but if you plug in the

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.400 
LCDs cracked but if you plug in the
video<00:00:11.040> output<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.210> this<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.809> your<00:00:12.929> flat<00:00:13.080> sharks

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
video output of this to your flat sharks

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.099 
video output of this to your flat sharks
you<00:00:13.530> can<00:00:13.679> redo<00:00:14.340> all<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.610> settings<00:00:14.969> so<00:00:15.839> if<00:00:15.960> your

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
you can redo all the settings so if your

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.349 
you can redo all the settings so if your
LCDs<00:00:16.650> cracks<00:00:16.949> it's<00:00:17.789> not<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.090> end<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.270> the

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
LCDs cracks it's not the end of the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.450 
LCDs cracks it's not the end of the
world<00:00:18.560> but<00:00:19.560> that's<00:00:19.650> not<00:00:19.890> why<00:00:20.039> we're<00:00:20.220> here

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
world but that's not why we're here

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.279 
world but that's not why we're here
I<00:00:20.609> want<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.180> show<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.539> antenna<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.050> built

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
I want to show you this antenna I built

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.920 
I want to show you this antenna I built
yesterday<00:00:23.060> so<00:00:24.060> 1.2<00:00:24.720> inverted<00:00:25.260> V<00:00:26.090> and<00:00:27.090> it's<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
yesterday so 1.2 inverted V and it's a

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.790 
yesterday so 1.2 inverted V and it's a
new<00:00:28.109> one<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.970> in<00:00:29.970> order<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.359> get<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.810> straight

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
new one and in order to get the straight

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.670 
new one and in order to get the straight
cable<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.399> bend<00:00:32.610> properly<00:00:33.230> what<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.380> do<00:00:34.530> is

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
cable to bend properly what you do is

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.430 
cable to bend properly what you do is
you<00:00:34.800> put<00:00:35.010> on<00:00:35.040> shrink-wrap<00:00:35.730> tubing<00:00:36.180> one<00:00:37.170> size

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
you put on shrink-wrap tubing one size

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.490 
you put on shrink-wrap tubing one size
the<00:00:37.680> next<00:00:38.040> size<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.460> exercise<00:00:38.790> up<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.500> hold

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
the next size and exercise up and hold

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.410 
the next size and exercise up and hold
it<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:40.800> place<00:00:40.950> while<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.309> shrink<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.879> tubing

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
it in place while you shrink that tubing

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.560 
it in place while you shrink that tubing
and<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.350> will<00:00:43.610> lock<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.850> shape<00:00:45.090> into<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
and it will lock the shape into the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.920 
and it will lock the shape into the
antenna<00:00:46.789> with<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.940> tension<00:00:48.180> that's<00:00:48.480> applied

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
antenna with the tension that's applied

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.630 
antenna with the tension that's applied
with<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.200> heat<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:50.190> then<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.460> put<00:00:50.610> another

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
with the heat so then you put another

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.760 
with the heat so then you put another
piece<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.360> reinforce<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.020> by<00:00:52.170> shrinking

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
piece on and reinforce it by shrinking

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.889 
piece on and reinforce it by shrinking
and<00:00:52.860> shrinking<00:00:52.949> into<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.610> shape<00:00:53.879> now<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.690> have

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
and shrinking into that shape now I have

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.310 
and shrinking into that shape now I have
a<00:00:54.930> very<00:00:55.260> flexible<00:00:55.530> antenna<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.300> top<00:00:57.539> that

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
a very flexible antenna on the top that

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.660 
a very flexible antenna on the top that
can<00:00:58.500> actually<00:00:58.829> bend<00:00:59.039> down<00:00:59.219> all<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.550> way

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
can actually bend down all the way

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.130 
can actually bend down all the way
without<00:01:00.480> getting<00:01:00.629> damaged<00:01:01.289> when<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.859> crashes

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
without getting damaged when it crashes

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.410 
without getting damaged when it crashes
be<00:01:03.380> less<00:01:03.559> stress<00:01:03.829> on<00:01:03.980> this<00:01:04.190> area<00:01:04.489> here<00:01:04.820> and

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
be less stress on this area here and

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.149 
be less stress on this area here and
then<00:01:06.020> there's<00:01:07.210> Lucic<00:01:08.210> here<00:01:08.620> to<00:01:09.620> protect<00:01:10.010> the

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
then there's Lucic here to protect the

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.609 
then there's Lucic here to protect the
elements<00:01:10.250> where<00:01:10.940> they<00:01:11.060> connect<00:01:11.450> and<00:01:12.140> I<00:01:12.229> used<00:01:12.440> a

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
elements where they connect and I used a

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.800 
elements where they connect and I used a
thicker<00:01:13.240> 12<00:01:14.560> 14<00:01:15.610> gauge<00:01:16.610> element<00:01:17.300> on<00:01:17.450> this<00:01:17.600> one

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
thicker 12 14 gauge element on this one

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.520 
thicker 12 14 gauge element on this one
rather<00:01:18.050> than<00:01:18.290> a<00:01:18.320> thin<00:01:19.570> welding<00:01:20.570> wire<00:01:20.780> element

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
rather than a thin welding wire element

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.290 
rather than a thin welding wire element
so<00:01:21.979> we're<00:01:22.100> gonna<00:01:22.190> see<00:01:22.460> if<00:01:22.490> that<00:01:22.729> improves<00:01:22.910> the

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
so we're gonna see if that improves the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.469 
so we're gonna see if that improves the
signal<00:01:23.660> or<00:01:23.780> not<00:01:24.550> this<00:01:25.550> is<00:01:25.729> only<00:01:25.880> one<00:01:26.180> of<00:01:26.330> my

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
signal or not this is only one of my

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.249 
signal or not this is only one of my
diversity<00:01:27.400> receiver<00:01:28.400> antennas<00:01:29.300> here<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:30.050> I'm

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
diversity receiver antennas here so I'm

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:31.930 
diversity receiver antennas here so I'm
hoping<00:01:30.560> that<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:30.890> interference<00:01:31.460> won't<00:01:31.820> be

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
hoping that the interference won't be

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.609 
hoping that the interference won't be
that<00:01:32.090> great<00:01:32.270> from<00:01:32.600> that<00:01:32.630> distance<00:01:33.170> it<00:01:33.320> wasn't

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
that great from that distance it wasn't

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.100 
that great from that distance it wasn't
the<00:01:33.680> other<00:01:33.800> day<00:01:34.630> now<00:01:35.630> I've<00:01:35.990> got<00:01:36.289> my<00:01:36.470> stripped

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
the other day now I've got my stripped

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.480 
the other day now I've got my stripped
transmitter<00:01:39.110> here<00:01:39.440> which<00:01:39.770> is<00:01:39.920> sort<00:01:40.130> of<00:01:40.190> sloppy

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
transmitter here which is sort of sloppy

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.880 
transmitter here which is sort of sloppy
but<00:01:40.789> I<00:01:41.030> really<00:01:41.780> like<00:01:41.930> to<00:01:42.050> have<00:01:42.140> access<00:01:42.530> to<00:01:42.590> it

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
but I really like to have access to it

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.830 
but I really like to have access to it
and<00:01:43.039> it's<00:01:43.729> covered<00:01:44.119> for<00:01:44.330> water

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
and it's covered for water

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.630 
and it's covered for water
I've<00:01:45.050> also<00:01:45.259> coated<00:01:45.800> it<00:01:45.920> so<00:01:46.310> that<00:01:46.460> it's

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
I've also coated it so that it's

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.400 
I've also coated it so that it's
waterproof<00:01:46.970> all<00:01:47.360> over<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.690> circuit<00:01:48.050> board<00:01:48.259> as

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
waterproof all over the circuit board as

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.200 
waterproof all over the circuit board as
well<00:01:48.560> I'm<00:01:49.340> gonna<00:01:49.460> figure<00:01:49.700> out<00:01:49.820> a<00:01:49.910> better<00:01:50.090> way

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
well I'm gonna figure out a better way

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.580 
well I'm gonna figure out a better way
to<00:01:50.300> mount<00:01:50.570> it<00:01:50.810> but<00:01:51.020> right<00:01:51.170> for<00:01:51.410> now<00:01:51.530> for

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
to mount it but right for now for

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.400 
to mount it but right for now for
testing<00:01:52.160> it<00:01:52.280> works<00:01:52.520> really<00:01:52.729> well<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.410> the

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
testing it works really well and the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.590 
testing it works really well and the
antenna<00:01:54.770> positions<00:01:55.250> far<00:01:55.820> clear<00:01:56.090> of<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.330> props

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
antenna positions far clear of the props

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.770 
antenna positions far clear of the props
now<00:01:56.840> as<00:01:56.990> you<00:01:57.170> can<00:01:57.289> see<00:01:58.060> because<00:01:59.060> of<00:01:59.270> that<00:01:59.420> Bend

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
now as you can see because of that Bend

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.109 
now as you can see because of that Bend
and<00:02:00.170> even<00:02:01.100> without<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.520> bend<00:02:01.700> it<00:02:01.850> wouldn't

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
and even without the bend it wouldn't

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.570 
and even without the bend it wouldn't
hit<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.479> antenna<00:02:03.080> but<00:02:03.470> if<00:02:03.770> it<00:02:03.890> was<00:02:04.009> on<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.160> 90

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
hit the antenna but if it was on a 90

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.820 
hit the antenna but if it was on a 90
but<00:02:04.789> just<00:02:05.630> to<00:02:05.720> be<00:02:05.840> safe<00:02:05.869> I<00:02:06.170> wanted<00:02:06.410> to<00:02:06.500> tuck<00:02:06.710> it

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
but just to be safe I wanted to tuck it

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.319 
but just to be safe I wanted to tuck it
further<00:02:07.070> in<00:02:07.340> mm-hmm<00:02:08.119> now<00:02:09.110> I've<00:02:09.440> just<00:02:09.500> got<00:02:10.329> my

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:11.329 
further in mm-hmm now I've just got my

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.360 
further in mm-hmm now I've just got my
camera<00:02:11.630> mounted<00:02:12.200> here<00:02:12.590> on<00:02:12.799> a<00:02:12.860> piece<00:02:13.190> of

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
camera mounted here on a piece of

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.250 
camera mounted here on a piece of
quarter-inch<00:02:13.700> foam

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
quarter-inch foam

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.430 
quarter-inch foam
closed<00:02:15.890> cell<00:02:16.220> phone<00:02:16.519> and<00:02:17.080> that's<00:02:18.080> giving<00:02:18.409> me

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
closed cell phone and that's giving me

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.460 
closed cell phone and that's giving me
zero<00:02:18.709> jello<00:02:19.010> from<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.400> position<00:02:19.849> I<00:02:20.290> can<00:02:21.290> put

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
zero jello from that position I can put

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.890 
zero jello from that position I can put
the<00:02:21.560> camera<00:02:21.769> up<00:02:21.920> here<00:02:22.250> as<00:02:22.370> well<00:02:22.580> because<00:02:23.480> the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
the camera up here as well because the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.559 
the camera up here as well because the
battery<00:02:24.560> is<00:02:24.680> on<00:02:24.769> foam<00:02:25.099> you<00:02:25.280> can<00:02:25.310> slip<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.700> velcro

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
battery is on foam you can slip a velcro

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.589 
battery is on foam you can slip a velcro
strap<00:02:26.900> under<00:02:27.170> there<00:02:27.349> very<00:02:27.560> easily<00:02:27.769> and<00:02:28.599> put

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
strap under there very easily and put

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.270 
strap under there very easily and put
the<00:02:29.720> GoPro<00:02:29.900> here<00:02:30.349> as<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.650> was<00:02:30.830> for<00:02:31.220> the

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
the GoPro here as it was for the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.520 
the GoPro here as it was for the
piggyback<00:02:31.580> shot<00:02:32.090> which<00:02:32.780> I'll<00:02:32.959> be<00:02:33.080> doing<00:02:33.110> some

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
piggyback shot which I'll be doing some

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.770 
piggyback shot which I'll be doing some
more<00:02:33.560> of<00:02:33.860> once<00:02:34.400> I<00:02:34.489> get<00:02:34.640> back<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.060> field<00:02:35.239> or

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
more of once I get back to the field or

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.160 
more of once I get back to the field or
to<00:02:36.080> another<00:02:36.470> location<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.959> maybe<00:02:38.959> the

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
to another location and maybe the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.750 
to another location and maybe the
hexacopter<00:02:39.530> will<00:02:39.890> be<00:02:39.950> doing<00:02:40.099> some<00:02:40.370> video<00:02:40.610> as

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
hexacopter will be doing some video as

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.410 
hexacopter will be doing some video as
well<00:02:42.250> because<00:02:43.250> I<00:02:43.370> was<00:02:43.519> having<00:02:43.819> a<00:02:43.910> bit<00:02:44.060> of<00:02:44.180> shake

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
well because I was having a bit of shake

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.059 
well because I was having a bit of shake
last<00:02:44.720> time<00:02:44.959> a<00:02:44.989> little<00:02:45.349> jello<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:45.739> was<00:02:45.860> really

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
last time a little jello it was really

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.460 
last time a little jello it was really
difficult<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.549> fly<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:47.299> I'm<00:02:47.599> gonna<00:02:47.750> hopefully

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
difficult to fly so I'm gonna hopefully

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.559 
difficult to fly so I'm gonna hopefully
have<00:02:48.709> a<00:02:48.860> little<00:02:48.950> bit<00:02:49.280> easier<00:02:49.790> time<00:02:50.030> flying<00:02:50.360> and

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
have a little bit easier time flying and

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:51.940 
have a little bit easier time flying and
do<00:02:50.690> a<00:02:50.720> little<00:02:50.840> bit<00:02:50.989> more<00:02:51.049> proximity<00:02:51.829> flying

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
do a little bit more proximity flying

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.080 
do a little bit more proximity flying
and<00:02:54.099> later<00:02:55.099> on<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.370> week<00:02:55.489> I'll<00:02:55.640> be<00:02:55.670> working<00:02:56.030> on

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
and later on the week I'll be working on

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.650 
and later on the week I'll be working on
the<00:02:56.209> Naza<00:02:57.099> camera<00:02:58.099> rig<00:02:58.340> which<00:02:58.879> is<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.209> actual

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
the Naza camera rig which is the actual

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.619 
the Naza camera rig which is the actual
official<00:03:00.410> frame<00:03:00.890> that<00:03:01.190> was<00:03:01.310> manufactured<00:03:01.879> and

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
official frame that was manufactured and

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.050 
official frame that was manufactured and
is<00:03:03.200> exact<00:03:03.590> same<00:03:03.799> spacing<00:03:04.340> in<00:03:04.489> size<00:03:04.700> and

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
is exact same spacing in size and

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.210 
is exact same spacing in size and
strength<00:03:05.390> so<00:03:05.569> there's<00:03:06.560> no<00:03:06.680> big<00:03:06.859> difference

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
strength so there's no big difference

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.339 
strength so there's no big difference
there<00:03:07.459> that's<00:03:08.450> your<00:03:08.629> update<00:03:08.690> for<00:03:09.109> today
