00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
today or in Bakersfield California we're

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.990 
today or in Bakersfield California we're
putting<00:00:03.990> in<00:00:04.080> some<00:00:04.290> bullion<00:00:04.650> vias<00:00:04.980> these<00:00:05.790> are

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
putting in some bullion vias these are

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.209 
putting in some bullion vias these are
number<00:00:06.359> 15<00:00:06.899> pots<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:09.590> most<00:00:10.590> important<00:00:11.070> thing

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
number 15 pots and most important thing

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.370 
number 15 pots and most important thing
you<00:00:11.280> know<00:00:11.460> about<00:00:11.580> bougainvillea<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:13.259> the

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
you know about bougainvillea is that the

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.700 
you know about bougainvillea is that the
roots<00:00:13.710> are<00:00:13.920> very<00:00:14.059> very<00:00:15.059> sensitive<00:00:15.750> so<00:00:16.680> you

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
roots are very very sensitive so you

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.189 
roots are very very sensitive so you
just<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.160> go<00:00:17.310> go<00:00:17.820> jerking<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.570> out<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.930> pot

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
just to go go jerking it out of the pot

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.170 
just to go go jerking it out of the pot
in<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.070> case<00:00:20.340> you're<00:00:20.550> just<00:00:20.580> going<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.850> lay<00:00:21.060> it

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
in this case you're just going to lay it

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.009 
in this case you're just going to lay it
down<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:22.550> we<00:00:23.550> kept<00:00:23.820> them<00:00:23.970> dry<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.810> root

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
down and we kept them dry so the root

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.910 
down and we kept them dry so the root
ball<00:00:25.199> isn't<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.710> heavy<00:00:26.510> and<00:00:27.560> just<00:00:28.560> gently

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
ball isn't that heavy and just gently

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.910 
ball isn't that heavy and just gently
slide<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.429> out<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.939> pot<00:00:30.500> again<00:00:31.500> have<00:00:31.769> your

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
slide it out of the pot again have your

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.760 
slide it out of the pot again have your
root<00:00:32.130> ball<00:00:32.340> dry<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.270> comes<00:00:33.510> out<00:00:33.780> nice<00:00:34.469> and

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
root ball dry so it comes out nice and

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.760 
root ball dry so it comes out nice and
light<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:38.180> ordinarily<00:00:39.180> we<00:00:39.690> rough<00:00:39.989> up<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
light and ordinarily we rough up the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.790 
light and ordinarily we rough up the
roots<00:00:41.040> we<00:00:41.940> now<00:00:42.120> do<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.570> bug<00:00:42.870> envy<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.350> because

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
roots we now do that bug envy it because

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.540 
roots we now do that bug envy it because
frankly<00:00:44.219> if<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.300> think<00:00:45.510> dice<00:00:46.100> it's<00:00:47.100> just<00:00:47.370> too

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
frankly if I think dice it's just too

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.600 
frankly if I think dice it's just too
much<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.969> headache<00:00:48.469> and<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.980> went<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.340> next

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
much of a headache and this went in next

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.029 
much of a headache and this went in next
to<00:00:50.730> block<00:00:51.000> wall<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.690> we<00:00:52.289> have<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.590> allow<00:00:52.800> for

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
to block wall so we have to allow for

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.220 
to block wall so we have to allow for
the<00:00:53.129> space<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.760> footing<00:00:54.180> for<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.449> wall<00:00:54.660> and

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
the space the footing for the wall and

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.970 
the space the footing for the wall and
then<00:00:55.920> we've<00:00:56.039> got<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> nice<00:00:56.550> hole<00:00:57.109> dug<00:00:58.109> out<00:00:58.350> and

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
then we've got a nice hole dug out and

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.490 
then we've got a nice hole dug out and
really<00:00:59.390> bogan<00:01:00.390> view<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.719> just<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:01.020> very<00:01:01.199> simple

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
really bogan view is just a very simple

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.369 
really bogan view is just a very simple
planting<00:01:02.329> you're<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.449> going<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.019> get<00:01:04.140> some

to<00:02:28.200> shove<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.650> down<00:02:28.680> in<00:02:29.069> there

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.420 

and<00:02:33.880> so<00:02:34.180> again<00:02:34.540> want<00:02:35.349> that<00:02:35.590> root<00:02:35.830> ball<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.250> be

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
and so again want that root ball to be

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.540 
and so again want that root ball to be
super<00:02:37.090> wet<00:02:37.330> and<00:02:38.170> take<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.560> hose<00:02:38.770> we<00:02:39.040> jet<00:02:39.370> out

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
super wet and take the hose we jet out

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.930 
super wet and take the hose we jet out
the<00:02:39.790> soil<00:02:40.620> get<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.860> silt<00:02:42.160> get<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.550> really

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
the soil get the silt get it really

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.420 
the soil get the silt get it really
waterlogged<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:43.989> then<00:02:44.530> we<00:02:44.650> know<00:02:44.830> that<00:02:45.099> that

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
waterlogged and then we know that that

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.840 
waterlogged and then we know that that
plant<00:02:45.760> is<00:02:45.910> going<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.180> thrive<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.810> establish

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
plant is going to thrive and establish

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.940 
plant is going to thrive and establish
fertilize<00:02:48.850> a<00:02:48.880> week<00:02:49.360> or<00:02:49.540> two<00:02:49.720> later<00:02:50.020> not<00:02:50.650> right

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
fertilize a week or two later not right

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.180 
fertilize a week or two later not right
now<00:02:51.190> we're<00:02:51.400> planting<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:53.350> that's<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.860> easy

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
now we're planting and that's the easy

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.250 
now we're planting and that's the easy
way<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:54.640> do<00:02:55.060> a<00:02:55.360> happy<00:02:55.900> healthy<00:02:56.290> Bulgin<00:02:56.980> Ziya
