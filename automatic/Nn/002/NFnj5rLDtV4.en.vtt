so I'm Lolita Castley originally from
the<00:00:11.400> States<00:00:11.670> but<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:11.969> also<00:00:12.150> have<00:00:12.420> family<00:00:12.450> here

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
the States but I also have family here

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.980 
the States but I also have family here
in<00:00:13.049> Switzerland<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:13.940> studied<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.299> Boston

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
in Switzerland I studied in Boston

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.750 
in Switzerland I studied in Boston
originally<00:00:16.440> at<00:00:16.590> MIT<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.430> they<00:00:17.520> have<00:00:17.640> an

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
originally at MIT and they have an

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.029 
originally at MIT and they have an
internship<00:00:18.180> program<00:00:18.359> with<00:00:19.230> Switzerland<00:00:19.439> and

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
internship program with Switzerland and

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.400 
internship program with Switzerland and
so<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.580> had<00:00:20.820> an<00:00:20.910> amazing<00:00:21.119> opportunity<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:22.260> do<00:00:22.380> a

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
so I had an amazing opportunity to do a

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.099 
so I had an amazing opportunity to do a
summer<00:00:22.740> internship<00:00:23.189> here<00:00:23.730> at<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.090> dvss<00:00:24.689> C<00:00:24.869> at

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
summer internship here at the dvss C at

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.830 
summer internship here at the dvss C at
ETH<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.849> how<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.029> first<00:00:27.570> came<00:00:27.779> to

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
ETH and this is how I first came to

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.999 
ETH and this is how I first came to
Basel<00:00:29.720> Switzerland<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.199> really<00:00:31.500> functional

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
Basel Switzerland is a really functional

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.400 
Basel Switzerland is a really functional
country<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.790> mean<00:00:33.120> all<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.510> trains<00:00:33.780> or<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
country I mean all the trains or the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.319 
country I mean all the trains or the
buses<00:00:35.370> were<00:00:35.489> all<00:00:35.730> public<00:00:36.059> transportation

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
buses were all public transportation

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.950 
buses were all public transportation
works<00:00:37.129> supermarkets<00:00:38.129> are<00:00:38.190> very<00:00:38.399> close<00:00:38.960> so

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
works supermarkets are very close so

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.569 
works supermarkets are very close so
it's<00:00:40.170> very<00:00:40.350> easy<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.710> live<00:00:40.980> here<00:00:43.520> okay<00:00:44.520> so

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
it's very easy to live here okay so

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.760 
it's very easy to live here okay so
specifically<00:00:45.450> why<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.719> chose<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.200> department

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
specifically why I chose this department

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.049 
specifically why I chose this department
the<00:00:46.890> biotechnology<00:00:48.050> master's<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.350> its

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
the biotechnology master's is its

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.819 
the biotechnology master's is its
interdisciplinary<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:52.170> have<00:00:52.410> also<00:00:52.620> applied

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
interdisciplinary so I have also applied

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.220 
interdisciplinary so I have also applied
to<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.250> computational<00:00:53.940> biology<00:00:54.480> program<00:00:54.930> and

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
to the computational biology program and

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.830 
to the computational biology program and
the<00:00:55.890> biomedical<00:00:56.430> engineering<00:00:57.059> program<00:00:57.149> and

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
the biomedical engineering program and

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.880 
the biomedical engineering program and
so<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.440> really<00:00:59.070> loved<00:00:59.280> biology<00:01:00.109> coding<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.500> I

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
so I really loved biology coding and I

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.500 
so I really loved biology coding and I
loved<00:01:02.160> engineering<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
loved engineering and this is the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.840 
loved engineering and this is the
perfect<00:01:03.719> combination

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
perfect combination

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.399 
perfect combination
so<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:05.880> guess<00:01:06.180> students<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.840> are<00:01:06.960> well<00:01:07.110> here

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
so I guess students that are well here

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.910 
so I guess students that are well here
are<00:01:07.799> extremely<00:01:08.369> curious<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.600> mean<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.500> courses

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
are extremely curious I mean the courses

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.640 
are extremely curious I mean the courses
here<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> wire<00:01:11.490> like<00:01:11.850> I've<00:01:12.030> taken<00:01:12.240> courses<00:01:13.110> on

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
here a wire like I've taken courses on

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.130 
here a wire like I've taken courses on
silicon<00:01:14.159> engineering<00:01:14.700> like<00:01:14.939> seamless<00:01:15.810> and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
silicon engineering like seamless and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.530 
silicon engineering like seamless and
MEMS<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.890> I've<00:01:17.070> taken<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:18.119> know<00:01:18.150> they<00:01:18.390> have

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
MEMS and I've taken you know they have

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.789 
MEMS and I've taken you know they have
math<00:01:18.750> courses<00:01:19.080> here<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.470> stochastic

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
math courses here and stochastic

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.640 
math courses here and stochastic
modeling<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.939> my<00:01:21.330> Flutie's<00:01:21.810> class<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.290> often

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
modeling and my Flutie's class is often

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.530 
modeling and my Flutie's class is often
flutist<00:01:23.040> classes<00:01:23.549> synthetic<00:01:24.030> biology

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
flutist classes synthetic biology

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.080 
flutist classes synthetic biology
classes<00:01:25.310> all<00:01:26.310> different<00:01:26.759> types<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.090> classes

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
classes all different types of classes

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.490 
classes all different types of classes
there's<00:01:30.090> such<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> wide<00:01:30.840> variety<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.799> different

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
there's such a wide variety of different

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.840 
there's such a wide variety of different
people<00:01:34.500> from<00:01:34.710> different<00:01:34.860> backgrounds<00:01:35.310> and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
people from different backgrounds and

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.240 
people from different backgrounds and
this<00:01:36.720> also<00:01:36.930> makes<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.350> really<00:01:37.530> cool<00:01:37.829> when<00:01:38.130> you

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
this also makes it really cool when you

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.789 
this also makes it really cool when you
go<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.610> try<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.939> solve<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.299> problem<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.470> when

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
go in to try to solve a problem so when

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.170 
go in to try to solve a problem so when
you're<00:01:40.890> trying<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.250> solve<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.520> problem<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.060> you

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
you're trying to solve a problem and you

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.270 
you're trying to solve a problem and you
have<00:01:42.270> people<00:01:42.479> from<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.110> many<00:01:43.170> different<00:01:43.409> you

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
have people from so many different you

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.950 
have people from so many different you
know<00:01:44.399> international<00:01:45.149> communities<00:01:45.630> and

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
know international communities and

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.490 
know international communities and
different<00:01:46.790> backgrounds<00:01:47.930> academically<00:01:48.930> this

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
different backgrounds academically this

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.899 
different backgrounds academically this
gives<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.950> really<00:01:50.250> unique<00:01:50.399> approach<00:01:50.880> to

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
gives you a really unique approach to

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.580 
gives you a really unique approach to
find<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.390> best<00:01:51.600> way<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.899> solve<00:01:52.320> different

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
find the best way to solve different

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
find the best way to solve different
problems<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.130> fire

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.310 

I'm<00:01:57.610> specifically<00:01:58.240> looking<00:01:58.600> at<00:01:58.720> cytokine

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
I'm specifically looking at cytokine

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.860 
I'm specifically looking at cytokine
secretion<00:01:59.530> or<00:02:00.100> how<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.640> cells<00:02:01.270> communicate

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
secretion or how the cells communicate

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.230 
secretion or how the cells communicate
to<00:02:01.990> each<00:02:02.020> other<00:02:02.230> so<00:02:02.620> how<00:02:02.830> does<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.790> cell<00:02:04.000> by

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
to each other so how does the cell by

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.970 
to each other so how does the cell by
the<00:02:04.300> infection<00:02:04.960> tell<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.290> other<00:02:05.470> selves<00:02:05.890> that

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
the infection tell the other selves that

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.320 
the infection tell the other selves that
it<00:02:06.130> should<00:02:06.280> come<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:06.610> hop<00:02:06.820> out

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
it should come and hop out

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.510 
it should come and hop out
so<00:02:07.750> it's<00:02:07.960> this<00:02:08.140> communication<00:02:08.800> process<00:02:08.979> that

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
so it's this communication process that

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.730 
so it's this communication process that
I'm<00:02:09.610> studying<00:02:12.990> so<00:02:13.990> usually<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.410> first<00:02:14.560> thing

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
I'm studying so usually the first thing

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.440 
I'm studying so usually the first thing
I<00:02:14.800> do<00:02:14.920> when<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.130> come<00:02:15.310> in<00:02:15.490> is<00:02:15.700> I<00:02:15.820> make<00:02:16.000> sure<00:02:16.030> all

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
I do when I come in is I make sure all

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.730 
I do when I come in is I make sure all
my<00:02:16.570> experiments<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.290> we're<00:02:17.440> running

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
my experiments that we're running

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.760 
my experiments that we're running
overnight<00:02:18.090> works<00:02:19.090> properly<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.990> while<00:02:20.650> this

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
is running I could analyze previous

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.820 
is running I could analyze previous
experiments<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.090> could<00:02:25.540> plan<00:02:25.900> new<00:02:26.050> experiments

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
experiments I could plan new experiments

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.710 
experiments I could plan new experiments
I<00:02:26.920> could<00:02:27.070> read<00:02:27.190> some<00:02:27.370> papers<00:02:27.550> so<00:02:28.360> I'm<00:02:28.480> free<00:02:28.690> to

plan out new things that I want to do so

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.340 
plan out new things that I want to do so
you<00:02:36.880> learn<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.209> most<00:02:37.420> by<00:02:37.660> doing<00:02:38.050> things

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
opportunity to work a hundred percent on

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.020 
opportunity to work a hundred percent on
research<00:02:44.680> which<00:02:45.310> is<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.459> ultimate<00:02:45.880> goal<00:02:46.000> I

feel<00:02:46.270> like<00:02:46.360> if<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.600> department<00:02:47.140> is<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.380> use

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
feel like if the department is to use

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.870 
feel like if the department is to use
what<00:02:47.709> you<00:02:47.800> learn<00:02:47.950> in<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.130> courses<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.670> apply

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
what you learn in the courses and apply

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.550 
what you learn in the courses and apply
them<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.120> your<00:02:49.300> research<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:50.050> this<00:02:50.500> is

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
them to your research and this is

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.650 
them to your research and this is
something<00:02:50.920> I<00:02:51.010> really<00:02:51.130> found<00:02:51.430> here<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.030> so

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
something I really found here and so

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.990
