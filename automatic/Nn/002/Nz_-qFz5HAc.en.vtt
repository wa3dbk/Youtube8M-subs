00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.950
 hi friends how are you today I am going to 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.279
 teach how to make these beautiful necklaces 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:23.880
 with pebbles and beads I hope that 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.340
 Like it, we're going to need a needle 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.079
 and a few pebbles we will choose 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.989
 what we like the most to do our 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:33.870
 things we also need some hooks 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:37.770
 for the termination we started cutting 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.260
 spear of approximately 80 centimeters 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.899
 and let's start in the following way 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.660
 once we named the 80s tanza 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.290
 centimeters let's start placing 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.380
 long combs 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.170
 one 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:58.079
 and a little one 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.079
 let's repeat this step 15 times 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:09.350
 once this step is completed we are going to 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:13.260
 add a stronger color canutillo 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.940
 we add a light color again 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.940
 and a long canutillo 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:26.690
 we will repeat this step five times 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.690
 that's how it has to be staying 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.430
 we repeat five more times but 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.430
 without the dark combs 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.570
 Clear 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.070
 long 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.070
 Clear 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:52.280
 long 5 times now let's add some 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.740
 bigger pebbles the more you 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.740
 like I'm going to put these droplets 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.510
 the drop goes between two light colors 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:14.370
 It should look like this 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.790
 we will repeat this step approximately 15 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.790
 times 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:31.209
 in this way he has to stay 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.819
 once we complete the 15 droplets or 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:37.170
 the stones that you have chosen we will 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:41.040
 repeat the previous steps 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.400
 but from back to front we have to 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.160
 make us stay the same on one side 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.660
 that of the other or the next step 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.850
 it will be 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.280
 He never did over a canutillo 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.960
 clear a long canutillo a canutillo 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.960
 clear 5 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:13.840
 now we must continue with the canutillo 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.840
 clear dark and long clear 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.690
 so that we stay the same of the two 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.120
 sides the step that remains to be repeated is 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.489
 the first one of the 15 canutillos 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.489
 long with clear combs 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.320
 our first part is ready let's 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.690
 move to the 60-cm tank with 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.450
 the 60-centimeter cup we will make a 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.280
 work similar to the previous one but this 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.910
 we will add a little more 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.910
 dark colors 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:05.909
 As you can see, I put a long comb 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:09.780
 2 dark colored beads and one of 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:13.620
 light color in the middle this I repeated 5 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:16.370
 Sometimes we will add more 2 boxes of 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.370
 dark color 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:24.330
 after putting 5 dark beads I'm going 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.540
 to add a colored stick again 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:30.050
 clear this step I will repeat three 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.050
 times 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:41.660
 and then we are going to add a mostacilla 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.660
 clear a dark mosque so 10 times 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:52.300
 now we will add a long canutillo 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.880
 mostacilla in light color and one drop one 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.600
 mostacilla in light color a canutillo 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:02.260
 long another light colored mostacilla and 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.660
 another drop this step let's repeat it 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.880
 at least four times once 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.400
 we put the four drops with the 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:13.330
 canutillos in order as we wanted to go 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:16.420
 to repeat the previous steps so that 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.840
 the collar is the same on both sides 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:23.410
 as you will see we have one longer than 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:27.250
 the other, what we are going to do is unite the 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:29.200
 tips where the pebbles end 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.240
 if you do not like to use tanza you can 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.970
 Use your fancy yarn 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.419
 two and two I did three or four 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.050
 knots to avoid unleashing the same 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.930
 and it says the other extreme 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:47.220
 What we are going to do now is add 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:49.860
 4 dark colored beads but let's go 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.470
 to pass it through the two threads once 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.720
 we passed the beads for both and 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.389
 we're going to be with him and what's left 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.810
 the hook to be able to close our 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:03.900
 thing the same thing we will do on the other side very 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.090
 well we finished our good necklace 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.370
 I hope you liked my video in 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.590
 this case we did double but they can 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.419
 do it triple or the amount of 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.699
 stretch that you want 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:17.250
 if you liked my video, like it 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:20.810
 subscribe to my channel I hope the 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.810
 next thank you very much
