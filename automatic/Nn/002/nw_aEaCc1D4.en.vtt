and<00:04:47.410> I<00:04:47.950> think<00:04:48.010> he's<00:04:48.580> gonna<00:04:48.700> win<00:04:48.940> because<00:04:49.360> he's

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
and I think he's gonna win because he's

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.150 
and I think he's gonna win because he's
been<00:04:49.840> in<00:04:49.960> the<00:04:50.110> let<00:04:50.260> light<00:04:50.590> heavyweight

been in the let light heavyweight
division<00:04:51.190> longer<00:04:52.000> than<00:04:52.180> bootay<00:04:52.540> and<00:04:52.780> he

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
division longer than bootay and he

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.470
