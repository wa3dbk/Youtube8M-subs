00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:46.599 
also a little bit lower so it should

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:48.389 
also a little bit lower so it should
work<00:01:46.840> a<00:01:47.079> little<00:01:47.259> more<00:01:47.529> like<00:01:47.740> your<00:01:47.919> stove<00:01:48.189> as

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.540 
they come hot really really quickly it's
actually<00:02:11.790> hot<00:02:12.260> all<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.320> way<00:02:13.620> around<00:02:13.950> which<00:02:14.400> is

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
actually hot all the way around which is

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.010 
actually hot all the way around which is
important<00:02:15.120> probably<00:02:15.600> probably<00:02:15.870> a

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
important probably probably a

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.270 
important probably probably a
frustrating<00:02:16.620> thing<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.980> when<00:02:17.100> you're<00:02:17.220> doing

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
frustrating thing is when you're doing

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.100 
frustrating thing is when you're doing
musical<00:02:17.820> chairs<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.360> you're<00:02:18.720> drawing

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
musical chairs and you're drawing

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.440 
musical chairs and you're drawing
everything<00:02:19.890> around<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.640> big<00:02:20.760> circle<00:02:20.820> and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
everything around in a big circle and

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.820 
everything around in a big circle and
you<00:02:21.750> spend<00:02:21.990> all<00:02:22.020> your<00:02:22.170> time<00:02:22.230> doing<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.680> you

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
you spend all your time doing that you

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.780 
you spend all your time doing that you
don't<00:02:22.950> need<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.100> get<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.280> talk<00:02:23.460> to<00:02:23.580> anyone

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
don't need to get to talk to anyone

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.360 
don't need to get to talk to anyone

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
that you don't really have to do

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.360 
that you don't really have to do
anything<00:02:27.630> like<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:27.870> but<00:02:28.200> seems<00:02:28.980> pretty<00:02:29.160> good

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
anything like that but seems pretty good

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.330 
anything like that but seems pretty good
that's<00:02:30.300> nice

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340

look at that it's perfectly cooked you
can<00:03:07.959> see<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.800> it's<00:03:08.950> perfectly<00:03:09.940> cooked

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
can see that it's perfectly cooked

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.040 
can see that it's perfectly cooked
evenly<00:03:10.780> all<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.140> way<00:03:11.410> across<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:13.000> outside<00:03:13.450> is

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
evenly all the way across the outside is

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.860 
evenly all the way across the outside is
cooked<00:03:14.410> nice<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:14.950> evenly<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:16.090> as<00:03:16.569> we<00:03:16.720> get

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
cooked nice and evenly and as we get

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.750 
cooked nice and evenly and as we get
closer<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.470> center<00:03:17.650> as<00:03:18.100> you<00:03:18.340> get<00:03:18.489> a<00:03:18.520> little

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
closer to the center as you get a little

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.520 
closer to the center as you get a little
bit<00:03:18.880> closer<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.360> medium-rare<00:03:19.930> here's<00:03:20.380> a<00:03:20.440> good

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
bit closer to medium-rare here's a good

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.000 
bit closer to medium-rare here's a good
example<00:03:20.650> it's<00:03:21.510> perfectly<00:03:22.510> brown<00:03:22.900> just<00:03:23.709> on<00:03:23.860> the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
example it's perfectly brown just on the

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.370 
example it's perfectly brown just on the
outside<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.730> pink<00:03:25.239> on<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.540> inside<00:03:25.870> all<00:03:26.110> the

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
outside and pink on the inside all the

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.530 
outside and pink on the inside all the
way<00:03:26.500> across<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.910> this<00:03:28.000> is<00:03:28.120> just<00:03:28.270> the<00:03:28.360> last

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
way across and this is just the last

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.940 
way across and this is just the last
little<00:03:28.720> piece<00:03:28.930> but<00:03:29.140> you<00:03:29.230> can<00:03:29.350> still<00:03:29.530> even<00:03:29.890> at

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
little piece but you can still even at

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.770 
little piece but you can still even at
the<00:03:30.040> end<00:03:30.160> it's<00:03:30.340> medium-rare<00:03:30.700> so<00:03:31.450> that's

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
the end it's medium-rare so that's

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.800 
the end it's medium-rare so that's
actually<00:03:31.959> a<00:03:32.170> really<00:03:32.350> good<00:03:32.440> sign
