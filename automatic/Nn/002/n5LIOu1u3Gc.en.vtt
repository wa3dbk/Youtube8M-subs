along with the GCW 0 I've already
pre-ordered<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.029> um<00:00:22.939> basically<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.330> tablet

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
um where is it it's this one the jxd s7

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:53.150 
um where is it it's this one the jxd s7
300<00:00:46.700> dual-core<00:00:47.960> um<00:00:50.360> yeah<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.289> i<00:00:52.770> pre-ordered

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
300 dual-core um yeah so I i pre-ordered

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.740 
300 dual-core um yeah so I i pre-ordered
one<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.730> these<00:00:54.110> was<00:00:55.110> hoping<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.680> could

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750

pre-ordered<00:00:59.670> this<00:00:59.879> before<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.329> found<00:01:00.510> out

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
pre-ordered this before I found out

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.189 
pre-ordered this before I found out
about<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.079> GCW<00:01:01.590> 0<00:01:02.390> which<00:01:03.390> pretty<00:01:03.750> much<00:01:03.840> does

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
about the GCW 0 which pretty much does

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.350 
about the GCW 0 which pretty much does
everything<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.680> wanted<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.189> do<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:06.150> only<00:01:06.180> thing

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
everything I wanted to do the only thing

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.130 
everything I wanted to do the only thing
that<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.560> has<00:01:07.920> over<00:01:08.520> probably<00:01:08.970> over<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.689> GCW

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
that this has over probably over the GCW

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.550 
that this has over probably over the GCW
is<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.520> fact<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.450> know<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:13.110> can<00:01:13.350> do

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
is the fact that you know it can do

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.710 
is the fact that you know it can do
other<00:01:13.770> Android<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.090> know<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.390> can<00:01:15.600> use

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
other Android and you know you can use

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.480 
other Android and you know you can use
other<00:01:15.840> Android<00:01:16.259> apps<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:17.040> has<00:01:17.220> an<00:01:17.400> a

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
other Android apps on it it has an a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.780 
other Android apps on it it has an a
second<00:01:18.030> analog<00:01:18.240> stick<00:01:18.810> um<00:01:19.460> it's<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.580> little

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
second analog stick um it's a little

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:28.149 
second analog stick um it's a little
bigger<00:01:21.560> it<00:01:22.560> does<00:01:22.860> have<00:01:23.130> hdmi<00:01:23.549> out<00:01:24.270> as<00:01:24.450> well<00:01:24.780> um

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.240 

but<00:01:29.159> oh<00:01:30.020> I<00:01:31.020> guess<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.650> fact<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.130> can

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
but oh I guess in the fact that it can

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.890 
but oh I guess in the fact that it can
play<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> ps1<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:34.490> which<00:01:35.490> I'm<00:01:35.640> called<00:01:35.909> PS<00:01:36.509> 1<00:01:36.720> in

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
play a ps1 and which I'm called PS 1 in

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.190 
play a ps1 and which I'm called PS 1 in
64<00:01:37.409> games<00:01:37.820> but<00:01:38.820> after<00:01:39.659> doing<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:40.020> little

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
64 games but after doing a little

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.350 
64 games but after doing a little
research<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.920> looks<00:01:41.130> like<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.430> specs<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.210> this

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
research it looks like the specs on this

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.710 
research it looks like the specs on this
device<00:01:43.369> aren't<00:01:44.369> any<00:01:44.610> better<00:01:45.090> than<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.479> phone

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
device aren't any better than the phone

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.310 
device aren't any better than the phone
that<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:45.990> currently<00:01:46.079> have<00:01:46.939> so<00:01:47.939> upon<00:01:48.720> doing<00:01:49.110> some

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
that I currently have so upon doing some

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.410 
that I currently have so upon doing some
little<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.680> little<00:01:50.369> research<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.850> decided<00:01:51.210> I

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
little a little research I decided I

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.480 
little a little research I decided I
would<00:01:51.479> try<00:01:51.570> putting<00:01:52.380> these<00:01:52.530> emulators<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:53.310> my

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
would try putting these emulators on my

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.789 
would try putting these emulators on my
phone<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:54.090> i<00:01:54.329> have<00:01:54.570> here<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:55.140> connect<00:01:55.710> them

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
phone that i have here and connect them

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.190 
phone that i have here and connect them
with<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.979> Bluetooth<00:01:56.340> controller<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.119> see<00:01:58.049> how

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
with a Bluetooth controller and see how

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.600 
with a Bluetooth controller and see how
we<00:01:58.259> do<00:01:58.590> so<00:02:00.439> that's<00:02:01.439> what<00:02:01.680> we're<00:02:01.829> going<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.040> try

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
we do so that's what we're going to try

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.880 
we do so that's what we're going to try
out<00:02:02.850> right<00:02:03.060> now<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.320> need<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:06.350> do<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.500> input

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
out right now so I need to do the input

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.559 
out right now so I need to do the input
settings<00:02:08.929> like<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.080> key<00:02:10.289> mappings

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
settings like the key mappings

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:20.709 
settings like the key mappings
oh<00:02:18.069> you<00:02:19.069> know<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.400> don't<00:02:19.670> need<00:02:19.879> it<00:02:20.060> evil

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:20.719

the<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.040> ps3<00:02:51.880> i'm<00:02:52.030> using<00:02:52.240> a<00:02:52.480> ps3<00:02:52.750> controller

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
the the ps3 i'm using a ps3 controller

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.950 
the the ps3 i'm using a ps3 controller
um<00:02:53.590> yeah<00:02:54.580> so<00:02:54.790> for<00:02:55.300> some<00:02:55.420> reason<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.810> doesn't
