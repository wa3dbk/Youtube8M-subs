pick<00:00:10.679> up<00:00:10.830> scout<00:00:11.190> class<00:00:11.429> transformers<00:00:12.360> but

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
pick up scout class transformers but

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.240 
pick up scout class transformers but
this<00:00:12.840> one<00:00:13.019> in<00:00:13.259> particular<00:00:13.469> caught<00:00:14.070> my<00:00:14.099> eye

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
this one in particular caught my eye

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.430 
this one in particular caught my eye
because<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:15.120> does<00:00:15.630> have<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.900> very<00:00:16.230> unique

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
because it does have a very unique

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.630 
because it does have a very unique
looking<00:00:17.160> jet<00:00:18.119> mode<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:19.100> also<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.130> very<00:00:20.369> cool

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
looking jet mode and also a very cool

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.640 
looking jet mode and also a very cool
looking<00:00:20.820> robot<00:00:21.359> mode<00:00:21.539> now<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.289> does<00:00:22.410> come

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
looking robot mode now it does come

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.189 
looking robot mode now it does come
packaged<00:00:23.039> in<00:00:23.340> robot<00:00:23.760> mode<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:24.750> i<00:00:24.779> will<00:00:25.170> be

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
packaged in robot mode so i will be

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.929 
packaged in robot mode so i will be
doing<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.529> transformation<00:00:26.099> from<00:00:26.160> robot<00:00:26.580> to

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
doing the transformation from robot to

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.900 
doing the transformation from robot to
alt<00:00:27.210> mode<00:00:27.390> in<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:27.810> review<00:00:28.279> but<00:00:29.279> first<00:00:29.550> let's

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
alt mode in this review but first let's

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.299 
alt mode in this review but first let's
take<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.090> look<00:00:30.300> at<00:00:30.359> robot<00:00:30.840> mode<00:00:31.160> sunspot<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.279> a

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
take a look at robot mode sunspot is a

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.970 
take a look at robot mode sunspot is a
really<00:00:32.550> nice<00:00:32.640> figure<00:00:33.000> very<00:00:33.540> poseable<00:00:34.050> as<00:00:34.200> you

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
really nice figure very poseable as you

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.160 
really nice figure very poseable as you
can<00:00:35.100> see<00:00:35.219> comes<00:00:35.520> with<00:00:35.700> two<00:00:35.910> handheld<00:00:36.719> weapons

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
can see comes with two handheld weapons

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.080 
can see comes with two handheld weapons
kind<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.309> axis<00:00:39.260> it's<00:00:40.260> got<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
kind of like axis it's got the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.389 
kind of like axis it's got the
Decepticon<00:00:42.090> symbol<00:00:42.930> there<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.469> both<00:00:44.100> arms

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
Decepticon symbol there on both arms

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.160 
Decepticon symbol there on both arms
actually<00:00:44.940> we<00:00:45.329> take<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> look<00:00:45.629> over<00:00:45.750> here<00:00:45.989> he<00:00:46.110> has

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
actually we take a look over here he has

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.010 
actually we take a look over here he has
it<00:00:46.320> over<00:00:46.469> here<00:00:46.620> as<00:00:46.710> well<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.750> if<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:48.809> look<00:00:48.930> at

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
it over here as well and if we look at

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.010 
it over here as well and if we look at
the<00:00:49.140> back<00:00:49.320> here<00:00:49.680> very<00:00:50.399> nice<00:00:50.610> wings<00:00:50.879> as<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.930> can

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
the back here very nice wings as you can

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.229 
the back here very nice wings as you can
see<00:00:52.199> there<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.879> if<00:00:53.879> you're<00:00:53.969> wondering<00:00:54.000> about

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
see there and if you're wondering about

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.060 
see there and if you're wondering about
these<00:00:54.570> gaps<00:00:54.989> here<00:00:55.320> or<00:00:55.469> these<00:00:55.590> holes<00:00:55.829> I'll

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
these gaps here or these holes I'll

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.479 
these gaps here or these holes I'll
explain<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.399> later<00:00:57.770> so<00:00:58.770> let's<00:00:59.129> take<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.309> look

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
explain that later so let's take a look

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.240 
explain that later so let's take a look
at<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.730> articulation<00:01:00.390> for<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.629> figure

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
at the articulation for this figure

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.030 
at the articulation for this figure
there's<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.550> head<00:01:03.650> due<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
there's the head due to the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.289 
there's the head due to the
transformation<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.820> head<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:06.119> go<00:01:06.270> like<00:01:06.869> that

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
transformation the head can go like that

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.910 
transformation the head can go like that
of<00:01:09.299> course<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.720> actual<00:01:10.260> head<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.560> attached<00:01:10.830> to

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
of course the actual head is attached to

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.060 
of course the actual head is attached to
a<00:01:11.010> ball<00:01:11.220> joint<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:12.360> you've<00:01:12.479> got<00:01:13.070> articulation

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
a ball joint so you've got articulation

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.270 
a ball joint so you've got articulation
there<00:01:15.170> you've<00:01:16.170> got<00:01:16.350> bulge<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.740> your<00:01:16.890> shoulders

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
there you've got bulge on your shoulders

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.620 
there you've got bulge on your shoulders
ball<00:01:18.030> jointed<00:01:18.570> elbows<00:01:20.030> there<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.210> no<00:01:21.450> waste

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
ball jointed elbows there is no waste

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.630 
ball jointed elbows there is no waste
articulation<00:01:22.520> yep<00:01:23.520> ball<00:01:23.700> jointed<00:01:24.380> hips<00:01:25.640> sliva

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
articulation yep ball jointed hips sliva

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.260 
articulation yep ball jointed hips sliva
lat<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.150> hip<00:01:27.680> you<00:01:28.680> have<00:01:28.860> rotation<00:01:29.369> here<00:01:29.670> but

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
lat the hip you have rotation here but

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.210 
lat the hip you have rotation here but
that's<00:01:30.420> largely<00:01:30.990> due<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.590> transformation

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
that's largely due to the transformation

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.899 
that's largely due to the transformation
but<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.490> do<00:01:32.610> have<00:01:32.790> posed<00:01:33.720> ability<00:01:34.049> there<00:01:34.909> now

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
but you do have posed ability there now

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.609 
but you do have posed ability there now
the<00:01:35.970> feet<00:01:36.270> are<00:01:36.420> kind<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.689> unique<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.439> see

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
the feet are kind of unique you can see

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.730 
the feet are kind of unique you can see
they're<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> spring<00:01:38.600> typo<00:01:39.600> joint<00:01:39.960> if<00:01:40.259> you

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
they're on a spring typo joint if you

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.569 
they're on a spring typo joint if you
push<00:01:41.189> them<00:01:41.340> they'll<00:01:42.000> go<00:01:42.240> forward<00:01:43.070> so<00:01:44.070> you

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
push them they'll go forward so you

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.889 
push them they'll go forward so you
gotta<00:01:44.759> kind<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:45.000> push<00:01:45.210> up<00:01:45.329> against<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.630> ground

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
gotta kind of push up against the ground

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.289 
gotta kind of push up against the ground
to<00:01:46.140> make<00:01:46.320> them<00:01:46.439> fully<00:01:46.950> extend<00:01:47.399> which<00:01:48.060> is

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
to make them fully extend which is

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.899 
to make them fully extend which is
pretty<00:01:49.110> cool<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:50.130> sometimes<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.670> can<00:01:50.759> make

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
pretty cool but sometimes it can make

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.889 
pretty cool but sometimes it can make
posing<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.509> figure<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:52.079> little<00:01:52.530> difficult

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
posing the figure a little difficult

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.899 
posing the figure a little difficult
anyhow<00:01:55.579> going<00:01:56.579> back<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.060> wings<00:01:58.670> it<00:01:59.670> also

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
anyhow going back to the wings it also

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.700 
anyhow going back to the wings it also
is<00:02:00.240> mounted<00:02:00.659> onto<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.960> shoulder<00:02:01.290> on<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.469> ball

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
is mounted onto the shoulder on a ball

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.830 
is mounted onto the shoulder on a ball
joint<00:02:01.740> as<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.250> can<00:02:02.369> see<00:02:02.549> there<00:02:02.790> now<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.479> wings

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
joint as you can see there now the wings

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.510 
joint as you can see there now the wings
themselves<00:02:04.500> do<00:02:04.710> have<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> wide<00:02:05.159> range<00:02:05.340> of

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
themselves do have a wide range of

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.910 
themselves do have a wide range of
motion<00:02:05.670> because<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.530> articulation<00:02:07.530> so

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
motion because of that articulation so

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.870 
motion because of that articulation so
you<00:02:08.009> can<00:02:08.099> go<00:02:08.280> up<00:02:09.209> like<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.629> if<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.020> wanted<00:02:10.259> to

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
you can go up like that if you wanted to

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.100 
you can go up like that if you wanted to
you<00:02:12.510> can<00:02:12.630> go<00:02:12.810> forward<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:14.630> kind<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.750> like<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:16.050> a

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
you can go forward I kind of like this a

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.760 
you can go forward I kind of like this a
little<00:02:16.290> bit<00:02:16.530> sort<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.160> attack<00:02:17.970> mode

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
little bit sort of like a attack mode

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.620 
little bit sort of like a attack mode
but<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:20.280> can<00:02:20.430> see<00:02:20.610> there's<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.850> wide<00:02:21.060> range<00:02:21.300> of

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
but you can see there's a wide range of

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
but you can see there's a wide range of
possibility<00:02:22.260> with<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.070> figure

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.240 

now<00:02:31.489> as<00:02:31.939> far<00:02:32.120> as<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.329> weapons<00:02:32.629> go<00:02:32.920> in<00:02:33.920> this<00:02:34.040> way

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
now as far as the weapons go in this way

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.649 
now as far as the weapons go in this way
in<00:02:34.430> this<00:02:34.579> case<00:02:34.790> they're<00:02:35.060> actually<00:02:35.329> just<00:02:35.360> paid

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:35.659 
in this case they're actually just paid

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.920 
in this case they're actually just paid
into<00:02:36.049> the<00:02:37.030> hand<00:02:38.030> as<00:02:38.329> you<00:02:38.420> can<00:02:38.540> see<00:02:38.720> there

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
into the hand as you can see there

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.170 
into the hand as you can see there
there's<00:02:39.079> a<00:02:39.260> pagan<00:02:39.799> hole<00:02:39.980> now<00:02:40.700> they<00:02:40.909> do<00:02:41.030> have

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
there's a pagan hole now they do have

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.990 
there's a pagan hole now they do have
this<00:02:41.360> little<00:02:41.569> u-shaped<00:02:42.459> connector<00:02:43.459> which<00:02:43.849> you

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
this little u-shaped connector which you

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.990 
this little u-shaped connector which you
can<00:02:44.120> attach<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:44.599> to<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:45.680> forearm<00:02:46.310> I<00:02:46.519> believe

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
can attach it to the forearm I believe

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.720 
can attach it to the forearm I believe
is<00:02:47.120> what<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:47.390> purpose<00:02:47.840> is<00:02:47.930> for<00:02:48.280> like<00:02:49.280> that<00:02:49.489> if

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
is what the purpose is for like that if

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.210 
is what the purpose is for like that if
you<00:02:49.819> wanted<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.090> have<00:02:50.239> them<00:02:50.980> hold<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.099> weapon

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
you wanted to have them hold the weapon

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.759 
you wanted to have them hold the weapon
like<00:02:52.459> that<00:02:52.489> if<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:52.879> wanted<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.409> actually<00:02:54.409> what

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
like that if you wanted to actually what

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.199 
like that if you wanted to actually what
the<00:02:54.920> cool<00:02:55.099> part<00:02:55.370> of<00:02:55.400> these<00:02:55.549> weapons<00:02:55.879> are<00:02:55.970> is

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
the cool part of these weapons are is

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.530 
the cool part of these weapons are is
they<00:02:56.359> actually<00:02:56.480> can<00:02:57.140> be<00:02:57.290> stored<00:02:57.730> in<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:59.299> wings

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
they actually can be stored in the wings

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.390 
they actually can be stored in the wings
so<00:02:59.989> you<00:03:00.049> can<00:03:00.200> have<00:03:00.319> storage<00:03:00.650> mode<00:03:00.920> actually

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
so you can have storage mode actually

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.539 
so you can have storage mode actually
and<00:03:01.780> as<00:03:02.780> I<00:03:03.170> said<00:03:03.230> before<00:03:03.379> those<00:03:03.769> caps<00:03:04.129> and<00:03:04.489> the

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
and as I said before those caps and the

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.949 
and as I said before those caps and the
wings<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:05.930> just<00:03:06.079> peg<00:03:06.260> these<00:03:06.440> in<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:08.030> they

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
wings you just peg these in and they

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.089 
wings you just peg these in and they
just<00:03:09.139> snap<00:03:09.260> into<00:03:09.590> place<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:10.069> as<00:03:10.190> you<00:03:10.280> can<00:03:10.400> see

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
just snap into place and as you can see

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.220 
just snap into place and as you can see
fills<00:03:13.099> in<00:03:13.340> that<00:03:13.489> gap<00:03:13.730> in<00:03:14.329> the<00:03:14.480> wing<00:03:14.629> section

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
fills in that gap in the wing section

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.629 
fills in that gap in the wing section
there<00:03:15.409> and<00:03:15.739> once<00:03:16.519> again<00:03:16.639> it<00:03:16.939> is<00:03:17.060> get<00:03:18.639> pegged

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639 
there and once again it is get pegged

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.330 
there and once again it is get pegged
into<00:03:19.879> the<00:03:19.970> wing<00:03:20.799> which<00:03:21.799> is<00:03:21.920> a<00:03:21.950> really<00:03:22.159> cool

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
into the wing which is a really cool

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.160 
into the wing which is a really cool
feature<00:03:22.519> I<00:03:22.730> think<00:03:22.939> because<00:03:23.209> it's<00:03:23.510> you<00:03:23.900> kind<00:03:24.109> of

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
feature I think because it's you kind of

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.190 
feature I think because it's you kind of
have<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.319> storage<00:03:24.769> mode<00:03:24.950> for<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.340> weapons<00:03:25.639> and

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
have a storage mode for the weapons and

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.129 
have a storage mode for the weapons and
they<00:03:27.200> don't<00:03:27.290> get<00:03:27.470> lost<00:03:27.650> as<00:03:28.099> well<00:03:28.159> so<00:03:28.959> all<00:03:29.959> right

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
they don't get lost as well so all right

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.970 
they don't get lost as well so all right
so<00:03:30.349> transformation<00:03:31.010> wise<00:03:32.500> you<00:03:33.500> can<00:03:33.620> see<00:03:33.769> here

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
so transformation wise you can see here

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.580 
so transformation wise you can see here
the<00:03:34.099> shoulders<00:03:34.489> if<00:03:34.760> you<00:03:35.150> pull<00:03:35.419> them<00:03:35.569> out<00:03:35.720> they

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
the shoulders if you pull them out they

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.650 
the shoulders if you pull them out they
actually<00:03:37.010> extend<00:03:37.790> out<00:03:37.910> like<00:03:38.060> that<00:03:38.209> this<00:03:38.510> is

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
actually extend out like that this is

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.569 
actually extend out like that this is
more<00:03:38.900> to<00:03:39.199> lock<00:03:39.410> it<00:03:39.530> in<00:03:39.620> place<00:03:39.709> for<00:03:40.129> a<00:03:40.160> robot

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
more to lock it in place for a robot

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.520 
more to lock it in place for a robot
mode<00:03:40.730> but<00:03:41.510> for<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:41.750> transformation<00:03:42.109> you<00:03:42.379> want

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
mode but for the transformation you want

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.439 
mode but for the transformation you want
to<00:03:42.590> take<00:03:42.739> out<00:03:42.859> the<00:03:43.010> shoulders<00:03:43.370> get<00:03:44.030> that<00:03:44.209> joint

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:44.449 
to take out the shoulders get that joint

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:48.009 
to take out the shoulders get that joint
loose<00:03:44.690> like<00:03:45.199> that<00:03:46.510> then<00:03:47.510> what<00:03:47.659> you<00:03:47.750> want<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:47.930> do

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
loose like that then what you want to do

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.599 
loose like that then what you want to do
with<00:03:48.169> the<00:03:48.290> arms<00:03:48.739> if<00:03:48.919> you<00:03:48.949> want<00:03:49.099> take<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.310> arms

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
with the arms if you want take the arms

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.149 
with the arms if you want take the arms
and<00:03:49.790> rotate<00:03:50.060> them<00:03:50.120> like<00:03:50.269> that<00:03:50.480> so<00:03:50.810> that<00:03:51.159> you've

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 
and rotate them like that so that you've

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:54.189 
and rotate them like that so that you've
got<00:03:52.370> everything<00:03:52.849> lined<00:03:53.060> up<00:03:53.359> looking<00:03:54.019> like

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
got everything lined up looking like

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.800 
got everything lined up looking like
that<00:03:54.560> see<00:03:55.040> there's<00:03:55.190> a<00:03:55.250> nice<00:03:55.790> continuous<00:03:56.090> color

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
that see there's a nice continuous color

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.030 
that see there's a nice continuous color
of<00:03:57.019> orange<00:03:57.199> there<00:03:59.199> bring<00:04:00.199> the<00:04:00.319> legs<00:04:00.500> down<00:04:00.739> and

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
of orange there bring the legs down and

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.710 
of orange there bring the legs down and
actually<00:04:01.159> for<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.489> legs<00:04:01.729> Bend<00:04:02.449> leave<00:04:02.629> them

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
actually for the legs Bend leave them

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.180 
actually for the legs Bend leave them
like<00:04:02.840> that<00:04:02.870> for<00:04:03.229> now<00:04:04.359> and<00:04:05.709> this<00:04:06.709> is<00:04:06.829> going<00:04:06.979> to

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
like that for now and this is going to

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.110 
like that for now and this is going to
come<00:04:07.489> back<00:04:07.639> like<00:04:07.879> this<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:09.909> tab<00:04:10.909> with<00:04:11.060> the

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
come back like this and tab with the

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.550 
come back like this and tab with the
place<00:04:11.299> like<00:04:11.479> that<00:04:11.510> and<00:04:11.870> just<00:04:11.930> the<00:04:12.139> same<00:04:12.319> thing

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
place like that and just the same thing

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.740 
place like that and just the same thing
with<00:04:12.709> the<00:04:12.859> other<00:04:12.889> arm<00:04:13.250> line<00:04:13.609> up<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:13.819> arm

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
with the other arm line up the arm
