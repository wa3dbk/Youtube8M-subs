the main grape here if we stick our nose

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.550 
the main grape here if we stick our nose
in<00:02:00.490> this<00:02:00.700> mm-hmm<00:02:02.009> inhale<00:02:03.009> it's<00:02:03.490> just<00:02:03.789> as<00:02:03.939> pure

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
in this mm-hmm inhale it's just as pure

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.499 
in this mm-hmm inhale it's just as pure
gravelly<00:02:05.560> and<00:02:05.770> play<00:02:06.189> notes<00:02:06.939> in<00:02:07.180> that<00:02:07.210> wine

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
gravelly and play notes in that wine

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.870 
gravelly and play notes in that wine
right<00:02:07.930> um<00:02:08.229> this<00:02:09.130> is<00:02:09.220> very<00:02:09.369> different<00:02:09.549> than<00:02:09.700> say

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
right um this is very different than say

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.479 
right um this is very different than say
Grenache<00:02:10.450> you'd<00:02:10.660> get<00:02:10.869> from<00:02:11.430> Australia<00:02:12.430> or

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
Grenache you'd get from Australia or

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.280 
Grenache you'd get from Australia or
California<00:02:13.180> right<00:02:13.510> which<00:02:13.870> would<00:02:13.989> be<00:02:14.109> much

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
California right which would be much

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.990 
California right which would be much
more<00:02:14.440> fruit<00:02:14.739> driven<00:02:15.070> and<00:02:15.250> that's<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.579> big

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
more fruit driven and that's the big

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.390 
more fruit driven and that's the big
difference<00:02:16.510> between<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:17.440> French<00:02:17.709> style<00:02:17.980> and

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
difference between the French style and

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.759 
difference between the French style and
the<00:02:19.209> new<00:02:19.359> world<00:02:19.540> styles<00:02:20.200> of<00:02:20.350> wine<00:02:20.470> that's

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
the new world styles of wine that's

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.130 
the new world styles of wine that's
earth<00:02:21.400> over<00:02:21.940> fruit<00:02:22.299> right<00:02:22.600> in<00:02:22.750> fact<00:02:22.900> that's

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
earth over fruit right in fact that's

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.229 
earth over fruit right in fact that's
that's<00:02:23.440> a<00:02:23.590> divide<00:02:23.829> that<00:02:24.100> we<00:02:24.340> can<00:02:24.609> in<00:02:24.910> general
