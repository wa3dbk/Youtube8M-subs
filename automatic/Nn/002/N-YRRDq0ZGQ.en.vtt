00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.119
 I just showed you the door how 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.920
 that can be done in a very easy way 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.750
 cleaning and the provision thereof 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.810
 you would also be very easy 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.579
 way you can clean my tires 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.110
 I will use jokes to dry them again 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.270
 to proclaim the spray, I'm going to 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.160
 make damp 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.320
 not too wet you better get one in between 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.430
 time when spraying I get too wet 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.469
 you stain it 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.750
 well just like at the door I put it on 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.610
 You put me on the wall and now I go the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.160
 I go for a very simple walk 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.629
 cleaning 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.629
 I pick up the first sides of the park 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.770
 and now i'm going to put the wall disk on a whole 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.770
 easy way 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.559
 5 jokes 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.430
 well this is a lot easier than with 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.880
 working a cloth becomes much more 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.100
 time and the great thing about it is that it 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.080
 end result is even better 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.760
 then with a normal cloth 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.650
 I am now writing again about the 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.900
 tiles around the other pieces too 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.150
 asked to take it well 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.100
 well what you see now that are 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.020
 water droplets on the tiles 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.820
 these values drop by anyway 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.649
 a streak-free assignment for that is it 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:39.080
 advantage of microfiber i now have above 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.850
 part of the country I did and now 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.940
 I go to the lower part of the 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.380
 edge what I will do first is that I have my 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.920
 joke once again the light ye 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.920
 to inject 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.259
 Now the bottom intention is that you don't 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.640
 written down 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.200
 the beauty of this joke that you too 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.970
 easily behind the heating can 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.619
 what I see now is a joke 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.360
 starts to get dirty i have 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.000
 pollution behind the heater off 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.070
 I just get a clean on you now 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.440
 passes and I continue with I 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.950
 Now have a clean on you confirm time 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.019
 on the picture and I go the joke I go 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.790
 lightning in life using 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.820
 clean water 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.530
 I now continue with the mittens below 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.780
 completely finished and last 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.160
 often wrote about it again 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.160
 to be able to take the past well 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.100
 You see that you are very simple 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.950
 way you can clean your walking 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.450
 you can take that much more with you 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.860
 of course you do a table with one 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.050
 but you have within a company 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.850
 lots of tables to do then you can go on 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.980
 a perfect and easy way you 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.290
 cleaning tables with this is what you want 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.640
 now show what i just said you can 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.990
 easily go wrong and all that 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.270
 The Netherlands 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:01.110
 the batch of spray and the table with flour 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.880
 he beautiful 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.650
 you know everyone around it can 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.560
 proposals are great here mentally 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.880
 its very quick here i'm not going 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.190
 around madrid 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.450
 thank you also for the days that I was alone 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.480
 stay 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.580
 I worked the table away completely 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.590
 if the joke is dry then jump 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.720
 between screening 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.060
 less dirt pick over 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.320
 I just take it according to just joke 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.810
 and I already have a very simple one 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.880
 way to go so much around the grooves 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.890
 I cleaned my thumb of it 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.320
 what i used in this 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.400
 instruction video are a few on 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.019
 material I have the glass joke with which 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.060
 I was perfectly able on the inside 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.769
 clean but you can possibly 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.840
 doors join in 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.450
 I have them just for the bathroom tiles 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.900
 I used this joke this man you 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.519
 also perfect tables cleaning me 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.830
 possibly for some rough edges but 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.530
 If you have a floor you can put it on you 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.120
 use where there are brush pieces 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.990
 these are some old pieces that made it 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.790
 make sure that 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.230
 raw material and gets better 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.250
