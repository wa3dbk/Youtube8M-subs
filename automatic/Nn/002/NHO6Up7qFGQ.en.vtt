00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.629
 insulin is a substance to which 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.299
 some bodybuilders resort to 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:12.429
 get a competitive advantage the 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.349
 satisfied with the use of steroids 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.910
 some of them have risked their 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.460
 lives with this medication that is 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.829
 potentially dangerous in the mind of 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.439
 many bodybuilders insulin is the 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:25.419
 almost perfect substance we will explain 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.340
 briefly what this can do 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.360
 substance to get results 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.189
 incredible 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.980
 first of all we will explain briefly 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.690
 what is insulin Insulin is a 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.789
 natural hormone secreted by our 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.679
 pancreas every time we consume a 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:41.260
 carbohydrate sugar levels in 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.730
 blood increase insulin simply 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.949
 takes care that these levels of 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.329
 sugar back to normal since the 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.120
 have blood sugar levels 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.800
 too high can be lethal indeed 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.629
 and for this reason diabetics 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.519
 they need to inject insulin after 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.530
 your meals since your pancreas does not 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.600
 produces enough so how do you 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.399
 realize this hormone is key to 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.499
 our metabolism on the other hand the 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.239
 having too much insulin is harmful 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:06.520
 since it can lower sugar levels 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.380
 in blood to zero which means that 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.490
 can put a person in a state of 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.220
 eat or even cause him love 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.590
 but do not be scared this only happens if 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.689
 you inject yourself uncontrollably if you're 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.000
 a healthy person your body will produce 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:22.369
 only the necessary amount of 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.380
 insulin as you have been able to check the 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.390
 Insulin issue is a bit tricky 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.299
 and maybe you wonder why someone 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.250
 would be able to use this substance it 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.130
 believes that the first use of insulin 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.229
 started with endurance athletes these 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.600
 they used this medication to force 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.700
 more sugar in the muscle fibers and 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.100
 therefore have more energy during 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.259
 your workouts and competitions more 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.119
 bodybuilders and 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.069
 discovered that this hormone could be 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.840
 used for the construction of 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.759
 muscle by holding the 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.100
 next protein essence and a better 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.869
 absorption of nutrients so as you 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.990
 realize this hormone is purely 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.909
 anabolic and now the question is can you 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.649
 benefit from insulin without having 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.119
 to inject ctera as we said 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.740
 before the insulin is secreted 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.780
 naturally the pancreas when 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.310
 we consume carbohydrates proteins and 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.440
 fats although the amounts 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.299
 signifiers segregate when 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.609
 we consume mostly carbohydrates 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.300
 surely you will be thinking that with the 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:19.730
 fact of eating 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.990
 high glycemic index foods you go to 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.630
 be able to take advantage of the benefits 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.610
 anabolic insulin and also 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.470
 you've heard of the famous peak of 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.570
 insulin to boost profits 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.640
 muscle because the truth of all this 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.160
 is that studies have come for 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.420
 convince us that this is a myth the 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.940
 reality is that natural foods 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.220
 they can not stimulate insulin what 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.770
 enough for them to get a 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.960
 anabolic benefit the reason for this is 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.240
 because our body segregates 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.610
 enough insulin to perform your 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.410
 functions and what is added is 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.960
 insignificant to be able to gain mass 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.700
 muscle so in other words the 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.010
 try to stimulate the insulin of 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.960
 Natural way will not make you gain mass 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.790
 muscular if you really want to see 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.250
 anabolic benefits through the 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.410
 insulin I would have to inject it already 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.060
 that in that way you will be able to stimulate 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.010
 insulin to a level at which you 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.080
 body is not able to segregate in a 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.570
 natural thing that obviously does not 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.550
 We recommend under no circumstances for another 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.860
 side you may consider changing your 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.600
 shake post training but this is a theme 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.790
 that we'll talk about in another video like 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.880
 conclusion we recommend you practice 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.730
 body-building 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.340
 and any sport in a natural way and 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.590
 sure it's not worth taking risks that 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.720
 can endanger your life many 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.420
 thanks for the video see you in the 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.810
 next video and as long as the 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.810
 madness
