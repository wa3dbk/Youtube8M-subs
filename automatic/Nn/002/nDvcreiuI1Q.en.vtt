00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.060
 already in the hanns-braun-straße these new cameras show book 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.060
 intelligent practical technology understands 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.729
 their compact transport measures 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:18.729
 enable a trouble-free procedure on the road 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.570
 through their maneuverability and backbones freedom, they are also problem-free 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.669
 hang downtown construction sites used 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:28.150
 Became reality 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.470
 in transport boxes for 25 Kallenhardt as on other routes for 80 km / h 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.470
 to disposal 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.679
 Mr. Mulisch 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.740
 fast and hydraulic 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.170
 the Alizé Cornet can be mounted in a surprisingly short time 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.500
 after arrival at the construction site, the barriers are unfolded and the 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.370
 Doormats attached 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.510
 In this phase, the under cart can be swiveled 360 degrees and can thus be moved in 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.800
 be brought to any position 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.020
 Sowas also carried out the removal after disassembly in each direction 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.760
 can be 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.030
 through the hydraulic straightening of the master and outrigger package and am yourself 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.520
 This will change the focus he will have on his dwindling 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.490
 set or burst 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.319
 Front and rear axles are released and can be easily removed 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.820
 the well-thought-out kinematics of the cutter has been with the TK since its 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.030
 Advantages not only in the speed of assembly 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.190
 the erection takes place simply by the use of hydraulics spare forces 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.190
 and in complete safety for the fitter 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.850
 With the help of the main pupil, the Charité is off the transport position 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.750
 on approx 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.750
 All ropes are reeved and taut 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.860
 February 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.640
 What will become easy here 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.689
 Saving power and accurately using the hydraulic pair ballast your sky + 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.689
 who operates via the radio remote control 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:18.529
 Dianetics have been used at different speeds 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:20.899
 become 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:24.289
 Due to the increasingly frequented inner city construction sites with their mostly 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:25.889
 very tight space 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:30.450
 What a call to the engineers of Butter the HTP fast assembly Kane 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.450
 to develop silhouette with a low-cost assembly 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:37.650
 After the saddest can get up from the transportation position 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:40.419
 twice the sad is every copying of the mast 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:43.999
 a maximum hook height of 32 meters 20 can be achieved 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:47.350
 an additional assembly of between masts 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.599
 This is not required 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.509
 the lock the telescope her were mastes 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:54.909
 fully automatic 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.349
 after the desired Hagen height is reached 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.890
 The boom will unfold in a roll 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.480
 from the top and trial full of obstacles to its maximum length 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.480
 unfolded 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.650
 Dr 

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:20.319
 the assembly have silhouette of reality 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.379
 unique at first glance 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.309
 HDD performances and high tech 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:30.169
 The mast consists of 3 telescope inside it were inside and outside 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:33.949
 galvanized by contrasts with twelve or Rudi 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:35.669
 cantonal cross section 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:39.439
 Due to the approximate raw form of the masses has an extraordinary 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:42.439
 Torsional rigidity and vibration stability 

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:46.889
 in the course of the telescope her shirt fully automatically locks the mast 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.999
 when disassembling is also fully automatic unlocked 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.089
 the hydraulic boom unfolding Erfurt above all obstacles as 

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:57.769
 Roll unfolding with the help of hydraulic cylinders 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.099
 in shortest time 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.299
 Also in the operated technique is butter came to Iraq 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.569
 gone new ways 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.070
 they can be equipped with a spacious crane cab cab 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.080
 which can be entered upright through a rear door 

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:16.849
 with the integrated radio remote control, the cab is moved around and 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:17.739
 crane operator 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.209
 infinitely adjustable in height and can be placed anywhere 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.090
 be stopped 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.370
 Thus, the perspective of the crane operator 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.660
 optimally adapted to the visibility on the construction site 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.830
 Great 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.310
 the hall stands without publicity of butter are standard 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.070
 equipped with a frequency response rule limited factory 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.070
 for precise and oscillates free movement sequences 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.199
 according to need can also prompt and chats chassis regulated as a frequency 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.210
 Drives are running 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.940
 As standard, the cables are in operation for two or four lines 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.550
 fitted 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.740
 flexibility 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.759
 stepless and atmospheric speed control 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:59.520
 the preliminary work for the 4th 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.139
 through precise and sensitive loads movement 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:03.120
 July and thus 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.520
 to the outstanding features of the disease
