athlete<00:01:03.890> well<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.920> think<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.610> these<00:01:05.759> proteins

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
athlete well I think that these proteins

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.020 
athlete well I think that these proteins
as<00:01:06.659> you'll<00:01:06.869> see<00:01:07.229> are<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.009> best<00:01:08.249> proteins<00:01:08.819> on

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
as you'll see are the best proteins on

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.520 
as you'll see are the best proteins on
the<00:01:09.149> planet<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.109> best<00:01:10.829> bar<00:01:11.399> none<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:12.380> use<00:01:13.380> these

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the planet the best bar none I use these

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.489 
the planet the best bar none I use these
in<00:01:13.590> combinations<00:01:14.399> okay<00:01:14.880> I've<00:01:15.359> lost<00:01:15.689> about<00:01:15.990> 35

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:16.499 
in combinations okay I've lost about 35

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:19.879 
in combinations okay I've lost about 35
pounds<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.369> just<00:01:18.209> I<00:01:18.329> call<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.719> baggage<00:01:19.229> stuff

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:19.889

serve my mind I was eating the incorrect
forms<00:01:26.039> of<00:01:26.159> protein<00:01:26.549> now<00:01:27.509> as<00:01:27.929> you<00:01:28.229> can<00:01:28.350> see<00:01:28.409> I

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:28.859 
forms of protein now as you can see I

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:30.709 
forms of protein now as you can see I
eat<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.789> stuff<00:01:30.090> I've<00:01:30.270> been<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.479> vegetarian

and when you put these super proteins I

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.769 
and when you put these super proteins I
call<00:01:50.009> them<00:01:50.219> super<00:01:50.609> fuels<00:01:50.909> into<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.299> machine

00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:51.779 
call them super fuels into this machine

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:55.370 
call them super fuels into this machine
it's<00:01:52.679> changes<00:01:53.669> the<00:01:53.909> idea<00:01:54.389> of<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.779> body<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.319> it

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
it's changes the idea of a body and it

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.949 
it's changes the idea of a body and it
turns<00:01:55.619> into<00:01:55.969> actually<00:01:56.969> what<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.149> call<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> a

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 
turns into actually what I call a a

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:00.199 
turns into actually what I call a a
high-level<00:01:58.619> instrument<00:01:59.609> because<00:01:59.849> now<00:02:00.029> it's

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
high-level instrument because now it's

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:02.929 
high-level instrument because now it's
starting<00:02:00.569> to<00:02:00.599> function<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.939> championship

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
starting to function like a championship

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.919 
starting to function like a championship
car<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:04.349> is<00:02:04.469> going<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.739> race<00:02:05.179> okay<00:02:06.179> now<00:02:06.659> the

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
car that is going to race okay now the

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:08.240 
car that is going to race okay now the
last<00:02:06.959> thing<00:02:07.380> you're<00:02:07.499> going<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.679> put<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:07.919> a<00:02:08.009> car

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
last thing you're going to put in a car

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.219 
last thing you're going to put in a car
is<00:02:08.459> bad<00:02:08.700> fuel<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.869> so

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
is bad fuel and so

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.630 
is bad fuel and so
this<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.619> what<00:02:10.769> we're<00:02:10.920> going<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.069> show<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.340> is

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
this is what we're going to show you is

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.930 
this is what we're going to show you is
some<00:02:11.879> supreme<00:02:12.480> fool<00:02:13.050> in<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.409> next<00:02:13.680> video<00:02:13.980> as

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
some supreme fool in the next video as

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.850 
some supreme fool in the next video as
you<00:02:15.090> can<00:02:15.239> see<00:02:15.450> there's<00:02:16.049> lots<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.470> different

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
you can see there's lots of different

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.410 
you can see there's lots of different
proteins<00:02:17.280> that<00:02:17.400> we<00:02:17.610> have<00:02:17.849> and<00:02:18.120> all<00:02:18.209> you're

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
proteins that we have and all you're

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.660 
proteins that we have and all you're
going<00:02:18.569> to<00:02:18.659> do<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.900> simple<00:02:19.260> exchange<00:02:19.769> program

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
going to do is a simple exchange program

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.899 
going to do is a simple exchange program
that's<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.780> this<00:02:22.560> for<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.159> did<00:02:23.580> protect

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
that's it this for that did protect

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.660 
that's it this for that did protect
simple<00:02:24.810> you're<00:02:25.260> not<00:02:25.379> adding<00:02:25.620> these<00:02:26.010> things<00:02:26.069> to

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
simple you're not adding these things to

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.460 
simple you're not adding these things to
your<00:02:26.790> diet<00:02:27.060> you're<00:02:27.330> exchanging<00:02:27.540> them<00:02:28.080> in<00:02:28.230> for

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
your diet you're exchanging them in for

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.420 
your diet you're exchanging them in for
a<00:02:28.500> while<00:02:28.910> even<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.569> bird<00:02:30.959> here<00:02:31.379> watch<00:02:32.099> old

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
a while even this bird here watch old

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.500 
a while even this bird here watch old
was<00:02:32.760> his<00:02:33.060> name

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
was his name

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.350 
was his name
watch<00:02:33.810> although<00:02:34.280> he<00:02:35.280> if<00:02:35.549> he<00:02:35.730> eats<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.150> wrong

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
watch although he if he eats the wrong

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.640 
watch although he if he eats the wrong
proteins<00:02:37.019> he<00:02:37.829> gets<00:02:38.040> sick<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.610> actually<00:02:39.269> dies

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
proteins he gets sick and actually dies

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.910 
proteins he gets sick and actually dies
okay

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
okay

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.619 
okay
we've<00:02:41.129> had<00:02:41.310> several<00:02:41.579> birds<00:02:41.909> here<00:02:42.209> with<00:02:42.480> the

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
we've had several birds here with the

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.339 
we've had several birds here with the
incorrect<00:02:43.049> food<00:02:43.670> cooked<00:02:44.670> food<00:02:45.000> meats<00:02:45.690> they

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
incorrect food cooked food meats they

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.440 
incorrect food cooked food meats they
just<00:02:46.590> got<00:02:46.739> sick<00:02:47.010> we<00:02:47.640> couldn't<00:02:48.060> figure<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.359> out

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
just got sick we couldn't figure it out

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.759 
just got sick we couldn't figure it out
but<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:48.690> guys<00:02:48.840> were<00:02:49.019> taking<00:02:49.170> care<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.500> before

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
but the guys were taking care of before

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.770 
but the guys were taking care of before
while<00:02:49.890> when<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.099> was<00:02:50.129> gone<00:02:50.459> so<00:02:50.700> anyway<00:02:51.269> correct

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
while when I was gone so anyway correct

while when I was gone so anyway correct
protein<00:02:52.230> get<00:02:52.650> on<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.920> right<00:02:53.069> track<00:02:53.370> you'll

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
protein get on the right track you'll

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.000 
protein get on the right track you'll
see<00:02:54.150> what<00:02:54.359> it<00:02:54.450> does<00:02:54.599> for<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.049> I<00:02:55.230> know<00:02:55.500> what<00:02:55.920> it

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
see what it does for you I know what it

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.130 
see what it does for you I know what it
does<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.340> me<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:57.299> know<00:02:57.359> what<00:02:57.720> its<00:02:57.840> gonna<00:02:57.900> do

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
does to me and I know what its gonna do

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.750 
does to me and I know what its gonna do
for<00:02:58.349> you<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.620> problem<00:02:58.829> is<00:02:59.129> is<00:02:59.310> that<00:02:59.340> you're

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
for you the problem is is that you're

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.550 
for you the problem is is that you're
gonna<00:02:59.910> have<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.299> figure<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:00.629> out<00:03:00.810> for<00:03:01.109> yourself

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
gonna have to figure it out for yourself

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.979 
gonna have to figure it out for yourself
so<00:03:02.370> if<00:03:02.819> you're<00:03:02.970> looking<00:03:03.269> for<00:03:03.390> optimization

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
so if you're looking for optimization

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.259 
so if you're looking for optimization
check<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.799> out<00:03:04.950> you'll<00:03:05.430> see<00:03:05.670> we'll<00:03:06.000> see<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.209> in
