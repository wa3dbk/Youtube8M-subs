00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:52.489

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.379
 Although next to me are still the route 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.010

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.199
 Maybe you know me from yesterday 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.750

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.570

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.320

 So things can do here too 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.270
 so you've seen her, but me 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.250
 believe she will not have to go soon 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.810

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.329

 Schachenmayr and I think it's really nice 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.119
 because the participants 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.310
 I hope men come too 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.000
 because I want so many men 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.000
 learn to knit that then during the day 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.710
 so winter sports can operate 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.330

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.159

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.680
 I'm looking forward to it and 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.810
 in the afternoon so if it is slow then 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.540
 It's getting cozy again outside 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.090

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.510
