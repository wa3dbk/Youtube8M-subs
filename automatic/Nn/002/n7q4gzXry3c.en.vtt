chucked<00:00:26.920> here

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
chucked here

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.190 
chucked here
whoa<00:00:27.369> guess<00:00:27.789> I<00:00:27.910> got<00:00:28.120> some<00:00:28.330> shove<00:00:28.690> I'm<00:00:28.990> just

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
whoa guess I got some shove I'm just

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.230 
whoa guess I got some shove I'm just
getting<00:00:29.440> out<00:00:29.590> of<00:00:29.770> the<00:00:29.860> leg<00:00:30.070> where<00:00:30.760> I<00:00:30.789> can<00:00:31.000> drill

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
getting out of the leg where I can drill

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.030 
getting out of the leg where I can drill
right<00:00:31.300> in<00:00:31.660> there<00:00:31.810> that<00:00:31.960> makes<00:00:32.140> them<00:00:32.349> kind<00:00:32.559> of

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
right in there that makes them kind of

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.340 
right in there that makes them kind of
upset<00:00:33.489> in<00:00:33.790> which<00:00:33.940> case<00:00:36.629> so<00:00:37.629> this<00:00:37.750> is<00:00:37.989> like<00:00:38.170> the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
upset in which case so this is like the

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.710 
upset in which case so this is like the
basic<00:00:38.920> role<00:00:39.430> so<00:00:39.640> here<00:00:39.879> it<00:00:39.940> is<00:00:40.030> in<00:00:40.180> super<00:00:40.510> slow

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
basic role so here it is in super slow

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:55.049 
basic role so here it is in super slow
motion<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:52.750> timing<00:00:53.610> let<00:00:54.610> me<00:00:54.670> show<00:00:54.820> you<00:00:54.910> how

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
motion so the timing let me show you how

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.569 
motion so the timing let me show you how
doesn't<00:00:55.870> doesn't<00:00:56.469> work<00:00:56.770> if<00:00:56.950> we<00:00:57.100> do<00:00:57.219> it<00:00:57.340> slow

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
doesn't doesn't work if we do it slow

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.869 
doesn't doesn't work if we do it slow
motion<00:00:58.590> if<00:00:59.590> I<00:00:59.770> open<00:01:00.280> I<00:01:00.489> can't<00:01:01.149> reach<00:01:01.480> him<00:01:01.899> yeah

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
motion if I open I can't reach him yeah

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.150 
motion if I open I can't reach him yeah
I'm<00:01:03.879> trying<00:01:04.270> to<00:01:04.390> go<00:01:04.570> when<00:01:05.229> he's<00:01:05.440> pushed<00:01:05.710> so<00:01:05.890> I

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
I'm trying to go when he's pushed so I

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:18.840 
I'm trying to go when he's pushed so I
have<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.610> collapse<00:01:07.119> around<00:01:15.690> so<00:01:16.690> if<00:01:17.549> we're<00:01:18.549> just

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
have to collapse around so if we're just

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.740 
have to collapse around so if we're just
in<00:01:19.060> a<00:01:19.210> reach<00:01:20.020> contest<00:01:20.650> I've<00:01:20.890> already<00:01:21.220> lost

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
in a reach contest I've already lost

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.539 
in a reach contest I've already lost
here<00:01:22.750> it<00:01:22.840> is<00:01:22.930> in<00:01:23.170> a<00:01:23.260> exaggerated<00:01:24.250> version<00:01:24.430> I'm

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
here it is in a exaggerated version I'm

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:31.230 
here it is in a exaggerated version I'm
shoved<00:01:27.390> wrapped<00:01:28.390> around<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.900> arm<00:01:29.880> I'm<00:01:30.880> trying

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
shoved wrapped around the arm I'm trying

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.780 
shoved wrapped around the arm I'm trying
to<00:01:31.390> come<00:01:31.600> around<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:32.260> arm<00:01:32.530> this<00:01:33.520> is<00:01:33.640> what<00:01:33.729> I

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
to come around the arm this is what I

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.039 
to come around the arm this is what I
was<00:01:33.880> saying<00:01:34.090> you<00:01:34.180> don't<00:01:34.390> respect<00:01:34.510> what<00:01:34.960> I'm

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
was saying you don't respect what I'm

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.450 
was saying you don't respect what I'm
trying<00:01:35.260> to<00:01:35.320> come<00:01:35.439> around<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.710> arm

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
trying to come around the arm

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.000 
trying to come around the arm
I<00:01:36.490> can't<00:01:37.210> reach<00:01:37.450> in<00:01:37.720> there<00:01:38.020> so<00:01:38.530> what<00:01:38.680> I<00:01:38.710> need<00:01:38.830> to

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
I can't reach in there so what I need to

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.780 
I can't reach in there so what I need to
do<00:01:39.220> is<00:01:39.369> fit<00:01:39.820> around<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:41.320> arm<00:01:41.500> this<00:01:41.860> way<00:01:42.130> where

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
do is fit around the arm this way where

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.240 
do is fit around the arm this way where
I<00:01:42.820> can<00:01:42.880> go<00:01:43.240> ahead<00:01:43.330> and<00:01:43.570> drive<00:01:43.840> in<00:01:44.170> super<00:01:45.040> slow

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
I can go ahead and drive in super slow

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.310 
I can go ahead and drive in super slow
motion<00:01:45.280> kind<00:01:45.820> of<00:01:45.970> funny<00:01:46.180> look<00:01:48.900> here<00:01:49.900> can<00:01:50.170> see

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
motion kind of funny look here can see

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.679 
motion kind of funny look here can see
how<00:01:50.380> my<00:01:50.500> chest<00:01:50.890> is<00:01:51.130> typically<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.670> same<00:01:51.790> like

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
how my chest is typically the same like

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.319 
how my chest is typically the same like
my<00:01:53.140> chest<00:01:53.500> is<00:01:53.619> Reverend<00:01:54.100> cuz<00:01:54.400> he's<00:01:54.579> shoving<00:01:55.119> in

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
my chest is Reverend cuz he's shoving in

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.929 
my chest is Reverend cuz he's shoving in
as<00:01:55.750> he<00:01:55.930> shoves<00:01:56.229> in<00:01:56.439> full<00:01:56.740> of<00:01:56.890> just<00:01:57.250> let<00:01:57.759> that

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
as he shoves in full of just let that

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.480 
as he shoves in full of just let that
happen<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:58.720> I'll<00:01:59.290> be<00:01:59.470> in<00:01:59.560> my<00:01:59.740> position<00:02:00.100> if

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
happen and I'll be in my position if

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.700 
happen and I'll be in my position if
he's<00:02:00.970> shoving<00:02:01.390> in<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:01.810> I<00:02:01.869> try<00:02:02.079> to<00:02:02.140> use

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
he's shoving in and I try to use

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.469 
he's shoving in and I try to use
rigidity<00:02:04.049> back<00:02:05.049> up<00:02:05.380> no<00:02:05.770> it's<00:02:05.979> not<00:02:06.130> work<00:02:06.479> same

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
rigidity back up no it's not work same

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.520 
rigidity back up no it's not work same
arm<00:02:07.860> same<00:02:08.860> arm<00:02:09.160> same<00:02:10.030> space<00:02:10.420> same<00:02:10.929> physics

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
arm same arm same space same physics

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:28.110 
arm same arm same space same physics
whole<00:02:12.070> different<00:02:12.459> result<00:02:12.850> I'm<00:02:25.650> sure<00:02:27.120> like

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
whole different result I'm sure like

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.220 
whole different result I'm sure like
this<00:02:28.389> okay<00:02:30.090> yeah<00:02:31.090> reach<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.660> even<00:02:31.930> though<00:02:32.139> I

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
this okay yeah reach it even though I

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.550 
this okay yeah reach it even though I
was<00:02:32.370> maybe<00:02:33.370> trying<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:34.000> practice<00:02:34.560> it's

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
was maybe trying to practice it's

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:47.370 
was maybe trying to practice it's
possible<00:02:41.730> underneath<00:02:42.730> hit<00:02:45.900> if<00:02:46.900> he<00:02:47.049> doesn't

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
possible underneath hit if he doesn't

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:58.360 
possible underneath hit if he doesn't
hit<00:02:47.530> come<00:02:47.949> back

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.280 

this<00:02:59.370> series<00:03:00.499> it's<00:03:01.499> the<00:03:01.560> same<00:03:01.799> principle
