00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
unique dude and it's balanced I mean

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.639 
unique dude and it's balanced I mean
it's<00:00:47.700> awesome<00:00:48.149> how<00:00:48.300> listen<00:00:48.750> mode<00:00:48.960> especially

like<00:00:49.800> you'd<00:00:49.980> think<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.550> would<00:00:50.670> be

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
like you'd think that that would be

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.389 
like you'd think that that would be
overpowered<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.110> not<00:00:52.199> like<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:53.219> goes

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
overpowered but it's not like it goes

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
away so quickly and it takes forever for

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.709 
away so quickly and it takes forever for
it<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.070> recharge<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.120> use<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.510> again

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.870 
want to go do some other things and I
just<00:02:00.000> left<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.420> on<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.710> multiplayer<00:02:01.710> menu<00:02:02.159> but

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
just left it on the multiplayer menu but

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.109 
just left it on the multiplayer menu but
it<00:02:03.149> still<00:02:03.810> had<00:02:04.320> like<00:02:04.560> people<00:02:05.310> dying<00:02:05.700> like

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119
