00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.200 

the<00:00:18.289> air<00:00:18.439> chambers<00:00:18.980> of<00:00:19.160> the<00:00:19.400> cheek<00:00:19.640> pads<00:00:19.880> are

the air chambers of the cheek pads are

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.900 
the air chambers of the cheek pads are
inflated<00:00:20.900> with<00:00:21.079> a<00:00:21.109> pump<00:00:21.410> system<00:00:21.800> until<00:00:22.759> they

inflated with a pump system until they

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.269 
inflated with a pump system until they
mold<00:00:23.210> themselves<00:00:23.449> to<00:00:24.320> the<00:00:24.439> exact<00:00:24.800> shape<00:00:24.890> of

mold themselves to the exact shape of
the<00:00:25.699> lower<00:00:25.880> head<00:00:26.559> after<00:00:27.559> pumping<00:00:28.369> 10<00:00:28.699> to<00:00:28.820> 15

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.929 
the lower head after pumping 10 to 15
times<00:00:29.539> the<00:00:30.380> cheek<00:00:30.619> pads<00:00:30.829> will<00:00:31.339> adjust<00:00:31.640> to<00:00:31.849> the

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
times the cheek pads will adjust to the

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.299 
times the cheek pads will adjust to the
shape<00:00:32.119> of<00:00:32.239> the<00:00:32.390> face<00:00:32.599> and<00:00:32.899> will<00:00:33.769> consequently

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
shape of the face and will consequently

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.770 
shape of the face and will consequently
reduce<00:00:34.820> outside<00:00:35.780> noise<00:00:36.079> levels<00:00:37.360> only<00:00:38.360> the

reduce outside noise levels only the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.160 
reduce outside noise levels only the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
edges of the cheek pads are inflated

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.479 
edges of the cheek pads are inflated
therefore<00:00:42.170> they<00:00:42.500> guarantee<00:00:42.979> good<00:00:43.280> shock

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
therefore they guarantee good shock

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.119 
therefore they guarantee good shock
