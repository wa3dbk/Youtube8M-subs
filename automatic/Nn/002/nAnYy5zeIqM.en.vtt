behind the build on this TJ was that was
in<00:02:12.560> Tennessee<00:02:13.010> so<00:02:13.670> this<00:02:13.970> one<00:02:14.269> was<00:02:14.860> geared<00:02:15.860> as<00:02:16.040> a

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
in Tennessee so this one was geared as a

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.589 
in Tennessee so this one was geared as a
budget<00:02:16.640> bill<00:02:16.930> so<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.680> was<00:02:18.950> how<00:02:19.879> do<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:20.120> go<00:02:20.330> with

budget bill so it was how do you go with

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.050 
budget bill so it was how do you go with
a<00:02:20.799> fairly<00:02:21.799> small<00:02:21.860> lift<00:02:22.370> I<00:02:22.549> think<00:02:22.760> they<00:02:22.849> did<00:02:23.030> a

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
a fairly small lift I think they did a

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.150 
a fairly small lift I think they did a
three<00:02:23.360> or<00:02:23.480> four<00:02:23.750> inch<00:02:23.989> you<00:02:24.590> know<00:02:24.709> lift<00:02:24.920> kit<00:02:25.129> on

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
three or four inch you know lift kit on

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.830 
three or four inch you know lift kit on
it<00:02:25.340> get<00:02:26.120> 40s<00:02:26.599> on<00:02:26.780> it<00:02:26.989> they<00:02:27.290> put<00:02:28.360> junkyard<00:02:29.360> 60s

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
it get 40s on it they put junkyard 60s

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.170 
it get 40s on it they put junkyard 60s
in<00:02:29.989> it<00:02:30.170> I<00:02:30.290> mean<00:02:30.440> they<00:02:30.530> tried<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.099> just<00:02:31.340> keep<00:02:31.549> the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
in it I mean they tried to just keep the

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.270 
in it I mean they tried to just keep the
cost<00:02:32.480> down<00:02:32.660> but<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.620> wouldn't<00:02:33.920> know<00:02:33.950> it<00:02:34.069> the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
cost down but you wouldn't know it the

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.770 
cost down but you wouldn't know it the
thing<00:02:34.489> looks<00:02:34.730> trick<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.269> when<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.480> turned<00:02:35.720> out

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
thing looks trick it when it turned out

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.869 
thing looks trick it when it turned out
really<00:02:35.989> nice<00:02:36.170> they<00:02:36.950> just<00:02:37.129> rattle<00:02:37.489> can<00:02:37.670> all<00:02:37.790> the

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
really nice they just rattle can all the

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.089 
really nice they just rattle can all the
parts<00:02:38.180> but<00:02:38.390> it<00:02:38.420> still<00:02:38.810> looks<00:02:39.049> good<00:02:39.230> you<00:02:40.010> know

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
parts but it still looks good you know

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.830 
parts but it still looks good you know
quite<00:02:40.340> frankly<00:02:40.400> that's<00:02:40.849> the<00:02:41.120> most<00:02:41.599> cost

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
quite frankly that's the most cost

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.119 
quite frankly that's the most cost
effective<00:02:42.079> thing<00:02:42.379> to<00:02:42.470> do<00:02:42.590> anyways<00:02:42.890> if<00:02:43.010> you're

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
effective thing to do anyways if you're

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.000
