00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.510
 a building that I'm selling right in 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.460
 the are and the kimball approximately 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.450
 in the corner I'm here the man sign 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.450
 gilvan 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.440
 approximately the big intersections 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:24.740
 they are irvine par and kimba building this is 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.760
 zaidÃ­n wood but the price is very 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:32.500
 low and the area is very good to rent 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.500
 as you can see here below 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.710
 the area is there is an apartment 2b drums 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.719
 Two rooms 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.070
 and the top part is this 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:47.930
 apartment and are duplex with attic 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.060
 now we will see the back one 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:55.510
 plot but good as you can observe 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.510
 The best thing about this house is the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.720
 situation where you are here and here 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.780
 there I do not know if it is not observed with the 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.800
 camera but there is the son let's go 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.800
 to the first apartment 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:16.070
 or there are some dogs inside that do not stop 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:18.970
 barking I have opened but good to hear 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.970
 noise 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.950
 you are inside the house 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.950
 this 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.960
 the value of the pound 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.580
 ah 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.659
 ah 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.659
 and this would be the damage 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.140
 the case has central heating 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.750
 year 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.800
 in addition to the kitchen 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:17.209
 I was in the kitchen is pretty good at 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.209
 half 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:27.670
 I can not open here because there is a dog 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:30.610
 but let's see let's go up to the 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.830
 part of up there are two times more and 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.060
 the master see drone and another bathroom 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.060
 we are looking at the top 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.590
 the first thing we see here 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:49.079
 a pretty big room that would be 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.079
 the master drone 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.019
 with 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:01.810
 class the ceilings approximately are of 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.810
 11 super high feet 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.250
 here we can see 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.250
 the bathroom on top 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.049
 and another pedro here 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.540
 can observe the plot that is very 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.569
 big 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.609
 can see how there is space at least 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.609
 for four cars 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.769
 Y 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.930
 and 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.930
 sorry 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.320
 ah 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.730
 I will live 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.730
 to the back 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.730
 and right now we are seeing the part of 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.730
 behind 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.230
 can see how the back 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.230
 it's pretty big 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.800
 and will put the entrance to the back 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:40.350
 of the other apartment apartment of this 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.750
 it goes from here to there it's pretty 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.660
 large in good condition and rent 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.229
 approximate here is about $ 1000 in 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.229
 this apartment 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:57.780
 this is the plot in the back 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.570
 has space for both small cars 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.150
 like big cars because the door is 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:07.860
 steel is very large can park 1 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:13.100
 2 3 4 possibly 5 here this is not a 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.100
 garage is something to store things 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:20.389
 the morgue of this house is 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.810
 approximately the monthly payment with everything 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.810
 included 

00:05:23.549 --> 00:05:31.569
 calculated by 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:33.409
 the bank of this payment 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:37.759
 total 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:39.780
 and this is what they can get out of 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:42.660
 apartment below 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:46.240
 this is the amount you are renting or 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:48.220
 be that your total payment would be this 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.650
 would be the total payment of this house 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.020
 discounting the rent was located 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:57.099
 where it is located in the sixth nick 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:06:00.819
 Kimball would be a unique opportunity to 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:05.319
 a family that would like to live in this 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:09.420
 building where are the colleges one of 

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:12.660
 the best in chicago and the combination 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:16.080
 It's great to go everywhere 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:21.620
 the nearest streets around are 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:21.620
 irvine park timbal and elston 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:42.470
 again santiago sanchez from the street 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.470
