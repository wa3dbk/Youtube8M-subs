00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.780
 will be so stuck in traffic 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.649
 recall that this question 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:18.089
 rides like a gas 66 hectares 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.720
 Yes, I even scared to imagine with 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.089
 setting out gas 66 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.089
 bargaining with something that she will pull out 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.480
 probably it will be just cool 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.760
 graveyard of cars is here 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.760
 rub 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.510
 checks 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.520
 the choice 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.520
 power god 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.140
 she is 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.410
 document 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.060
 I think 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.470
 in the past 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.010
 he 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.350
 such settlements but have never seen 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.480
 break 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.670
 according to 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.670
 more than half the volume is not limited 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.220
 apparently vadim apparently driver man 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.680
 experienced 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.680
 and in the swamp itself a month and two knows it 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.020
 manuel just turn around 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.929
 probably 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.030
 because with such wheels 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.409
 and landing fear about such a field even 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:42.270
 nothing 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.440
 I like cooking atr 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.440
 and this is what is to be afraid of 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.360
 manat 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:55.700
 2 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.720
 here's the rest point 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.400
 but or some kind of powerful metal 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.130
 cable 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.130
 that's good but also jumshud 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.789
 need to move away from what they reach 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:20.789
 anything happens last year ago 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:24.750
 not 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.750
 not 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.389
 asking swallow player 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.099
 cube 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.019
 in will 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.040
 veteran 1 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:09.229
 Doll 

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:11.289
 in reply 

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:14.289
 uah 

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:17.919

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.919
 fools sit here et export 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:25.029
 no one will pull you out 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.199
 here it is 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:33.439
 his models are easy to pull out 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:35.869
 Yes 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:37.769
 that's just for the worst girl
