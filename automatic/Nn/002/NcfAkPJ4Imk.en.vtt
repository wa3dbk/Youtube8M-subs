application it wants you to set up a
code<00:00:22.260> once<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.070> do<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.609> then<00:00:23.820> have<00:00:24.060> to

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
code once you do that you then have to

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.689 
code once you do that you then have to
enter<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.199> code<00:00:25.230> in<00:00:25.650> order<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.920> get<00:00:26.279> into<00:00:26.580> the

enter the code in order to get into the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.759 
enter the code in order to get into the
application<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.930> we're<00:00:28.019> gonna<00:00:28.140> come<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.500> here

until we get our code so all you have to

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.510 
until we get our code so all you have to
do<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.870> let<00:00:34.079> go<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.500> then<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:35.040> will<00:00:35.070> take<00:00:35.399> you

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
do is let go and then it will take you

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.490 
do is let go and then it will take you
into<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.880> next<00:00:36.000> one<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.050> are<00:00:37.110> going<00:00:37.350> to

then<00:00:37.680> put<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.070> our<00:00:38.219> code<00:00:38.520> here<00:00:43.129> and<00:00:44.129> once<00:00:44.760> we

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
then put in our code here and once we

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.610 
then put in our code here and once we
get<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:47.780> it<00:00:48.780> will<00:00:48.960> give<00:00:49.230> us<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.469> green

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
get that in it will give us the green

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.189 
get that in it will give us the green
light<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.100> let<00:00:50.280> us<00:00:50.370> into<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.789> application<00:00:51.480> so

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199
