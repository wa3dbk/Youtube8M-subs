00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
mixed in with a lot of desirable wedge

head<00:02:54.579> pinball<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.480> early<00:02:56.319> hybrid<00:02:56.980> make<00:02:57.489> like

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
head pinball and early hybrid make like

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.300 
head pinball and early hybrid make like
mechanical<00:02:58.299> evil<00:02:58.959> knievel<00:02:59.440> that's<00:03:02.190> one<00:03:03.190> of

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
mechanical evil knievel that's one of

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.840 
mechanical evil knievel that's one of
155<00:03:04.269> made<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:05.049> probably<00:03:05.620> 70<00:03:06.130> or<00:03:06.190> 80<00:03:06.340> exist

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
155 made and probably 70 or 80 exist

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.960 
155 made and probably 70 or 80 exist
still<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.480> that's<00:03:08.109> an<00:03:08.350> NOS<00:03:08.680> play<00:03:09.160> field<00:03:09.549> new

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
still and that's an NOS play field new

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.030 
still and that's an NOS play field new
old<00:03:10.180> stock<00:03:10.410> so<00:03:11.410> it's<00:03:11.530> probably<00:03:11.769> one<00:03:11.889> of<00:03:11.920> the

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
old stock so it's probably one of the

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.699 
old stock so it's probably one of the
best<00:03:12.220> shaped<00:03:12.549> games<00:03:12.850> in<00:03:13.299> the<00:03:13.420> museum<00:03:13.930> that

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
best shaped games in the museum that

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.009 
best shaped games in the museum that
came<00:03:14.889> out<00:03:15.100> of<00:03:15.280> my<00:03:15.940> house<00:03:16.209> and<00:03:16.600> that<00:03:16.720> probably

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
came out of my house and that probably

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.660 
came out of my house and that probably
will<00:03:17.139> end<00:03:17.290> up<00:03:17.470> back<00:03:17.680> in<00:03:17.859> my<00:03:17.889> house<00:03:18.190> again<00:03:18.400> in

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
will end up back in my house again in

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.979 
will end up back in my house again in
the<00:03:18.760> summer<00:03:18.970> so<00:03:19.239> that's<00:03:19.359> going<00:03:19.569> to<00:03:19.630> be<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.750> game

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
the summer so that's going to be a game

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.240 
the summer so that's going to be a game
that's<00:03:20.230> gonna<00:03:20.319> probably<00:03:20.620> be<00:03:20.859> here<00:03:21.040> for<00:03:21.220> a

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
that's gonna probably be here for a

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.670 
that's gonna probably be here for a
three-month<00:03:21.760> stay<00:03:22.060> but<00:03:23.049> we<00:03:23.139> do<00:03:23.260> have<00:03:23.440> another

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
three-month stay but we do have another

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.650 
three-month stay but we do have another
one<00:03:23.769> coming<00:03:24.160> in<00:03:24.370> from<00:03:24.670> Switzerland

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
one coming in from Switzerland

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.630 
one coming in from Switzerland
so<00:03:25.780> hopefully<00:03:25.989> we

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
so hopefully we

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.700 
so hopefully we
keep<00:03:26.819> the<00:03:26.970> knee<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.300> evel<00:03:27.569> knievel<00:03:27.600> in<00:03:28.560> the

keep the knee and evel knievel in the

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:29.840

selections I don't know if it's the
biggest<00:05:47.000> collection<00:05:47.750> but<00:05:47.900> I<00:05:47.930> think<00:05:48.170> it's<00:05:48.320> a

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
biggest collection but I think it's a

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.490 
biggest collection but I think it's a
very<00:05:48.800> select<00:05:49.340> collection<00:05:49.910> of<00:05:50.030> games<00:05:50.240> I<00:05:50.600> think

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
very select collection of games I think

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.890 
very select collection of games I think
we<00:05:51.740> can<00:05:51.890> offer<00:05:52.100> that<00:05:52.310> to<00:05:52.790> everyone<00:05:53.570> to<00:05:53.720> play

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
we can offer that to everyone to play

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.170 
we can offer that to everyone to play
them<00:05:54.200> I<00:05:54.380> mean<00:05:54.530> the<00:05:54.920> point<00:05:55.310> is<00:05:55.520> for<00:05:55.850> the<00:05:55.970> games

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
them I mean the point is for the games

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.000 
them I mean the point is for the games
to<00:05:56.270> be<00:05:56.450> played<00:05:56.600> and<00:05:56.960> that<00:05:57.020> was<00:05:57.320> the<00:05:57.470> purpose<00:05:57.710> of

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
to be played and that was the purpose of

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.310 
to be played and that was the purpose of
the<00:05:58.100> museum<00:05:58.580> to<00:05:59.210> allow<00:05:59.510> people<00:05:59.870> to<00:06:00.020> play<00:06:00.290> the

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
the museum to allow people to play the

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.780 
the museum to allow people to play the
game<00:06:00.500> and<00:06:00.890> I<00:06:00.980> believe<00:06:01.310> that<00:06:01.460> if<00:06:01.610> they're

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 
game and I believe that if they're

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.930 
game and I believe that if they're
maintained<00:06:02.240> properly<00:06:02.690> and<00:06:03.320> waxed<00:06:03.890> and<00:06:04.040> taken

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
maintained properly and waxed and taken

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.150 
maintained properly and waxed and taken
care<00:06:05.180> of<00:06:05.240> the<00:06:06.140> way<00:06:06.170> they<00:06:06.470> should<00:06:06.530> be<00:06:06.770> that

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
care of the way they should be that

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.980 
care of the way they should be that
these<00:06:07.520> games<00:06:07.820> are<00:06:08.090> not<00:06:08.240> going<00:06:08.450> to<00:06:08.510> wear<00:06:08.690> down

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
these games are not going to wear down

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.440 
these games are not going to wear down
the<00:06:09.740> paint's<00:06:10.070> not<00:06:10.130> going<00:06:10.460> to<00:06:10.520> fall<00:06:10.760> off<00:06:11.060> we

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.650 
diligence on the maintenance which we do

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.260 
have a great maintenance staff in and
we're<00:06:18.080> only<00:06:18.200> gonna<00:06:18.380> make<00:06:18.470> the<00:06:19.100> games<00:06:19.340> better

we're only gonna make the games better

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.210 
we're only gonna make the games better
as<00:06:20.540> the<00:06:20.810> year<00:06:20.990> goes<00:06:21.020> by<00:06:21.320> because<00:06:21.890> we'll<00:06:22.100> be

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
as the year goes by because we'll be

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.760 
as the year goes by because we'll be
able<00:06:22.310> to<00:06:22.430> work<00:06:22.730> full-time<00:06:23.500> if<00:06:24.500> they're

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
able to work full-time if they're

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.010 
able to work full-time if they're
stacked<00:06:25.100> up<00:06:25.340> in<00:06:25.550> the<00:06:25.640> garage<00:06:25.940> or<00:06:26.360> an<00:06:26.510> attic<00:06:26.870> or

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
stacked up in the garage or an attic or

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.740 
stacked up in the garage or an attic or
a<00:06:27.110> basement<00:06:27.140> you<00:06:27.860> know<00:06:28.550> they<00:06:28.910> over<00:06:29.240> time<00:06:29.270> they

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
a basement you know they over time they

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.960 
a basement you know they over time they
deteriorate<00:06:30.710> they're<00:06:31.280> not<00:06:31.430> going<00:06:31.580> to<00:06:31.610> get<00:06:31.760> any

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
deteriorate they're not going to get any

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.790 
deteriorate they're not going to get any
better<00:06:32.150> sitting<00:06:32.660> around<00:06:32.900> so<00:06:33.230> we<00:06:33.380> think<00:06:33.590> it's

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
better sitting around so we think it's

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.590 
better sitting around so we think it's
best<00:06:34.100> for<00:06:34.250> the<00:06:34.310> games<00:06:34.550> to<00:06:34.700> be<00:06:34.910> online<00:06:35.090> and

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.600 
best for the games to be online and

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.510 
best for the games to be online and
playing<00:06:36.050> and<00:06:36.350> we'll<00:06:36.470> rotate<00:06:36.680> different<00:06:37.310> games

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 
playing and we'll rotate different games

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:45.010 
playing and we'll rotate different games
in<00:06:37.820> as<00:06:38.000> we<00:06:38.630> keep<00:06:39.230> the<00:06:39.440> collection<00:06:39.950> moving<00:06:44.020> and

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
in as we keep the collection moving and

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.270 
in as we keep the collection moving and
every<00:06:45.260> year<00:06:45.470> we're<00:06:45.560> going<00:06:45.650> to<00:06:45.740> duck<00:06:45.980> games

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
every year we're going to duck games

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.280 
every year we're going to duck games
