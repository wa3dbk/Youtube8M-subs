00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
the next important feature here is the

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.190 
the next important feature here is the
zoom<00:00:04.500> settings<00:00:05.540> where<00:00:06.540> we<00:00:06.629> go<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.960> front

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
zoom settings where we go to the front

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.049 
zoom settings where we go to the front
end<00:00:07.500> of<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.740> website<00:00:08.130> you'll<00:00:08.370> see<00:00:08.460> that<00:00:08.790> when

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
end of the website you'll see that when

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.900 
end of the website you'll see that when
you<00:00:09.240> double<00:00:09.570> click<00:00:09.599> on<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:10.019> particular<00:00:10.260> image

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
you double click on a particular image

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.390 
you double click on a particular image
you'll<00:00:11.910> be<00:00:12.300> zoomed<00:00:12.719> into<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.110> page<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.830> this

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
you'll be zoomed into a page and this

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.450 
you'll be zoomed into a page and this
allows<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:15.210> be<00:00:15.389> allows<00:00:15.870> you<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.500> read<00:00:16.740> more

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
allows to be allows you to read more

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.320 
allows to be allows you to read more
details<00:00:18.230> clearer<00:00:19.230> like<00:00:19.650> text<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.330> view

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
details clearer like text and view

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.620 
details clearer like text and view
detailed<00:00:22.320> images<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.359> much<00:00:24.359> better

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
detailed images in a much better

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.500 
detailed images in a much better
resolution<00:00:25.310> so<00:00:26.310> how<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.820> done<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.269> that

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
resolution so how this is done is that

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.160 
resolution so how this is done is that
basically<00:00:28.320> when<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.010> set<00:00:29.220> up<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.490> page<00:00:30.050> for<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
basically when you set up a page for the

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.370 
basically when you set up a page for the
joomla<00:00:31.500> catalog<00:00:32.239> you'll<00:00:33.239> need<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.510> upload<00:00:33.960> an

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
joomla catalog you'll need to upload an

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.680 
joomla catalog you'll need to upload an
original<00:00:35.280> size<00:00:35.550> which<00:00:35.850> watch<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.239> which<00:00:36.570> is

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
original size which watch it which is

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.260 
original size which watch it which is
what<00:00:36.840> you're<00:00:37.020> seeing<00:00:37.200> here<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:38.550> zoomed<00:00:39.000> in

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
what you're seeing here and a zoomed in

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.250 
what you're seeing here and a zoomed in
version<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.040> same<00:00:41.340> page<00:00:41.989> which<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.110> what

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
version of the same page which is what

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.470 
version of the same page which is what
you<00:00:43.410> see<00:00:43.559> when<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.800> double<00:00:44.190> click<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.610> any

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
you see when you double click on any

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.670 
you see when you double click on any
particular<00:00:45.840> page<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.160> catalog<00:00:47.840> so<00:00:48.840> let's

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
particular page of the catalog so let's

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.729 
particular page of the catalog so let's
go<00:00:50.340> back<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.820> backend<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.390> see<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
go back to the backend and see that the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.970 
go back to the backend and see that the
zoomed<00:00:53.100> image<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.629> basically<00:00:55.079> 800<00:00:55.469> pixels

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
zoomed image is basically 800 pixels

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.959 
zoomed image is basically 800 pixels
high<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:57.289> 600<00:00:58.289> pixels<00:00:58.649> wide<00:00:58.949> whereas<00:00:59.820> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
high and 600 pixels wide whereas the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.970 
high and 600 pixels wide whereas the
original<00:01:00.090> size<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.199> which<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.680> be<00:01:01.800> got

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
original size of this which can be got

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.460 
original size of this which can be got
from<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.370> basic<00:01:02.879> parameter<00:01:03.300> stop<00:01:03.870> drop<00:01:04.260> down

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
from the basic parameter stop drop down

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.510 
from the basic parameter stop drop down
is<00:01:04.790> 300<00:01:05.790> pixels<00:01:06.240> wide<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.770> height<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:07.979> 400

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
is 300 pixels wide and the height is 400

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.440 
is 300 pixels wide and the height is 400
pixels<00:01:08.990> high<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.880> these<00:01:11.880> figures<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.420> be

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
pixels high so these figures can be

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.109 
pixels high so these figures can be
changed<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.229> whatever<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.740> see<00:01:13.950> fit<00:01:14.119> or

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:33.110 
to my book zoomed to and save that and
let's<00:04:27.610> create<00:04:27.940> a<00:04:28.000> third<00:04:28.420> page<00:04:31.440> using<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:32.740> same

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
let's create a third page using the same

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.810 
let's create a third page using the same
method<00:04:34.950> so<00:04:35.950> my<00:04:36.250> book<00:04:36.520> zoomed<00:04:36.880> page<00:04:37.450> three<00:04:37.900> and

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
method so my book zoomed page three and

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.060 
method so my book zoomed page three and
save<00:04:39.820> that<00:04:40.140> now<00:04:41.140> we<00:04:41.200> see<00:04:41.470> that<00:04:41.680> they're<00:04:41.890> not

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
save that now we see that they're not

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.830 
save that now we see that they're not
quite<00:04:42.400> in<00:04:42.640> the<00:04:42.730> right<00:04:42.760> order<00:04:43.180> they<00:04:43.510> starting

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
quite in the right order they starting

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.910 
quite in the right order they starting
from<00:04:44.050> three<00:04:44.290> to<00:04:44.500> one<00:04:44.800> you<00:04:45.340> remember<00:04:45.730> the<00:04:45.970> top
