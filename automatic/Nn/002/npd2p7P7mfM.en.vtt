00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:08.930
 now let's improvise a sun is 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:12.600
 important to understand that guitarists 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.970
 leaves rock of the 70 were 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.500
 in a line of evolution of the guitar 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.260
 of blues 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.680
 well then this has a lot more than 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.340
 see with the raw pentatonic structure 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.640
 Rustic Cruise Phrase has more than 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:34.070
 see with this that with the diatonic touch 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:38.559
 of the metal guitar that is usually a 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.320
 a very used resource to touch in a way 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.820
 Catholic with many successes with scales 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.070
 major or minor harmonics on top of 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.199
 progression is very rustic and actually 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.980
 they are very sophisticated scales for 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.510
 approaching approaching this kind of 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.519
 progressions that do not have a harmony 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.540
 very definite does not mean that this 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.330
 it is a mistake 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.540
 it means to sound a 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.280
 Rustic progression or a focus 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.560
 rustic when it comes to doing rhythms with 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.970
 a sophisticated melody can carry 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.280
 much more work than if you simply 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.600
 I concentrate and tried to squeeze the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.790
 blues phrase to this kind of 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.450
 progressions 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.450
 now 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.759
 and 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.290
 m 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.840
 and
