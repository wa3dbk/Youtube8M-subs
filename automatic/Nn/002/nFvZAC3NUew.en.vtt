that's coming here today I just wanted

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.959 
that's coming here today I just wanted
to<00:00:09.719> do<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:10.260> video<00:00:10.530> on<00:00:11.100> my<00:00:11.219> Lexie<00:00:11.790> hair

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
to do a video on my Lexie hair

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.150 
to do a video on my Lexie hair
extensions<00:00:12.570> I've<00:00:13.559> got<00:00:13.799> them<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.920> lot<00:00:14.070> of

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
extensions I've got them a lot of

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.680 
extensions I've got them a lot of
questions<00:00:14.459> about<00:00:14.580> them<00:00:14.789> from<00:00:14.940> clients<00:00:15.570> and

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
questions about them from clients and

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.300 
questions about them from clients and
everything<00:00:16.110> like<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.289> so<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.890> just<00:00:16.920> figured

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
everything like that so I just figured

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.099 
everything like that so I just figured
that<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.760> would<00:00:17.850> be<00:00:18.000> easier<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.600> do<00:00:18.779> kind<00:00:19.020> of

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
that it would be easier to do kind of

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.130 
that it would be easier to do kind of
like<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.350> review<00:00:19.710> video<00:00:20.300> ok<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:21.330> anybody<00:00:21.930> that

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
put them in and you know how to choose

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.560 
put them in and you know how to choose
your<00:01:59.369> color<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.759> everything<00:02:00.210> like<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.390> and

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
your color and everything like that and

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.389 
your color and everything like that and
I<00:02:00.780> kind<00:02:00.929> of<00:02:01.020> knew<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.409> wanted<00:02:01.530> or<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.369> I

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
I kind of knew that I wanted or that I

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.039 
I kind of knew that I wanted or that I
was<00:02:02.640> gonna<00:02:02.880> need<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.420> strawberry<00:02:03.749> blonde

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
was gonna need the strawberry blonde

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.330 
was gonna need the strawberry blonde
ones<00:02:04.319> but<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.560> figured<00:02:04.859> that<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.069> would<00:02:05.219> probably

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
ones but I figured that I would probably

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.389 
ones but I figured that I would probably
have<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.880> color<00:02:06.090> them<00:02:06.329> one<00:02:06.479> way<00:02:06.600> or<00:02:06.749> the<00:02:06.780> other

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
have to color them one way or the other

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.680 
have to color them one way or the other
but<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.460> video<00:02:08.729> definitely<00:02:08.940> helped<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.569> kind

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
but the video definitely helped to kind

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.360 
but the video definitely helped to kind
of<00:02:09.840> distinguish<00:02:10.319> like<00:02:10.560> oh<00:02:10.710> okay<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.160> one's

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
of distinguish like oh okay this one's

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.059 
of distinguish like oh okay this one's
much<00:02:11.700> lighter<00:02:12.000> darker<00:02:12.450> or<00:02:12.990> more<00:02:13.230> warm<00:02:13.530> or<00:02:13.860> you

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
much lighter darker or more warm or you

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.550 
much lighter darker or more warm or you
know<00:02:14.420> all<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.080> videos<00:02:16.350> are

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
know all of that so the videos are

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.440

my hair up here but that's how my hair
is<00:02:22.290> colored<00:02:22.920> anyway<00:02:23.489> because<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.230> darker

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830

on<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.040> roots<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.640> then<00:02:26.790> lighter<00:02:27.030> on<00:02:27.180> the

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
on the roots and then lighter on the

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.550 
on the roots and then lighter on the
ends<00:02:27.569> I<00:02:27.660> don't<00:02:27.810> know<00:02:27.900> if<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.140> can<00:02:28.319> kind<00:02:28.440> of

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
ends I don't know if you can kind of

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.280 
ends I don't know if you can kind of
tell<00:02:28.910> so<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.030> kind<00:02:30.209> of<00:02:30.269> works<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.810> is<00:02:30.959> a<00:02:30.989> little

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
tell so it kind of works it is a little

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.960 
tell so it kind of works it is a little
bit<00:02:31.440> lighter<00:02:31.620> but<00:02:31.830> it<00:02:31.950> does<00:02:32.160> blend<00:02:32.489> with<00:02:32.790> like

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
bit lighter but it does blend with like

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.670 
bit lighter but it does blend with like
the<00:02:33.120> overall<00:02:33.450> effect<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.840> my<00:02:34.019> hair<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.560> I

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
the overall effect of my hair and I

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.380 
the overall effect of my hair and I
think<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.099> kind<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.400> looks<00:02:35.459> you<00:02:36.000> know

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
think that it kind of looks you know

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.530 
think that it kind of looks you know
like<00:02:36.599> it's<00:02:36.780> how<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.230> did<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:37.769> that<00:02:38.730> worked<00:02:39.420> out

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
like it's how I did so that worked out

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.490 
like it's how I did so that worked out
well<00:02:39.599> and<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:41.010> get<00:02:41.190> 10<00:02:41.459> weft<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.959> have<00:02:43.170> a

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
well and you get 10 weft and you have a

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.640 
well and you get 10 weft and you have a
3<00:02:43.830> clip<00:02:44.099> left<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.700> 4<00:02:45.150> clip<00:02:45.360> weft<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.989> bigger<00:02:46.349> 4

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
3 clip left a 4 clip weft a bigger 4

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.630 
3 clip left a 4 clip weft a bigger 4
clip<00:02:46.860> left<00:02:47.099> and<00:02:47.459> then<00:02:48.769> another<00:02:49.769> 3<00:02:50.129> cliff<00:02:50.340> lifts

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
clip left and then another 3 cliff lifts

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.400 
clip left and then another 3 cliff lifts
and<00:02:50.910> that's<00:02:51.030> what<00:02:51.269> goes<00:02:51.390> in<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.870> back<00:02:52.019> section

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
and that's what goes in the back section

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.470 
and that's what goes in the back section
of<00:02:52.500> your<00:02:52.650> hair<00:02:52.830> and<00:02:53.040> then<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.190> have<00:02:53.459> one<00:02:54.239> clip

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
of your hair and then you have one clip

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
weft a 2 clip weft and then another one

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.720 
weft a 2 clip weft and then another one
clip<00:02:56.730> clip<00:02:57.209> weft<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:58.160> they<00:02:59.160> just<00:02:59.340> pop<00:02:59.549> it<00:02:59.670> in

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
clip clip weft and they just pop it in

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:08.020 
clip clip weft and they just pop it in
and<00:02:59.849> out<00:03:00.000> it's<00:03:00.239> really<00:03:00.450> super<00:03:00.959> easy<00:03:01.370> so<00:03:05.690> just

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
and out it's really super easy so just

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.460 
and out it's really super easy so just
snaps<00:03:09.030> I've<00:03:09.239> been<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.630> they<00:03:09.750> actually<00:03:10.019> have

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
snaps I've been and they actually have

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.190 
snaps I've been and they actually have
little<00:03:10.769> silicone<00:03:11.280> pieces<00:03:11.970> where<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.840> clip<00:03:13.019> is

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
little silicone pieces where the clip is

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.410 
little silicone pieces where the clip is
that<00:03:14.069> helps<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.489> to<00:03:14.610> stay<00:03:14.819> in<00:03:14.970> a<00:03:15.060> little<00:03:15.299> bit

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
that helps it to stay in a little bit

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.000 
that helps it to stay in a little bit
better<00:03:15.599> so<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:15.959> just<00:03:16.140> let<00:03:16.319> it<00:03:16.440> in<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.829> then

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
better so you just let it in and then

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.430 
better so you just let it in and then
pop<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.340> down<00:03:17.459> with<00:03:17.670> your<00:03:17.819> fingers<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.480> then

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
pop it down with your fingers and then

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.900 
pop it down with your fingers and then
you<00:03:19.680> know<00:03:19.799> it's<00:03:19.980> pretty<00:03:20.130> secure<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:20.640> can<00:03:20.700> pull

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
you know it's pretty secure you can pull

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.490 
you know it's pretty secure you can pull
on<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.269> usually<00:03:21.390> curl<00:03:21.810> them<00:03:22.019> while<00:03:22.260> they're

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
on it I usually curl them while they're

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.210 
on it I usually curl them while they're
in<00:03:22.530> my<00:03:22.799> hair<00:03:23.040> so<00:03:23.760> um<00:03:24.500> you<00:03:25.500> know<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.950> curling

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
in my hair so um you know the curling

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.170 
in my hair so um you know the curling
iron<00:03:26.310> doesn't<00:03:26.579> pull<00:03:26.819> it<00:03:26.910> out<00:03:27.000> or<00:03:27.150> anything

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
iron doesn't pull it out or anything

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.940 
iron doesn't pull it out or anything
definitely<00:03:27.900> don't<00:03:28.079> want<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.230> be<00:03:28.290> like<00:03:28.500> ripping

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
definitely don't want to be like ripping

you know see that's you guys can see a
little<00:03:48.630> bit<00:03:48.810> better<00:03:48.959> they<00:03:49.829> are<00:03:50.389> pretty<00:03:51.389> long

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
little bit better they are pretty long

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.530 
little bit better they are pretty long
and<00:03:52.250> this<00:03:53.250> is<00:03:53.430> actually<00:03:53.760> after<00:03:54.060> I<00:03:54.090> cut<00:03:54.359> them

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
and this is actually after I cut them

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.759 
and this is actually after I cut them
they<00:03:54.810> were<00:03:54.900> probably<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.650> here<00:03:56.010> before<00:03:57.139> and<00:03:58.139> so

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
they were probably to here before and so

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.210 
they were probably to here before and so
I<00:03:59.040> cut<00:03:59.250> like<00:03:59.400> 3<00:03:59.730> inches<00:04:00.090> off<00:04:00.299> of<00:04:00.329> them<00:04:00.750> and

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
I cut like 3 inches off of them and

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.170 
I cut like 3 inches off of them and
actually<00:04:02.220> went<00:04:02.579> through<00:04:02.609> and<00:04:02.760> tech<00:04:02.910> straws

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
actually went through and tech straws

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.720 
actually went through and tech straws
then<00:04:03.420> some<00:04:03.660> too<00:04:03.900> which<00:04:04.349> made<00:04:04.859> it<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.099> lot<00:04:05.310> easier

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
then some too which made it a lot easier

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.849 
then some too which made it a lot easier
to<00:04:06.359> kind<00:04:06.480> of<00:04:06.569> style<00:04:06.870> because<00:04:07.440> they<00:04:07.560> were<00:04:07.620> heavy

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
to kind of style because they were heavy

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:16.819 
to kind of style because they were heavy
before<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.639> then

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.379 

so<00:04:17.829> yeah<00:04:17.979> I've<00:04:18.310> been<00:04:18.489> really<00:04:18.760> really<00:04:19.060> happy
