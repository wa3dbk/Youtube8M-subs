00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
winter the winds are best then and there

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.279

January<00:01:04.729> I'll<00:01:05.729> probably<00:01:06.119> leave<00:01:06.539> in<00:01:06.720> January<00:01:07.289> I

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
January I'll probably leave in January I

January I'll probably leave in January I
don't<00:01:08.310> know<00:01:08.399> the<00:01:08.520> exact<00:01:08.880> date<00:01:09.149> yet

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
don't know the exact date yet

are<00:01:10.289> you<00:01:10.590> using<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.310> similar<00:01:11.820> balloon<00:01:12.149> this

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
are you using a similar balloon this

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.770 
are you using a similar balloon this
time<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:13.100> found<00:01:14.100> last<00:01:14.670> time<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.330> didn't<00:01:15.690> have

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
time I found last time I didn't have

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.900 
time I found last time I didn't have
enough<00:01:16.050> fuel<00:01:16.289> to<00:01:16.380> cross<00:01:16.800> the<00:01:17.039> Pacific<00:01:17.550> so<00:01:17.850> I

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
enough fuel to cross the Pacific so I

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.810 
enough fuel to cross the Pacific so I
had<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.270> land<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.600> India<00:01:19.100> my<00:01:20.100> new<00:01:20.340> balloon<00:01:20.610> is

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
had to land in India my new balloon is

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.359 
had to land in India my new balloon is
larger<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.200> take<00:01:22.380> more<00:01:22.619> fuel<00:01:22.920> with<00:01:23.160> me

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
larger so I can take more fuel with me

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.880 
larger so I can take more fuel with me
it<00:01:24.210> will<00:01:24.420> make<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> depletes<00:01:25.080> heavier<00:01:25.500> but<00:01:25.740> I'll

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
it will make a depletes heavier but I'll

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.669 
it will make a depletes heavier but I'll
be<00:01:26.039> able<00:01:26.160> to<00:01:26.369> fly<00:01:26.580> further<00:01:27.170> what<00:01:28.170> do<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.440> find

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
be able to fly further what do you find

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.810 
be able to fly further what do you find
most<00:01:28.890> difficult<00:01:29.460> on<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.300> long<00:01:30.660> flight<00:01:31.070> well<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
most difficult on a long flight well the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.880 
most difficult on a long flight well the
last<00:01:33.000> time<00:01:33.300> I<00:01:33.539> spent<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.079> lot<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.259> time<00:01:34.560> talking

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
last time I spent a lot of time talking

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.550 
last time I spent a lot of time talking
on<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.310> radio<00:01:35.810> because<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.200> only<00:01:37.380> got

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
on the radio because of that I only got

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.539 
on the radio because of that I only got
2<00:01:37.920> hours<00:01:38.280> sleep<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.880> day<00:01:38.909> which<00:01:39.840> isn't<00:01:40.229> enough

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
2 hours sleep a day which isn't enough

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.240 
2 hours sleep a day which isn't enough
that<00:01:41.549> was<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> real<00:01:42.000> problem<00:01:42.390> for<00:01:42.689> me<00:01:43.009> so<00:01:44.009> this

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
that was a real problem for me so this

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.550 
that was a real problem for me so this
time<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.850> missed<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.420> less<00:01:45.750> time<00:01:46.079> on<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> radio

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
time I missed a less time on the radio

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.630 
time I missed a less time on the radio
and<00:01:47.460> get<00:01:47.700> more<00:01:47.909> sleep<00:01:48.439> the<00:01:49.439> food<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.829> horrible

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
and get more sleep the food is horrible

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.539 
and get more sleep the food is horrible
but<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.540> keeps<00:01:51.689> me<00:01:51.840> alive<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.590> it's<00:01:53.130> not<00:01:53.310> for

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
but it keeps me alive and it's not for

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.569 
but it keeps me alive and it's not for
long<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.000> don't<00:01:54.270> mind<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:55.100> heard<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.369> you're
