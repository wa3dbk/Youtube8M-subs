recorded<00:03:20.739> that's<00:03:20.920> great<00:03:21.190> again<00:03:21.820> aunty<00:03:23.790> I

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
recorded that's great again aunty I

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.610 
recorded that's great again aunty I
think<00:03:25.269> I<00:03:25.360> could<00:03:25.420> definitely<00:03:25.690> fall<00:03:26.079> it<00:03:26.290> because

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
think I could definitely fall it because

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.550 
think I could definitely fall it because
it's<00:03:26.950> a<00:03:27.190> lot<00:03:27.430> of<00:03:27.579> food<00:03:27.820> and<00:03:28.030> you're<00:03:28.120> never

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
it's a lot of food and you're never

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.360 
it's a lot of food and you're never
like<00:03:28.819> starving<00:03:29.819> so<00:03:30.569> I<00:03:31.050> think<00:03:31.920> it'd<00:03:32.220> be<00:03:32.250> really

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
like starving so I think it'd be really

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.699 
like starving so I think it'd be really
easy<00:03:32.640> because<00:03:33.060> it's<00:03:33.270> good<00:03:33.450> food<00:03:33.660> too<00:03:33.930> he's

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
easy because it's good food too he's

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.220 
easy because it's good food too he's
each<00:03:34.920> male<00:03:35.190> until<00:03:35.520> you<00:03:35.700> are<00:03:35.849> full<00:03:36.239> that's<00:03:37.080> all

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
each male until you are full that's all

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.300 
each male until you are full that's all
time<00:03:38.690> I'll<00:03:39.690> plan<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.200> was<00:03:40.440> at<00:03:40.650> first<00:03:40.830> was<00:03:41.130> very

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
time I'll plan it was at first was very

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.570 
time I'll plan it was at first was very
tough<00:03:41.580> for<00:03:41.790> me<00:03:41.910> to<00:03:42.180> be<00:03:42.270> really<00:03:42.630> honest<00:03:43.580> but

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
tough for me to be really honest but

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.729 
tough for me to be really honest but
what's<00:03:44.819> really<00:03:45.030> interesting<00:03:45.150> is<00:03:45.840> if<00:03:46.230> i<00:03:46.470> think

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
what's really interesting is if i think

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.059 
what's really interesting is if i think
if<00:03:46.830> i<00:03:46.950> were<00:03:47.099> to<00:03:47.750> completely<00:03:48.750> follow<00:03:49.050> it<00:03:49.319> to<00:03:50.040> the

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
if i were to completely follow it to the

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.800 
if i were to completely follow it to the
