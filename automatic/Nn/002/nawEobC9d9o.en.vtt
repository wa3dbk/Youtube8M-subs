00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.279 
still holding and we should be
successfully<00:01:52.630> in<00:01:52.890> dfu<00:01:53.890> mode<00:01:53.950> on<00:01:54.369> our<00:01:54.729> devices

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
successfully in dfu mode on our devices

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.499 
successfully in dfu mode on our devices
so<00:01:56.289> a<00:01:56.320> few<00:01:56.829> more<00:01:57.039> seconds<00:01:57.579> it<00:01:57.880> usually<00:01:58.149> goes<00:01:58.450> to

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
so a few more seconds it usually goes to

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.870 
so a few more seconds it usually goes to
8<00:01:58.810> seconds<00:01:59.320> here<00:01:59.590> and<00:01:59.770> then<00:01:59.920> it<00:02:00.159> successfully

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
8 seconds here and then it successfully

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.330 
8 seconds here and then it successfully
goes<00:02:01.060> into<00:02:01.329> dfu<00:02:01.810> mode<00:02:01.869> there<00:02:02.500> we<00:02:02.680> go<00:02:02.829> it's<00:02:03.100> now

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
goes into dfu mode there we go it's now

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.940 
goes into dfu mode there we go it's now
exploiting<00:02:04.030> with<00:02:04.180> lime<00:02:04.479> rain<00:02:04.780> and<00:02:05.049> this

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
exploiting with lime rain and this

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.340 
exploiting with lime rain and this
should<00:02:06.159> take<00:02:06.490> a<00:02:06.520> second<00:02:07.329> now<00:02:07.930> we<00:02:07.990> should<00:02:08.140> see

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
should take a second now we should see

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.650 
should take a second now we should see
our<00:02:08.560> devices<00:02:08.979> kind<00:02:09.460> of<00:02:09.580> booting<00:02:09.940> up<00:02:10.119> and<00:02:10.420> see

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
our devices kind of booting up and see

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.199 
our devices kind of booting up and see
some<00:02:10.869> cool<00:02:11.140> code<00:02:11.500> going<00:02:11.920> on<00:02:12.040> our<00:02:12.220> devices<00:02:12.550> this

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
some cool code going on our devices this

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.790 
some cool code going on our devices this
is<00:02:13.360> basically<00:02:13.780> just<00:02:13.810> hacking<00:02:14.200> into<00:02:14.590> your

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
out it's going to take

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.700 
out it's going to take
a<00:02:18.550> bit<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:18.940> might<00:02:19.120> take<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.390> minute<00:02:19.690> or<00:02:19.990> two<00:02:20.170> so

do everything on its own just look at
the<00:02:27.280> pretty<00:02:27.430> code<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.090> if<00:02:28.600> you<00:02:28.720> don't<00:02:28.930> really

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
the pretty code and if you don't really

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.390 
the pretty code and if you don't really
want<00:02:29.410> to<00:02:29.530> look<00:02:29.650> at<00:02:29.740> the<00:02:29.830> pretty<00:02:29.950> code<00:02:30.250> if

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
want to look at the pretty code if

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.340 
want to look at the pretty code if
you're<00:02:30.520> looking<00:02:30.820> at<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.270> on<00:02:31.390> your<00:02:31.780> own<00:02:31.810> device

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
you're looking at it on your own device

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.470 
you're looking at it on your own device
you<00:02:32.830> can<00:02:32.950> go<00:02:33.130> ahead<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:33.340> fast-forward<00:02:33.730> this

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
you can go ahead and fast-forward this

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:43.010 
you can go ahead and fast-forward this

and<00:03:30.299> now<00:03:31.230> our<00:03:31.409> devices<00:03:31.799> should<00:03:32.549> be<00:03:32.819> rebooting

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
and now our devices should be rebooting

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.869 
and now our devices should be rebooting
this<00:03:34.019> will<00:03:34.260> just<00:03:34.560> take<00:03:34.709> a<00:03:34.890> second<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:35.640> we

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
this will just take a second and we

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.059 
this will just take a second and we
should<00:03:36.090> see<00:03:36.329> a<00:03:36.359> brand<00:03:36.689> new<00:03:36.900> cydia<00:03:37.230> icon<00:03:37.769> on<00:03:38.010> our

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:47.219 
going to need to boot tethered which

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:49.280 
going to need to boot tethered which
you'll<00:03:47.489> have<00:03:47.700> to<00:03:47.879> do<00:03:48.090> every<00:03:48.540> single<00:03:48.689> time<00:03:49.049> your
