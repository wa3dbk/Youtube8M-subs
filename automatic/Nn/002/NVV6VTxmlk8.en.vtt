actually earns report ten dollars for
downloading<00:01:39.329> their<00:01:39.479> application<00:01:40.820> now<00:01:41.820> let<00:01:42.060> me

see<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.689> probably<00:01:42.960> guys<00:01:43.140> don't<00:01:43.380> want<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.649> few

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
see you probably guys don't want a few

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.620 
see you probably guys don't want a few
more<00:01:44.009> points<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.549> can<00:01:44.700> convert<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.360> and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
more points so you can convert that and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.359 
more points so you can convert that and
zero<00:01:46.470> point<00:01:46.740> 10<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.729> believe<00:01:47.939> 10<00:01:48.630> points

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
zero point 10 is I believe 10 points

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.539 
zero point 10 is I believe 10 points
because<00:01:50.369> one<00:01:50.729> dollar<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.420> 100<00:01:52.259> points<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.280> yeah

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
because one dollar is 100 points so yeah

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.429 
because one dollar is 100 points so yeah
so<00:01:54.030> that's<00:01:54.180> pretty<00:01:54.360> awesome<00:01:54.450> but<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.200> really

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
so that's pretty awesome but it's really

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.350 
so that's pretty awesome but it's really
easy<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.189> you're<00:01:56.399> not<00:01:56.520> sorry<00:01:56.729> about<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.000> this
