 knows several sounds well several sounds is one 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.720
 rpg action distanced 16 means this 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.090
 that you work or the game being played 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.790

 You'll spend your friends alone, and you? 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.130

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.770
 that face cute bosses of the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.790
 silicon for those who do not know 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.969
 several sounds in 2011 was published by 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.040
 altus for a public company of the muse 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.759
 also published fiesta and five 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:09.270
 malls or hostiles and at that time he 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:12.989
 It was closed too I know he had the 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.860
 even so it came out is to make 2011 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.900
 This game was 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.640
 released and has already been removed from the air but 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.310
 it was also a very interesting thing 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.580
 because it is the whole order too 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.190
 closed the doors passing the plague party 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.750
 friend and it is for sure it goes there well if you 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.640
 do not know several sounds 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.980
 so you can access the link is there 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.950
 in the description of the video that the first 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.260
 Egg prints beta beta 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.780
 closed beta testing after beta 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.360
 vine souza american is not different 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.470
 of what is now in open beta does not have 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.540
 no difference 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.490
 you will realize that several souza a a 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.700
 johnson and mrp g 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.680
 based on combustion of both skills 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.620
 how much of the skills or are you going to 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.800
 have to do left side sequences 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.390
 because right leap tam having as much 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.940
 as a terrain 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.550
 the game counts on a visual well let's go 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.480
 to say so is a mixture between the 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.430
 realistic visual look with Korean is 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.430
 that thing half style anime 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.610
 police and arrows that good visualization 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.860
 and has game pad support if you can 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.620
 see your neighbor control on pv pps 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.989
 game system has a lobby system or 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.900
 whether you go to the lobby of tvp in 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.730
 nets dp rooms suddenly you will power 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.140
 do against your friends or against 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.610
 people that are there with them open 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.030
 how can we be found in 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.250
 systems like ipss 7 also remembering 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.780
 that one goes in sounds classic themes a 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.010
 little different from the ones we 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.019
 is accustomed to seeing 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.690
 we have a coast of the sun ie 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.450
 classic the other fists you use 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:52.049
 a class that uses sword in shape 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.600
 chain or sword that she 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.209
 Stretch that recoils to know marking 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.280
 glintt is the name more than meets the eye 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.709
 know how the stop also got 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.320
 a christi using a scythe one 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.290
 brand that they use to earn a 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.720
 stop then it 's a very different deal 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.209
 you have a differential in classes 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.670
 also the game a little old so he 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.890
 will be able to run even on the most 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.160
 modest or you did not notice 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.860
 so it is an is was the river needs the 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.180
 Xuxa broke the pieces there you want 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.789
 that your cousin who noticed 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.720
 million there picked up the pieces 1 million together 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.760
 accurately 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.470
 I 'm going to run this flow again. 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.180
 What do you have at home for? 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.880
 you'll probably be able to rotate 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.130
 because you do not need a super com 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.500
 powerful way to rotate the graphs up 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.550
 who are not so ugly though 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.280
 that sincerely the new characters and 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.320
 the games caps and customizations as 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.420
 beautiful so interesting but not 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.240
 the ancients have reinstated at least one point 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.640
 beating the NFL American nicky not 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.980
 had a respect and who was well 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.210
 different when you see a new one this 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.240
 there nevermind 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.630
 so many shows in brazil by 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:10.350
 claw near being a prostitute 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.710
 that America is going to bet to bring 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:16.230
 for Brazilians being an action 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:19.620
 distanced and well let's see what happens 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:24.570
 in fact because it is known is the ring close 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.470

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.560

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.050
 of various sounds in Brazil is a 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.660
 good release is not a good tone 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.240
 budget you will play you prefer 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.730
 play another mm or have some reason 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.530
 or you really were not 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.419
 playing American and now we are 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.580

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.620
