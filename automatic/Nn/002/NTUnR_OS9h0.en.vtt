sugar cane needs water next to it to
grow<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.309> doesn't<00:00:41.520> have<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.700> be<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.820> source

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120

just have some redstone dust in a timer

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.039 
just have some redstone dust in a timer
um<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.950> works<00:01:23.130> as<00:01:23.340> well<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.700> just<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.630> this

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
looks better I in his chest of course so

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.230 
looks better I in his chest of course so
let's<00:01:28.740> put<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> water<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.310> first<00:01:29.579> we're<00:01:30.150> going

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
let's put the water in first we're going

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.300 
let's put the water in first we're going
to<00:01:30.299> make<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:31.110> other<00:01:31.259> way<00:01:31.350> around<00:01:31.740> so

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
to make this the other way around so

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.810 
to make this the other way around so
we're<00:01:32.610> going<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.850> make<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:34.700> so<00:01:35.700> all

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
we're going to make it like that so all

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.840 
we're going to make it like that so all
this<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.030> going<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.329> go<00:01:36.420> come<00:01:36.659> down<00:01:36.840> here<00:01:37.850> and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
this is going to go come down here and

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.630 
this is going to go come down here and
this<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.060> not<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:41.329> to<00:01:42.329> transport<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
this is not to to transport the

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.100 
this is not to to transport the
sugarcane<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.030> can<00:01:45.420> actually<00:01:45.630> make<00:01:45.960> it

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
sugarcane so you can actually make it

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.950 
sugarcane so you can actually make it
longer<00:01:46.320> as<00:01:46.500> well<00:01:47.090> he<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.810> place

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
longer as well he just have to place

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.870 
longer as well he just have to place
place<00:01:49.290> more<00:01:49.500> water<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:50.009> can<00:01:50.399> also<00:01:50.520> make<00:01:50.759> it

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
place more water you can also make it

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.569 
place more water you can also make it
all<00:01:51.000> source<00:01:51.270> blogs<00:01:51.600> doesn't<00:01:52.020> matter<00:01:52.310> so<00:01:53.310> let's

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
all source blogs doesn't matter so let's

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.789 
all source blogs doesn't matter so let's
get<00:01:53.670> started<00:01:54.710> flying<00:01:55.710> down<00:01:55.950> some<00:01:56.189> sugar<00:01:56.399> cane

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:07.200 

go<00:02:02.579> now<00:02:03.579> I<00:02:03.610> let<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:04.030> tar<00:02:04.409> done<00:02:05.409> cool<00:02:05.970> now<00:02:06.970> next

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
go now I let the tar done cool now next

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.229 
go now I let the tar done cool now next
off<00:02:07.450> we<00:02:08.349> want<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:08.619> make<00:02:08.769> and<00:02:09.250> this<00:02:09.849> is<00:02:09.970> just<00:02:10.090> a

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
off we want to make and this is just a

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.110 
off we want to make and this is just a
personal<00:02:10.869> that's<00:02:11.080> just<00:02:11.349> a<00:02:11.410> tip<00:02:11.739> that<00:02:11.980> no<00:02:12.730> this

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
personal that's just a tip that no this

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.759 
personal that's just a tip that no this
is<00:02:13.269> what<00:02:13.420> i<00:02:13.450> usually<00:02:13.720> do<00:02:14.050> it<00:02:14.140> because<00:02:14.410> else<00:02:14.590> is

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
is what i usually do it because else is

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.220 
is what i usually do it because else is
getting<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.760> be<00:02:15.849> a<00:02:15.880> bit<00:02:16.060> of<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.239> pain<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:19.420> we

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
getting it to be a bit of a pain so we

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.600 
getting it to be a bit of a pain so we
want<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.890> block<00:02:21.280> breakers<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:22.000> be<00:02:23.580> like<00:02:24.580> that

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
want the block breakers to be like that

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.370 
want the block breakers to be like that
so<00:02:25.090> there's<00:02:25.239> one<00:02:25.390> space<00:02:25.660> available<00:02:26.170> so<00:02:26.349> that

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
so there's one space available so that

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.440 
so there's one space available so that
the<00:02:26.560> sugar<00:02:26.680> cane<00:02:27.190> can<00:02:27.430> grow<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:27.849> then<00:02:28.239> when

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
the sugar cane can grow and then when

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.210 
the sugar cane can grow and then when
this<00:02:28.569> gets<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.870> signal<00:02:29.349> it'll<00:02:29.769> break<00:02:30.040> to

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
this gets a signal it'll break to

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.130 
this gets a signal it'll break to
sugarcane<00:02:30.670> here<00:02:31.560> so<00:02:32.560> just<00:02:32.769> a<00:02:32.860> tip<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.989> way<00:02:35.110> I

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
sugarcane here so just a tip the way I

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.620 
sugarcane here so just a tip the way I
made<00:02:35.470> that<00:02:35.709> one<00:02:35.890> is<00:02:36.130> I<00:02:36.400> put<00:02:36.910> down<00:02:37.030> all<00:02:37.239> block

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
made that one is I put down all block

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.839 
made that one is I put down all block
breakers<00:02:38.080> in<00:02:38.260> like<00:02:38.769> a<00:02:38.799> random<00:02:39.069> positions<00:02:39.670> like

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
breakers in like a random positions like

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.150 
breakers in like a random positions like
this<00:02:40.060> for<00:02:40.180> example<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:41.620> then<00:02:41.709> I<00:02:41.799> had<00:02:41.920> to<00:02:42.010> use<00:02:42.130> a

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
this for example and then I had to use a

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.710 
this for example and then I had to use a
screwdriver<00:02:42.489> to<00:02:42.819> fix<00:02:42.940> them<00:02:43.269> all<00:02:43.390> it's<00:02:43.569> just

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
screwdriver to fix them all it's just

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.520 
screwdriver to fix them all it's just
such<00:02:43.959> a<00:02:43.989> pain<00:02:44.410> so<00:02:45.370> I<00:02:45.760> think<00:02:46.330> this<00:02:47.170> is<00:02:47.349> going<00:02:47.470> to

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
such a pain so I think this is going to

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.430 
such a pain so I think this is going to
be<00:02:47.650> faster<00:02:48.269> if<00:02:49.269> you<00:02:49.540> just<00:02:49.690> place<00:02:49.959> that<00:02:49.989> in<00:02:50.319> all

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
be faster if you just place that in all

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.500 
be faster if you just place that in all
the<00:02:50.470> dirt<00:02:50.799> and<00:02:50.980> then<00:02:51.190> just<00:02:51.370> place<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.849> block

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
the dirt and then just place the block

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.050 
the dirt and then just place the block
breakers<00:02:52.900> afterwards<00:02:53.760> they'll<00:02:54.760> probably

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
breakers afterwards they'll probably

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.890 
breakers afterwards they'll probably
save<00:02:55.360> you<00:02:55.450> some<00:02:55.630> time<00:02:56.489> or<00:02:57.510> alternatively<00:02:58.510> and

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
save you some time or alternatively and

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.650 
save you some time or alternatively and
even<00:02:59.140> better<00:02:59.260> step<00:02:59.620> tip<00:03:00.489> which<00:03:01.360> are<00:03:01.510> just

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
even better step tip which are just

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.930 
even better step tip which are just
thought<00:03:01.959> of<00:03:02.079> now<00:03:02.260> is<00:03:02.530> just<00:03:03.250> place<00:03:03.579> down<00:03:03.760> on<00:03:03.790> the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
thought of now is just place down on the

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.630 
thought of now is just place down on the
tube<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.359> you're<00:03:04.450> gonna<00:03:04.540> have<00:03:04.600> a<00:03:04.810> tube<00:03:05.640> coming

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
tube so you're gonna have a tube coming

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.190 
tube so you're gonna have a tube coming
out<00:03:06.790> of<00:03:06.850> every<00:03:07.299> single<00:03:07.600> block<00:03:07.750> breaker<00:03:07.959> so

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
out of every single block breaker so

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.430 
out of every single block breaker so
place<00:03:08.500> down<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.709> tubes<00:03:08.950> first<00:03:09.310> and<00:03:10.260> then<00:03:11.260> get

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
place down the tubes first and then get

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.699 
place down the tubes first and then get
under<00:03:11.739> it<00:03:12.810> let's<00:03:13.810> play<00:03:13.959> place<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.500> block

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
under it let's play place the block

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.319 
under it let's play place the block
breaks<00:03:14.950> like<00:03:15.160> that<00:03:15.340> that<00:03:15.760> will<00:03:15.850> save<00:03:16.030> you<00:03:16.180> some

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
breaks like that that will save you some

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.099 
breaks like that that will save you some
time<00:03:17.910> if<00:03:18.910> you're<00:03:19.150> not<00:03:19.239> missing<00:03:19.540> up<00:03:19.630> like<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:19.959> am

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
time if you're not missing up like I am

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.930 
time if you're not missing up like I am
okay<00:03:21.810> so<00:03:22.810> there<00:03:23.440> we<00:03:23.470> have<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.829> that's<00:03:24.459> one<00:03:24.730> row

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
okay so there we have it that's one row

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.620 
okay so there we have it that's one row
done<00:03:25.180> let's<00:03:26.019> do<00:03:26.139> the<00:03:26.200> next<00:03:26.260> one<00:03:27.209> now<00:03:28.209> these<00:03:28.450> are

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
done let's do the next one now these are

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.039 
done let's do the next one now these are
also<00:03:28.959> going<00:03:29.530> to<00:03:29.650> 0<00:03:29.950> or<00:03:30.280> forgot<00:03:30.630> 11<00:03:31.630> whole<00:03:31.810> layer

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
also going to 0 or forgot 11 whole layer

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.420 
also going to 0 or forgot 11 whole layer
so<00:03:32.530> it<00:03:32.650> weird<00:03:33.810> that's<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:34.900> bit<00:03:35.049> weird<00:03:35.340> there<00:03:36.340> we

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
so it weird that's a bit weird there we

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.970 
so it weird that's a bit weird there we
go<00:03:36.639> and<00:03:37.630> all<00:03:37.959> these<00:03:38.049> breakers<00:03:38.470> are<00:03:38.680> also<00:03:38.799> going

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
go and all these breakers are also going

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.920 
go and all these breakers are also going
to<00:03:39.040> be<00:03:39.160> connected<00:03:39.519> so<00:03:40.030> we're<00:03:40.510> just<00:03:40.540> going<00:03:40.810> to

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
to be connected so we're just going to

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.910 
to be connected so we're just going to
get<00:03:41.620> it<00:03:41.739> over<00:03:41.950> here<00:03:41.980> already<00:03:42.340> and<00:03:43.769> make<00:03:44.769> this

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
get it over here already and make this

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:52.559 
get it over here already and make this
row<00:03:45.130> as<00:03:45.280> well<00:03:46.380> yep<00:03:47.380> yep<00:03:48.480> very<00:03:49.480> nice

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:17.349 
there put the last book breakers in like

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:26.490 
there put the last book breakers in like
so<00:04:19.320> come<00:04:20.320> on<00:04:20.470> come<00:04:21.250> on<00:04:21.280> come<00:04:22.470> on<00:04:23.789> do<00:04:24.789> it<00:04:25.500> perfect

time so I'm just going to do it here you
can<00:04:31.030> do<00:04:31.210> it<00:04:31.300> anywhere<00:04:31.570> else<00:04:31.630> of<00:04:31.900> course<00:04:34.289> there

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
can do it anywhere else of course there

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.700 
can do it anywhere else of course there
you<00:04:35.349> go<00:04:35.500> that<00:04:36.070> works<00:04:36.280> and<00:04:36.610> now<00:04:37.330> if<00:04:37.660> shoot<00:04:38.500> can

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
you go that works and now if shoot can

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.270 
you go that works and now if shoot can
gross<00:04:38.919> here<00:04:39.160> for<00:04:39.340> example<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:41.800> blood<00:04:42.099> break

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
gross here for example the blood break

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.620 
gross here for example the blood break
we'll<00:04:42.460> take<00:04:42.669> it<00:04:43.139> put<00:04:44.139> in<00:04:44.259> the<00:04:44.349> chest<00:04:45.030> so<00:04:46.030> yeah

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
we'll take it put in the chest so yeah

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.120 
we'll take it put in the chest so yeah
that's<00:04:46.780> so<00:04:47.020> that's<00:04:47.169> how<00:04:47.320> it<00:04:47.410> works<00:04:47.590> it's<00:04:47.800> very

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
that's so that's how it works it's very

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.680 
that's so that's how it works it's very
simple<00:04:48.430> to<00:04:48.580> make<00:04:48.789> its<00:04:49.000> it's<00:04:49.389> not<00:04:49.630> that

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
simple to make its it's not that

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.180 
simple to make its it's not that
expensive<00:04:50.050> either<00:04:50.440> because<00:04:50.830> his<00:04:50.979> book

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
expensive either because his book

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.129 
expensive either because his book
breakers<00:04:51.520> don't<00:04:51.729> cost<00:04:51.910> anything<00:04:52.210> some<00:04:52.810> stone

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
breakers don't cost anything some stone

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.610 
breakers don't cost anything some stone
and<00:04:53.349> some<00:04:53.470> iron<00:04:53.789> it's<00:04:54.789> just<00:04:54.970> nice<00:04:55.120> and<00:04:55.150> easy

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
and some iron it's just nice and easy

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.020 
and some iron it's just nice and easy
I've<00:04:56.620> had<00:04:56.740> this<00:04:56.889> running<00:04:57.220> for<00:04:57.370> about<00:04:57.460> half<00:04:57.880> an

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.540 
I've had this running for about half an
hour<00:04:58.150> so<00:04:58.509> not<00:04:58.659> even<00:04:58.690> I<00:04:58.960> think<00:04:59.169> so<00:04:59.889> 41<00:05:00.340> is<00:05:00.430> not

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
hour so not even I think so 41 is not
