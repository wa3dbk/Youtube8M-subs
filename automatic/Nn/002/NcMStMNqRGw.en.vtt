of the vehicles here and yeah frame
rates<00:01:01.980> are<00:01:02.129> generally<00:01:02.280> pretty<00:01:03.030> reasonable

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
it's not perfect there is the occasional

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.969 
it's not perfect there is the occasional
stutter<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:09.030> slowdown<00:01:09.689> but<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.439> playable

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
and it's not perfect experience the game

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.190 
and it's not perfect experience the game
obviously<00:01:15.030> looks<00:01:15.210> better<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.570> sort<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.960> higher

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200
