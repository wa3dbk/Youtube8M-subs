00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
would suggest going to make it a size

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.429 
would suggest going to make it a size
smaller<00:02:03.630> than<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.899> think<00:02:04.079> you're<00:02:04.290> going<00:02:04.409> to

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
smaller than you think you're going to

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.350 
smaller than you think you're going to
pick<00:02:04.680> because<00:02:04.890> it'll<00:02:05.700> be<00:02:05.729> probably<00:02:05.880> too<00:02:06.210> big

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
pick because it'll be probably too big

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.300 
pick because it'll be probably too big
for<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:06.899> overall<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.920> think<00:02:08.039> it's<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.280> really

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
for you so overall I think it's a really

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.140

really<00:02:08.849> really<00:02:09.209> nice<00:02:09.390> Jersey

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150
