explosions<00:02:00.299> when<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.810> feel<00:02:01.109> like<00:02:01.259> they

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
explosions when I feel like they

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.469 
explosions when I feel like they
announced<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.920> police<00:02:02.280> deemed<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.819> don't

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
announced the police deemed I don't

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.059 
announced the police deemed I don't
think<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.840> will<00:02:03.960> be<00:02:04.079> getting<00:02:04.499> that<00:02:04.530> if<00:02:04.859> they

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
think that will be getting that if they

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:06.469 
think that will be getting that if they
actually<00:02:05.280> go<00:02:05.609> through<00:02:05.639> with<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.389> they

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
actually go through with this and they

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.029 
actually go through with this and they
make<00:02:06.689> battlefield<00:02:07.229> SWAT<00:02:07.560> we're<00:02:07.799> probably

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
make battlefield SWAT we're probably

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.350 
make battlefield SWAT we're probably
