00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.990 

this<00:00:00.930> is<00:00:01.110> not<00:00:01.319> a<00:00:01.350> new<00:00:01.589> product<00:00:01.860> but<00:00:02.669> I'm<00:00:02.790> going

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
this is not a new product but I'm going

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.519 
this is not a new product but I'm going
to<00:00:03.060> be<00:00:03.179> unboxing<00:00:03.300> it<00:00:03.689> anyway<00:00:03.929> because<00:00:04.080> it<00:00:04.380> is<00:00:04.500> a

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
to be unboxing it anyway because it is a

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.200 
to be unboxing it anyway because it is a
new<00:00:04.710> product<00:00:05.990> this<00:00:06.990> is<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.350> Intel<00:00:07.710> Core<00:00:08.040> i5

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.210 
new product this is the Intel Core i5

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.900 
new product this is the Intel Core i5
760<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.960> i5<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.800> not<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.010> new<00:00:11.309> thing<00:00:11.580> but

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
760 and the i5 is not a new thing but

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.150 
760 and the i5 is not a new thing but
the<00:00:12.059> 760<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:12.840> so<00:00:13.230> it's<00:00:13.380> kind<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.590> half<00:00:13.769> old<00:00:14.040> half

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
the 760 is so it's kind of half old half

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.359 
the 760 is so it's kind of half old half
new<00:00:14.610> this<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.210> quad<00:00:15.540> core<00:00:15.839> processor<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.619> it

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
new this is a quad core processor and it

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.939 
new this is a quad core processor and it
does<00:00:17.699> not<00:00:18.029> support<00:00:18.480> hyper<00:00:19.199> threading<00:00:19.710> but<00:00:19.859> it

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
does not support hyper threading but it

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.010 
does not support hyper threading but it
does<00:00:20.160> support<00:00:20.400> turbo<00:00:20.910> boost<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.570> basically

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
does support turbo boost so basically

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.189 
does support turbo boost so basically
it's<00:00:22.320> just<00:00:22.380> like<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.949> Core<00:00:23.160> i5<00:00:23.189> 750<00:00:24.060> but<00:00:24.990> a

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
it's just like the Core i5 750 but a

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.500 
it's just like the Core i5 750 but a
little<00:00:25.590> bit<00:00:25.740> faster<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.789> actual<00:00:27.090> stock

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
little bit faster so the actual stock

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.339 
little bit faster so the actual stock
clock<00:00:27.810> speed<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.830> core<00:00:29.039> i5<00:00:29.300> 760<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.539> as<00:00:31.170> we

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
clock speed of the core i5 760 is as we

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.080 
clock speed of the core i5 760 is as we
can<00:00:31.619> see<00:00:31.859> here<00:00:32.660> 2.8<00:00:33.660> gigahertz<00:00:34.079> versus<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
can see here 2.8 gigahertz versus the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.780 
can see here 2.8 gigahertz versus the
2.66<00:00:36.090> gigahertz<00:00:36.510> stock<00:00:37.230> frequency<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.460> i5

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
2.66 gigahertz stock frequency of the i5

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.910 
2.66 gigahertz stock frequency of the i5
750<00:00:39.270> that's<00:00:40.050> pretty<00:00:40.440> much<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.890> only

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
750 that's pretty much the only

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.880 
750 that's pretty much the only
difference<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.730> still<00:00:42.000> got<00:00:42.149> an<00:00:42.300> 8<00:00:42.420> Meg<00:00:42.629> -<00:00:42.899> it's

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
difference it still got an 8 Meg - it's

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.670 
difference it still got an 8 Meg - it's
still<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.250> Linfield<00:00:44.940> class<00:00:45.390> CPU<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.469> means

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
still a Linfield class CPU so that means

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.240 
still a Linfield class CPU so that means
that<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.039> fits<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.520> LGA<00:00:48.120> 1156<00:00:48.989> but<00:00:49.620> please<00:00:49.980> note

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
that it fits in LGA 1156 but please note

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.970 
that it fits in LGA 1156 but please note
this<00:00:50.879> since<00:00:51.180> it's<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.480> quad<00:00:51.780> core<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.350> not<00:00:52.949> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
this since it's a quad core and not a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.580 
this since it's a quad core and not a
dual<00:00:53.399> core<00:00:53.820> i5<00:00:54.360> processor<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:55.199> does<00:00:55.379> not

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
dual core i5 processor it does not

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.830 
dual core i5 processor it does not
support<00:00:56.070> onboard<00:00:56.699> graphics<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.480> if<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.690> have

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
support onboard graphics so if you have

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.229 
support onboard graphics so if you have
an<00:00:57.960> age<00:00:58.079> 55<00:00:58.620> chipset<00:00:59.100> motherboard<00:00:59.579> you<00:01:00.030> won't

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
an age 55 chipset motherboard you won't

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.880 
an age 55 chipset motherboard you won't
be<00:01:00.359> able<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.660> use<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.989> onboard<00:01:01.109> graphics<00:01:01.469> it

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
be able to use the onboard graphics it

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.070 
be able to use the onboard graphics it
has<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> three-year<00:01:02.460> warranty<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:03.120> includes<00:01:03.809> an

has a three-year warranty it includes an

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.429 
has a three-year warranty it includes an
Intel<00:01:04.820> cooling<00:01:05.820> solution<00:01:06.270> which<00:01:06.990> we're<00:01:07.290> just

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
Intel cooling solution which we're just

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.950 
Intel cooling solution which we're just
gonna<00:01:07.909> okay<00:01:08.909> we're<00:01:09.270> gonna<00:01:09.390> look<00:01:09.600> at<00:01:09.780> like<00:01:09.930> that

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
gonna okay we're gonna look at like that

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.859 
gonna okay we're gonna look at like that
so<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:11.070> very<00:01:11.130> thin<00:01:11.640> very<00:01:11.939> wussy<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:12.659> all

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
so it's very thin very wussy with all

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.380 
so it's very thin very wussy with all
the<00:01:13.080> core<00:01:13.260> i5s<00:01:13.619> especially<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> quad<00:01:14.880> cores<00:01:15.240> I

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the core i5s especially the quad cores I

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.910 
the core i5s especially the quad cores I
really<00:01:15.720> do<00:01:15.869> recommend<00:01:16.020> getting<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.740> decent

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
really do recommend getting a decent

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.649 
really do recommend getting a decent
aftermarket<00:01:17.700> cooler<00:01:17.850> from<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> likes<00:01:18.509> of

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
aftermarket cooler from the likes of

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.840 
aftermarket cooler from the likes of
Arctic<00:01:18.990> cooling<00:01:19.380> or<00:01:19.500> Noctua<00:01:19.890> or<00:01:20.189> one<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.759> those

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
Arctic cooling or Noctua or one of those

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.149 
Arctic cooling or Noctua or one of those
other<00:01:21.030> good<00:01:21.390> aftermarket<00:01:22.259> cooler<00:01:22.409> brands<00:01:23.009> I

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
other good aftermarket cooler brands I

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.550 
other good aftermarket cooler brands I
mean<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.790> will<00:01:23.970> work<00:01:24.180> but<00:01:24.780> especially<00:01:25.049> if

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
mean this will work but especially if

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.270 
mean this will work but especially if
you're<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.830> be<00:01:25.920> doing<00:01:26.009> any

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
you're going to be doing any

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.310 
you're going to be doing any
overclocking<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.090> mean<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.990> going<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.200> be

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
overclocking I mean this is going to be

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.140 
overclocking I mean this is going to be
an<00:01:28.409> overclocking<00:01:28.890> champ<00:01:29.340> because<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.909> only

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
an overclocking champ because the only

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.359 
an overclocking champ because the only
real<00:01:30.329> difference<00:01:30.570> between<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.890> 750

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
real difference between it and the 750

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.429 
real difference between it and the 750
is<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.909> has<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> higher<00:01:33.329> multiplier<00:01:33.930> so

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
is that it has a higher multiplier so

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.539 
is that it has a higher multiplier so
you're<00:01:34.590> going<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.770> be<00:01:34.890> able<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.159> take<00:01:35.400> it

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
you're going to be able to take it

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.819 
you're going to be able to take it
further<00:01:35.820> with<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> lower<00:01:36.750> overall<00:01:37.229> base<00:01:37.560> clock

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
further with a lower overall base clock

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.700 
further with a lower overall base clock
you<00:01:38.490> can<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:38.850> here<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.240> CPU<00:01:39.720> has<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.229> bit<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.619> a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
you can see here the CPU has a bit of a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.679 
you can see here the CPU has a bit of a
brushed<00:01:41.009> metal<00:01:41.280> look<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.600> know

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
brushed metal look to it and you know

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.120 
brushed metal look to it and you know
what<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.170> something<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.500> actually<00:01:44.009> we

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
what this is something that actually we

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.340 
what this is something that actually we
had<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> complaint<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.210> little<00:01:45.420> while<00:01:45.570> ago<00:01:45.750> about

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
had a complaint a little while ago about

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.340 
had a complaint a little while ago about
you<00:01:46.649> see<00:01:47.040> these<00:01:47.250> one<00:01:47.610> two<00:01:47.909> three<00:01:48.360> four<00:01:48.899> spots

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
you see these one two three four spots

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.770 
you see these one two three four spots
and<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.520> don't<00:01:50.850> know<00:01:51.060> if<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.329> can<00:01:51.509> see<00:01:51.659> you

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
and this I don't know if you can see you

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.969 
and this I don't know if you can see you
certainly<00:01:52.110> won't<00:01:52.200> be<00:01:52.320> able<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.560> see<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.890> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
certainly won't be able to see it in the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.830 
certainly won't be able to see it in the
shadows<00:01:53.369> here<00:01:53.640> maybe<00:01:54.119> if<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.360> bring<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:54.659> over

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
shadows here maybe if I bring this over

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.800 
shadows here maybe if I bring this over
to<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.200> light<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.680> can<00:01:56.219> see<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.610> faint<00:01:57.030> square

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
to the light you can see a faint square

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.510 
to the light you can see a faint square
outline<00:01:58.500> can<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.890> see<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.399> camera

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
outline can you see that in the camera

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.780 
outline can you see that in the camera
no<00:02:00.090> I'll<00:02:01.079> try<00:02:01.229> different<00:02:01.439> angles<00:02:01.710> but<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.579> can

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
no I'll try different angles but you can

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.260 
no I'll try different angles but you can
see<00:02:03.060> sort<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.689> line<00:02:04.469> on<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.820> heat<00:02:05.969> spreader

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
see sort of a line on the heat spreader

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.639 
see sort of a line on the heat spreader
like<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.750> if<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.049> get<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.320> at<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.500> certain

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
like this if you get it at a certain

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.089 
like this if you get it at a certain
angle<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.280> don't<00:02:08.819> know<00:02:08.910> yeah<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.200> all<00:02:10.739> hope<00:02:10.979> you

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
angle I don't know yeah I all hope you

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.430 
angle I don't know yeah I all hope you
are<00:02:11.220> able<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.489> see<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.790> but<00:02:12.180> basically<00:02:12.330> we<00:02:13.260> had

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
are able to see it but basically we had

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.170 
are able to see it but basically we had
someone<00:02:13.800> complained<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.310> their<00:02:14.520> CPU<00:02:14.849> had

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
someone complained that their CPU had

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.900 
someone complained that their CPU had
been<00:02:15.360> opened<00:02:15.780> because<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.349> had<00:02:16.560> this<00:02:17.370> mark<00:02:17.730> on

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
been opened because it had this mark on

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.339 
been opened because it had this mark on
it<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.239> it<00:02:18.300> had<00:02:18.450> some<00:02:18.750> thermal<00:02:19.140> compound

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
it and it had some thermal compound

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.680 
it and it had some thermal compound
residue<00:02:19.980> now<00:02:20.160> my<00:02:20.819> understanding<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.660> that

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
residue now my understanding is that

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.710 
residue now my understanding is that
Intel<00:02:22.170> actually<00:02:22.349> tests<00:02:23.040> these<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.660> is

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
Intel actually tests these and that is

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.900 
Intel actually tests these and that is
why<00:02:25.170> they<00:02:25.470> do<00:02:25.530> have<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.099> marks<00:02:26.430> on<00:02:26.610> them<00:02:26.760> and

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
why they do have the marks on them and

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.850 
why they do have the marks on them and
they<00:02:26.970> aren't<00:02:27.239> they<00:02:27.690> aren't<00:02:27.870> pristine<00:02:28.560> when

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
they aren't they aren't pristine when

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.410 
they aren't they aren't pristine when
you<00:02:28.950> take<00:02:29.129> them<00:02:29.280> out<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.580> box<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.150> was

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
you take them out of a box so that was

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.759 
you take them out of a box so that was
just<00:02:30.629> something<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:30.989> wanted<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.349> mention<00:02:31.470> to

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
just something I wanted to mention to

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.250 
just something I wanted to mention to
our<00:02:31.980> viewers<00:02:32.310> if<00:02:32.519> you<00:02:32.970> get<00:02:33.150> an<00:02:33.300> Intel<00:02:33.599> CPU<00:02:34.080> that

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
our viewers if you get an Intel CPU that

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.900 
our viewers if you get an Intel CPU that
has<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.470> little<00:02:34.860> bit<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:35.040> marking<00:02:35.459> on<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:35.760> it's
