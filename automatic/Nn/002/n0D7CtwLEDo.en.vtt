one's<00:02:19.960> jungle<00:02:20.470> if<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.680> mistaken<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.700> looks<00:02:21.910> like

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
one's jungle if I mistaken it looks like

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.000 
one's jungle if I mistaken it looks like
jungle<00:02:22.360> death<00:02:22.750> if<00:02:22.960> you<00:02:23.110> ask<00:02:23.260> me<00:02:23.530> but<00:02:23.560> you<00:02:23.860> know

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
jungle death if you ask me but you know

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.760 
jungle death if you ask me but you know
whatever<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:24.970> didn't<00:02:25.360> make<00:02:25.480> these<00:02:25.720> this<00:02:26.590> one

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
whatever I didn't make these this one

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.620 
whatever I didn't make these this one
kind<00:02:26.950> of<00:02:27.010> looks<00:02:27.160> like<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.610> Viper<00:02:27.880> one<00:02:28.210> yet

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
kind of looks like the Viper one yet

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.560 
kind of looks like the Viper one yet
again<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:29.140> know<00:02:29.290> kind<00:02:29.920> of<00:02:29.950> grey<00:02:30.360> can't<00:02:31.360> really

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
again you know kind of grey can't really

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.030 
again you know kind of grey can't really
see<00:02:31.750> it<00:02:31.840> too<00:02:31.960> much<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.290> doesn't<00:02:32.590> stand<00:02:32.830> out

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
see it too much it doesn't stand out

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.420 
see it too much it doesn't stand out
diamond<00:02:33.670> of<00:02:33.760> course<00:02:33.970> and<00:02:34.150> out<00:02:34.300> by<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.540> most

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
diamond of course and out by the most

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.160 
diamond of course and out by the most
you<00:02:36.430> know<00:02:36.550> a<00:02:36.790> big<00:02:37.090> deal<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.300> then<00:02:37.990> there's

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
you know a big deal and then there's

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.890 
you know a big deal and then there's
this<00:02:38.440> one<00:02:38.710> that<00:02:38.920> has<00:02:39.820> cool<00:02:40.090> designs<00:02:40.450> on<00:02:40.660> but

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.200 
this one that has cool designs on but
yet<00:02:41.140> again<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:41.650> can't<00:02:41.920> really<00:02:42.100> see<00:02:42.490> it<00:02:42.520> you

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
yet again you can't really see it you

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.580 
yet again you can't really see it you
can<00:02:43.300> see<00:02:43.420> when<00:02:43.570> you<00:02:43.660> zoom<00:02:43.870> in<00:02:44.080> you<00:02:44.110> can<00:02:44.260> see<00:02:44.500> the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
can see when you zoom in you can see the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.080 
can see when you zoom in you can see the
little<00:02:44.680> lines<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.220> stuff<00:02:45.280> but<00:02:45.580> nothing<00:02:45.760> too

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
little lines and stuff but nothing too

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.630 
little lines and stuff but nothing too
fancy<00:02:46.240> it<00:02:46.540> looks<00:02:46.660> like<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.840> skateboarders<00:02:47.640> wet

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640
