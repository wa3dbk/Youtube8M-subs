00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.230 
so this is kind of like we build some
such<00:01:46.350> thing<00:01:46.380> like<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.310> would<00:01:47.790> be<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.060> bill

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240

look<00:01:53.930> really<00:01:54.930> different<00:01:55.729> it<00:01:56.729> should<00:01:57.680> so<00:01:58.680> it

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
look really different it should so it

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.450 
look really different it should so it
altered<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.020> look<00:02:01.170> like<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.829> take<00:02:02.310> all

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.940 
altered it to look like that to take all
those<00:02:02.610> new<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.750> gave<00:02:04.619> this<00:02:04.710> one<00:02:04.770> I
