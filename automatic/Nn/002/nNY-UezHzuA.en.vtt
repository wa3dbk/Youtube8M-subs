00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.890
 hello to all in this video I want 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.890
 review the latest 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.639
 eyeliner out of bupa there are three types 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:19.350
 I argue because I vague too much 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:23.460
 are three types cell host aisthesis style 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:29.699
 liner which is a full eyeliner 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:36.570
 and there is only black there is this here that has the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:40.730
 brush in a kind of felt type 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:46.050
 which is not very tight as a small brush 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:48.920
 and then there's this here is the one with the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.430
 finer brush a little more we say 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.239
 professional I want to show you on 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.719
 but no 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.940
 I haven't tried all the colors because 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.399
 of these of these here with 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.610
 the infiltrator applicator is different 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.610
 colors and tell you my impressions 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.430
 then this here with the brush end I 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.360
 I did I did this or this sister 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:22.220
 the one but penalty pen 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:26.369
 what follows burgundy burgundy is 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.890
 the one with the felt applicator e 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.189
 this and the professional one with 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.310
 brush as you can see here on the hand 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.630
 this 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:42.439
 with the applicator it's just a bit we say 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:49.310
 trasparent hoso so to speak is not 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:51.560
 just an absolute black on the maneuver 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.740
 on tine folds on the eye does not make the 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.539
 same thing i wear it now and it doesn't 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.189
 the same thing also because on the skin 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.110
 of the eye we do not have these pil it 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.119
 that we find on the hand keep in mind that 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.380
 however, as with all eyeshadows 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:10.009
 swatch up the hand on several so I will 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.920
 like for the facilitation that that 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.870
 we have in applying with the pen io 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.480
 I prefer it because it's fast 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.120
 in the sense for everyone for every day 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.849
 a very fast thing to apply with the 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.340
 pen does it in a moment king comes the 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:29.660
 much more mince line much more 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.580
 symmetrical so it facilitates us in this 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.230
 in this thing, however, here is not a 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.900
 pure black 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.790
 see what it does anyway in these lines 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.720
 white in the middle 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.720
 we say acceptable 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.470
 in short, preferable with regard to 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.330
 the application community then this 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.010
 in filter 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.300
 I don't like felt applicators 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.340
 so because I don't know how I pack it 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.530
 sublime because apply to others 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.950
 came a breeze for 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.430
 applying it are on themselves is a little more 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.320
 complicated and to apply it on me 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.280
 I do a little effort because it's a bit 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.280
 rigid for my taste 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.630
 however, these too 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.620
 we say that the black blue are 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:28.190
 different colors 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:33.140
 that is black brown blue and green and the 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:36.650
 burgundy these colors here in black and blue 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.050
 are the ones we say most covering for 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.980
 so to say the burgundy you see that if me 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:48.380
 I move quickly I make a corner a 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:51.640
 moment creates this transparency and not me 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.920
 I really like this here instead 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.900
 with the small brush that he doesn't have anyway 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.290
 an application that I love because the 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.760
 so fine brush 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.710
 I repeat to apply it to others 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.400
 perfect for apply on me creates me a 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:11.510
 a bit of discomfort, but this one is wonderful 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.400
 and black tint holds so much there too 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:18.070
 for there to the others if for that 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.070
 they hold a lot are not days 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.120
 eye liner for fade I don't know there 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:28.919
 I show one that I said o 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:31.470
 of the air france liked this which 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.690
 here liner of essence which has a 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:37.050
 brush and also this then felt but 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.940
 a little less rigid this one but veil 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:43.250
 anyway it takes a while 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:47.160
 trasparent hoso is this here though later 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.560
 three hours but how to vanish and from one thing 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.180
 horrible and does not end in su garsi 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.240
 remains as wet and is not an effect 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.270
 shiny remains just as wet and not 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.130
 I like it at all 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.440
 instead I like this full here 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.860
 very much as a seal as the result 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.780
 it is not opaque when it dries is not a 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.860
 pack see from a glossy finish and mi 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.560
 I like it alot 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.440
 instead the pen and the felt one a 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.270
 a matte finish has its own packet end 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:20.159
 however I tell you the felt ones for whom 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.979
 is used to this application to whom 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:26.699
 like can be a valid choice 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:28.560
 because I have this transparency 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:31.409
 made to show you produce when you go to 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.800
 move it quickly as if calastra 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:36.509
 amount of product in the brush I do not know 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.310
 if you managed to work around that anyway 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:41.400
 by doing two evils it is possible to avoid 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.960
 this problem is also good because there 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.669
 they are nice colors not always yes 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.740
 find liner that are Bourbon on board 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:53.639
 so you have to try some eyeliner e 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:56.460
 not a very personal thing not all a 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:59.699
 hand the brush up not all of them 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.919
 by hand the pen and in any case it is worth trying 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:04.139
 I tell you about the eye I will try to do 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.240
 of the tutorials with these products from 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:08.610
 let you see 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.259
 look i am cleaning you with the 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.240
 brush cleaner I know you don't 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:15.360
 should do because the skin is in need 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.200
 but to make it fast and see how 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.160
 others leave 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.690
 this is faster and more homogeneous 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.090
 it remains just attached that it was that 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:28.110
 with the brush is a seal more 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:31.510
 in my opinion higher and more professional 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.430
 I told you, you have to try because 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.700
 on the eye then they have results 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:39.490
 different for example I am now 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:42.910
 wearing that pen and see that not 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:45.400
 is a bad result is a result 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:50.500
 very nice of course I would have had one 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.850
 cover a more decisive result with 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.310
 this is the penis call brush 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.530
 thin I call him i told him 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:59.760
 names this is called professional liner 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:02.500
 and of course the most professional one 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.110
 This guilt Nellino felt called 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.790
 defines online and probably why 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:10.300
 should be easier to apply 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:12.820
 given life on the felt panel e 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:15.390
 this liner style that I told you 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:17.920
 at the beginning , I hope to have you 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:21.100
 help with your choice of line 

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.860
 up with this review I want to do 

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:26.020
 soon preview of the pencils moves 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:30.070
 even though here but these I haven't yet 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:31.570
 tried and so I tend to try them myself 

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:35.530
 they are curious because these are the 

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:38.860
 very beautiful colors there is a green these 

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:41.350
 would be to make smokey no then 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:46.510
 you have a smokey fast on one side 

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:47.350
 and the pencil on the other side will fade the idea 

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.030
 is cute 

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:51.420
 you have to see how it works 

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:55.750
 in short, I will try the purple and 

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:59.400
 burgundy always emerald green black 

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:59.400
 brown and gray fleece 

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.850
 nothing the proofs I will let me know I hope 

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:08.580
 that this review was helpful to you 

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:08.580
 I send a kiss rules hello
