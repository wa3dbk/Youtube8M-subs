00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.779
 how did the South American tournament take you? 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.970
 You can have the continuity that you wanted 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.300
 the game although it could not be fulfilled 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.750
 objective 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:19.420
 yes the truth that what good of very 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.100
 surprise did not take me we did not expect to have 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.430
 as if this was left out in the 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.380
 first stage but they are not things of the 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.290
 football , soccer is like that, it gives you many 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.439
 surprises and good now it's about 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.690
 reverse the situation here in the club not 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.699
 It's your turn to have a player as a partner 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.980
 that you are talking a lot about your 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.690
 incorporation of dirt river that you 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.809
 I can comment on the one you talked about 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.920
 personally yes the truth that good 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.260
 we talk to Juan and 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.949
 he wants to come so he wants to play in 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.769
 the country but good are negotiations that 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.390
 is doing the club and hopefully I can 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.199
 come because he 's a very good player who 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.199
 will bring many things 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.580
 and good the truth that nothing for what 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.710
 yes he is a fast skill player 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.170
 that takes the ball very well when it goes 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.460
 in speed hits very well has 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.920
 several like this things that can serve 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.930
 for the team on the other hand ramón how 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.330
 you feel with the feeling that we have a 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.150
 little more of prominence in what is going to 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.000
 be the eleven taking into account that 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:31.090
 before you did not have so much continuity 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.210
 and the truth what a nice competition there is 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.340
 great players in my position that good 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.730
 always the competition is there that's 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.660
 the beauty of football does not have competition 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.830
 and well I hope I can start or if I do not go 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.240
 to support where you are 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.700
 Sanmartín of all with a scheme 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.800
 different today you see that calls were 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.230
 another scheme with three defenders and 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.530
 four ruffles or the position of 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.620
 Hitch changes you into something this or as 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.190
 It's the game 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.740
 how important it is good that ramón 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.500
 want to play with hitch because that is 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.509
 us what is hardest all my juan 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.739
 house that makes things easier 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:17.819
 then later how do you make the decision 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.739
 from me I think I'm fine for 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.900
 to start in the same way 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:27.579
 like my classmates 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.900
 I think that although that is no no it is not a 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:32.170
 preseason what we did but 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.170
 we were playing for a long time 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.390
 in constant activity and I think I'm 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.670
 well physically seeing that it reaches up 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.680
 recently surprised what it was to do the 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.750
 training the amount of people the 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.390
 number of autographs that ask you to 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.359
 photos same today the training with the 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.480
 tribune that are almost always full and 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:56.400
 if it happens that the same is up where 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.879
 go there's always going to be a crowd of people 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.290
 It's the beauty of football too that so much 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:06.360
 people follow you to support you is fundamental is 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.829
 When you arrive, it was your turn to see your 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.870
 companions when the superclassic as 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.030
 You see that was taken on campus while 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.069
 this was a friendly a joy that they 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.769
 He contributed ramón in what could be 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.450
 They still won but he corrected them 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.890
 he told them that that 's fine what they are 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.710
 doing 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.300
 I do not think we did things in 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.580
 general lines we are doing the 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.580
 things well both the games that play 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.310
 the guys against independent-mouth the 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.110
 friendly friendlies 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.480
 we are doing things very well 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.280
 good product of the preseason and 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.170
 we hope to continue like this to be able to start 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.400
 the championship in the best way the 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.560
 same then they are missing two parties 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.540
 100 are friendly as they take them and you 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.489
 personally you want to have a few minutes 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.400
 in the mouth and follow the good run of what 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.640
 that was the first triumph I hope I wish 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.170
 play play because because it's not a 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.069
 rival that all players want 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.290
 play no and I'm a river fan 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.720
 classic as that is double satisfaction 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.350
 but good and if not encourage my 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:11.989
 companions as I did as the 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.989
 previous classic trying to give the best
