don't get as much publicity because size

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.770 
don't get as much publicity because size
does<00:00:49.890> matter<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.460> sport<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.300> it's<00:00:51.690> a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
does matter in that sport and it's a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.540 
does matter in that sport and it's a
sport<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:53.040> take<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.310> to<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.460> extreme

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
sport so to take it to the extreme

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.510 
sport so to take it to the extreme
sometimes<00:00:54.450> they<00:00:54.660> do<00:00:54.720> use<00:00:55.340> human<00:00:56.340> growth

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
sometimes they do use human growth

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.900 
sometimes they do use human growth
hormone<00:00:57.030> or<00:00:57.210> anabolic<00:00:58.200> steroids<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.790> we

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
hormone or anabolic steroids and so we

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.069 
hormone or anabolic steroids and so we
want<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.180> make<00:01:00.300> sure<00:01:00.329> we're<00:01:00.660> not<00:01:00.690> dabbling

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
want to make sure we're not dabbling

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.389 
want to make sure we're not dabbling
into<00:01:01.380> any<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.680> those<00:01:01.800> because<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.130> don't<00:01:02.280> want

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
into any of those because you don't want

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.030 
into any of those because you don't want
to<00:01:02.489> get<00:01:02.610> that<00:01:02.790> big<00:01:03.059> now<00:01:03.899> another<00:01:04.439> reason<00:01:04.890> why

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
to get that big now another reason why

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.649

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
you're not going to look like a man or

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.109 
you're not going to look like a man or
bulky<00:01:07.319> when<00:01:07.499> you<00:01:07.649> weight<00:01:07.889> train<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.369> because

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
bulky when you weight train is because

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.050 
bulky when you weight train is because
genetically<00:01:09.869> women<00:01:10.469> are<00:01:10.679> not<00:01:10.979> set<00:01:11.579> up<00:01:11.759> to<00:01:11.789> have

program<00:01:39.299> now<00:01:39.929> that's<00:01:40.139> partially<00:01:40.469> true<00:01:40.740> but

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
program now that's partially true but

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.330 
program now that's partially true but
hey<00:01:41.850> it's<00:01:42.209> temporary<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.020> B<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:43.859> very

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
hey it's temporary and B it's very

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.399 
hey it's temporary and B it's very
minimal<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.569> reason<00:01:45.749> why<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.380> is

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
minimal and the reason why that is is

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.749 
minimal and the reason why that is is
when<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.799> started<00:01:47.130> trying<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.459> strength

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
when you started trying a strength

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.910 
when you started trying a strength
training<00:01:47.969> program<00:01:48.359> without<00:01:48.509> even<00:01:49.049> working

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
training program without even working

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.889 
training program without even working
out<00:01:50.189> before<00:01:50.670> you're<00:01:51.240> going<00:01:51.359> to<00:01:51.420> notice<00:01:51.599> you're

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
out before you're going to notice you're

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.719 
out before you're going to notice you're
going<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.079> get<00:01:52.200> sore<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.979> what<00:01:53.099> that<00:01:53.279> is<00:01:53.459> is

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
going to get sore and what that is is

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.819 
going to get sore and what that is is
those<00:01:53.909> little<00:01:54.060> tiny<00:01:54.719> muscle<00:01:55.200> fibers<00:01:55.649> get

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
those little tiny muscle fibers get

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.919 
those little tiny muscle fibers get
those<00:01:55.979> little<00:01:56.219> micro<00:01:56.609> tears<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.209> what<00:01:57.779> that

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
those little micro tears and what that

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.129 
those little micro tears and what that
does<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.490> you<00:01:59.490> may<00:01:59.669> get<00:01:59.969> some<00:02:00.240> water<00:02:00.659> retention

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:01.139 
does is you may get some water retention

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:03.620 
does is you may get some water retention
and<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.829> may<00:02:02.009> cause<00:02:02.310> about<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> one<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.359> four

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
and that may cause about a one to four

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.949 
and that may cause about a one to four
pound<00:02:04.069> weight<00:02:05.069> gain<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.639> the<00:02:05.729> initial<00:02:05.999> month

pound weight gain in the initial month

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:08.990 
pound weight gain in the initial month
or<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.709> your<00:02:07.919> strength<00:02:08.220> training<00:02:08.459> program

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
or so of your strength training program

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.539 
or so of your strength training program
but<00:02:09.780> with<00:02:10.319> those<00:02:10.440> little<00:02:10.679> tears<00:02:11.099> and

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
but with those little tears and

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.819 
but with those little tears and
retaining<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.239> water<00:02:12.510> it's<00:02:13.110> allowing<00:02:13.620> your

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829 
retaining that water it's allowing your

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.170 
retaining that water it's allowing your
muscles<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.489> repair<00:02:14.909> and<00:02:15.209> grow<00:02:15.870> and

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
muscles to repair and grow and

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.089 
muscles to repair and grow and
come<00:02:16.420> more<00:02:16.629> dense<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.319> you<00:02:17.379> can<00:02:17.650> burn<00:02:17.859> more

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
come more dense so you can burn more

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.220 
come more dense so you can burn more
calories<00:02:18.459> at<00:02:18.849> rest<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.480> your<00:02:19.750> muscles<00:02:19.900> can

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
calories at rest and your muscles can

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.319 
calories at rest and your muscles can
become<00:02:20.500> stronger<00:02:20.859> and<00:02:21.159> work<00:02:21.640> with<00:02:21.909> you<00:02:22.120> as

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
become stronger and work with you as

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.660 
become stronger and work with you as
opposed<00:02:22.659> to<00:02:22.900> against<00:02:23.349> you<00:02:23.670> unfortunately

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
opposed to against you unfortunately

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.229 
opposed to against you unfortunately
initially<00:02:25.540> that's<00:02:25.810> going<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.790> happen<00:02:27.790> a

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
initially that's going to happen a

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.240 
initially that's going to happen a
little<00:02:28.719> bit<00:02:28.810> slower<00:02:29.079> than<00:02:29.409> the<00:02:29.469> fat<00:02:29.799> loss<00:02:30.040> so

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
little bit slower than the fat loss so

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.380 
little bit slower than the fat loss so
you're<00:02:30.400> going<00:02:30.489> to<00:02:30.549> gain<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:30.819> little<00:02:31.090> bit<00:02:31.239> of

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
you're going to gain a little bit of

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.610 
you're going to gain a little bit of
muscle<00:02:31.599> in<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.870> beginning<00:02:32.260> with<00:02:32.409> water

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
muscle in the beginning with water

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.740 
muscle in the beginning with water
retention<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.370> then<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.849> fat<00:02:34.090> loss<00:02:34.329> doesn't

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
retention and then the fat loss doesn't

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.390 
retention and then the fat loss doesn't
trigger<00:02:35.079> for<00:02:35.379> another<00:02:35.560> few<00:02:35.859> weeks<00:02:35.889> that's<00:02:36.280> why

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
trigger for another few weeks that's why

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.140 
trigger for another few weeks that's why
you<00:02:36.459> want<00:02:36.639> to<00:02:36.700> make<00:02:36.790> sure<00:02:36.819> you're<00:02:37.030> being

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
you want to make sure you're being

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.209 
you want to make sure you're being
consistent<00:02:37.719> with<00:02:37.870> your<00:02:38.019> program<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.769> at

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:39.219 
consistent with your program and at

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:42.270 
consistent with your program and at
least<00:02:39.459> giving<00:02:39.849> it<00:02:39.939> a<00:02:40.030> 12<00:02:40.389> week<00:02:40.959> time<00:02:41.620> frame<00:02:41.650> to

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
least giving it a 12 week time frame to

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.459 
least giving it a 12 week time frame to
see<00:02:42.730> those<00:02:42.939> results<00:02:43.209> so<00:02:43.689> being<00:02:43.900> consistent

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:44.469 
see those results so being consistent

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:45.750 
see those results so being consistent
with<00:02:44.560> strength<00:02:44.799> training<00:02:45.040> is<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.609> ultimate
