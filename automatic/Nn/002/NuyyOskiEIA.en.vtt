now watch this I just pulled the brush

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.809 
now watch this I just pulled the brush
out<00:00:45.789> of<00:00:46.269> the<00:00:47.139> tube<00:00:47.440> and<00:00:47.739> as<00:00:47.889> you<00:00:48.010> can<00:00:48.159> see<00:00:48.219> there

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:48.819 
out of the tube and as you can see there

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:51.750 
out of the tube and as you can see there
are<00:00:48.909> some<00:00:49.089> spikes<00:00:49.479> there<00:00:49.839> but<00:00:50.170> there's<00:00:51.010> also<00:00:51.249> a

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
are some spikes there but there's also a

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.139 
are some spikes there but there's also a
lot<00:00:52.539> of<00:00:52.749> product<00:00:53.319> protruding<00:00:54.159> from<00:00:54.909> the<00:00:55.120> end

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
lot of product protruding from the end

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.899 
lot of product protruding from the end
there<00:00:55.659> so<00:00:56.019> it's<00:00:56.229> very<00:00:56.609> important<00:00:57.609> if<00:00:57.729> you<00:00:57.789> want

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
because this is a mascara that is adding

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.750 
because this is a mascara that is adding
substantial<00:02:01.420> length<00:02:02.140> to<00:02:02.680> your<00:02:02.950> lash<00:02:03.280> the

number one best quality about this

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.630 
number one best quality about this
mascara<00:02:06.850> is<00:02:07.210> that<00:02:07.570> you<00:02:08.170> can<00:02:08.649> build<00:02:09.039> length

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
mascara is that you can build length

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.479 
mascara is that you can build length
with<00:02:09.940> it<00:02:10.149> you<00:02:11.019> can<00:02:11.290> apply<00:02:11.409> multiple<00:02:11.859> coats<00:02:12.099> I

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
with it you can apply multiple coats I

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.350 
with it you can apply multiple coats I
applied<00:02:12.819> three<00:02:13.239> coats<00:02:13.569> to<00:02:14.409> my<00:02:14.590> lashes

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
applied three coats to my lashes

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.120 
applied three coats to my lashes
and<00:02:15.450> notice<00:02:15.900> that<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.260> just<00:02:16.290> continued

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
and notice that it just continued

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.310 
and notice that it just continued
building<00:02:17.490> lengths<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.390> know<00:02:18.510> with<00:02:18.750> each<00:02:19.020> one

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
building lengths you know with each one

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.710 
building lengths you know with each one
I<00:02:19.620> didn't<00:02:20.100> let<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.280> get<00:02:20.490> totally<00:02:20.970> dry<00:02:21.240> between

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
I didn't let it get totally dry between

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.860 
I didn't let it get totally dry between
each<00:02:21.900> coat<00:02:22.710> and<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.070> think<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:23.430> helped

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
each coat and I think that helped

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.930 
each coat and I think that helped
however<00:02:24.870> as<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.650> put<00:02:25.860> on<00:02:25.950> more<00:02:26.220> coats<00:02:26.520> you

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
however as you put on more coats you

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.880 
however as you put on more coats you
will<00:02:27.150> notice<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.690> little<00:02:28.080> more<00:02:28.440> clumpiness

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
happening I mean it doesn't just

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.870

you<00:03:48.810> know<00:03:48.900> right<00:03:49.200> on<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.410> inside<00:03:49.769> your<00:03:50.040> lowers

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
hard to get to it can't take that much

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.140 
hard to get to it can't take that much
product<00:03:54.900> so<00:03:55.290> you<00:03:55.350> must<00:03:55.860> clean<00:03:56.250> this<00:03:56.430> off<00:03:56.670> and<00:03:57.000> I

product so you must clean this off and I

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.300 
product so you must clean this off and I
seriously<00:03:57.840> when<00:03:58.140> I<00:03:58.200> was<00:03:58.320> applying<00:03:58.680> I<00:03:58.920> mean<00:03:59.100> I

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
seriously when I was applying I mean I

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.890 
seriously when I was applying I mean I
was<00:03:59.610> spending<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.120> decent<00:04:00.480> amount<00:04:00.540> of<00:04:00.690> time

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
was spending a decent amount of time

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.870 
was spending a decent amount of time
really<00:04:01.530> getting<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.950> product<00:04:02.400> off<00:04:02.580> of<00:04:02.760> the

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
end of this because I mean it's those

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.970 
end of this because I mean it's those
small<00:04:05.790> areas<00:04:05.970> that<00:04:06.600> can't<00:04:06.930> be<00:04:07.019> overloaded<00:04:07.830> and

small areas that can't be overloaded and

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.590 
small areas that can't be overloaded and

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
really taper at the tip and you pull

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.630 
really taper at the tip and you pull
them<00:04:16.140> out<00:04:16.260> of<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.530> packaging<00:04:17.070> that's<00:04:17.400> what's

going to get those tiny lashes that's

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.710 
going to get those tiny lashes that's
what<00:04:19.200> the<00:04:19.290> packaging<00:04:19.769> says

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
what the packaging says

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.990 
what the packaging says
and<00:04:20.810> that's<00:04:21.410> the<00:04:21.739> part<00:04:22.070> of<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.370> wand<00:04:22.610> that<00:04:22.940> is

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
and that's the part of the wand that is

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.690 
and that's the part of the wand that is
overloaded<00:04:23.990> with<00:04:24.110> product<00:04:24.680> so<00:04:25.010> you<00:04:25.070> have<00:04:25.430> to

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
overloaded with product so you have to

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.220 
overloaded with product so you have to
you<00:04:26.210> know<00:04:26.360> and<00:04:26.480> they're<00:04:26.600> not<00:04:26.720> telling<00:04:27.140> you

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
you know and they're not telling you

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.960 
you know and they're not telling you
this<00:04:27.410> but<00:04:27.680> you<00:04:27.830> have<00:04:27.860> to<00:04:28.400> spend<00:04:28.700> some<00:04:28.850> time

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
this but you have to spend some time

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.750 
this but you have to spend some time
cleaning<00:04:29.780> it<00:04:30.050> off<00:04:30.260> and<00:04:30.710> you<00:04:30.860> know<00:04:30.980> your<00:04:31.250> rim<00:04:31.550> is

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
cleaning it off and you know your rim is

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.820 
cleaning it off and you know your rim is
inevitably<00:04:32.330> getting<00:04:32.720> kind<00:04:32.960> of<00:04:33.050> goopy<00:04:33.500> at<00:04:33.620> that

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
inevitably getting kind of goopy at that

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.310 
inevitably getting kind of goopy at that
point<00:04:34.190> but<00:04:34.400> I<00:04:34.700> mean<00:04:35.270> it's<00:04:35.660> just<00:04:35.750> something<00:04:36.110> you

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
point but I mean it's just something you

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.750 
point but I mean it's just something you
have<00:04:36.410> to<00:04:36.470> think<00:04:36.710> about<00:04:36.800> before<00:04:37.040> you<00:04:37.250> apply<00:04:37.730> it

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
have to think about before you apply it

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.570 
have to think about before you apply it
so<00:04:38.720> ultimate<00:04:39.680> question<00:04:40.100> at<00:04:40.220> the<00:04:40.310> end<00:04:40.340> of<00:04:40.520> the

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
so ultimate question at the end of the

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.620 
so ultimate question at the end of the
day<00:04:40.730> is<00:04:41.060> what<00:04:41.450> I<00:04:41.480> again<00:04:42.290> repeatedly<00:04:43.160> pay<00:04:43.630> $22

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
day is what I again repeatedly pay $22

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.200 
day is what I again repeatedly pay $22
to<00:04:44.900> repurchase<00:04:45.500> this<00:04:45.680> mascara<00:04:46.250> and<00:04:46.520> I<00:04:46.790> would

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
to repurchase this mascara and I would

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.580 
to repurchase this mascara and I would
not<00:04:47.470> as<00:04:48.470> much<00:04:48.770> as<00:04:48.950> I<00:04:49.040> like<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.460> length<00:04:50.170> I<00:04:51.170> don't

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
not as much as I like the length I don't

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.160 
not as much as I like the length I don't
think<00:04:51.860> this<00:04:52.040> length<00:04:52.370> is<00:04:52.580> unique<00:04:53.060> to<00:04:53.480> just<00:04:53.900> this

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
think this length is unique to just this

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.830 
think this length is unique to just this
mascara<00:04:54.860> it<00:04:55.130> reminded<00:04:55.760> me<00:04:55.820> lengthwise<00:04:56.480> of

considering I applied three coats here
