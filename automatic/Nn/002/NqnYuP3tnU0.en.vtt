 Second World War that 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.520
 characterized by its character rather 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.010
 rebellious but honorable and he had a 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.260
 incredible combative skill is 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.270
 inspired by marfret von richthofen more

 palance who had a stature 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.909
 intimidating very rough features and a voice 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.560
 particularly rough and scratchy that 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.599
 gave a certain charisma to their 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.209
 interpretations as a villain in several 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.430
 dark set westerns became a 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.140
 tyrant with a stony and expressionless face 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.239
 each of his words is a 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.519
 precise cold sentence that does not stop

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.500
 the characters created by marvel in the 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.500
 70 to take advantage of the furor of the 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.420
 Growing culture of martial arts 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.190
 danny rand is a supreme combatant of 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.260

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.620
 heir of the title and the iron technique

 fist despite being Caucasian 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.060
 this character is based on the actor 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.039
 philosopher and martial artist Bruce Lee already 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.530
 that many compare to their personal style 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.510
 and wet with the iron fist style of 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.330
 that was based on fluid movements and 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.520
 difficult 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.620
 based loosely on the version of 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.310
 satanás de john milton in his work el 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.409

 doors of hell to give them to sant 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.300
 man 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:51.460
 neil gaiman expressly requested that the 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.250
 design of its appearance resembles the 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.210
 singer and actor david bowie 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.599
 particularly to what can be seen in 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.550
 the movie the man of fate bullfighting 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:03.789
 1976 where I'm going to play a being 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.710
 mysterious and strange extraterrestrial 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.750
 sebastian shaw is a mutant that was 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.849
 for a long time the head of the club 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.400
 the cinema where it was known as black 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:14.710
 kid is one of the biggest villains of the 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.659
 marvel universe able to absorb all 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.789
 energy class or physical attack that 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:21.669
 be directed towards it to increase 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:23.919
 his physical abilities is inspired 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:26.009
 physically in the British actor Robert 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.270
 shaw with whom also shares last name 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:31.389
 mainly in his kings character of 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.610
 the 1975 shark movie and its 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:34.360
 Sinister and manipulative personality is 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.969
 Similary 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:41.139
 the Russian killer played by sour 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:42.849
 from russia with love from 1963 this 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.710
 mutant member of the club and affects and 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:46.050
 known as black bishop 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.909
 characterized by its behavior 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.979
 pompous condescending and haughty in 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:52.599
 part thanks to its power to increase the 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:55.509
 mass of the objects that causes 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:57.400
 people fall kneeling before him was 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:59.560
 created almost as a tribute to the actor 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.169
 orson welles since his appearance 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.900
 it resembles pretty much that of jp morgan a 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:07.240
 character interpreted by web is also 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.919
 his name harry comes from above and the 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.139
 last name of the pnc and on the day axis 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:13.930
 I read both characters in different 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.879
 movies by orson welles although the 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.650
 author alan moore created john constantine 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:19.900
 with the idea that he is a sorcerer 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.939
 hooligan was the cartoonist this penis 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.379
 review t who decided to bring you a 

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:26.229
 look very similar at least 

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:28.210
 initially to the singer's sting this 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:30.639
 it was first because the character is 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.979
 British with Irish ancestry 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:35.259
 just like the singer and also because in 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:37.210
 that sting era he dressed and expressed 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:39.370
 with the style of the subculture mod la 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.110
 which can be seen very well represented 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.090
 in the movie quadrophenia 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:46.270
 nine hundred and seventy nine in which the 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:48.280
 singer makes a good appearance friends 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.350
 so far the video I hope you put in 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.880

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.670
