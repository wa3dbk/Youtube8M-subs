through the five simple steps of brewing
today<00:00:14.610> remember<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.450> great<00:00:15.629> batch<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:16.080> draft

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
today remember of a great batch of draft

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:28.880 
today remember of a great batch of draft
here<00:00:25.820> basically<00:00:27.170> five<00:00:28.170> really<00:00:28.350> simple<00:00:28.710> steps

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
here basically five really simple steps

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.530 
here basically five really simple steps
to<00:00:28.950> bring<00:00:29.160> first<00:00:30.060> we're<00:00:30.150> gonna<00:00:30.240> start<00:00:30.480> with

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:30.540 
to bring first we're gonna start with

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.709 
to bring first we're gonna start with
the<00:00:30.690> mashing<00:00:31.170> process<00:00:31.759> this<00:00:32.759> releases<00:00:33.270> and

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
the mashing process this releases and

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.900 
the mashing process this releases and
energizes<00:00:34.230> all<00:00:34.379> of<00:00:34.530> those<00:00:34.710> sugars<00:00:35.339> within<00:00:35.789> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
energizes all of those sugars within the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.290 
energizes all of those sugars within the
malt<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.539> the<00:00:36.690> grain<00:00:37.219> to<00:00:38.219> spread<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.760> base<00:00:38.910> of

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
malt in the grain to spread the base of

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.079 
malt in the grain to spread the base of
beer<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:40.050> report<00:00:40.350> hot<00:00:40.649> water<00:00:40.859> and<00:00:41.100> mix<00:00:41.789> it<00:00:41.969> with

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.089 
beer to report hot water and mix it with

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:46.189 
beer to report hot water and mix it with
malt<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:43.530> create<00:00:43.949> our<00:00:44.670> wort<00:00:45.359> okay

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
malt to create our wort okay

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:47.959 
malt to create our wort okay
and<00:00:46.350> wort<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.859> absolute<00:00:47.190> basis<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.730> beer

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
and wort is the absolute basis of beer

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.149 
and wort is the absolute basis of beer
this<00:00:48.659> is<00:00:48.719> pretty<00:00:49.050> much<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.440> same<00:00:49.620> process

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.159 
this is pretty much the same process

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:52.369 
this is pretty much the same process
that<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.460> would<00:00:50.699> go<00:00:50.909> through<00:00:51.179> if<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.199> are<00:00:52.350> a

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
that you would go through if you are a

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.380 
that you would go through if you are a
commercial<00:00:52.679> Brewer<00:00:53.069> but<00:00:53.370> exact<00:00:53.819> on<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> smaller

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
commercial Brewer but exact on a smaller

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.829 
commercial Brewer but exact on a smaller
scale<00:00:54.690> exactly<00:00:56.210> what<00:00:57.210> we're<00:00:57.359> doing<00:00:57.600> here<00:00:57.780> is

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
scale exactly what we're doing here is

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:59.719 
scale exactly what we're doing here is
we're<00:00:58.050> we're<00:00:58.530> mashing<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:59.159> so<00:00:59.489> we're

00:00:59.719 --> 00:00:59.729 
we're we're mashing in so we're

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:01.669 
we're we're mashing in so we're
basically<00:01:00.059> making<00:01:00.690> sure<00:01:01.229> that<00:01:01.409> we<00:01:01.499> have<00:01:01.649> a

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
basically making sure that we have a

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.180 
basically making sure that we have a
nice<00:01:01.859> evening<00:01:02.699> grain<00:01:03.089> bed<00:01:03.620> and<00:01:04.620> mixing<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.070> all

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
nice evening grain bed and mixing in all

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.120 
nice evening grain bed and mixing in all
these<00:01:05.370> ingredients<00:01:05.519> they<00:01:06.060> start<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.360> smell

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
these ingredients they start to smell

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.959 
these ingredients they start to smell
the<00:01:08.130> brewing<00:01:08.490> process<00:01:08.520> happening<00:01:10.820> okay<00:01:11.820> we're

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:11.969 
the brewing process happening okay we're

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:14.209 
the brewing process happening okay we're
gonna<00:01:12.060> seal<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.509> mash<00:01:12.689> tun<00:01:12.899> now<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.979> let<00:01:14.130> that
