shoulders<00:00:21.470> are<00:00:21.710> the<00:00:22.670> most<00:00:22.880> mobile<00:00:23.210> joint<00:00:23.840> in

note with chest as well because people

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.249 
note with chest as well because people
tend<00:01:06.710> to<00:01:07.330> strain<00:01:08.330> their<00:01:08.539> shoulders<00:01:08.930> often

the shoulders thoroughly is also

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.010 
the shoulders thoroughly is also
