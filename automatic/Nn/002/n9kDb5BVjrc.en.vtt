I'm using the app modeling in there and

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.850 
I'm using the app modeling in there and
the<00:00:38.309> distortion<00:00:38.760> in<00:00:38.879> there<00:00:39.860> hopefully

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
bypass pedal then go with that there's

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.440 
bypass pedal then go with that there's
no<00:01:38.939> right<00:01:39.210> or<00:01:39.240> wrong<00:01:39.390> here<00:01:40.640> so<00:01:41.640> here's<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
no right or wrong here so here's the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.389 
no right or wrong here so here's the
video<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.990> listening<00:01:43.680> very<00:01:43.829> carefully<00:01:44.130> to

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
video and listening very carefully to

00:01:44.399 --> 00:02:48.770 
video and listening very carefully to
the<00:01:44.880> difference<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.299> tone

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.510 

so<00:02:49.780> that<00:02:49.930> was<00:02:50.020> an<00:02:50.110> example<00:02:50.170> for<00:02:50.530> don't<00:02:51.130> you<00:02:51.250> buy

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
so that was an example for don't you buy

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.520 
so that was an example for don't you buy
the<00:02:51.550> past<00:02:51.880> versus<00:02:52.480> true<00:02:52.690> bypass<00:02:53.050> seasoning

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
about my pedalboard

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.340 
about my pedalboard
I'm<00:02:57.910> going<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.180> show<00:02:58.330> you<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:59.140> concept

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
I'm going to show you the concept

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.980 
I'm going to show you the concept
between<00:02:59.770> my<00:03:00.130> pedalboard<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:00.790> why<00:03:01.360> I<00:03:01.390> built<00:03:01.870> it

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
between my pedalboard and why I built it

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.210 
between my pedalboard and why I built it
this<00:03:02.140> way<00:03:02.760> where<00:03:03.760> each<00:03:04.300> pedal<00:03:04.600> is<00:03:05.440> in<00:03:06.130> the

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
this way where each pedal is in the

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.750 
this way where each pedal is in the
chain<00:03:06.490> and<00:03:06.760> why<00:03:07.560> I'll<00:03:08.560> be<00:03:08.830> talking<00:03:08.980> about<00:03:09.220> why

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
chain and why I'll be talking about why

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.110 
chain and why I'll be talking about why
I<00:03:09.790> chose<00:03:09.940> that<00:03:10.330> pedal<00:03:10.660> specifically<00:03:11.350> and

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
I chose that pedal specifically and

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.490 
I chose that pedal specifically and
we'll<00:03:13.120> really<00:03:13.270> get<00:03:13.450> into<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:14.640> gear<00:03:15.640> aspect<00:03:16.270> of

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
we'll really get into the gear aspect of

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.690 
we'll really get into the gear aspect of
my<00:03:17.500> setup<00:03:17.710> so<00:03:18.430> I'll<00:03:18.790> see<00:03:19.270> you<00:03:19.330> next<00:03:19.390> week
