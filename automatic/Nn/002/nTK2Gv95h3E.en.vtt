this<00:00:02.610> is<00:00:02.850> kind<00:00:03.449> of<00:00:03.510> difficult<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.990> do<00:00:04.259> I<00:00:04.529> have

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
this is kind of difficult to do I have

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.829 
this is kind of difficult to do I have
to<00:00:05.279> turn<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.549> lights<00:00:05.790> on<00:00:05.970> or<00:00:06.150> those<00:00:06.359> there's

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
to turn the lights on or those there's

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.089 
to turn the lights on or those there's
no<00:00:06.990> way<00:00:07.109> you'll<00:00:07.290> be<00:00:07.319> able<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.529> see<00:00:07.740> how<00:00:07.799> far<00:00:08.040> I

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
no way you'll be able to see how far I

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.629 
no way you'll be able to see how far I
can<00:00:08.220> get<00:00:08.490> from<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.730> coil<00:00:09.000> with<00:00:09.210> up<00:00:10.639> without

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
can get from the coil with up without

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.879 
can get from the coil with up without
the<00:00:11.790> lights<00:00:11.969> on<00:00:12.380> otherwise<00:00:13.380> here<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.710> have<00:00:13.860> my

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
the lights on otherwise here I have my

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.060 
the lights on otherwise here I have my
white<00:00:14.160> magic<00:00:14.639> wand<00:00:15.170> my<00:00:16.170> basically<00:00:16.770> resistor

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
white magic wand my basically resistor

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.880 
white magic wand my basically resistor
led<00:00:20.070> bridge<00:00:20.369> with<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.270> resistor<00:00:21.650> right<00:00:22.650> there

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
led bridge with a resistor right there

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.910 
led bridge with a resistor right there
and<00:00:23.160> as<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.730> can<00:00:23.880> see<00:00:24.109> what<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.140> have<00:00:25.410> in<00:00:25.439> next

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
and as you can see what I have in next

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.650 
and as you can see what I have in next
to<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.130> proximity<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.000> coil<00:00:27.210> no<00:00:27.480> matter

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
to the proximity of the coil no matter

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.740 
to the proximity of the coil no matter
where<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:27.869> am<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.349> glow<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.400> further<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.539> get

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
where I am it glow and the further I get

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.620 
where I am it glow and the further I get
away<00:00:31.019> from<00:00:31.080> these<00:00:31.380> things<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.360> dimmer<00:00:33.360> they

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
away from these things the dimmer they

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.319 
away from these things the dimmer they
get<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.200> they<00:00:34.260> turn<00:00:34.680> off<00:00:34.800> one<00:00:35.070> by<00:00:35.219> one<00:00:35.300> so<00:00:36.300> I

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
get and they turn off one by one so I

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.510 
get and they turn off one by one so I
can<00:00:36.600> use<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:38.030> judge<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.450> see<00:00:39.690> how<00:00:39.870> far

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.560 

it'll<00:00:44.520> light<00:00:44.789> things<00:00:45.059> up<00:00:45.530> now<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:47.360> get<00:00:48.360> better

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
it'll light things up now I get better

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.569 
it'll light things up now I get better
results<00:00:48.750> obviously<00:00:49.530> with<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.680> background

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
results obviously with the background

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.010 
results obviously with the background
light<00:00:51.030> off<00:00:51.980> but<00:00:52.980> as<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:53.430> see<00:00:53.640> I'm<00:00:53.789> already

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
light off but as you can see I'm already

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.350 
light off but as you can see I'm already
pretty<00:00:55.020> pretty<00:00:55.800> decent<00:00:56.280> distance<00:00:56.579> away<00:00:56.940> from

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
pretty pretty decent distance away from

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.250 
pretty pretty decent distance away from
the<00:00:58.079> coil<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:59.449> i'm<00:01:00.449> still<00:01:00.719> getting<00:01:00.809> good

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
the coil and i'm still getting good

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.450 
the coil and i'm still getting good
indications<00:01:01.920> let's<00:01:02.210> step<00:01:03.210> back<00:01:03.239> about<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.750> foot

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
indications let's step back about a foot

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.030 
indications let's step back about a foot
maybe<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.640> couple<00:01:05.970> feet<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.380> can<00:01:07.560> still<00:01:07.799> see

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
maybe a couple feet as you can still see

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.000 
maybe a couple feet as you can still see
the<00:01:08.070> LED<00:01:08.310> still<00:01:08.850> indicating<00:01:09.650> if<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.770> look<00:01:10.920> at

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
the LED still indicating if you look at

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.469 
the LED still indicating if you look at
the<00:01:11.040> chair<00:01:11.430> let's<00:01:11.729> have<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.090> point<00:01:12.390> of

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
the chair let's have a point of

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.230 
the chair let's have a point of
reference<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:13.229> there's<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.549> coil<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
reference and there's a coil in the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.980 
reference and there's a coil in the
center<00:01:15.630> I'm<00:01:16.380> still<00:01:16.799> getting<00:01:16.950> indication<00:01:17.990> of

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
center I'm still getting indication of

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.440 
center I'm still getting indication of
my<00:01:19.229> magical<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.920> here<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.729> let's<00:01:20.970> see<00:01:21.150> if<00:01:21.240> i<00:01:21.299> get

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
my magical on here so let's see if i get

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.960 
my magical on here so let's see if i get
step<00:01:21.720> back<00:01:21.930> another<00:01:22.200> couple<00:01:22.619> inches<00:01:22.880> for<00:01:23.880> it

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
step back another couple inches for it

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.420 
step back another couple inches for it
fades<00:01:24.180> out<00:01:24.470> you<00:01:25.470> can<00:01:25.590> see<00:01:25.799> i'm<00:01:25.920> still<00:01:25.979> getting

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
fades out you can see i'm still getting

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.480 
fades out you can see i'm still getting
a<00:01:26.670> little<00:01:26.970> glimmer<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.750> light<00:01:28.220> from<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.430> I

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
a little glimmer of light from that I

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.350 
a little glimmer of light from that I
lady<00:01:30.229> not<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.470> one<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.850> usually<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
lady not this one this is usually the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.060 
lady not this one this is usually the
first<00:01:33.600> one<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.869> turns<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.380> its<00:01:34.530> still<00:01:34.740> barely

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
first one that turns on its still barely

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.330 
first one that turns on its still barely
glowing<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.880> got<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> closer<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.799> camera<00:01:38.310> you

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
glowing I got a closer the camera you

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.990 
glowing I got a closer the camera you
can<00:01:38.490> see<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:38.909> still<00:01:39.119> going<00:01:39.590> but<00:01:40.790> right<00:01:41.790> about

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
can see it's still going but right about

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.850 
can see it's still going but right about
here<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:43.159> where<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.189> start<00:01:44.520> seeing<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.149> glow<00:01:45.860> from

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
here is where I start seeing a glow from

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.920 
here is where I start seeing a glow from
there<00:01:47.100> they're<00:01:47.340> too<00:01:47.579> good<00:01:47.729> 60<00:01:48.329> inches<00:01:48.750> I

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
there they're too good 60 inches I

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.850 
there they're too good 60 inches I
measured<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.380> before<00:01:49.799> from<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.850> point<00:01:51.149> to

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
measured it before from this point to

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.480 
measured it before from this point to
there<00:01:52.860> now<00:01:53.850> these<00:01:54.299> plants<00:01:54.869> here<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.290> wish<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.340> can

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
there now these plants here I wish I can

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.630 
there now these plants here I wish I can
do<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:56.759> without<00:01:56.939> these<00:01:57.390> plants<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.020> room

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
do this without these plants in the room

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.310 
do this without these plants in the room
because<00:01:59.640> all<00:02:00.060> these<00:02:00.240> plants<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:01.020> plan<00:02:01.290> is

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
because all these plants this plan is

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.160 
because all these plants this plan is
actually<00:02:02.329> loading<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.479> electromagnetic

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
actually loading the electromagnetic

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.920 
actually loading the electromagnetic
field<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.770> noticed<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.509> when<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.780> was

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
field I noticed that when it was

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.540 
field I noticed that when it was
actually<00:02:07.290> significantly<00:02:07.530> closer<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.459> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
actually significantly closer to the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.750 
actually significantly closer to the
plant<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:09.060> would<00:02:09.959> move<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:11.220> branches<00:02:11.700> back

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
plant I would move the branches back

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.270 
plant I would move the branches back
and<00:02:12.849> then<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.420> bulbs<00:02:13.750> would<00:02:13.930> get<00:02:14.110> brighter<00:02:14.650> so

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
and then the bulbs would get brighter so

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.880 
and then the bulbs would get brighter so
they're<00:02:15.939> obviously<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.810> don't<00:02:17.470> know<00:02:17.620> if<00:02:17.680> it's<00:02:17.799> a

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
they're obviously I don't know if it's a

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.949 
they're obviously I don't know if it's a
grounding<00:02:18.459> or<00:02:18.640> what<00:02:18.879> our<00:02:19.000> grounding<00:02:19.629> effect

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
grounding or what our grounding effect

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.539 
grounding or what our grounding effect
or<00:02:20.140> something<00:02:20.560> but<00:02:20.769> these<00:02:21.040> plants<00:02:21.459> are

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
or something but these plants are

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.270 
or something but these plants are
actually<00:02:22.680> decreasing<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.769> range<00:02:23.980> of<00:02:24.159> the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
actually decreasing the range of the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.330 
actually decreasing the range of the
coil<00:02:24.519> so<00:02:24.790> if<00:02:24.849> there<00:02:25.150> was<00:02:25.269> nothing<00:02:25.599> organic

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
coil so if there was nothing organic

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.720 
coil so if there was nothing organic
leading<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.489> ground<00:02:27.790> um<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:29.110> probably<00:02:30.099> got<00:02:30.489> a

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
leading the ground um I probably got a

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.390 
leading the ground um I probably got a
few<00:02:31.030> more<00:02:31.150> inches<00:02:31.590> from<00:02:32.590> this<00:02:32.799> magic<00:02:33.159> wand

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
few more inches from this magic wand

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.930 
few more inches from this magic wand
here<00:02:33.730> so<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.180> can<00:02:34.299> see<00:02:34.480> now<00:02:34.659> lit<00:02:35.079> I<00:02:35.670> get<00:02:36.670> closer

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
here so you can see now lit I get closer

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.990 
here so you can see now lit I get closer
it's<00:02:37.239> just<00:02:37.360> going<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.540> get<00:02:37.629> brighter<00:02:37.989> and<00:02:39.000> you

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
it's just going to get brighter and you

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.770 
it's just going to get brighter and you
can<00:02:40.150> see<00:02:40.709> visible<00:02:41.709> this<00:02:41.920> way<00:02:42.099> and<00:02:42.970> I'm<00:02:43.510> still<00:02:43.750> a

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
can see visible this way and I'm still a

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.490 
can see visible this way and I'm still a
decent<00:02:44.049> ways<00:02:44.409> away<00:02:44.739> at<00:02:45.159> least<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.670> yard<00:02:46.500> from

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
decent ways away at least a yard from

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.710 
decent ways away at least a yard from
the<00:02:47.530> tip<00:02:47.859> of<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.040> coil<00:02:48.329> and<00:02:49.329> then<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:49.540> can<00:02:49.690> just

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
the tip of the coil and then I can just

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.390 
the tip of the coil and then I can just
keep<00:02:49.959> getting<00:02:50.260> closer<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.739> they<00:02:51.069> all<00:02:51.190> just

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
keep getting closer and they all just

00:02:51.400 --> 00:03:05.160 
keep getting closer and they all just
light<00:02:51.639> up<00:02:51.670> slowly<00:03:02.609> range<00:03:03.609> test<00:03:04.060> don't<00:03:04.989> forget

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
light up slowly range test don't forget

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.960 
light up slowly range test don't forget
