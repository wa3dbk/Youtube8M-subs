 and along the entire length of the intestines live 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.950
 human friendly bacteria average

 starter in the first place we always 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.620
 advise you to pay attention to 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.630

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.209
 leaven bacteria is the most important thing 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.760
 very important to learn to read the composition 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.140
 bacteria that is written on the packaging and 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.890
 what benefits can they bring 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.260
 to the body 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.850
 still when choosing starters and other 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.040
 probiotics should pay it 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.750
 attention to the conditions of their storage because 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.489
 live bacteria must 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.590

 stir well, and here is this temperature 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:51.330
 it is desirable to save therefore I cover 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.490
