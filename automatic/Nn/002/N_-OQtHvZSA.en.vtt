00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
to see if you can feel the difference of

relaxing in the inside leg and opening
the<00:00:20.520> hip<00:00:21.560> it's<00:00:22.560> diving<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.760> can<00:00:23.939> talk<00:00:24.090> about

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
the hip it's diving you can talk about

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.390 
the hip it's diving you can talk about
the<00:00:24.510> energy<00:00:24.660> guiding<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.590> energy<00:00:26.039> or<00:00:26.220> the

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
the energy guiding the energy or the

breath through the inside hip opening it

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.959 
breath through the inside hip opening it
was<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:34.770> nice<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:37.070> just<00:00:38.070> go<00:00:38.250> back<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.579> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
was so nice and you just go back to the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.750 
was so nice and you just go back to the
full<00:00:39.239> halt<00:00:39.540> or<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.260> stop<00:00:41.010> there<00:00:41.280> because<00:00:41.460> he

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
full halt or you stop there because he

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.610 
full halt or you stop there because he
has<00:00:41.940> been<00:00:42.149> good<00:00:42.450> now<00:00:42.690> for<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> while<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.500> if

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
has been good now for a while and if

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.440 
has been good now for a while and if
it's<00:00:43.829> maybe<00:00:44.250> too<00:00:44.399> much<00:00:44.640> for<00:00:44.910> him<00:00:45.030> we<00:00:45.210> stop

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
it's maybe too much for him we stop

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.430 
it's maybe too much for him we stop
rather<00:00:45.809> than<00:00:46.170> getting<00:00:46.649> into<00:00:46.890> trouble<00:00:51.410> was<00:00:52.410> he

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
rather than getting into trouble was he

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.439 
rather than getting into trouble was he
misunderstood<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.309> could<00:00:53.520> also<00:00:53.730> be<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.270> know

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
misunderstood it could also be you know

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.709 
misunderstood it could also be you know
when<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:54.809> are<00:00:54.840> playing<00:00:55.829> with<00:00:56.190> energy<00:00:56.570> that<00:00:57.570> you

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
when we are playing with energy that you

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.110 
when we are playing with energy that you
open<00:00:58.230> things<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.890> course<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.550> may<00:00:59.730> be<00:00:59.789> feel

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
open things of course it may be feel

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.820 
open things of course it may be feel
that<00:01:00.359> all<00:01:00.510> right<00:01:04.549> yeah<00:01:06.470> exactly

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
that all right yeah exactly

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.539 
that all right yeah exactly
that<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.670> good<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.720> know<00:01:09.890> this<00:01:10.890> feeling<00:01:11.250> of

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
that is good you know this feeling of

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.600 
that is good you know this feeling of
what<00:01:11.790> was<00:01:11.939> an<00:01:12.060> opening<00:01:12.479> up<00:01:12.659> means<00:01:13.280> shall<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.430> go

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
what was an opening up means shall we go

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.219 
what was an opening up means shall we go
to<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.060> right<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.659> see<00:01:15.869> if<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.799> same

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
to the right and see if it's the same

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:25.910 
to the right and see if it's the same
idea<00:01:22.580> then<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.700> depends<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.630> look<00:01:25.409> at<00:01:25.530> me<00:01:25.710> if

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
idea then it depends on look at me if

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.050 
idea then it depends on look at me if
you<00:01:26.070> take<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.430> opening<00:01:26.850> up<00:01:27.799> forward<00:01:28.799> or<00:01:29.159> if

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
you take the opening up forward or if

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.360 
you take the opening up forward or if
you<00:01:30.360> take<00:01:30.930> opening<00:01:31.619> up<00:01:31.770> backward

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.820 

and<00:01:36.370> you<00:01:37.000> can<00:01:37.360> experiment<00:01:38.140> because<00:01:38.440> he<00:01:38.650> is

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
and you can experiment because he is

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.210 
and you can experiment because he is
also<00:01:39.070> a<00:01:39.220> sensitive<00:01:39.460> horse<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:41.320> therefore<00:01:41.950> you

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
also a sensitive horse so therefore you

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.790 
also a sensitive horse so therefore you
can<00:01:42.430> open<00:01:42.790> up<00:01:43.030> and<00:01:43.390> maybe<00:01:43.720> go<00:01:44.050> backwards<00:01:44.590> but

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
can open up and maybe go backwards but

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.090 
can open up and maybe go backwards but
just<00:01:45.360> opening<00:01:46.360> like<00:01:46.660> you<00:01:46.810> kind<00:01:47.050> of<00:01:47.170> opening

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
just opening like you kind of opening

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.730 
just opening like you kind of opening
the<00:01:48.250> door<00:01:48.280> but<00:01:49.000> you<00:01:49.030> don't<00:01:49.420> go<00:01:49.659> out<00:01:49.900> of<00:01:49.930> it<00:01:50.350> then

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
the door but you don't go out of it then

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.010 
the door but you don't go out of it then
I<00:01:50.950> get<00:01:51.160> it's<00:01:51.310> more<00:01:51.340> collection<00:01:52.300> yes

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
I get it's more collection yes

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.080 
I get it's more collection yes
see<00:01:53.800> if<00:01:53.860> you<00:01:53.979> can<00:01:54.130> do<00:01:54.250> that<00:01:54.400> on<00:01:54.580> the<00:01:54.670> left<00:01:54.880> as

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
see if you can do that on the left as

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.350 
see if you can do that on the left as
well<00:01:55.330> just<00:01:55.660> to<00:01:55.869> see<00:01:56.110> if<00:01:56.320> it<00:01:56.470> was<00:01:57.000> very<00:01:58.000> hard

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
well just to see if it was very hard

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.940 
well just to see if it was very hard
with<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:58.660> hind<00:01:58.869> leg<00:01:59.020> or<00:01:59.259> if<00:01:59.530> you<00:01:59.800> were

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
with the hind leg or if you were

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.320 
with the hind leg or if you were
misunderstanding<00:02:00.880> each<00:02:01.000> other<00:02:02.910> but<00:02:03.910> there<00:02:04.150> is

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
misunderstanding each other but there is

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.090 
misunderstanding each other but there is
not<00:02:04.509> running<00:02:04.990> away<00:02:05.110> when<00:02:05.440> you<00:02:05.560> opening<00:02:06.040> the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
not running away when you opening the

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:30.509 
not running away when you opening the
hip

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.149 

but<00:02:31.519> it<00:02:31.640> could<00:02:31.909> be<00:02:32.180> this<00:02:32.530> this<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.590> little<00:02:33.920> bit

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:34.159 
but it could be this this a little bit

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.740 
but it could be this this a little bit
magar<00:02:34.549> also<00:02:35.120> she<00:02:35.510> has<00:02:35.689> a<00:02:37.090> muscle<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.510> muscle

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
magar also she has a muscle and muscle

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:47.069 
magar also she has a muscle and muscle
who<00:02:39.290> could<00:02:39.590> be<00:02:40.209> forced<00:02:41.209> into<00:02:41.810> more<00:02:42.579> towing<00:02:45.909> and

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
who could be forced into more towing and

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:52.839 
who could be forced into more towing and
that<00:02:48.079> she<00:02:48.290> knows<00:02:48.470> herself<00:02:48.829> as<00:02:49.310> well<00:02:51.609> yes<00:02:52.609> so

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
that she knows herself as well yes so

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.240 
that she knows herself as well yes so
you<00:02:52.970> open<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.720> door<00:02:54.049> in<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.439> hip<00:02:54.590> but<00:02:54.980> you

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
you open the door in the hip but you

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.949 
you open the door in the hip but you
don't<00:02:55.819> go<00:02:56.060> out<00:02:56.389> of<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:57.019> door

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
don't go out of the door

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.470 
don't go out of the door
exactly<00:03:00.109> much<00:03:00.290> better<00:03:00.620> so<00:03:01.280> he<00:03:01.430> is<00:03:01.609> sensitive<00:03:02.150> I

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
exactly much better so he is sensitive I

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.949 
exactly much better so he is sensitive I
mean<00:03:02.720> if<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:03.139> fly<00:03:03.439> out<00:03:03.470> of<00:03:04.040> that<00:03:04.250> door<00:03:04.629> he<00:03:05.629> will

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
mean if you fly out of that door he will

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:32.460 
mean if you fly out of that door he will
follow<00:03:09.340> doesn't<00:03:10.340> matter

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:39.730 

what

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.870 

when<00:03:40.740> he<00:03:40.980> gets<00:03:41.220> support<00:03:42.180> from<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:43.290> wall<00:03:43.880> maybe

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
when he gets support from the wall maybe

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.270 
when he gets support from the wall maybe
you<00:03:45.570> should<00:03:46.430> take<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.490> little<00:03:47.760> bit<00:03:48.080> watering

also<00:04:36.600> that<00:04:36.990> that<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:38.580> horse<00:04:38.790> need<00:04:39.120> both<00:04:39.480> hind

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
also that that the horse need both hind

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.540 
also that that the horse need both hind
leg<00:04:40.350> to<00:04:40.710> be<00:04:40.830> able<00:04:40.980> even<00:04:41.550> to<00:04:41.790> be<00:04:42.600> in<00:04:43.310> one<00:04:44.310> more

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
leg to be able even to be in one more

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:53.360 
leg to be able even to be in one more
another<00:04:44.880> shape<00:04:50.690> and<00:04:51.690> I<00:04:52.620> think<00:04:52.920> you<00:04:53.100> should

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
another shape and I think you should

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.230 
another shape and I think you should
find<00:04:54.240> some<00:04:55.230> time<00:04:55.530> where<00:04:56.010> you<00:04:56.130> can<00:04:56.370> stop<00:04:56.790> so<00:04:57.090> you

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
find some time where you can stop so you

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.710 
find some time where you can stop so you
don't<00:04:57.510> continue<00:04:58.020> too<00:04:58.470> long<00:04:58.770> and<00:04:59.570> when<00:05:00.570> you

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
don't continue too long and when you

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.200 
don't continue too long and when you
feel<00:05:00.960> satisfied<00:05:01.620> that<00:05:01.980> you<00:05:02.280> have<00:05:02.310> figured

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
feel satisfied that you have figured

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.590 
feel satisfied that you have figured
something<00:05:03.540> out<00:05:04.020> that<00:05:04.760> you<00:05:05.760> felt<00:05:06.300> that<00:05:06.450> you

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
something out that you felt that you

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.150 
something out that you felt that you
were<00:05:06.750> connected<00:05:07.530> you<00:05:08.250> can<00:05:08.580> stop
