russet color which is going to be a nice
dark<00:01:08.229> going<00:01:09.229> to<00:01:09.530> make<00:01:09.860> sure<00:01:10.070> I<00:01:10.270> spritz<00:01:11.270> the

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
dark going to make sure I spritz the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.840 
dark going to make sure I spritz the
paints<00:01:12.290> a<00:01:12.530> little<00:01:12.800> bit<00:01:12.950> to<00:01:13.190> keep<00:01:13.369> them<00:01:13.640> moist

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
paints a little bit to keep them moist

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.550 
paints a little bit to keep them moist
so<00:01:14.180> they're<00:01:14.390> getting<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:14.750> moisture<00:01:15.320> from<00:01:15.470> the

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
so they're getting the moisture from the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:26.680 
so they're getting the moisture from the
bottom<00:01:16.009> and<00:01:16.310> from<00:01:16.910> the<00:01:17.090> top<00:01:25.509> so<00:01:26.509> we're<00:01:26.660> just

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
bottom and from the top so we're just

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.950 
bottom and from the top so we're just
going<00:01:27.229> to<00:01:27.350> establish<00:01:28.310> our<00:01:28.610> darkest<00:01:29.270> value

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
going to establish our darkest value

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.330 
going to establish our darkest value
pattern<00:01:30.440> with<00:01:31.340> this<00:01:31.580> under<00:01:32.060> painting<00:01:33.340> get

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
pattern with this under painting get

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:49.330 
pattern with this under painting get
that<00:01:34.550> Bank<00:01:35.050> established

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.950 

so<00:01:49.850> we're<00:01:50.030> still<00:01:50.360> not<00:01:52.420> we're<00:01:53.420> still<00:01:53.450> not

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
so we're still not we're still not

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.399 
so we're still not we're still not
really<00:01:54.530> tightening<00:01:55.159> up<00:01:55.369> on<00:01:55.579> this<00:01:56.110> we're<00:01:57.110> still

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
really tightening up on this we're still

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:05.649 
really tightening up on this we're still
trying<00:01:57.710> to<00:01:57.770> keep<00:01:57.979> it<00:01:58.189> loose<00:02:03.759> and<00:02:04.759> you'll

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
trying to keep it loose and you'll

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.830 
trying to keep it loose and you'll
notice<00:02:05.929> that<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:07.280> combination<00:02:08.090> of<00:02:08.360> orange

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
notice that the combination of orange

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.650 
notice that the combination of orange
and<00:02:09.110> purple<00:02:10.360> provide<00:02:11.360> a<00:02:11.390> little<00:02:11.900> bit<00:02:12.080> of<00:02:12.230> color

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
and purple provide a little bit of color

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.410 
and purple provide a little bit of color
variety<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:18.410> some<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.519> that<00:02:19.670> is<00:02:19.970> going<00:02:20.150> to

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
variety and some of that is going to

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:36.630 
variety and some of that is going to
show<00:02:20.810> through<00:02:21.290> in<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:22.730> finished<00:02:23.090> painting

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.980 

the<00:02:37.640> most<00:02:37.880> important<00:02:38.570> midtone<00:02:40.450> or<00:02:41.450> one<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:41.900> the

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
the most important midtone or one of the

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.060 
the most important midtone or one of the
most<00:02:42.140> important<00:02:42.740> mid-tones<00:02:43.250> is<00:02:43.670> this<00:02:45.070> water

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
most important mid-tones is this water

mentioned earlier so I'm doing
brushstrokes<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:10.319> follow<00:03:10.829> the<00:03:11.129> gesture<00:03:11.670> of

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
brushstrokes that follow the gesture of

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.369

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
the creek and every once in a while I'll

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:21.800 
the creek and every once in a while I'll
flip<00:03:16.769> row<00:03:17.190> in<00:03:18.349> some<00:03:19.349> vertical<00:03:20.659> movement<00:03:21.659> as

now I put it in now once again I'm
really<00:03:51.620> squinting<00:03:52.430> a<00:03:52.519> lot<00:03:52.730> so<00:03:53.510> that<00:03:53.659> I<00:03:53.689> see<00:03:54.139> the

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:54.439 
really squinting a lot so that I see the

00:03:54.439 --> 00:04:00.369 
really squinting a lot so that I see the
value<00:03:55.250> patterns<00:03:56.530> now<00:03:57.530> this<00:03:57.739> paint<00:03:58.219> this<00:03:59.379> snow

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
value patterns now this paint this snow

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.649 
value patterns now this paint this snow
in<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:00.799> background<00:04:01.400> we<00:04:02.239> might<00:04:02.420> have<00:04:02.629> a

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
in the background we might have a

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:07.059 
in the background we might have a
tendency<00:04:03.290> to<00:04:03.319> paint<00:04:03.680> that<00:04:03.920> white<00:04:05.409> but<00:04:06.409> I<00:04:06.439> mixed

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
tendency to paint that white but I mixed

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.899 
tendency to paint that white but I mixed
up<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.280> white<00:04:07.730> with<00:04:08.030> a<00:04:08.060> little<00:04:08.209> bit<00:04:08.599> of<00:04:08.720> blue

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:09.909 
up the white with a little bit of blue

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.490 
up the white with a little bit of blue
because<00:04:10.909> we<00:04:10.939> don't<00:04:11.269> really<00:04:11.540> want<00:04:11.720> it<00:04:12.019> jumping

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
a little more medium tone in here it's a

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.469 
a little more medium tone in here it's a
good<00:04:51.260> idea<00:04:52.479> this<00:04:53.479> might<00:04:53.750> be<00:04:53.930> a<00:04:53.960> good<00:04:54.229> time<00:04:54.530> to

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
good idea this might be a good time to

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.960 
good idea this might be a good time to
just<00:04:56.479> mention<00:04:57.169> the<00:04:57.320> colorist<00:04:57.860> value<00:04:58.430> idea

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
just mention the colorist value idea

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.300 
just mention the colorist value idea
once<00:04:59.479> more<00:04:59.840> because<00:05:00.620> if<00:05:00.770> you<00:05:00.860> look<00:05:01.039> at<00:05:01.159> the

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
once more because if you look at the

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.999 
once more because if you look at the
picture<00:05:01.849> the<00:05:02.810> photograph<00:05:03.349> that<00:05:03.380> I'm<00:05:03.650> working

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
from it really doesn't have this bright

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:15.760 
from it really doesn't have this bright
purple<00:05:12.250> kind<00:05:13.250> of<00:05:13.370> reddish<00:05:13.639> purple<00:05:14.590> so<00:05:15.590> I'm

pattern<00:05:32.789> in

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:46.879 

right<00:05:42.849> now<00:05:43.889> this<00:05:44.889> side<00:05:45.159> of<00:05:45.340> the<00:05:45.430> painting

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
right now this side of the painting

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.559 
right now this side of the painting
doesn't<00:05:47.889> quite<00:05:48.280> look<00:05:48.580> like<00:05:48.639> it's<00:05:49.030> painted<00:05:49.330> in

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:49.569 
doesn't quite look like it's painted in

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:55.559 
doesn't quite look like it's painted in
the<00:05:49.689> same<00:05:49.930> manner<00:05:50.229> as<00:05:50.710> the<00:05:53.189> upper-left<00:05:54.569> 2/3

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:55.569 
the same manner as the upper-left 2/3

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:58.619 
the same manner as the upper-left 2/3
let's<00:05:55.960> say<00:05:56.199> of<00:05:56.349> the<00:05:56.439> painting<00:05:57.090> so<00:05:58.090> I'm<00:05:58.449> going

00:05:58.619 --> 00:05:58.629 
let's say of the painting so I'm going

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:02.640 
let's say of the painting so I'm going
to<00:05:58.689> make<00:05:58.870> sure<00:05:58.900> to<00:05:59.379> take<00:06:00.449> use<00:06:01.449> the<00:06:01.689> same<00:06:02.020> wide

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
to make sure to take use the same wide

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.330 
to make sure to take use the same wide
bristle<00:06:03.550> brush<00:06:04.349> to<00:06:05.349> get<00:06:05.530> some<00:06:05.770> of<00:06:05.889> that<00:06:05.979> same

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
bristle brush to get some of that same

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:25.040 
bristle brush to get some of that same
texture<00:06:14.279> so<00:06:15.279> we<00:06:15.370> balance<00:06:15.849> that<00:06:16.090> texture<00:06:16.599> out

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.200 

a<00:06:25.139> small<00:06:26.039> brush<00:06:26.370> is<00:06:26.610> definitely<00:06:27.030> going<00:06:27.180> to

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
a small brush is definitely going to

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.080 
a small brush is definitely going to
give<00:06:27.389> you<00:06:27.509> a<00:06:27.569> different<00:06:27.750> texture<00:06:28.819> and<00:06:29.819> a<00:06:29.909> big

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
give you a different texture and a big

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:57.130 
give you a different texture and a big
brush

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.140 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.140 

and<00:06:58.140> by<00:06:58.260> the<00:06:58.320> same<00:06:58.650> token<00:06:58.950> I<00:06:59.370> feel<00:06:59.610> like<00:06:59.760> I<00:06:59.940> need

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.150 
and by the same token I feel like I need

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.370 
and by the same token I feel like I need
a<00:07:00.180> little<00:07:00.480> more<00:07:00.720> of<00:07:00.840> that<00:07:01.020> broad<00:07:01.710> texture<00:07:03.380> and

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:04.380 
a little more of that broad texture and

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.730 
a little more of that broad texture and
here<00:07:04.620> not<00:07:04.860> necessarily<00:07:05.250> to<00:07:05.820> cover<00:07:06.180> it<00:07:06.360> up<00:07:06.740> but

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:07.740 
here not necessarily to cover it up but

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.170 
here not necessarily to cover it up but
to<00:07:07.770> add<00:07:08.010> to<00:07:08.370> it

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:11.180 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.600 

of<00:07:12.180> course<00:07:12.480> I'm<00:07:12.660> keeping<00:07:13.080> in<00:07:13.200> mind<00:07:13.610> the

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.610 
of course I'm keeping in mind the

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.700 
of course I'm keeping in mind the
finishing<00:07:15.300> touches<00:07:15.570> that<00:07:15.810> I<00:07:16.020> want<00:07:16.260> to<00:07:16.350> put<00:07:16.560> in

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:16.710 
finishing touches that I want to put in

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:28.930 
finishing touches that I want to put in
later<00:07:26.000> and<00:07:27.000> the<00:07:27.210> same<00:07:27.420> color<00:07:27.890> get<00:07:28.890> that

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:28.940 
later and the same color get that

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.910 
later and the same color get that
distributed<00:07:29.940> in<00:07:30.120> a<00:07:30.150> way<00:07:30.710> that<00:07:31.710> balances

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:33.920 
distributed in a way that balances

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:50.360 
distributed in a way that balances
painting<00:07:34.920> out

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:50.370 

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.430
