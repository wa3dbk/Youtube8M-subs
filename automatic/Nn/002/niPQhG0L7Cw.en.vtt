00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.139
 do I have to buy a ps4 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.000
 when we have a pc the question arises 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.430
 with all the more acuteness since the 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.990
 today's release of blackburn on ps4 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.970
 so I propose this time to 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.369
 get out of the console war you 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.769
 we are interested in the Cornelian choice 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.529
 present themselves to the fabulous members of the 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:25.089
 glorious pc gaming master rais 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.739
 know the question of the choice between pc and 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.569
 xbox one does not really arise in 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.640
 effect almost all exclusives 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.689
 from the microsoft console will come out 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.820
 also on pc 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.590
 on the nintendo side the question is without 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.390
 doubt easier to decide if you 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.039
 like nintendo games you do not have 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.960
 the choice are almost all 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.730
 exclusives and machinery of the 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.500
 Japanese brand background in this case 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.359
 inescapable now let's move on to 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.800
 more subtle case of ps4 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:49.750
 in view of the sales figures it is 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.280
 obvious that many pc players have 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.870
 also cracked for this console 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.730
 yet in the community of those who 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.800
 express themselves most on the internet and who 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.550
 are not necessarily 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.379
 representative of the mass of players 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.870
 we often find the expression of a 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.059
 disdain displayed for this console which I 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.580
 quote would have no play and would not serve 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.040
 so nothing nakk in famous second sound 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.960
 res club or killzone does not justify 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.610
 probably not buying a ps 4 but 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.030
 What about games like The Last of 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.820
 the hunt john hull blackburn wild brahim 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.260
 or still uncharted 4 certainly difficult 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.790
 to decide when talking about games that do not 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.050
 are not out yet like what they 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.150
 have huge potential 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.220
 however the incredible series of notes 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.980
 has collected blood terminals is 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.690
 between 9 and 10 out of 10 inches the fans of 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.790
 the series of games south of com software 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.720
 to be interested in ps4 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.980
 it is even more true that 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.930
 the exclusivity does indeed seem 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.730
 permanent which we believe the returns 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.100
 of sony in the end all the questions of 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.720
 usual budget and remove in my opinion 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.120
 pc and consoles are very complementary 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.850
 in terms of budget the only benefit 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.130
 real pc is located in my eyes in 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.260
 the price of the games because the myth of the pc is 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.720
 easy and inexpensive to upgrade 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.450
 seems unconvincing to me given the 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.310
 price of high-end components 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.689
 it remains difficult to do without 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.969
 totally from a pc bypassed by 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.070
 example rpg fans but what a pleasure 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.200
 yet to find some comfort 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.640
 of play that I still find 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.200
 more pronounced on consoles 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.750
 indeed even if the consoles become 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.099
 pc disguise the simplicity remains 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.620
 more in the heart of the experience 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.480
 proposed in the case of the ps4 the 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.040
 dualshock 4 joystick is so good 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.739
 thought it offers a real 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.360
 comparative advantage maybe that the 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.310
 stigmas china will put everyone 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.769
 okay next fall but from here 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.959
 there I go back to die in a loop on 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.110
 blood terminals in joy and good 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.110
 mood
