00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.090
 this web school and this is where he works 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.990
 In our factory where we build 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.990
 humanoid robots 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.770
 robots that look and behave 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.770
 like people 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.290
 and the robots are really almost like 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:35.129
 children the shipments to the world and so they learn 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.129
 to do your job 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:40.859
 these robots are designed for the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.539
 communication and entertainment for 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:44.989
 talk to people and behave like 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.989
 the people 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.879
 Y 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.000
 dynamic robots must jump and 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.800
 move like the people and we want that 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.410
 our robots behave like the 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.420
 people if a robot can follow you if 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.040
 can approach you and press your 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.409
 nose against yours will be a 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.960
 very powerful experience 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.789
 and that is what we are interested in exploring and 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.210
 why we want our robots 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:15.210
 walk 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.960
 what interests us to discover what they are 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.900
 the minimum elements that you must create 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.180
 so that the robot is human 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.670
 and we have seen that there are three of us 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.980
 called turning axes 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.050
 rolling and pitching 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.770
 these are the movements that you need 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.390
 in the head to express your expression 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.700
 we develop a projection system 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.140
 internal that is basically projecting a 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.970
 image in the country side 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.530
 well we are lucky that it has gone up 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.870
 a new technology that has made 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.140
 possible to produce this with a budget 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.140
 reasonable 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.460
 so we're trying to create a 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.619
 emotive and captivating robot that is capable 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.820
 to have eye contact with you that 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:04.340
 look when you spend more ugly cool 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.930
 who is involved with you we believe that 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.940
 it can be an application for the lobby 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.959
 of an airport for example where you 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:15.500
 you pass the robot looks at you they greet you 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.330
 ask where are you going or are you lost 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.400
 that part is about discovering the 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.980
 nature of humanity that is to be 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.610
 human being is to be alive because we 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.410
 we behave in certain ways 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.330
 I believe that what defines us as beings 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.330
 human is the way we move 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:41.840
