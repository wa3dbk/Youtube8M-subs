00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
dogs how you guys really want to see

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.320

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
dogs in GTA online it might be a little

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.470 
dogs in GTA online it might be a little
hard<00:02:24.659> for<00:02:25.280> Rockstar<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.489> implement<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.209> into

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
hard for Rockstar to implement it into

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.410 
hard for Rockstar to implement it into
our<00:02:28.080> homes<00:02:28.349> and<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:29.790> just<00:02:30.090> feel<00:02:30.209> like<00:02:30.269> it<00:02:30.390> might

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
our homes and I just feel like it might

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.229 
our homes and I just feel like it might
get<00:02:30.720> messed<00:02:30.930> up<00:02:31.080> now<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.670> can<00:02:32.670> probably<00:02:32.940> see

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
get messed up now I can probably see

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.030 
get messed up now I can probably see
them<00:02:33.390> implementing<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.049> dogs<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.620> then<00:02:34.830> just

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
them implementing the dogs and then just

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.059 
them implementing the dogs and then just
having<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.489> dogs<00:02:35.700> poop<00:02:36.260> like<00:02:37.260> right<00:02:37.560> there<00:02:37.799> in

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
having the dogs poop like right there in

having the dogs poop like right there in
the<00:02:38.250> house<00:02:38.430> like<00:02:38.730> they<00:02:38.970> would<00:02:39.269> back<00:02:39.870> at

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
the house like they would back at

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.319 
the house like they would back at
Franklin's<00:02:40.530> house<00:02:40.879> when<00:02:41.879> you<00:02:42.000> had<00:02:42.150> the

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
Franklin's house when you had the

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:43.970 
Franklin's house when you had the
apartment<00:02:42.569> that<00:02:42.810> lessor<00:02:43.110> gave<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.440> chop

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
would just go poop right there but I

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.990 
would just go poop right there but I
don't<00:02:46.680> really<00:02:46.950> see<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.280> happening<00:02:47.430> around<00:02:47.910> the

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
manually clean up the poop as like some

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.020 
manually clean up the poop as like some
objectives<00:02:52.950> or<00:02:53.160> things<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.579> do<00:02:53.730> around<00:02:53.849> the
