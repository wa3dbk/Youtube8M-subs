00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
pointed all my barracks is on to my arm

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.880 
pointed all my barracks is on to my arm
so<00:00:26.760> any<00:00:27.029> units<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.170> send<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.650> just<00:00:28.800> going

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
so any units you send in is just going

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.910 
so any units you send in is just going
to<00:00:28.949> go<00:00:29.130> straight<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.550> your<00:00:29.670> army<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.920> it's

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
to go straight to your army and it's

to go straight to your army and it's
kind<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.160> nice<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:33.059> problem<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.420> if<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.660> lose

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
kind of nice the problem is if you lose

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.260 
kind of nice the problem is if you lose
that<00:00:34.140> unit<00:00:34.590> then<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.950> kind<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.550> messes<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:36.059> up<00:00:36.120> a

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
that unit then it kind of messes it up a

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.830 
that unit then it kind of messes it up a
little<00:00:36.420> bit<00:00:36.739> but<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:38.579> probably<00:00:39.300> won't<00:00:39.570> come

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
little bit but that probably won't come

don't<00:01:57.080> know<00:01:57.140> why<00:01:58.060> Richmond<00:01:59.060> either<00:02:00.700> okay<00:02:01.700> so

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
don't know why Richmond either okay so

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.750 
don't know why Richmond either okay so
they're<00:02:02.540> backing<00:02:02.870> off<00:02:03.370> just<00:02:04.370> trying<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:04.610> focus

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
they're backing off just trying to focus

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.510 
they're backing off just trying to focus
out<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.450> week<00:02:05.660> zerglings<00:02:06.260> and<00:02:06.530> then<00:02:07.070> focus

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
out the week zerglings and then focus

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.980 
out the week zerglings and then focus
Byron<00:02:07.970> as<00:02:08.119> you<00:02:08.210> can<00:02:08.360> see<00:02:08.480> in<00:02:08.570> doing<00:02:08.750> that<00:02:08.840> right

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
Byron as you can see in doing that right

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.840 
Byron as you can see in doing that right
now<00:02:09.050> just<00:02:09.440> hopeful<00:02:09.920> aspiring<00:02:10.250> each<00:02:10.700> circling

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
now just hopeful aspiring each circling

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.830 
now just hopeful aspiring each circling
especially<00:02:13.850> with<00:02:13.910> Marauders<00:02:14.390> because<00:02:14.690> they

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
especially with Marauders because they

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.360 
especially with Marauders because they
only<00:02:14.990> have<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.290> single<00:02:15.740> attack<00:02:16.010> if<00:02:16.220> you

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
only have that single attack if you

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.190 
only have that single attack if you
spread<00:02:16.730> it<00:02:16.790> out<00:02:17.000> just<00:02:17.300> to<00:02:17.450> attack<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.960> ground

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
spread it out just to attack the ground

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.140 
spread it out just to attack the ground
you're<00:02:18.500> probably<00:02:18.860> going<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.370> lose<00:02:19.520> more<00:02:19.790> units

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
you're probably going to lose more units

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.210 
you're probably going to lose more units
than<00:02:20.240> if<00:02:20.420> you<00:02:20.540> focus<00:02:20.900> by<00:02:21.080> each<00:02:21.770> serving

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
than if you focus by each serving

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.940 
than if you focus by each serving
individually<00:02:22.790> so<00:02:23.630> I<00:02:23.930> don't<00:02:24.140> quite<00:02:24.740> have

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
individually so I don't quite have

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.230 
individually so I don't quite have
enough<00:02:25.010> units<00:02:25.520> now<00:02:26.710> to<00:02:27.710> attack<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.220> base<00:02:28.430> but

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
enough units now to attack the base but

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.450 
enough units now to attack the base but
once<00:02:29.450> it<00:02:29.570> gets<00:02:29.720> reinforced<00:02:30.260> enough<00:02:30.740> I<00:02:30.980> should

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
once it gets reinforced enough I should

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.710 
once it gets reinforced enough I should
be<00:02:31.580> good<00:02:31.730> so<00:02:32.090> I'm<00:02:32.180> just<00:02:32.360> going<00:02:32.510> to<00:02:32.570> go<00:02:32.630> in

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
you feel like your force isn't big

enough just go as you can see i'm

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.729 
enough just go as you can see i'm
backing<00:02:53.030> out<00:02:53.150> that<00:02:53.330> run<00:02:53.510> you<00:02:53.630> refrain<00:02:54.290> because

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
backing out that run you refrain because

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.520 
backing out that run you refrain because
at<00:02:55.190> this<00:02:55.400> point<00:02:55.520> every<00:02:56.180> unit<00:02:56.450> counts<00:02:56.840> like<00:02:57.380> I

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
at this point every unit counts like I

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.940 
at this point every unit counts like I
don't<00:02:57.590> want<00:02:57.770> to<00:02:57.830> lose<00:02:57.950> any<00:02:58.190> variation<00:02:59.950> but

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
don't want to lose any variation but

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.100 
don't want to lose any variation but
yeah<00:03:01.160> back<00:03:01.370> at<00:03:01.400> base<00:03:01.730> I'm<00:03:02.120> just<00:03:02.480> making<00:03:02.900> sure<00:03:02.930> i

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
yeah back at base I'm just making sure i

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.460 
yeah back at base I'm just making sure i
started<00:03:03.800> knew<00:03:03.920> instantly<00:03:04.160> take<00:03:05.060> out<00:03:05.209> that<00:03:05.420> uh

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
started knew instantly take out that uh

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.160 
started knew instantly take out that uh
mainly<00:03:06.470> missed<00:03:07.660> that<00:03:08.660> were<00:03:08.780> actually<00:03:08.870> got<00:03:09.140> a

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
mainly missed that were actually got a

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.810 
mainly missed that were actually got a
chance<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.620> use<00:03:09.650> being<00:03:10.070> in<00:03:10.280> zone<00:03:10.520> which<00:03:10.790> is

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
chance to use being in zone which is

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.720 
chance to use being in zone which is
good

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.100 

that's<00:03:14.730> probably<00:03:15.180> won't<00:03:15.510> even<00:03:15.630> matter<00:03:15.900> that

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
that's probably won't even matter that

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.830 
that's probably won't even matter that
wouldn't<00:03:16.650> make<00:03:16.860> them<00:03:17.190> at<00:03:17.640> this<00:03:17.790> point<00:03:20.330> um<00:03:21.330> yeah

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
wouldn't make them at this point um yeah

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.710 
wouldn't make them at this point um yeah
this<00:03:22.020> much<00:03:22.470> over<00:03:22.800> because<00:03:23.370> as<00:03:23.910> you<00:03:24.030> can<00:03:24.060> see<00:03:24.210> he

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
this much over because as you can see he

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.570 
this much over because as you can see he
doesn't<00:03:24.900> have<00:03:25.110> any<00:03:25.290> minutes<00:03:25.740> coming<00:03:25.980> it's<00:03:26.310> a

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
doesn't have any minutes coming it's a

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.490 
doesn't have any minutes coming it's a
couple's<00:03:26.970> arrogance<00:03:27.420> it's<00:03:27.660> easy<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:28.080> take<00:03:28.260> out

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
couple's arrogance it's easy to take out

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.590 
couple's arrogance it's easy to take out
and<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.460> drones<00:03:29.820> are<00:03:30.000> just<00:03:30.180> kind<00:03:30.300> of<00:03:30.420> running

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
and the drones are just kind of running

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.890 
and the drones are just kind of running
around<00:03:30.810> aimlessly<00:03:32.330> doing<00:03:33.330> nothing<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:33.690> can

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
around aimlessly doing nothing you can

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.560 
around aimlessly doing nothing you can
do<00:03:34.050> so<00:03:34.800> you<00:03:34.860> can<00:03:35.010> see<00:03:35.190> how<00:03:35.220> that<00:03:35.580> tribe<00:03:36.030> Eric's

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
do so you can see how that tribe Eric's

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.060 
do so you can see how that tribe Eric's
just<00:03:36.990> pop<00:03:37.440> out<00:03:37.680> as<00:03:38.040> many<00:03:39.650> Infantry's<00:03:40.650> in<00:03:40.860> town

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
just pop out as many Infantry's in town

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.580 
just pop out as many Infantry's in town
works<00:03:41.340> really<00:03:41.640> well<00:03:41.790> even<00:03:42.380> with<00:03:43.380> the

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
works really well even with the

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.400 
works really well even with the
increased<00:03:44.520> build<00:03:44.820> time<00:03:45.120> on<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.450> reactor<00:03:46.110> and

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
increased build time on the reactor and

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.220 
increased build time on the reactor and
the<00:03:46.950> Marines<00:03:47.730> you<00:03:48.270> can<00:03:48.420> still<00:03:48.750> get<00:03:48.959> it<00:03:49.110> out

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
the Marines you can still get it out

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.190 
the Marines you can still get it out

a<00:05:03.840> few<00:05:04.200> Marines<00:05:04.560> and<00:05:07.250> muta<00:05:08.250> lists<00:05:08.580> would<00:05:08.760> have

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
a few Marines and muta lists would have

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.300 
a few Marines and muta lists would have
actually<00:05:09.030> been<00:05:09.510> pretty<00:05:10.020> good<00:05:10.140> and<00:05:10.410> I<00:05:10.980> don't

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
actually been pretty good and I don't

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.700 
actually been pretty good and I don't
know<00:05:11.400> how<00:05:11.880> effective<00:05:12.480> well<00:05:13.050> you<00:05:13.200> don't<00:05:13.290> equate

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
know how effective well you don't equate

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.050 
know how effective well you don't equate
a<00:05:13.770> few<00:05:14.070> because<00:05:15.560> Marines<00:05:16.560> can<00:05:16.920> of<00:05:17.250> course<00:05:17.520> deal

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
a few because Marines can of course deal

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.380 
a few because Marines can of course deal
pretty<00:05:18.450> heavy<00:05:18.660> damage<00:05:19.020> analysts<00:05:20.180> right<00:05:21.180> now

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
pretty heavy damage analysts right now

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.270 
pretty heavy damage analysts right now
I'm<00:05:21.630> just<00:05:21.660> hope<00:05:22.200> the<00:05:22.350> factory<00:05:22.830> just<00:05:22.920> so<00:05:23.250> I

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
I'm just hope the factory just so I

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.780 
I'm just hope the factory just so I
could<00:05:23.370> get<00:05:23.580> star<00:05:23.910> ports<00:05:24.330> but

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
could get star ports but

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.870 
could get star ports but
one<00:05:26.350> so<00:05:27.350> yeah<00:05:27.650> I<00:05:27.680> think<00:05:27.770> next<00:05:28.130> game<00:05:28.460> I'm<00:05:28.760> going

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
one so yeah I think next game I'm going

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.360 
one so yeah I think next game I'm going
to<00:05:28.940> do<00:05:29.030> another<00:05:29.210> turn<00:05:29.600> your<00:05:29.930> scissored<00:05:30.370> it's

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
to do another turn your scissored it's

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.550 
to do another turn your scissored it's
going<00:05:31.550> to<00:05:31.610> be<00:05:31.670> a<00:05:31.730> bit<00:05:31.910> longer<00:05:32.120> so<00:05:32.780> you<00:05:33.140> kind<00:05:33.500> of

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
going to be a bit longer so you kind of

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.640 
going to be a bit longer so you kind of
see<00:05:33.770> how<00:05:34.630> tippy<00:05:35.630> toes<00:05:35.810> are<00:05:35.960> get<00:05:36.080> you<00:05:36.170> can't<00:05:36.440> do

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
see how tippy toes are get you can't do

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.450 
see how tippy toes are get you can't do
this<00:05:36.830> cheese<00:05:37.730> rushing<00:05:38.360> in<00:05:38.570> with<00:05:38.600> a<00:05:39.050> mass<00:05:39.320> or<00:05:40.280> on
