you need to decide where you want your

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.510 
you need to decide where you want your
phillippe<00:00:48.680> then<00:00:49.680> go<00:00:49.829> two<00:00:50.039> blocks<00:00:50.160> down<00:00:50.370> from

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
phillippe then go two blocks down from

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:58.639 
phillippe then go two blocks down from
that<00:00:51.860> and<00:00:52.860> actually<00:00:53.100> one<00:00:55.100> ok<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.160> um<00:00:57.649> then

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
that and actually one ok so um then

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.639 
that and actually one ok so um then
place<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:59.039> redstone<00:00:59.520> block<00:01:00.410> then<00:01:01.410> place<00:01:01.620> a

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
place a redstone block then place a

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.289 
place a redstone block then place a
normal<00:01:02.010> block<00:01:03.379> and<00:01:04.379> then<00:01:05.129> place<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.670> normal

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
normal block and then place a normal

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.609 
normal block and then place a normal
piston<00:01:06.689> facing<00:01:07.170> up<00:01:07.580> this<00:01:08.580> will<00:01:08.760> push<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.060> that

piston facing up this will push you that

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:19.780 
piston facing up this will push you that
it's<00:01:10.619> fine<00:01:13.159> now<00:01:14.159> place<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.909> block<00:01:15.270> here<00:01:16.580> a<00:01:17.810> slab

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
it's fine now place a block here a slab

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.940 
it's fine now place a block here a slab
then<00:01:20.790> go<00:01:21.979> one<00:01:22.979> block<00:01:23.130> up<00:01:23.340> from<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.950> look

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
then go one block up from that I look

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.730 
then go one block up from that I look
across<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.869> another<00:01:27.869> slap<00:01:28.170> here<00:01:30.170> now<00:01:31.170> by<00:01:31.680> the

also have a signal run into running into
this<00:03:21.540> wire<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:22.230> doesn't<00:03:22.530> matter<00:03:24.200> in<00:03:25.200> what<00:03:25.470> way

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
this wire it doesn't matter in what way

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.380 
this wire it doesn't matter in what way
you<00:03:25.680> can<00:03:26.190> decide<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.300> for<00:03:27.420> yourself<00:03:28.940> but<00:03:29.940> yeah

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
you can decide it for yourself but yeah

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.120 
you can decide it for yourself but yeah
pressure<00:03:30.780> plate<00:03:31.050> it's<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.680> nice<00:03:31.830> thing<00:03:32.070> to<00:03:32.130> have

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
pressure plate it's a nice thing to have

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:41.240 
pressure plate it's a nice thing to have
um<00:03:36.709> so<00:03:37.709> from<00:03:37.950> here<00:03:38.330> take<00:03:39.470> way<00:03:40.470> this<00:03:40.680> is<00:03:41.010> not

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
um so from here take way this is not

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.699 
um so from here take way this is not
correct<00:03:42.050> like<00:03:43.050> this<00:03:43.290> yeah<00:03:44.900> from<00:03:45.900> here<00:03:46.080> take<00:03:46.470> a

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
correct like this yeah from here take a

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.690 
correct like this yeah from here take a
repeater<00:03:47.280> on<00:03:47.489> 1<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.000> r<00:03:48.540> peed<00:03:48.780> on<00:03:48.900> four<00:03:49.170> here

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.199 

both<00:03:53.700> going<00:03:54.150> into<00:03:54.540> thread<00:03:55.200> soundest<00:03:56.209> into

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
both going into thread soundest into

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:04.400 
both going into thread soundest into
this<00:03:57.530> torch<00:03:58.530> and<00:03:58.830> into<00:03:59.580> a<00:03:59.790> normal<00:04:00.600> piston<00:04:03.410> now

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
this torch and into a normal piston now

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
this torch and into a normal piston now
we<00:04:04.470> can<00:04:04.650> place<00:04:04.980> this<00:04:05.100> block<00:04:05.400> back<00:04:05.610> and<00:04:07.430> over

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
we can place this block back and over

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:15.820 
we can place this block back and over
here<00:04:11.360> place<00:04:12.360> a<00:04:12.600> sticky<00:04:12.930> piston

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:22.210 

and<00:04:15.920> a<00:04:16.870> downsizing<00:04:17.870> sticky<00:04:18.230> piston<00:04:19.750> and<00:04:21.220> on

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
and a downsizing sticky piston and on

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:30.100 
and a downsizing sticky piston and on
top<00:04:22.400> of<00:04:22.430> it<00:04:22.580> I<00:04:22.910> forgot<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:23.800> cauldron<00:04:29.110> like

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
top of it I forgot the cauldron like

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:38.200 
top of it I forgot the cauldron like
that<00:04:32.950> with<00:04:33.950> a<00:04:33.980> comparator<00:04:35.290> going<00:04:36.520> into<00:04:37.520> these

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
that with a comparator going into these

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:48.480 
that with a comparator going into these
red<00:04:38.450> sounds

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.689 

is<00:04:49.030> that<00:04:49.240> correct<00:04:50.340> no<00:04:51.340> that's<00:04:51.550> not<00:04:51.639> correct

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
is that correct no that's not correct

00:04:53.699 --> 00:05:01.460 
is that correct no that's not correct
this<00:04:54.699> should<00:04:54.759> be<00:04:55.449> here<00:04:57.060> this<00:04:58.060> should<00:04:58.210> be<00:04:58.240> here

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:08.370 

sorry<00:05:02.470> for<00:05:02.650> that<00:05:04.889> so<00:05:06.780> same<00:05:07.780> thing<00:05:07.810> as<00:05:08.229> I<00:05:08.349> just

sorry for that so same thing as I just
said<00:05:08.770> except<00:05:09.490> bum<00:05:09.759> Bob<00:05:09.940> not<00:05:10.120> lower<00:05:14.220> you<00:05:15.220> don't

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
said except bum Bob not lower you don't

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:23.189 
said except bum Bob not lower you don't
do<00:05:16.710> you<00:05:17.710> need<00:05:17.919> a<00:05:18.870> normal<00:05:19.870> piston<00:05:20.169> here<00:05:22.199> to

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 
do you need a normal piston here to

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:30.749 
do you need a normal piston here to
stick<00:05:23.620> distance<00:05:24.099> here<00:05:27.180> like<00:05:28.180> this<00:05:28.720> and<00:05:29.759> once

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 
stick distance here like this and once

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:35.430 
stick distance here like this and once
the<00:05:30.940> piston<00:05:31.479> over<00:05:32.050> here<00:05:33.870> then<00:05:34.870> take<00:05:35.289> the

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
the piston over here then take the

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.360 
the piston over here then take the
signal<00:05:35.830> and<00:05:37.259> let's<00:05:38.259> go<00:05:38.560> into<00:05:38.590> this<00:05:38.889> distance

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
signal and let's go into this distance

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:47.159 
signal and let's go into this distance
and<00:05:41.940> also<00:05:42.940> with<00:05:43.599> 226<00:05:44.500> repeaters<00:05:46.080> into<00:05:47.080> this

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
and also with 226 repeaters into this

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:56.659 
and also with 226 repeaters into this
wire<00:05:49.560> and<00:05:50.560> down<00:05:50.949> here<00:05:54.210> repeaters<00:05:55.210> going<00:05:55.719> into

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
wire and down here repeaters going into

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:03.360 
wire and down here repeaters going into
each<00:05:57.669> other<00:05:57.909> some<00:05:58.599> sort<00:05:59.440> of<00:06:02.039> into<00:06:03.039> this<00:06:03.130> block

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
each other some sort of into this block

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.320 
each other some sort of into this block
and<00:06:04.620> we<00:06:05.620> will<00:06:05.770> have<00:06:05.889> to<00:06:05.949> reset<00:06:06.400> this<00:06:06.550> later

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.760 

repeat<00:06:10.330> it<00:06:10.449> on<00:06:10.570> three<00:06:11.229> into<00:06:11.560> this<00:06:11.680> piston<00:06:13.770> wire

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
repeat it on three into this piston wire

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.020 
repeat it on three into this piston wire
up<00:06:15.039> and<00:06:15.310> a<00:06:15.550> solid<00:06:15.820> look<00:06:16.060> here<00:06:17.430> and<00:06:18.430> you<00:06:18.759> can't

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
up and a solid look here and you can't

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.499 
up and a solid look here and you can't
cover<00:06:19.180> this<00:06:19.419> up<00:06:19.539> so<00:06:20.229> that<00:06:20.319> it<00:06:20.409> looks<00:06:20.560> bit<00:06:20.800> nicer

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:21.509 
cover this up so that it looks bit nicer

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:27.469 
cover this up so that it looks bit nicer
ok<00:06:22.509> now<00:06:22.599> I<00:06:22.630> have<00:06:22.960> to<00:06:23.169> reset<00:06:23.680> this<00:06:25.710> like<00:06:26.710> this

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 
ok now I have to reset this like this

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:32.520 
ok now I have to reset this like this
and<00:06:28.479> you<00:06:28.719> have<00:06:28.960> to<00:06:29.229> power<00:06:29.770> this<00:06:29.949> person<00:06:31.530> like

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530 
and you have to power this person like

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.839 
and you have to power this person like
that<00:06:32.560> now<00:06:32.919> it<00:06:33.159> should<00:06:33.639> be<00:06:34.110> reset<00:06:35.110> almost<00:06:35.849> like

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:36.849 
that now it should be reset almost like

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:41.130 
that now it should be reset almost like
this

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.140 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.460 

um<00:06:43.360> let<00:06:44.360> me<00:06:44.390> shoot<00:06:44.600> it<00:06:44.720> up<00:06:44.810> late<00:06:45.050> night<00:06:45.260> min

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470 
um let me shoot it up late night min

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.240 
um let me shoot it up late night min
here<00:06:46.180> yeah<00:06:47.180> then<00:06:47.450> I<00:06:47.570> think<00:06:47.990> it<00:06:48.530> shoots<00:06:49.010> work

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
here yeah then I think it shoots work

00:06:49.250 --> 00:07:02.580 
here yeah then I think it shoots work
now<00:06:51.700> it's<00:06:52.700> just<00:06:52.880> it<00:06:59.650> well<00:07:00.650> I<00:07:00.830> forgot<00:07:01.610> place<00:07:02.030> a

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:02.590 
now it's just it well I forgot place a

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:09.250 
now it's just it well I forgot place a
sticky<00:07:03.590> piston<00:07:04.420> right<00:07:05.420> here<00:07:06.940> and<00:07:07.940> other<00:07:08.930> than

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:09.260 
sticky piston right here and other than

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:17.470 
sticky piston right here and other than
that<00:07:09.410> it<00:07:09.650> looks<00:07:09.680> like<00:07:09.920> works<00:07:12.190> yeah<00:07:16.090> so<00:07:17.090> that's

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:17.480 
that it looks like works yeah so that's

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.620 
that it looks like works yeah so that's
