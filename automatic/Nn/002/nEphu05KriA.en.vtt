one be right back Bushnell was kind
enough<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.480> send<00:00:18.750> us<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.140> backtrack<00:00:19.830> detour

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
enough to send us the backtrack detour

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.359 
enough to send us the backtrack detour
this<00:00:21.480> device<00:00:21.810> right<00:00:22.050> here<00:00:22.320> now<00:00:22.949> what<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.189> see

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
also a login screen that ties for this

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.509 
also a login screen that ties for this
guy<00:00:27.810> right<00:00:28.080> here<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:28.830> can<00:00:29.010> actually<00:00:29.189> keep

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
guy right here this can actually keep

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.759 
guy right here this can actually keep
track<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:30.150> where<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.539> actually<00:00:30.810> hiked<00:00:31.380> and

all that that you can see on actually
pulls<00:00:33.899> up<00:00:34.020> from<00:00:34.170> Google<00:00:34.469> Maps<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:34.860> pretty

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
pulls up from Google Maps it's pretty

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.860 
pulls up from Google Maps it's pretty
cool<00:00:35.370> from<00:00:35.760> what<00:00:35.940> I've<00:00:36.030> read<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.570> reviews

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
cool from what I've read on the reviews

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.940 
cool from what I've read on the reviews
but<00:00:36.989> we're<00:00:37.140> going<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.290> actually<00:00:37.410> test<00:00:37.829> this

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
but we're going to actually test this

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.200 
but we're going to actually test this
thing<00:00:38.129> out<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.610> field

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
thing out in the field

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.240 
thing out in the field
now<00:00:39.600> field<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.079> stream<00:00:40.260> actually<00:00:40.710> rated<00:00:40.980> this

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
now field and stream actually rated this

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.639 
now field and stream actually rated this
the<00:00:41.489> best<00:00:41.910> new<00:00:42.300> GPS<00:00:42.930> for<00:00:43.910> 2011<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.559> let's<00:00:46.559> see

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
the best new GPS for 2011 so let's see

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.350 
the best new GPS for 2011 so let's see
if<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.829> passes<00:00:47.010> my<00:00:47.340> test<00:00:47.610> out<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> field

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
if it passes my test out of the field

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.810 
if it passes my test out of the field
okay<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:49.500> just<00:00:49.530> got<00:00:49.829> here<00:00:50.039> at<00:00:50.160> Cane<00:00:50.340> Creek<00:00:50.520> Park

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
okay we just got here at Cane Creek Park

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.220 
okay we just got here at Cane Creek Park
and<00:00:51.000> walk<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.570> let's<00:00:51.750> see<00:00:51.840> how<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.079> works

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
and walk so so let's see how this works

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.380 
and walk so so let's see how this works
as<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.350> detour<00:00:55.680> took<00:00:55.890> less<00:00:56.309> than<00:00:56.340> 60<00:00:56.969> seconds

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
as a detour took less than 60 seconds

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.389 
as a detour took less than 60 seconds
from<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.600> time<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.930> turned<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
from the time I turned it on to the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.490 
from the time I turned it on to the
point<00:00:59.699> where<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.030> marked<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.809> car<00:01:01.050> before<00:01:01.289> I

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
point where I marked the car before I

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.630 
point where I marked the car before I
headed<00:01:01.739> out<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.160> my<00:01:02.309> hike<00:01:04.159> well<00:01:05.159> guys<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.519> was

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
headed out to my hike well guys I was

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.399 
headed out to my hike well guys I was
going<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.820> mark<00:01:06.090> do<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> little<00:01:07.140> bit<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.290> a

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
going to mark do a little bit of a

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.230 
going to mark do a little bit of a
longer<00:01:07.680> hike<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:08.130> got<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> lot<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.580> wasps

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
longer hike but we got a lot of wasps

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.450 
longer hike but we got a lot of wasps
and<00:01:09.510> snakes<00:01:09.930> around<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.320> area<00:01:10.650> today<00:01:10.799> and

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
and snakes around the area today and

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.600 
and snakes around the area today and
where<00:01:12.390> I'm<00:01:12.540> at<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.900> about<00:01:12.990> 445<00:01:13.920> feet<00:01:14.310> yards

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
where I'm at is about 445 feet yards

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.270 
where I'm at is about 445 feet yards
away<00:01:15.030> from<00:01:15.240> my<00:01:15.630> car<00:01:15.930> currently<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:17.159> was

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
away from my car currently and this was

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.580 
away from my car currently and this was
pointing<00:01:17.640> actually<00:01:18.030> very<00:01:18.240> accurately<00:01:18.750> and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
pointing actually very accurately and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.810 
pointing actually very accurately and
give<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.860> an<00:01:19.950> idea<00:01:20.250> if<00:01:20.400> you're<00:01:20.549> not<00:01:20.670> familiar

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
give you an idea if you're not familiar

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.640 
give you an idea if you're not familiar
with<00:01:21.090> an<00:01:21.270> area<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.659> you're<00:01:21.810> at<00:01:21.990> as<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.530> can

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
with an area that you're at as you can

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.230 
with an area that you're at as you can
see<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.159> cannot<00:01:23.430> see<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.700> parking<00:01:24.030> lot<00:01:24.090> from

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
see you cannot see the parking lot from

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.890 
see you cannot see the parking lot from
here<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.280> if<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:27.270> thing<00:01:27.479> actually<00:01:27.810> would

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
here and if this thing actually would

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.690 
here and if this thing actually would
direct<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.320> back<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.770> where<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.040> car<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.490> and

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
direct you back to where the car is and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.980 
direct you back to where the car is and
this<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.820> actually<00:01:30.240> very<00:01:30.479> accurate

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
this is actually very accurate

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.230 
this is actually very accurate
just<00:01:31.439> like<00:01:31.590> my<00:01:31.770> back<00:01:31.979> track<00:01:32.280> but<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.150> is

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
just like my back track but this is

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.240 
just like my back track but this is
actually<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.540> lot<00:01:33.659> easier<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:34.110> read<00:01:34.290> verses<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
actually a lot easier to read verses the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.039 
actually a lot easier to read verses the
original<00:01:35.670> back<00:01:35.850> track<00:01:36.119> now<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.720> go<00:01:36.840> ahead<00:01:36.960> and

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
original back track now you go ahead and

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:37.940 
original back track now you go ahead and
show<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.170> some<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.530> functions

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
show you some of the functions

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.130 
show you some of the functions
everything<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.430> controlled<00:01:38.729> really<00:01:39.180> by<00:01:39.329> three

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
everything is controlled really by three

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.960 
everything is controlled really by three
there's<00:01:40.619> four<00:01:40.710> buttons<00:01:41.159> but<00:01:41.340> really<00:01:41.579> three<00:01:41.850> of

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
there's four buttons but really three of

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.969 
there's four buttons but really three of
them<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.210> use<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> regular<00:01:42.659> basis<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.860> got

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
them you use on a regular basis you got

this afternoon of sort of when I started
the<00:03:28.950> log<00:03:29.130> basically<00:03:29.730> going<00:03:30.000> up<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.299> street<00:03:30.630> to

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
the log basically going up the street to

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.319 
the log basically going up the street to
test<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.799> out<00:03:31.889> and<00:03:32.130> it<00:03:32.519> actually<00:03:32.880> monitors

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
test it out and it actually monitors

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.660 
test it out and it actually monitors
your<00:03:33.540> speed<00:03:34.079> what<00:03:35.069> you<00:03:35.160> see<00:03:35.340> is<00:03:35.489> there<00:03:35.639> a

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
your speed what you see is there a

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.860 
your speed what you see is there a
temperature<00:03:36.150> time<00:03:36.420> lapse<00:03:36.720> speed<00:03:37.340> in<00:03:38.569> hours<00:03:39.569> it

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
temperature time lapse speed in hours it

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.740 
temperature time lapse speed in hours it
basically<00:03:40.799> set<00:03:41.220> up<00:03:41.340> on<00:03:41.489> it's<00:03:41.700> very<00:03:41.910> a<00:03:42.000> very

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
basically set up on it's very a very
