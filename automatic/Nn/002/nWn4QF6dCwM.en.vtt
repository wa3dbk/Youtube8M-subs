mr.<00:00:11.710> Emoto<00:00:11.980> became<00:00:12.549> terribly<00:00:13.000> interested<00:00:13.900> in

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.170 
mr. Emoto became terribly interested in

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.740 
mr. Emoto became terribly interested in
the<00:00:14.410> molecular<00:00:14.770> structure<00:00:15.580> of<00:00:15.730> water<00:00:15.820> and

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750 
the molecular structure of water and

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.920 
the molecular structure of water and
what<00:00:17.349> effects<00:00:17.740> it<00:00:17.980> now<00:00:18.939> water<00:00:19.240> is<00:00:19.390> the<00:00:19.720> most

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
what effects it now water is the most

what effects it now water is the most
receptive<00:00:20.470> of<00:00:20.770> the<00:00:21.250> four<00:00:21.520> elements<00:00:22.320> mr.<00:00:23.320> Emoto

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.210 
receptive of the four elements mr. Emoto
thought<00:00:24.039> perhaps<00:00:24.760> it<00:00:24.940> would<00:00:25.090> respond<00:00:25.630> to

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
thought perhaps it would respond to

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.010 
thought perhaps it would respond to
non-physical<00:00:27.220> events<00:00:27.850> so<00:00:28.270> he<00:00:28.480> set<00:00:28.720> up<00:00:28.750> a

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
non-physical events so he set up a

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.009 
non-physical events so he set up a
series<00:00:29.470> of<00:00:29.500> studies<00:00:29.850> applied<00:00:30.850> mental<00:00:31.449> stimuli

and<00:00:32.349> photographed<00:00:33.250> it<00:00:33.430> with<00:00:33.790> a<00:00:33.820> dark<00:00:34.180> field

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
and photographed it with a dark field

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.740

different<00:01:16.000> this<00:01:16.180> is<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.509> Chi<00:01:16.810> of<00:01:16.840> love<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:21.070> we

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
different this is the Chi of love and we

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.690 
different this is the Chi of love and we
move<00:01:21.430> along<00:01:21.729> here<00:01:22.060> to<00:01:22.229> thank<00:01:23.229> you<00:01:23.409> and<00:01:23.860> you<00:01:24.549> can

move along here to thank you and you can

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.120 
move along here to thank you and you can
see<00:01:24.970> where<00:01:25.180> he<00:01:25.330> taped<00:01:25.600> that<00:01:25.810> to<00:01:26.530> this<00:01:26.680> bottle

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
see where he taped that to this bottle

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.760 
see where he taped that to this bottle
here<00:01:27.659> but<00:01:28.659> if<00:01:28.780> you<00:01:28.899> read<00:01:29.110> Japanese<00:01:29.289> you

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
here but if you read Japanese you

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.169 
here but if you read Japanese you
already<00:01:30.070> knew<00:01:30.220> that

now<00:01:34.179> mr.<00:01:34.600> Emoto<00:01:34.869> speaks<00:01:35.470> of<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:36.610> thought<00:01:37.000> or

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
now mr. Emoto speaks of the thought or

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.200 
now mr. Emoto speaks of the thought or
intent<00:01:37.869> being<00:01:38.289> the<00:01:38.440> driving<00:01:39.100> force<00:01:39.490> in<00:01:39.850> all<00:01:40.060> of

intent being the driving force in all of

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.300 
intent being the driving force in all of
this<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:41.110> science<00:01:41.560> of<00:01:41.679> how<00:01:41.830> that<00:01:42.039> actually

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
this the science of how that actually

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.990 
this the science of how that actually
affects<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:43.000> molecules<00:01:43.659> is<00:01:43.960> unknown<00:01:45.000> except

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
affects the molecules is unknown except

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.919 
affects the molecules is unknown except
to<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.330> water<00:01:46.539> molecules<00:01:47.170> of<00:01:47.380> course<00:01:47.670> and

to the water molecules of course and

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.570 
to the water molecules of course and
it's<00:01:49.929> really<00:01:50.200> fascinating<00:01:50.440> when<00:01:51.069> you<00:01:51.159> keep<00:01:51.340> in

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
it's really fascinating when you keep in

00:01:51.580 --> 00:02:05.910 
it's really fascinating when you keep in
mind<00:01:51.610> that<00:01:52.330> 90%<00:01:52.929> of<00:01:53.470> our<00:01:53.679> bodies<00:01:53.830> are<00:01:54.369> water

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
make sure wander doesn't if thoughts

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.750 
make sure wander doesn't if thoughts
could<00:02:09.580> do<00:02:09.700> that<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:10.119> water<00:02:10.300> imagine<00:02:11.730> what<00:02:12.730> our

could do that to water imagine what our
