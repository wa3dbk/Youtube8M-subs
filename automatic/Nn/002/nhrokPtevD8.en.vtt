00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
here so we can take a look look the

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.870 
here so we can take a look look the
fields<00:04:55.810> offer<00:04:56.100> something<00:04:57.100> else<00:04:57.430> you<00:04:57.670> bite

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
fields offer something else you bite

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.790 
fields offer something else you bite
first<00:04:58.180> like<00:04:58.450> this<00:04:58.660> and<00:04:59.260> then<00:04:59.380> you<00:04:59.410> upgrade<00:04:59.770> to

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800

first like this and then you upgrade to
the<00:04:59.950> stone<00:05:00.250> and<00:05:00.520> then<00:05:01.060> to<00:05:01.210> this<00:05:01.360> so<00:05:01.690> they

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
the stone and then to this so they

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.710
