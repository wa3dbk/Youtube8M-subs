cleavage so all that you know is leaving

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.910 
cleavage so all that you know is leaving
lines<00:05:44.640> where<00:05:45.120> you<00:05:45.300> file<00:05:45.720> so<00:05:46.170> you<00:05:46.200> need<00:05:46.470> to<00:05:46.650> try

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 
lines where you file so you need to try

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.550 
lines where you file so you need to try
and<00:05:47.100> get<00:05:47.700> as<00:05:47.820> much<00:05:48.390> of<00:05:48.450> that<00:05:48.720> off<00:05:49.110> as<00:05:49.440> you

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
and get as much of that off as you

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.290 
and get as much of that off as you
possibly<00:05:49.980> can<00:05:50.300> with<00:05:51.300> the<00:05:51.420> buffer<00:05:53.180> so<00:05:54.180> now

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
possibly can with the buffer so now

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.630 
possibly can with the buffer so now
