00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
would probably be my second choice for

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.640 
would probably be my second choice for
editing<00:04:16.329> along<00:04:17.329> with<00:04:17.479> your<00:04:17.630> other<00:04:17.660> editing

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
editing along with your other editing

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.270 
editing along with your other editing
software<00:04:19.070> like<00:04:19.190> after<00:04:19.489> effects<00:04:19.820> I<00:04:20.120> have<00:04:20.269> that

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
software like after effects I have that

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.640 
software like after effects I have that
as<00:04:22.280> well<00:04:22.520> I<00:04:22.840> don't<00:04:23.840> have<00:04:23.960> premier<00:04:24.260> though<00:04:24.410> but

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
as well I don't have premier though but

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.740 
as well I don't have premier though but
I've<00:04:24.889> I<00:04:25.220> think<00:04:26.060> I've<00:04:26.180> used<00:04:26.360> it<00:04:26.510> before<00:04:28.750> does

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
I've I think I've used it before does

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.460 
I've I think I've used it before does
that<00:04:29.870> answer<00:04:29.930> your<00:04:30.110> question<00:04:30.290> oh<00:04:30.680> yeah<00:04:32.470> okay

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
that answer your question oh yeah okay

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.340 
that answer your question oh yeah okay
next<00:04:34.100> question<00:04:34.250> uh<00:04:34.610> how<00:04:35.570> long<00:04:35.600> does<00:04:35.990> it<00:04:36.050> take

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
next question uh how long does it take

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.900 
next question uh how long does it take
you<00:04:36.530> to<00:04:36.620> make<00:04:36.650> an<00:04:36.919> episode<00:04:38.320> five<00:04:39.320> minutes

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
you to make an episode five minutes

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.080 
you to make an episode five minutes
without<00:04:40.910> fit<00:04:41.680> when<00:04:42.680> I<00:04:42.710> don't<00:04:42.950> filming<00:04:43.880> takes

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
without fit when I don't filming takes

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.750 
without fit when I don't filming takes
probably<00:04:44.960> longer<00:04:45.470> because<00:04:45.949> people<00:04:46.400> goof<00:04:46.550> off

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
probably longer because people goof off

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.409 
probably longer because people goof off
but<00:04:47.500> it<00:04:48.500> doesn't<00:04:48.860> take<00:04:48.979> that<00:04:49.010> long<00:04:49.190> I<00:04:49.699> can

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
but it doesn't take that long I can

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.840 
but it doesn't take that long I can
easily<00:04:50.570> edit<00:04:50.870> one<00:04:51.169> in<00:04:51.320> five<00:04:51.500> minutes<00:04:51.770> and<00:04:52.130> have

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
easily edit one in five minutes and have

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.029 
easily edit one in five minutes and have
it<00:04:52.970> ready<00:04:53.150> to<00:04:53.300> air<00:04:53.650> five<00:04:54.650> minutes<00:04:54.860> later

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
it ready to air five minutes later

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:58.180 
it ready to air five minutes later
movies<00:04:55.850> or<00:04:56.030> holes<00:04:56.270> on<00:04:56.450> the<00:04:56.510> story<00:04:56.840> though<00:04:57.190> yeah

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.090 
movies or holes on the story though yeah
movies<00:04:58.550> take<00:04:58.760> a<00:04:58.789> lot<00:04:59.030> longer<00:04:59.680> especially<00:05:00.680> this

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
movies take a lot longer especially this
