00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.400
 A scientist 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.290
 Resources 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.290
 As a result of the dollar, 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.369
 Accepted. 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.589
 In this situation, b-boys on the floor 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.479
 Live in the last floor 

00:00:18.479 --> 00:00:22.050
 I was invited to the oyster for 11.3 times 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.989
 This is a very restful and difficult exercise, but now 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.659
 In the case of Naver, 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:31.659
 What can be said is the ultimate skill. 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.890
 In order to make the shape look good, the result is dynamic 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.960
 Because the workers themselves are not so difficult, 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.960
 Worth drinking and writing together 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.140
 I mean, it's a small call to pick up resources. 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.640
 Call it. 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.610
 So many people, B-boys. 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.040
 Looking back 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.550
 It was as if the floor was getting bigger. Of course, this went beyond the circle. 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.040
 I would be the kind of company that just showed up. 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.450
 Even those who can not imagine that there is no restaurant company 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.620
 I was back in the era when there was no money. 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.090
 The most basic idea of ​​professional baseball is 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.080
 Before ours. Over the next few months 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.900
 It is assumed to be shifting. 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.570
 This is not the tempo you see 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.570
 Stop 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.010
 Wardrobe 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.710
 The whole school student can move this movement to others deeply. 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.030

 Seongdonggang once agriculture 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.550
 Even after peeling off the building 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.700
 Distance 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.370

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.940
 Enjoy the deal 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.030
 Among the small countries, 600 million units in total, 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.190
 The distance to the state is not on the ground. 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.140
 When I actively mobilize my legs, I step on the right leg of Jakarta. 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.660
 Feel up 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.660
 We need to find out what we need to do 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.109
 With the left leg, 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:10.899
 Once so 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.899
 At this time, would you like to comfort your legs? 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.369
 Enjoy your hot dunk on your left leg

 2008 running 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:22.299
 Writing your body to the right 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.019
 Development or Bridge Plate Clouds Bridge is getting ground 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.999
 If you gave it a deep time, the heel of a company with a high full moon 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:31.239
 rarely 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.929
 Jumping 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:35.980
 A little inconvenience to the aide 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.449
 As a requirement to deal with 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:44.289

 5. 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.569
 No blinds had come up if you had invested in, 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.599
 It's hard to sustain, but if it's theoretical, 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.449
 I am so glad that I came to Korea 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:00.249
 Not 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:03.559
 There are only nine cards, and they sell for $ 810,000. 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:06.899
 see. United States of America 

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:10.219
 Something to throw away. While jumping to the left leg, grains 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.219
 It's clear to the right. 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.159
 Now this state 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.379

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:49.909
 At the same time 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:50.500
 Well

 I want you to listen.
