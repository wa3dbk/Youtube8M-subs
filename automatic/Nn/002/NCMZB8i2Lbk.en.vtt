00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
if you get close to your rocks go ahead

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.290 
if you get close to your rocks go ahead
and<00:03:45.560> use<00:03:45.710> the<00:03:45.970> woodland<00:03:46.970> Scenic's<00:03:49.300> cement

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300

sign once it dries this Elmer's glue

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.830 
sign once it dries this Elmer's glue
will<00:04:00.950> give<00:04:01.100> a<00:04:01.130> slight<00:04:01.460> shine<00:04:01.970> you<00:04:02.540> don't<00:04:02.720> want

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
will give a slight shine you don't want

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.070 
will give a slight shine you don't want
that<00:04:02.990> on<00:04:03.110> your<00:04:03.140> rocks<00:04:05.080> go<00:04:06.080> ahead<00:04:06.320> and<00:04:08.080> make

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
that on your rocks go ahead and make

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.720 
that on your rocks go ahead and make
sure<00:04:09.110> everything<00:04:09.650> is<00:04:09.680> well<00:04:09.920> saturated<00:04:10.220> with

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
sure everything is well saturated with

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.290 
sure everything is well saturated with
the<00:04:10.880> white<00:04:11.240> glue<00:04:11.390> and<00:04:11.540> water<00:04:12.460> and<00:04:13.460> we'll<00:04:14.150> go

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
the white glue and water and we'll go

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.759 
the white glue and water and we'll go
from<00:04:14.420> there

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.969 

okay<00:04:20.340> so<00:04:20.400> now<00:04:20.699> I've<00:04:21.289> put<00:04:22.289> in<00:04:22.440> some<00:04:22.680> of<00:04:22.710> the

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
okay so now I've put in some of the

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:28.600 
okay so now I've put in some of the
burnt<00:04:23.639> grass<00:04:24.199> which<00:04:25.199> when<00:04:25.830> wet<00:04:26.990> blends<00:04:27.990> in

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
burnt grass which when wet blends in

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.400 
burnt grass which when wet blends in
with<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:29.880> dirt<00:04:30.349> but<00:04:31.349> when<00:04:32.009> it<00:04:32.160> dries<00:04:32.460> up<00:04:33.410> it

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
with the dirt but when it dries up it

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.579 
with the dirt but when it dries up it
will<00:04:34.590> lighten<00:04:34.889> up<00:04:35.539> to<00:04:36.539> this<00:04:37.440> color

00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:40.589 

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:48.760 

I've<00:04:41.309> also<00:04:41.519> started<00:04:42.299> with<00:04:42.479> the<00:04:43.909> medium<00:04:44.909> green

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:05:11.250 

horse<00:04:49.370> turf<00:04:51.130> see<00:04:52.130> it<00:04:52.220> there

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.460 

okay<00:05:11.800> so<00:05:11.860> here<00:05:12.160> we<00:05:12.190> have<00:05:12.310> the<00:05:12.640> top<00:05:13.410> section<00:05:14.410> of

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
okay so here we have the top section of

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.950 
okay so here we have the top section of
the<00:05:14.590> mountain<00:05:14.920> with<00:05:15.700> the<00:05:15.910> second<00:05:16.600> and<00:05:16.750> third

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
the mountain with the second and third

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:27.690 
the mountain with the second and third
layer<00:05:17.200> of<00:05:18.840> bone

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.090 

and<00:05:28.240> what<00:05:28.630> I<00:05:28.660> tried<00:05:28.960> the<00:05:29.350> effect<00:05:29.470> that<00:05:29.770> tried

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
and what I tried the effect that tried

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:36.020 
and what I tried the effect that tried
to<00:05:30.250> get<00:05:30.460> was<00:05:33.210> to<00:05:34.210> have<00:05:34.390> the<00:05:34.570> heavier<00:05:35.020> grass

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
to get was to have the heavier grass

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.400 
to get was to have the heavier grass
grow<00:05:37.030> on<00:05:37.390> the<00:05:39.270> horizontal<00:05:40.270> side<00:05:40.510> more<00:05:41.200> on<00:05:41.320> the

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
grow on the horizontal side more on the

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.860 
grow on the horizontal side more on the
horizontal<00:05:41.860> side<00:05:42.070> of<00:05:42.250> the<00:05:42.310> mountain<00:05:42.720> then<00:05:43.720> on

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
horizontal side of the mountain then on

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.530 
horizontal side of the mountain then on
the<00:05:44.140> vertical<00:05:44.650> side<00:05:44.860> even<00:05:45.550> though<00:05:45.700> some<00:05:46.270> grass

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
the vertical side even though some grass

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.040 
the vertical side even though some grass
will<00:05:46.840> catch<00:05:47.080> on<00:05:47.320> the<00:05:47.410> vertical<00:05:47.770> side<00:05:48.300> and<00:05:49.300> on

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
will catch on the vertical side and on

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.570 
will catch on the vertical side and on
these<00:05:50.320> cuts<00:05:50.740> or<00:05:51.700> small<00:05:52.240> ravines

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
these cuts or small ravines

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.290 
these cuts or small ravines
see<00:05:55.210> where<00:05:55.449> some<00:05:55.810> of<00:05:55.930> the<00:05:55.990> rock<00:05:56.199> is<00:05:56.410> exposed<00:05:57.300> on

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
see where some of the rock is exposed on

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.980 
see where some of the rock is exposed on
top<00:05:58.599> of<00:05:58.810> the<00:05:59.400> thicker<00:06:00.400> rock<00:06:00.720> then<00:06:01.720> you<00:06:01.750> have

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
top of the thicker rock then you have

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.059 
top of the thicker rock then you have
grass<00:06:02.470> patches<00:06:03.039> growing<00:06:04.710> wherever<00:06:05.710> the<00:06:05.860> water

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:06.069 
grass patches growing wherever the water

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:09.300 
grass patches growing wherever the water
would<00:06:06.400> channel<00:06:06.699> through<00:06:07.740> just<00:06:08.740> to<00:06:08.860> try<00:06:09.009> to<00:06:09.039> get

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
would channel through just to try to get

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.749 
would channel through just to try to get
a<00:06:09.340> more<00:06:09.909> realistic<00:06:10.240> effect<00:06:10.539> I<00:06:11.490> think<00:06:12.490> it<00:06:12.610> looks

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:12.759 
a more realistic effect I think it looks

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:15.719 
a more realistic effect I think it looks
good<00:06:12.940> you<00:06:13.180> know<00:06:14.139> give<00:06:14.860> me<00:06:14.979> your<00:06:15.159> opinions<00:06:15.550> on

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729 
good you know give me your opinions on

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:20.219 
good you know give me your opinions on
it<00:06:17.190> and<00:06:18.190> I<00:06:18.460> still<00:06:19.150> have<00:06:19.300> to<00:06:19.419> do<00:06:19.569> the<00:06:19.720> bottom

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:20.229 
it and I still have to do the bottom

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:31.650 
it and I still have to do the bottom
section

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.720 

you
