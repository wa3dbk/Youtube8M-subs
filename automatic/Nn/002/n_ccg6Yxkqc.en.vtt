 L'orÃ©al 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:12.379
 pretty pitch that's like this 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:21.790

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.990
 finally as I showed you my 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.590
 makeup we are going to us accessories so 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.110
 I have earrings I know that 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.880

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.580
 euros at miss something naughty 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.790
 like that and of course the piece 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.210
 mistress of maintained to know this 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.740
 necklace that I had at the fair of paris 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.560
 last year it is on sale there 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.540
 was 50 euros so that's it 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.360
 the subject of this video the necklace to 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.550
 know that I simply find that 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.950
 we can have an outfit that would celebrate 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.880
 evening done by having 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.250
 accessories finally we are in an outfit 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.660
 very sober but there the accessory does not 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.360
 it's all all all all all element 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.010
 in this case I find that this necklace 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.270
 do absolutely everything in my outfit 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.160
 so I show you my dress anyway 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.540
 I still show it to you so that 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.630
 you see the whole so I wear 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.780
 this little bustier dress from h &amp; m 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.100
 that I had a few months ago which 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.959
 should have done between 15 and 20 hours 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.110
 worked months was not expensive at all 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.540
 so really an outfit that I find a 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.640
 still its effect despite the fact that 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.500
 the dress does not cost super super expensive 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.930
 this is a strapless dress there are 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.380
 I do not have a thing a little self-adhesive e 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.680
 for the chest and behind a buttock 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.470
 too much in fact 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.630
 if you will see 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.680
 and so here and with this outfit 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:57.160
 so here I am wearing just my 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.870
 black pumps you see them there but 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.570
 so here are black pumps all that 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.570
 the shell shirt polish at 20 euros 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.100
 and in case it's a little cool 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.959
 it was in force simply 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.090
 I planned a little vest like these 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:16.419
 which is in 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:20.250
 aso that I had years ago and 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:26.410
 which put income at around 8 euros 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:27.910
 so here we go the final set and I 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.770
 finds that immediately maintained 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.780
 raymond 6.6 eyes you do not see me 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.580
 keys but I think that 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.930
 maintained is still pretty chic 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:41.080
 that she does without being I have not 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.820
 too stuffy or anything here and 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.110
 to stay sober because I 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.800
 find that the necklace really does 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.540
 wow geo little bun all there is 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.950
 more simple so here are the girls 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.320
 with this video I really wanted 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.930
 to show you that I find in any case 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.550
 in my opinion we can have an outfit that 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.729
 is out of the ordinary for the holidays 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.340
 just betting on the accessory I 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.780
 to say the big necklace like that one 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.810
 find a little I can not say 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.639
 everywhere but even at claire's or 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.530
 accessories or that sort of thing there it 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.970
 there are big necklaces like that and I 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.000
 say that with a simple little dress 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.320
 bustier all there is more simple all 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.440
 right away it makes a little impression 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.580
 vest that can a little break the side 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.450
 Too much too much because I find 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.570
 with a blazer that would I actually like 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:32.050
 a bit too much so here I find that it 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:34.360
 it breaks a little bit and I find that 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.460
 it's just awesome 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.660
 So here we are, and I hope that 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.700
 you will have good holidays 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:43.090
 and then I hope it gives you 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.770
 ideas before 24 25 or even the 31st 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.599
 or a birthday can be a carrier 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.770
 so here I am making you big kisses 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:51.030
