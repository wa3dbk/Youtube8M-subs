you to do extra features on your Nexus 7
so<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.820> way<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.000> do<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.660> if<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.199> tap<00:00:22.619> on

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
so the way you do this is if you tap on

so the way you do this is if you tap on
settings<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.029> then<00:00:24.060> go<00:00:24.990> down<00:00:25.019> right<00:00:25.740> there

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
settings and then go down right there

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.609 
settings and then go down right there
you<00:00:26.160> will<00:00:26.220> see<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.550> says<00:00:26.789> developer<00:00:27.660> options

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619

you will see it says developer options
ok<00:00:29.580> by<00:00:29.730> default<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.390> won't<00:00:30.720> have<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.439> option

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
ok by default you won't have this option

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.540 
ok by default you won't have this option
and<00:00:32.930> on<00:00:33.930> your<00:00:34.110> Nexus<00:00:34.440> 7<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.160> what<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.399> do<00:00:35.520> is

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
and on your Nexus 7 so what you do is

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.000 
and on your Nexus 7 so what you do is
first<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.329> all<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.450> wanna<00:00:36.660> say<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.410> it

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.470 
seems kind of weird that end right did
it<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:41.250> way<00:00:41.489> because<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.059> kind<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.300> feels

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480

is you tap about this tablet and right
here<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.030> see<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.239> build<00:00:54.629> number<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.460> all

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
here you see the build number and all

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.529 
here you see the build number and all
you<00:00:56.610> have<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.879> do<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:58.219> tap<00:00:59.219> keep<00:00:59.940> tapping<00:01:00.000> on

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
you have to do is tap keep tapping on

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.080 
you have to do is tap keep tapping on
the<00:01:00.600> build<00:01:01.050> number<00:01:01.129> maybe<00:01:02.129> five<00:01:02.520> or<00:01:02.730> six<00:01:03.030> times

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
the build number maybe five or six times

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.980 
the build number maybe five or six times
and<00:01:03.650> it<00:01:04.650> will<00:01:04.830> say<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.760> are<00:01:05.790> now<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.210> developer

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
and it will say you are now a developer

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.100 
and it will say you are now a developer
and<00:01:07.220> I<00:01:08.220> believe<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:09.060> also<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.600> easiest

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
and I believe that is also the easiest

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.590 
and I believe that is also the easiest
way<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.320> becoming<00:01:10.740> developer<00:01:11.280> no<00:01:12.060> pun

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
way to becoming developer no pun

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.950 
way to becoming developer no pun
intended<00:01:13.369> so<00:01:14.369> after<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.880> just<00:01:14.909> go<00:01:15.720> back

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
intended so after that you just go back

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.340 
intended so after that you just go back
and<00:01:16.549> right<00:01:17.549> here<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.939> see<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.450> developer

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
and right here you see the developer

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.030 
and right here you see the developer
options<00:01:19.890> feature<00:01:21.350> right<00:01:22.350> there<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.890> if<00:01:22.950> you

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
options feature right there so if you

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.609 
options feature right there so if you
just<00:01:23.280> go<00:01:23.670> through<00:01:24.030> some<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.570> options<00:01:25.110> in

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
just go through some of the options in

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.870 
just go through some of the options in
the<00:01:25.680> developer<00:01:27.170> options<00:01:28.170> tab<00:01:28.500> then<00:01:29.460> right

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
the developer options tab then right

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.710 
the developer options tab then right
here<00:01:30.030> you'll<00:01:30.210> see<00:01:30.470> head<00:01:31.610> desktop<00:01:32.610> back<00:01:32.820> up<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
here you'll see head desktop back up the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.590 
here you'll see head desktop back up the
password<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.790> let<00:01:35.790> me<00:01:35.880> see<00:01:36.000> if<00:01:36.210> that's<00:01:36.420> a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
password and let me see if that's a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.550 
password and let me see if that's a
funny<00:01:36.869> one<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.079> can<00:01:37.380> show<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:38.150> show<00:01:39.150> GPU<00:01:40.020> view

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
funny one I can show you show GPU view

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.380 
funny one I can show you show GPU view
updates<00:01:41.720> show<00:01:42.720> GPU<00:01:43.500> overdraw<00:01:44.990> and<00:01:47.390> transition

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
updates show GPU overdraw and transition

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.520 
updates show GPU overdraw and transition
animation<00:01:49.140> scale<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.600> so<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:52.140> also<00:01:52.290> have

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
animation scale and so you also have

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.100 
animation scale and so you also have
window<00:01:52.950> animation<00:01:53.880> scale<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.600> again

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
window animation scale and again

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.550 
window animation scale and again
transition<00:01:55.860> animation<00:01:56.460> scale<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.939> animator

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
transition animation scale and animator

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.039 
transition animation scale and animator
duration<00:01:58.560> scale<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.670> if<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.420> just<00:02:00.600> tap<00:02:01.020> on

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
duration scale so if you just tap on

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.980 
duration scale so if you just tap on
window<00:02:01.530> animation<00:02:02.159> scale<00:02:02.600> you'll<00:02:03.600> see<00:02:03.810> right

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
window animation scale you'll see right

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.550 
window animation scale you'll see right
here<00:02:04.110> it's<00:02:04.259> set<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.469> one<00:02:04.890> time<00:02:05.630> it<00:02:06.630> won't<00:02:06.840> slow

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
here it's set to one time it won't slow

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.479 
here it's set to one time it won't slow
down<00:02:07.590> or<00:02:08.099> speed<00:02:08.670> up<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.149> animation<00:02:10.280> so<00:02:11.280> that's

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
down or speed up the animation so that's

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.090 
down or speed up the animation so that's
basically<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:12.209> so<00:02:13.200> we<00:02:13.290> have<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.470> bunch<00:02:13.800> of

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
basically that so we have a bunch of

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.960 
basically that so we have a bunch of
shins<00:02:14.370> in<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.940> developer<00:02:15.830> options<00:02:16.830> menu<00:02:17.130> so

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
shins in the developer options menu so

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.340 
shins in the developer options menu so
that's<00:02:18.150> basically<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.630> thank<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.260> are

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
that's basically it thank you are
