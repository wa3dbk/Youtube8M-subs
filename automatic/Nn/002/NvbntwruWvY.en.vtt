of the show that way the music in the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.969 
of the show that way the music in the
resource<00:01:06.510> pack<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:07.020> trigger<00:01:07.290> properly

sometimes<00:01:08.490> if<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.030> get<00:01:09.210> there<00:01:09.420> while<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
sometimes if you get there while the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.030 
sometimes if you get there while the
show's<00:01:09.900> running<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.409> might<00:01:10.590> not<00:01:10.680> trigger

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
show's running it might not trigger

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.100 
show's running it might not trigger
sometimes<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.970> will<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.659> seems<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.960> be<00:01:12.990> a

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
sometimes it will it seems to be a

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.530 
sometimes it will it seems to be a
little<00:01:13.229> finicky<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.890> way<00:01:14.119> so<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.390> always

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
little finicky that way so it's always

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.999 
little finicky that way so it's always
safest<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.320> make<00:01:16.500> sure<00:01:16.650> you're<00:01:16.799> there<00:01:16.830> a

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
Tower of Terror is a very complex ride

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.859 
Tower of Terror is a very complex ride
this<00:01:41.009> all<00:01:41.220> uses<00:01:41.670> an<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:41.970> game<00:01:42.180> mechanic<00:01:42.659> called

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
this all uses an in game mechanic called

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.350 
this all uses an in game mechanic called
redstone<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:44.369> red<00:01:44.520> stone<00:01:44.759> for<00:01:45.000> tower<00:01:45.180> of

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
redstone and the red stone for tower of

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.330 
redstone and the red stone for tower of
terror<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.780> just<00:01:46.020> very<00:01:46.439> very<00:01:46.619> vast<00:01:47.040> and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
terror is just very very vast and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.010 
terror is just very very vast and
complex<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.360> there<00:01:48.540> are<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.659> lot<00:01:48.990> of

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
complex and so there are a lot of

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.870 
complex and so there are a lot of
opportunities<00:01:49.799> for<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.189> attraction<00:01:50.790> to

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
opportunities for the attraction to

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.700 
opportunities for the attraction to
break<00:01:51.060> down<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.869> if<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.140> go<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.380> Tower<00:01:52.680> of

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
break down so if you go to Tower of

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.520 
break down so if you go to Tower of
