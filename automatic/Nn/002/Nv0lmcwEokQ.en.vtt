00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
think we feel that deep responsibility

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.180 
think we feel that deep responsibility
to<00:04:12.810> harness<00:04:13.170> that<00:04:13.349> win<00:04:13.620> in<00:04:13.739> our<00:04:13.829> country's

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
to harness that win in our country's

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
history have we been able to actually

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.319 
history have we been able to actually
just<00:04:15.810> completely<00:04:16.470> start<00:04:16.799> over<00:04:16.950> with<00:04:17.880> an<00:04:18.060> urban

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
just completely start over with an urban

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.330 
just completely start over with an urban
school<00:04:18.510> system<00:04:18.930> that<00:04:19.079> was<00:04:19.229> arguably<00:04:20.010> one<00:04:20.220> of

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
school system that was arguably one of

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.960 
school system that was arguably one of
the<00:04:20.489> lowest<00:04:21.299> performing<00:04:21.750> in<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.930> country<00:04:22.970> you

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
the lowest performing in the country you

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.580 
the lowest performing in the country you
know<00:04:24.000> this<00:04:24.240> is<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.389> once<00:04:24.660> in<00:04:24.750> a<00:04:24.840> lifetime<00:04:25.050> chance

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
know this is a once in a lifetime chance

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.320 
know this is a once in a lifetime chance

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:28.649 
for young men I see so much potential in

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:30.409 
for young men I see so much potential in
them<00:05:28.800> and<00:05:28.979> they<00:05:29.159> just<00:05:29.399> don't<00:05:29.579> realize<00:05:30.029> it

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
them and they just don't realize it

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:32.269 
them and they just don't realize it
but<00:05:30.749> if<00:05:30.839> I<00:05:30.989> can<00:05:31.199> be<00:05:31.229> that<00:05:31.349> teacher<00:05:31.800> and<00:05:31.979> teach

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159 
them then you know it would be a better

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:44.889

City

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:44.899 

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:47.869 

honestly<00:05:45.899> without<00:05:46.409> Hurricane<00:05:47.129> Katrina<00:05:47.520> I

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:47.879 
honestly without Hurricane Katrina I

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:49.909 
honestly without Hurricane Katrina I
don't<00:05:48.539> think<00:05:48.749> I<00:05:48.839> would<00:05:49.020> be<00:05:49.050> the<00:05:49.289> same<00:05:49.439> person

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
don't think I would be the same person

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:52.939 
don't think I would be the same person
because<00:05:50.459> the<00:05:51.149> hardships<00:05:51.749> actually<00:05:52.529> helped

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949 
because the hardships actually helped

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:56.510 
because the hardships actually helped
mold<00:05:53.729> me<00:05:54.089> into<00:05:54.559> the<00:05:55.559> young<00:05:55.709> lady<00:05:56.009> that<00:05:56.099> I<00:05:56.279> am

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
mold me into the young lady that I am

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.510 
mold me into the young lady that I am
now<00:05:56.759> so<00:05:57.689> it's<00:05:57.869> like<00:05:57.959> without<00:05:58.800> Katrina

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
now so it's like without Katrina

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.689 
now so it's like without Katrina
without<00:05:59.819> losing<00:06:00.300> a<00:06:00.479> lot<00:06:00.809> of<00:06:01.379> my<00:06:01.800> things<00:06:02.369> my

without losing a lot of my things my

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:07.639 
without losing a lot of my things my
family<00:06:02.939> I<00:06:03.449> wouldn't<00:06:04.110> be<00:06:04.289> Who<00:06:04.409> I<00:06:04.469> am<00:06:04.589> I<00:06:04.979> would
