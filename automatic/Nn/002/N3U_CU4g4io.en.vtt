received a big increase in funding now
first<00:00:47.640> before<00:00:47.760> we<00:00:47.940> get<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.180> those<00:00:48.300> increases

talked about what's being cut because

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.020

of<00:00:56.250> our<00:00:56.340> own<00:00:56.610> planet<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.899> not<00:00:58.109> just<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.500> random

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
of our own planet is not just a random

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.160 
of our own planet is not just a random
inclusion<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.090> seems<00:01:00.359> politically<00:01:01.020> motivated

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
inclusion it seems politically motivated

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.680 
inclusion it seems politically motivated
it<00:01:01.620> seems<00:01:01.859> like<00:01:02.100> because<00:01:02.460> that's<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
it seems like because that's one of the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.600 
it seems like because that's one of the
the<00:01:04.019> scientific<00:01:04.500> organizations<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
the scientific organizations the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.890 
the scientific organizations the
executive<00:01:06.030> departments<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.689> would

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
executive departments that would

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.050 
executive departments that would
investigate<00:01:07.680> climate<00:01:08.369> change<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.909> things

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
investigate climate change and things

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.060 
investigate climate change and things
like<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.479> by<00:01:10.020> putting<00:01:10.229> satellites<00:01:10.560> up<00:01:10.979> in

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
like that by putting satellites up in

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.219 
like that by putting satellites up in
the<00:01:11.220> sky<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.790> studying<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.390> distribution<00:01:12.750> of

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
the sky and studying the distribution of

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.870 
the sky and studying the distribution of
things<00:01:13.500> around<00:01:13.860> our<00:01:13.950> planet<00:01:14.100> right<00:01:14.400> that's

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
things around our planet right that's

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.370 
things around our planet right that's
gonna<00:01:15.119> receive<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.509> cut<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.840> that's<00:01:15.990> probably

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
gonna receive a cut and that's probably

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.469 
gonna receive a cut and that's probably
not<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.830> coincidence<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.820> let's<00:01:18.119> talk<00:01:18.240> about

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
not a coincidence so let's talk about

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.210 
not a coincidence so let's talk about
some<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.659> those<00:01:18.780> cuts<00:01:19.020> more<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.409> detail<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
some of those cuts more in detail the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.770 
some of those cuts more in detail the
republican-controlled<00:01:20.670> committee<00:01:21.420> wants<00:01:21.689> to

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
cut about 265 million dollars from NASA

NASA's earth science program the bill
doesn't<00:01:27.210> specify<00:01:27.450> where<00:01:27.869> all<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.439> those<00:01:28.560> cuts

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
doesn't specify where all of those cuts

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.620 
doesn't specify where all of those cuts
would<00:01:29.130> come<00:01:29.340> from<00:01:29.490> but<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.119> does<00:01:30.329> eliminate

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
would come from but it does eliminate

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.990 
would come from but it does eliminate

photos of Earth's surface will run out
of<00:01:41.009> fuel<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.390> seems<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.720> possibly

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
of fuel and so that seems like possibly

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.810 
of fuel and so that seems like possibly
significant<00:01:43.799> if<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.950> want<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:44.490> an<00:01:44.670> eye

it's in their name basically that is

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
would seriously reduce our earth science

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.749 
would seriously reduce our earth science
program<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.040> threaten<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.399> set<00:02:05.640> back

to earthquakes droughts and

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.360 
to earthquakes droughts and
and<00:02:14.330> that<00:02:14.420> especially<00:02:14.900> seems<00:02:15.230> very<00:02:16.040> relevant

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
and that especially seems very relevant

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.979 
and that especially seems very relevant
right<00:02:16.700> now<00:02:16.849> I<00:02:16.879> heard<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.599> Nepal<00:02:17.870> earthquake

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
right now I heard the Nepal earthquake

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.809 
right now I heard the Nepal earthquake
the<00:02:18.500> California<00:02:18.980> drought<00:02:19.159> seems<00:02:19.519> like<00:02:19.670> this

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
the California drought seems like this

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.479 
the California drought seems like this
is<00:02:19.879> something<00:02:20.209> we<00:02:20.450> might<00:02:20.629> need<00:02:21.019> yeah<00:02:21.560> yeah<00:02:22.280> and

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
is something we might need yeah yeah and

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.670 
is something we might need yeah yeah and
so<00:02:22.670> they<00:02:23.330> might<00:02:23.569> see<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:23.959> as<00:02:24.080> just<00:02:24.349> well<00:02:24.530> you

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
so they might see it as just well you

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.320 
so they might see it as just well you
know<00:02:24.769> we<00:02:24.980> think<00:02:25.310> it's<00:02:25.459> a<00:02:25.580> waste<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:25.970> money<00:02:26.120> to

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
know we think it's a waste of money to

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.699 
know we think it's a waste of money to
study<00:02:26.480> climate<00:02:26.780> change<00:02:27.230> but<00:02:27.409> there's<00:02:27.590> gonna

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
study climate change but there's gonna

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:28.780 
study climate change but there's gonna
be<00:02:27.830> a<00:02:27.860> lot<00:02:27.980> of<00:02:28.010> other<00:02:28.220> things<00:02:28.430> that<00:02:28.519> sort<00:02:28.640> of

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
be a lot of other things that sort of

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.550 
be a lot of other things that sort of
caught<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.269> crossfire<00:02:29.720> like<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.290> study<00:02:30.500> of

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
caught the crossfire like the study of

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.800 
caught the crossfire like the study of
drought<00:02:31.280> earthquakes<00:02:31.910> hurricanes<00:02:32.180> other

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
drought earthquakes hurricanes other

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.780 
drought earthquakes hurricanes other
natural<00:02:33.260> disaster<00:02:33.950> this<00:02:34.129> week<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:34.489> climate

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
natural disaster this week that climate

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.339 
natural disaster this week that climate
change<00:02:35.000> was<00:02:35.269> a<00:02:35.299> national<00:02:35.870> security<00:02:36.049> threat

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
change was a national security threat

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.339 
change was a national security threat
exactly<00:02:37.280> but<00:02:38.030> I<00:02:38.060> personally<00:02:38.569> don't<00:02:38.750> believe

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
exactly but I personally don't believe

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.990 
exactly but I personally don't believe
in<00:02:39.560> droughts<00:02:39.860> or<00:02:40.099> earthquakes<00:02:42.400> so<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:43.760> don't

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
in droughts or earthquakes so I don't

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.270 
in droughts or earthquakes so I don't
like<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.299> boosting<00:02:44.840> these<00:02:45.049> falsehoods<00:02:45.620> on

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
like you boosting these falsehoods on

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.520 
like you boosting these falsehoods on
the<00:02:46.579> think<00:02:46.760> tank<00:02:46.940> audience<00:02:47.269> so<00:02:48.079> that<00:02:48.230> is<00:02:48.379> the

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
the think tank audience so that is the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.920 
the think tank audience so that is the
bad<00:02:48.709> side<00:02:49.010> but<00:02:49.280> there<00:02:49.459> is<00:02:49.579> some<00:02:49.819> good<00:02:50.120> some

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
bad side but there is some good some

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.869 
bad side but there is some good some
stuff<00:02:51.440> that<00:02:51.560> NASA<00:02:51.769> was<00:02:52.069> not<00:02:52.220> expecting<00:02:52.730> or

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
stuff that NASA was not expecting or

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.520 
stuff that NASA was not expecting or
that<00:02:53.150> provides<00:02:53.510> more<00:02:53.720> funding<00:02:54.170> than<00:02:54.200> in

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
that provides more funding than in

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.319 
that provides more funding than in
Obama's<00:02:54.980> version<00:02:55.310> of<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.459> bill<00:02:55.579> so<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.209> bill

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
Obama's version of the bill so the bill

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:57.940 
Obama's version of the bill so the bill
provides<00:02:56.660> nearly<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:57.019> two<00:02:57.290> hundred<00:02:57.650> million

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
provides nearly a two hundred million

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.280 
provides nearly a two hundred million
dollar<00:02:58.340> boost<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.940> planetary<00:02:59.450> science<00:02:59.930> as<00:03:00.079> we

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
dollar boost to planetary science as we

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.869 
dollar boost to planetary science as we
pointed<00:03:00.530> out<00:03:00.620> earlier<00:03:00.650> which<00:03:01.430> is<00:03:01.459> a<00:03:01.579> study<00:03:01.760> of

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
pointed out earlier which is a study of

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.880 
pointed out earlier which is a study of
other<00:03:02.120> planets<00:03:02.629> that's<00:03:02.810> significant<00:03:03.379> the

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
other planets that's significant the

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.710 
other planets that's significant the
bill<00:03:04.040> would<00:03:04.160> also<00:03:04.280> create<00:03:04.579> an<00:03:04.790> ocean<00:03:05.239> world's

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
bill would also create an ocean world's

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720

Ganymede and Saturn's moon Enceladus I

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.119 
Ganymede and Saturn's moon Enceladus I
believe<00:03:14.930> that's<00:03:15.079> pronounced<00:03:15.349> I<00:03:15.590> could<00:03:16.040> be

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
believe that's pronounced I could be

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.789 
believe that's pronounced I could be
getting<00:03:16.250> that<00:03:16.400> one<00:03:16.609> salad<00:03:17.120> us<00:03:17.660> I<00:03:18.049> don't<00:03:18.650> even

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
getting that one salad us I don't even

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.860 
getting that one salad us I don't even
really<00:03:19.130> like<00:03:19.370> salad<00:03:20.030> right<00:03:20.239> I<00:03:20.480> think<00:03:20.660> that's<00:03:20.780> a

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
really like salad right I think that's a

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.809 
really like salad right I think that's a
waste<00:03:21.019> of<00:03:21.230> money<00:03:21.470> but<00:03:22.370> look<00:03:22.549> if<00:03:22.669> you're

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
waste of money but look if you're

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.670 
waste of money but look if you're
looking<00:03:23.150> for<00:03:23.389> life<00:03:23.630> on<00:03:23.870> other<00:03:24.049> planets<00:03:24.169> or

looking for life on other planets or
another<00:03:24.950> moons<00:03:25.130> this<00:03:25.280> is<00:03:25.400> a<00:03:25.430> significant

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
another moons this is a significant

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.400 
another moons this is a significant
possible<00:03:26.359> place<00:03:26.540> to<00:03:26.569> find<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:27.079> so<00:03:27.230> that's

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
possible place to find it so that's

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.110 
possible place to find it so that's
certainly<00:03:27.560> good<00:03:27.889> right<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:28.609> so<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:28.760> think<00:03:28.910> we

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
certainly good right and so I think we

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.210 
certainly good right and so I think we
kind<00:03:29.329> of<00:03:29.359> like<00:03:29.590> went<00:03:30.590> into<00:03:30.799> the<00:03:30.889> other<00:03:31.010> the

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
kind of like went into the other the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.819 
kind of like went into the other the
first<00:03:31.400> point<00:03:31.639> of<00:03:31.819> the<00:03:32.780> damage<00:03:33.440> that<00:03:33.470> can<00:03:33.769> be

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
first point of the damage that can be

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.650 
first point of the damage that can be
done<00:03:34.130> if<00:03:34.489> you<00:03:34.519> cut<00:03:34.910> some<00:03:35.209> of<00:03:35.329> the<00:03:35.480> earth

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
done if you cut some of the earth

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.979 
done if you cut some of the earth
science<00:03:36.519> programs<00:03:37.519> so<00:03:38.150> that<00:03:38.389> kind<00:03:38.630> of<00:03:38.690> that

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
science programs so that kind of that

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.990 
science programs so that kind of that
kind<00:03:39.049> of<00:03:39.290> bums<00:03:39.530> me<00:03:39.739> out<00:03:39.769> and<00:03:40.220> you<00:03:40.730> know<00:03:40.819> then

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
kind of bums me out and you know then

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.009 
kind of bums me out and you know then
you're<00:03:41.090> like<00:03:41.209> people<00:03:41.540> why<00:03:41.630> are<00:03:41.660> they<00:03:41.810> putting

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
you're like people why are they putting

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.819 
you're like people why are they putting
so<00:03:42.139> much<00:03:42.560> money<00:03:42.620> into<00:03:43.540> exploring<00:03:44.540> other<00:03:44.989> you

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
so much money into exploring other you

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.379 
so much money into exploring other you
know<00:03:45.950> planets<00:03:46.639> that<00:03:46.880> you're<00:03:47.000> before<00:03:47.329> you

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
know planets that you're before you

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:49.420 
know planets that you're before you
don't<00:03:47.510> even<00:03:47.599> understand<00:03:48.049> ours<00:03:48.349> yes<00:03:48.859> um<00:03:49.069> and<00:03:49.400> so

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
don't even understand ours yes um and so

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.800 
don't even understand ours yes um and so
I'm<00:03:49.700> excited<00:03:50.120> that<00:03:50.150> they're<00:03:50.329> you<00:03:50.389> are<00:03:50.510> putting

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
I'm excited that they're you are putting

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.030 
I'm excited that they're you are putting
money<00:03:50.989> in<00:03:51.200> because<00:03:51.380> I<00:03:51.530> do<00:03:51.590> think<00:03:51.919> that's

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
money in because I do think that's

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.039 
money in because I do think that's
important<00:03:52.669> but<00:03:53.090> then<00:03:53.239> it<00:03:53.389> makes<00:03:53.540> me<00:03:53.750> think

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
important but then it makes me think

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.080 
important but then it makes me think
because<00:03:54.680> I<00:03:54.709> feel<00:03:55.040> like<00:03:55.069> the<00:03:55.370> government<00:03:55.549> knows

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
because I feel like the government knows

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.289 
because I feel like the government knows
more<00:03:56.510> about<00:03:56.540> these<00:03:57.400> external<00:03:58.400> creatures<00:03:59.030> than

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
more about these external creatures than

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.300 
more about these external creatures than
we<00:03:59.530> extraterrestrial<00:04:00.530> creatures<00:04:00.919> than<00:04:01.160> we

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
we extraterrestrial creatures than we

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.490 
we extraterrestrial creatures than we
think<00:04:01.940> so<00:04:02.480> if<00:04:02.569> there<00:04:02.720> are<00:04:02.900> willing<00:04:03.230> to<00:04:03.349> put

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
think so if there are willing to put

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.259 
think so if there are willing to put
more<00:04:03.590> money<00:04:03.799> if<00:04:03.919> it's<00:04:04.069> passing<00:04:04.519> that<00:04:05.060> means

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
more money if it's passing that means

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.830 
more money if it's passing that means
they<00:04:05.540> exist<00:04:06.519> maybe<00:04:07.519> they<00:04:08.150> don't<00:04:08.299> want<00:04:08.660> us<00:04:08.810> to

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
they exist maybe they don't want us to

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.599 
they exist maybe they don't want us to
find<00:04:09.139> intelligent<00:04:09.410> life<00:04:09.709> outside<00:04:10.220> of

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
find intelligent life outside of

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.400 
find intelligent life outside of
humanity<00:04:10.849> and<00:04:11.209> they<00:04:11.359> know<00:04:11.569> that<00:04:11.599> it's<00:04:11.959> already

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
humanity and they know that it's already

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.460 
humanity and they know that it's already
here<00:04:13.099> that's<00:04:14.030> why<00:04:14.239> they've<00:04:14.419> defunded<00:04:14.900> it<00:04:15.019> that

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
here that's why they've defunded it that

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.439 
here that's why they've defunded it that
could<00:04:15.590> be<00:04:15.650> possible<00:04:16.039> or<00:04:16.340> it<00:04:16.669> could<00:04:16.880> be<00:04:17.060> that

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
could be possible or it could be that

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:19.479 
could be possible or it could be that
they're<00:04:17.599> gonna<00:04:17.750> suggest<00:04:17.989> hey<00:04:18.349> Obama<00:04:18.620> you<00:04:19.130> love

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
they're gonna suggest hey Obama you love

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.789 
they're gonna suggest hey Obama you love
science<00:04:19.849> we're<00:04:20.630> gonna<00:04:20.780> go<00:04:20.989> investigate<00:04:21.289> this

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
science we're gonna go investigate this

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.740 
science we're gonna go investigate this
moon<00:04:22.010> of<00:04:22.159> Jupiter<00:04:22.490> why<00:04:22.940> don't<00:04:23.150> you<00:04:23.330> go<00:04:23.570> with

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
moon of Jupiter why don't you go with

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.420 
moon of Jupiter why don't you go with
them<00:04:23.780> or<00:04:24.380> they<00:04:25.370> already<00:04:25.580> know<00:04:25.880> that

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
them or they already know that

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.670 
them or they already know that
intelligent<00:04:26.880> life<00:04:26.910> exists<00:04:27.780> on<00:04:27.900> earth<00:04:28.289> and

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
intelligent life exists on earth and

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.499 
intelligent life exists on earth and
they<00:04:28.919> want<00:04:29.130> to<00:04:29.190> cut<00:04:29.370> their<00:04:29.550> funding<00:04:29.820> for<00:04:30.419> earth

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:30.509 
they want to cut their funding for earth

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
science programs that could be it I

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.100 
science programs that could be it I
haven't<00:04:33.120> really<00:04:33.270> come<00:04:33.449> across<00:04:33.570> that<00:04:33.990> much

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
haven't really come across that much

intelligent<00:04:35.039> life<00:04:35.820> on<00:04:36.000> earth<00:04:36.259> now<00:04:37.259> there's

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
intelligent life on earth now there's

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.260 
intelligent life on earth now there's
one<00:04:37.710> other<00:04:37.740> big<00:04:38.130> addition<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.699> biggest<00:04:39.030> bump

like climate change I know it's a delay

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.029 
like climate change I know it's a delay
some<00:05:03.630> of<00:05:03.750> that's<00:05:03.960> Bush<00:05:04.289> so<00:05:04.380> we<00:05:04.500> don't<00:05:04.680> have<00:05:04.830> to

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
some of that's Bush so we don't have to

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.249 
some of that's Bush so we don't have to
like<00:05:05.220> try<00:05:05.400> to<00:05:05.490> see<00:05:05.759> it's<00:05:05.880> really<00:05:06.060> odds<00:05:06.330> on<00:05:06.630> more

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
like try to see it's really odds on more

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:09.830 
like try to see it's really odds on more
cutting<00:05:08.009> for<00:05:08.610> people<00:05:08.820> we<00:05:09.330> have<00:05:09.509> cut

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
cutting for people we have cut

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.260 
cutting for people we have cut
the<00:05:09.870> firing<00:05:10.380> society<00:05:11.190> that's<00:05:11.340> getting<00:05:11.699> it<00:05:11.820> so

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
the firing society that's getting it so

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.969 
the firing society that's getting it so
it's<00:05:12.539> gonna<00:05:12.750> happen<00:05:13.139> so<00:05:13.320> we<00:05:13.440> better<00:05:13.620> get<00:05:13.860> off

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
it's gonna happen so we better get off

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.980 
it's gonna happen so we better get off
this<00:05:14.009> planet<00:05:14.460> as<00:05:14.550> fast<00:05:14.759> as<00:05:14.880> we<00:05:15.000> can<00:05:15.180> so<00:05:15.509> go

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
this planet as fast as we can so go

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.950 
this planet as fast as we can so go
ahead<00:05:16.289> SLS<00:05:16.860> maybe<00:05:17.190> then<00:05:18.120> climate<00:05:18.509> change<00:05:18.780> and

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
ahead SLS maybe then climate change and

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.360 
ahead SLS maybe then climate change and
they<00:05:19.020> know<00:05:19.229> it's<00:05:19.440> just<00:05:19.590> like<00:05:19.740> a<00:05:19.830> lost<00:05:20.130> cause

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
they know it's just like a lost cause

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.680 
they know it's just like a lost cause
and<00:05:20.400> that's<00:05:20.789> why<00:05:21.000> they<00:05:21.180> want<00:05:21.389> it's<00:05:21.539> why

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
and that's why they want it's why

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.629 
and that's why they want it's why
there's<00:05:21.900> so<00:05:22.080> many<00:05:22.259> emergency<00:05:23.009> I<00:05:23.039> really<00:05:23.430> want

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
there's so many emergency I really want

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.089 
there's so many emergency I really want
to<00:05:23.729> know<00:05:23.880> where<00:05:24.720> where<00:05:25.139> our<00:05:25.320> audience<00:05:25.500> lives

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 
to know where where our audience lives

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:27.830 
to know where where our audience lives
but<00:05:26.340> all<00:05:26.520> of<00:05:26.639> my<00:05:26.789> theories<00:05:27.150> you<00:05:27.570> know<00:05:27.690> look

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
but all of my theories you know look

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.029 
but all of my theories you know look
this<00:05:27.960> is<00:05:28.080> obviously<00:05:28.470> this<00:05:28.560> is<00:05:28.650> a<00:05:28.710> complicated

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
this is obviously this is a complicated

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.159 
this is obviously this is a complicated
issue<00:05:29.430> does<00:05:29.759> not<00:05:29.789> cut<00:05:30.150> and<00:05:30.240> dried<00:05:30.479> I<00:05:30.720> mean<00:05:30.900> look

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
issue does not cut and dried I mean look

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.290 
issue does not cut and dried I mean look
I<00:05:31.320> want<00:05:31.710> us<00:05:31.800> to<00:05:31.949> study<00:05:32.190> the<00:05:32.490> earth<00:05:32.669> more<00:05:33.000> I<00:05:33.030> also

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
I want us to study the earth more I also

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.060 
I want us to study the earth more I also
want<00:05:33.659> us<00:05:33.750> to<00:05:33.870> study<00:05:34.080> other<00:05:34.320> planets<00:05:34.860> more

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
want us to study other planets more

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.040 
want us to study other planets more
there's<00:05:35.610> a<00:05:35.760> limited<00:05:36.180> amount<00:05:36.300> of<00:05:36.510> money<00:05:36.570> that

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
there's a limited amount of money that

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.320 
there's a limited amount of money that
we've<00:05:37.190> decided<00:05:38.190> we're<00:05:38.580> going<00:05:38.760> to<00:05:38.849> put<00:05:39.060> towards

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
we've decided we're going to put towards

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.640 
we've decided we're going to put towards
this<00:05:39.389> sort<00:05:39.630> of<00:05:39.690> endeavor<00:05:40.020> so<00:05:40.289> how<00:05:40.440> do<00:05:40.500> you

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
this sort of endeavor so how do you

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.020 
this sort of endeavor so how do you
distribute<00:05:41.010> it

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
distribute it

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.360 
distribute it
I<00:05:42.090> don't<00:05:42.720> trust<00:05:43.139> their<00:05:43.530> motivations<00:05:44.159> and

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
I don't trust their motivations and

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.149 
I don't trust their motivations and
cutting<00:05:44.580> the<00:05:44.669> earth<00:05:44.760> science<00:05:45.180> programs<00:05:45.539> but

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:46.159 
cutting the earth science programs but

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:48.439 
cutting the earth science programs but
Obama<00:05:47.159> also<00:05:47.400> didn't<00:05:47.760> provide<00:05:47.970> as<00:05:48.120> much<00:05:48.240> money

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:48.449 
Obama also didn't provide as much money

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:50.180 
Obama also didn't provide as much money
to<00:05:48.630> some<00:05:48.810> of<00:05:48.930> them<00:05:49.050> so<00:05:49.260> maybe<00:05:49.830> there's<00:05:50.099> a

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
to some of them so maybe there's a

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.890 
to some of them so maybe there's a
little<00:05:50.610> bit<00:05:50.699> of<00:05:50.729> blame<00:05:51.000> on<00:05:51.180> both<00:05:51.210> sides<00:05:51.630> there

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
little bit of blame on both sides there

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.990 
little bit of blame on both sides there
but<00:05:52.530> anyway<00:05:52.710> again<00:05:53.039> this<00:05:53.280> is<00:05:53.460> just<00:05:53.580> past<00:05:53.820> the

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
but anyway again this is just past the

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.999 
but anyway again this is just past the
house<00:05:54.180> it<00:05:54.570> has<00:05:54.930> not<00:05:55.139> passed<00:05:55.409> the<00:05:55.590> Senate<00:05:55.889> as

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:56.009 
house it has not passed the Senate as

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:57.589 
house it has not passed the Senate as
well<00:05:56.190> they<00:05:56.400> have<00:05:56.550> to<00:05:56.669> do<00:05:56.789> their<00:05:56.940> version<00:05:57.180> and

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:57.599 
well they have to do their version and

00:05:57.599 --> 00:05:59.240 
well they have to do their version and
we'll<00:05:57.720> see<00:05:57.930> what<00:05:58.139> we<00:05:58.229> get<00:05:58.409> out<00:05:58.440> of<00:05:58.680> out<00:05:58.889> of<00:05:58.949> that

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
we'll see what we get out of out of that

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.159 
we'll see what we get out of out of that
and<00:05:59.699> if<00:06:00.330> we're<00:06:00.449> gonna<00:06:00.539> end<00:06:00.690> up<00:06:00.720> at<00:06:00.840> Mars<00:06:00.990> any

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
and if we're gonna end up at Mars any

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.140 
and if we're gonna end up at Mars any
time<00:06:01.289> soon<00:06:01.440> let<00:06:01.919> me<00:06:01.979> know<00:06:02.070> you<00:06:02.130> think<00:06:02.220> about

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
time soon let me know you think about

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.700 
time soon let me know you think about
these<00:06:03.419> priorities<00:06:04.139> would<00:06:04.380> you<00:06:04.560> have

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
these priorities would you have

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:05.990 
these priorities would you have
distributed<00:06:05.190> the<00:06:05.250> money<00:06:05.370> in<00:06:05.669> a<00:06:05.759> slightly

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
distributed the money in a slightly

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.520 
distributed the money in a slightly
different<00:06:06.090> way<00:06:06.539> let<00:06:06.930> us<00:06:07.020> know<00:06:07.110> the<00:06:07.229> details
