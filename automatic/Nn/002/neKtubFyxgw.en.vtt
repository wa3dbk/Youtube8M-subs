00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.919 
there like a few days back and I
literally<00:00:29.490> thought<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:29.939> had<00:00:30.240> gotten<00:00:30.480> some

Easter eggs but I guess I had left those
behind<00:00:33.870> or<00:00:34.020> something<00:00:34.170> cuz<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.590> don't<00:00:34.649> have

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040

them<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.820> literally<00:00:36.270> thought<00:00:36.660> I'd<00:00:36.840> flop

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
them and I literally thought I'd flop
