front of the seven car

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.460 
front of the seven car
we<00:01:44.090> really<00:01:44.360> haven't<00:01:44.540> seen<00:01:44.840> here<00:01:45.050> this<00:01:45.230> with

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
we really haven't seen here this with

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.560 
we really haven't seen here this with
this<00:01:45.650> particular<00:01:46.220> car<00:01:46.700> that<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.120> middle<00:01:47.450> was

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
this particular car that the middle was

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.210 
this particular car that the middle was
a<00:01:47.600> great<00:01:48.020> place<00:01:48.290> to<00:01:48.320> be<00:01:48.560> but<00:01:48.710> it<00:01:48.830> seems<00:01:49.040> to<00:01:49.100> be

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
a great place to be but it seems to be

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.800 
a great place to be but it seems to be
coming<00:01:49.400> back<00:01:49.700> maybe<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.120> speeds<00:01:50.420> have<00:01:50.540> gotten

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
coming back maybe the speeds have gotten

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.750 
coming back maybe the speeds have gotten
slower<00:01:51.080> and<00:01:51.350> that's<00:01:51.890> going<00:01:52.160> to<00:01:52.220> allow<00:01:52.370> them<00:01:52.610> as

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
slower and that's going to allow them as

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.700 
slower and that's going to allow them as
you<00:01:52.850> can<00:01:52.910> see<00:01:53.150> David<00:01:54.080> Reutimann<00:01:54.440> and<00:01:54.560> Greg

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
you cannot bump crap and stay hooked up

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.919 
you cannot bump crap and stay hooked up
in<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.550> corners<00:02:08.030> they<00:02:08.149> were<00:02:08.210> concerned<00:02:08.720> about

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
in the corners they were concerned about

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.630 
in the corners they were concerned about
safety<00:02:09.320> yeah<00:02:09.649> one<00:02:09.830> thing<00:02:10.009> that<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.250> drivers

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
safety yeah one thing that the drivers

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.770 
safety yeah one thing that the drivers
have<00:02:10.790> figured<00:02:11.060> out<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.300> last<00:02:11.450> couple<00:02:11.750> of

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
have figured out the last couple of

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.180 
have figured out the last couple of
times<00:02:12.020> here<00:02:12.170> we<00:02:12.320> see<00:02:12.470> him<00:02:12.530> go<00:02:12.709> three<00:02:12.950> and<00:02:12.980> four

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
times here we see him go three and four

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.240 
times here we see him go three and four
wide<00:02:13.430> getting<00:02:13.820> into<00:02:14.000> turn<00:02:14.209> one

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
wide getting into turn one

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.400 
wide getting into turn one
is<00:02:15.400> that<00:02:15.700> if<00:02:15.850> you<00:02:15.970> can<00:02:16.120> put<00:02:16.330> your<00:02:16.540> front<00:02:17.230> bumper

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
is that if you can put your front bumper

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.170 
is that if you can put your front bumper
on<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.740> guy<00:02:17.860> in<00:02:17.920> front<00:02:18.130> two<00:02:18.400> cars<00:02:18.700> can<00:02:19.000> just

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
on the guy in front two cars can just

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.570 
on the guy in front two cars can just
basically<00:02:19.630> hook<00:02:20.110> up<00:02:20.290> exactly<00:02:20.890> as<00:02:21.010> one<00:02:21.280> and

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
basically hook up exactly as one and

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.850 
basically hook up exactly as one and
take<00:02:22.060> off<00:02:22.300> like<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.570> rocket<00:02:22.720> ship<00:02:23.170> if<00:02:23.590> they<00:02:23.710> can

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
take off like a rocket ship if they can

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.530 
take off like a rocket ship if they can
do<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:23.980> all<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.520> way<00:02:24.610> around<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:25.000> track<00:02:25.240> and

we're<00:04:42.440> drafting<00:04:43.040> a<00:04:43.250> herd<00:04:43.670> on<00:04:43.820> lap<00:04:44.090> number<00:04:44.300> one

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
we're drafting a herd on lap number one

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.930 
we're drafting a herd on lap number one
when<00:04:45.320> he<00:04:45.470> lost<00:04:45.740> all<00:04:46.010> the<00:04:46.310> position<00:04:46.760> that<00:04:46.880> he

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
when he lost all the position that he

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.400 
when he lost all the position that he
was<00:04:47.330> at<00:04:47.390> the<00:04:47.420> back<00:04:47.570> of<00:04:47.630> the<00:04:47.810> field<00:04:47.990> but<00:04:48.140> he<00:04:48.200> lost

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
was at the back of the field but he lost

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.020 
was at the back of the field but he lost
the<00:04:48.530> draft<00:04:48.680> completely<00:04:49.190> on<00:04:49.340> lap<00:04:49.550> 1<00:04:49.730> and<00:04:49.880> right

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
the draft completely on lap 1 and right

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.370 
the draft completely on lap 1 and right
now<00:04:50.180> it<00:04:50.270> looks<00:04:50.420> like<00:04:50.480> he's<00:04:50.690> going<00:04:50.870> backwards

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
now it looks like he's going backwards

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.470 
now it looks like he's going backwards
again<00:04:51.530> so<00:04:51.860> definitely<00:04:52.550> something<00:04:52.850> amiss<00:04:53.300> in

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
again so definitely something amiss in

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.670 
again so definitely something amiss in
that<00:04:53.600> nine<00:04:53.810> they<00:04:54.050> thought<00:04:54.260> it<00:04:54.410> was<00:04:54.530> going<00:04:54.620> to

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
that nine they thought it was going to

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.200 
that nine they thought it was going to
be<00:04:54.800> better<00:04:54.980> because<00:04:55.430> the<00:04:55.760> motive<00:04:56.030> that<00:04:56.120> they

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
be better because the motive that they

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.970 
be better because the motive that they
put<00:04:56.390> in<00:04:56.510> the<00:04:56.630> car<00:04:56.810> was<00:04:57.290> originally<00:04:57.470> going<00:04:57.890> to

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
put in the car was originally going to

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.010 
put in the car was originally going to
be<00:04:58.070> indeed<00:04:58.310> 19<00:04:59.000> car<00:04:59.300> of<00:04:59.390> Elliott<00:04:59.480> Sadler<00:04:59.690> and

be indeed 19 car of Elliott Sadler and

saw him actually ease off the throttle a

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.300 
saw him actually ease off the throttle a
little<00:05:16.550> bit<00:05:16.880> on<00:05:16.970> the<00:05:17.060> back<00:05:17.210> straightaway<00:05:17.690> just

found him a nice place to run right here
in<00:05:20.510> the<00:05:20.570> middle<00:05:20.810> I<00:05:20.990> think<00:05:21.320> that<00:05:21.710> what<00:05:21.860> these

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
in the middle I think that what these

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.920 
in the middle I think that what these
guys<00:05:22.250> were<00:05:22.460> told<00:05:22.640> by<00:05:22.820> NASCAR<00:05:23.060> we're<00:05:23.570> seeing<00:05:23.840> a

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
guys were told by NASCAR we're seeing a

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.490 
guys were told by NASCAR we're seeing a
lot<00:05:24.080> of<00:05:24.110> this<00:05:24.350> up<00:05:24.590> here<00:05:24.800> right<00:05:24.950> now

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
lot of this up here right now

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.160 
lot of this up here right now
be<00:05:27.100> easy<00:05:27.370> I<00:05:27.700> think<00:05:28.270> these<00:05:28.600> guys<00:05:28.780> are<00:05:28.840> going<00:05:29.080> to

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
be easy I think these guys are going to

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.020 
be easy I think these guys are going to
chance<00:05:29.380> it<00:05:29.530> is<00:05:29.830> it's<00:05:30.040> going<00:05:30.160> to<00:05:30.250> come<00:05:30.400> later<00:05:30.700> in

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
chance it is it's going to come later in

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.510 
chance it is it's going to come later in
the<00:05:31.150> race

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.490 

we're<00:05:36.120> seeing<00:05:36.300> a<00:05:36.419> lot<00:05:36.660> more<00:05:36.900> distance<00:05:37.139> in

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
we're seeing a lot more distance in

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.920 
we're seeing a lot more distance in
between<00:05:37.530> these<00:05:38.130> guys<00:05:38.400> than<00:05:39.180> what<00:05:39.419> we<00:05:39.599> normally

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
between these guys than what we normally

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.370 
between these guys than what we normally
would<00:05:40.410> at<00:05:40.680> this<00:05:40.830> point<00:05:41.130> in<00:05:41.220> time<00:05:41.400> of<00:05:41.610> the<00:05:41.699> race
