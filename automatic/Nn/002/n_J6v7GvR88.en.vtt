group and they start to play the same
song<00:01:14.100> okay<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.299> really<00:01:15.420> cool<00:01:15.659> now

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
song okay this is really cool now

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.510 
song okay this is really cool now
because<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.259> have<00:01:16.409> like<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.710> Bluetooth<00:01:17.100> speaker

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
because I have like a Bluetooth speaker

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.340 
because I have like a Bluetooth speaker
and<00:01:17.759> I'm<00:01:18.060> just<00:01:18.240> carrying<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.720> from<00:01:18.930> one<00:01:19.110> room

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
and I'm just carrying it from one room

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.469 
and I'm just carrying it from one room
to<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.619> next<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.280> it's<00:01:20.610> cumbersome<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.330> know

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
to the next and it's cumbersome you know

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.480 
to the next and it's cumbersome you know
and<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.409> with<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.710> cut<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> great

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
and so with this cut this is a great

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.130 
and so with this cut this is a great
solution<00:01:23.759> where<00:01:24.090> everything<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.780> starting<00:01:25.049> to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
solution where everything is starting to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.350 
solution where everything is starting to
talk<00:01:25.680> with<00:01:25.890> each<00:01:25.920> other<00:01:26.130> how<00:01:26.700> does<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.970> work<00:01:27.150> is

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
talk with each other how does it work is

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.950 
talk with each other how does it work is
it<00:01:27.390> with<00:01:27.659> in-app<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.920> you're<00:01:29.460> using<00:01:29.790> Wi-Fi<00:01:30.150> and

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
it with in-app so you're using Wi-Fi and

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.539 
it with in-app so you're using Wi-Fi and
depending<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.680> capabilities<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
depending on the capabilities in the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.670 
depending on the capabilities in the
system<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.180> source<00:01:33.479> can<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:33.840> something

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
system the source can be something

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.170 
system the source can be something
that's<00:01:34.829> on<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.130> system<00:01:35.520> are<00:01:35.640> playing<00:01:35.880> over

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
that's on the system are playing over

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.210 
that's on the system are playing over
the<00:01:36.299> network<00:01:36.479> but<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.140> phone<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.740> really<00:01:38.070> the
