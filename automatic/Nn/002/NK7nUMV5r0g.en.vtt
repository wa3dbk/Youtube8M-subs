00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 a compression test is a way of 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.890
 check the condition of an engine without 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.590
 the old-fashioned engine compression and the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.139
 amount of the gasoline air mixture and the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.620
 the piston compression tower during the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.690
 race 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.300
 a compression ratio that accounts 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.310
 the manufacturer's specifications are 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.380
 essential for a running engine 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.119
 effectively even if a loss of 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.310
 compression is more common 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.320
 it is also possible that the rate of 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.390
 compression is too much one on 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.099
 compression to result in a problem 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.739
 known as detonation 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.090
 which can be very damaging for 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.370
 the internal parts of the engine 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.379
 the first thing that mechanic do 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.540
 when he completed a compression test 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.090
 he makes sure the engine is warmed up 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.969
 and reaches a temperature of operations 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.030
 optimal like the compression test at 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.940
 a motor starter the battery 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.940
 should be charged to full capacity 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.010
 after the mechanic removes the fuse from the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.250
 electric injection system 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.930
 fuel so the ambient gasoline does not 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.729
 will not be injected into the seeland 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.610
 he removes all the spark plugs from the engine 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.950
 and then the eyl filter will have to be 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.560
 also removed the mechanism used 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.320
 the tool to measure the compression 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.170
 is done test at the end of 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.700
 the tool there is the indicator dial of 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.920
 compression and the other side 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.290
 the tip that needs to be installed at the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.200
 place of the candle on a motor the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.909
 mechanic aims tools with laying of 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.200
 good dimensions in the cylinder 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.299
 number one 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.159
 the mechanic's assistant will start the 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.850
 motor and presses bar on 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.799
 accelerator 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.439
 we have to start the vehicle at least 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.439
 for cycle in order to obtain and expressive 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.420
 the mechanic will read the 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.350
 cups and note it says this 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.810
 mechanical inspection 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.369
 once the mechanic a reading of 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.439
 all the engine sites it can 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.689
 now compare readings obtained 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.090
 and the specifications of the manual of 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.799
 service compression of a vehicle 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.990
 used date must 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.750
 absolutely meet specifications 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.259
 from the manufacturer indicated in the manual 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.259
 of service
