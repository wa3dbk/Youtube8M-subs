00:00:05.412 --> 00:00:06.788
Hi, I’m Francis, 

00:00:06.788 --> 00:00:09.595
the host of this show "Cooking with Dog."

00:00:19.729 --> 00:00:24.801
First, cut the thin pork slices into bite-size pieces 

00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:28.218
and preboil them in a pot of water.

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:35.425
When the pork begins to turn white, 

00:00:35.425 --> 00:00:38.902
remove it with a mesh strainer.

00:00:39.627 --> 00:00:43.493
Next, heat another pot of water 

00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:49.431
and divide the konjac into bite-size pieces using a shot glass.

00:00:49.513 --> 00:00:55.188
The uneven cuts will help the konjac to absorb the stock later.

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.886
Place the konjac into the pot 

00:00:59.886 --> 00:01:03.919
and lightly simmer for about 30 seconds.

00:01:03.987 --> 00:01:07.722
Remove and place it onto a tray.

00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:17.227
Make a shallow cut along the gobo, burdock root.

00:01:18.449 --> 00:01:23.158
Then, shave the gobo while gradually rotating it.

00:01:28.313 --> 00:01:31.239
To keep the root from discoloring, 

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:34.685
lightly rinse it in a bowl of water.

00:01:35.967 --> 00:01:39.893
Strain the gobo with a mesh strainer.

00:01:40.936 --> 00:01:47.756
Next, cut the daikon radish into 5mm or thin quarter moons.

00:01:49.082 --> 00:01:55.210
Slice the carrot into 5mm or quarter inch half moons.

00:01:58.345 --> 00:02:01.711
Now, peel the taro.

00:02:11.085 --> 00:02:15.203
Cut the taro into bite-size pieces.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.338
Slice the white part of the long green onion 

00:02:19.338 --> 00:02:25.410
into 1cm or half inch slices using diagonal cuts.

00:02:25.608 --> 00:02:29.942
Slice the green part into thin slices.

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.777
Remove the stems of the shiitake mushrooms 

00:02:33.777 --> 00:02:36.878
and cut a shallow “X” into the top.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.116
Tear each cap into 4 pieces.

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.774
And now, let’s cook the tonjiru.

00:02:46.774 --> 00:02:49.428
In a pot, place the gobo, 

00:02:49.428 --> 00:02:51.098
konjac, 

00:02:51.098 --> 00:02:52.098
daikon, 

00:02:52.098 --> 00:02:54.045
carrot 

00:02:54.045 --> 00:02:56.144
and the taro.

00:02:57.815 --> 00:03:00.035
Add the dashi stock.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.459
Turn on the burner and bring it to a boil.

00:03:07.565 --> 00:03:11.113
Remove the foam with a mesh strainer.

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:16.983
Then, cover with a lid.

00:03:17.882 --> 00:03:20.152
Simmer it for about 10 minutes 

00:03:20.152 --> 00:03:23.290
until the ingredients soften slightly.

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:28.172
Now, add the white part of the long green onion 

00:03:28.172 --> 00:03:30.821
and the shiitake mushroom.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.392
Add the sake.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.126
Place about half of the miso into a ladle 

00:03:39.126 --> 00:03:42.387
and dissolve it with a portion of the broth.

00:03:42.387 --> 00:03:46.504
Then, combine the dissolved miso and the broth.

00:03:49.211 --> 00:03:52.130
When the ingredients are almost cooked, 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.464
place the pork slices into the pot.

00:04:03.045 --> 00:04:06.463
Then, dissolve the rest of the miso.

00:04:09.623 --> 00:04:12.630
When it reaches a rolling, 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.346
add the green part of the onion and turn off the burner.

00:04:19.813 --> 00:04:22.832
Ladle the Tonjiru into a bowl.

00:04:26.584 --> 00:04:29.452
Finally, sprinkle on the shichimi, 

00:04:29.452 --> 00:04:32.708
seven flavor chili powder to taste.

00:04:33.254 --> 00:04:36.682
This tonjiru doesn’t use any extra oil, 

00:04:36.682 --> 00:04:39.865
making the soup exceptionally healthy.

00:04:39.983 --> 00:04:43.152
The taro tends to cause boiling over 

00:04:43.152 --> 00:04:46.184
so leave the lid slightly open.

00:04:55.869 --> 00:05:00.105
Ichimi, red chili powder or grated ginger root 

00:05:00.105 --> 00:05:03.176
also go great with this recipe.

00:05:03.176 --> 00:05:05.113
Good luck in the kitchen.
