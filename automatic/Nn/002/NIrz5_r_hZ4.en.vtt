00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
and say you gotta be smart enough to do

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.100 
and say you gotta be smart enough to do
this<00:02:29.370> but<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:30.330> way<00:02:30.450> they<00:02:30.570> used<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.810> have<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.020> is

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
this but the way they used to have it is

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.810 
this but the way they used to have it is
they<00:02:31.200> had<00:02:31.320> classic<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.100> they<00:02:32.430> had<00:02:32.580> nothing

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
they had classic and they had nothing

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.610 
they had classic and they had nothing
else<00:02:32.910> underneath<00:02:33.270> it<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:33.780> now<00:02:34.020> they<00:02:34.290> have<00:02:34.380> mod

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
else underneath it so now they have mod

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.270 
else underneath it so now they have mod
it<00:02:34.860> like<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.100> made<00:02:35.310> modded<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:36.390> but<00:02:37.170> um<00:02:37.320> now<00:02:38.220> you

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
it like I made modded so but um now you

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.460 
it like I made modded so but um now you
can<00:02:38.550> just<00:02:38.700> choose<00:02:39.090> modded<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.570> it'll<00:02:40.170> have

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
can just choose modded and it'll have

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.960 
can just choose modded and it'll have
the<00:02:40.500> name<00:02:40.740> right<00:02:40.890> here<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.250> what<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.730> actual

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
the name right here and what the actual

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.150 
the name right here and what the actual
jar<00:02:42.240> is<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:43.170> doesn't<00:02:43.500> actually<00:02:43.560> have<00:02:43.800> a<00:02:43.860> jar

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
jar is it doesn't actually have a jar

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.150

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
um like this if you made a new folder

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.710 
um like this if you made a new folder
for<00:03:40.860> 1.6<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:41.910> basically<00:03:42.269> just<00:03:42.390> go<00:03:42.660> to

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
for 1.6 you basically just go to

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.360 
for 1.6 you basically just go to
environment<00:03:43.320> choose<00:03:43.709> which<00:03:43.890> environment<00:03:44.310> you

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
environment choose which environment you

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.470 
environment choose which environment you
want<00:03:44.519> but<00:03:44.730> for<00:03:44.850> this<00:03:44.910> one<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.180> want<00:03:45.329> to<00:03:45.360> go<00:03:45.450> back

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
want but for this one I want to go back

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.380 
want but for this one I want to go back
to<00:03:45.630> classic<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:46.320> then<00:03:47.310> because<00:03:47.850> my<00:03:47.970> jars<00:03:48.209> in<00:03:48.329> a

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
to classic and then because my jars in a

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.170 
to classic and then because my jars in a
different<00:03:48.630> spot<00:03:48.840> I'd<00:03:49.769> go<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.070> jar<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.579> I<00:03:50.880> copy

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
different spot I'd go to jar and I copy

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.420 
different spot I'd go to jar and I copy

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
it and actually what I do that no I want

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.970 
it and actually what I do that no I want
to<00:03:59.100> go<00:03:59.190> to<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.400> different<00:03:59.820> area<00:04:00.680> so<00:04:01.680> what<00:04:01.890> I'm

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
to go to a different area so what I'm

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
to go to a different area so what I'm
going<00:04:02.070> to<00:04:02.160> do<00:04:02.280> is<00:04:02.370> I'm<00:04:02.489> actually<00:04:02.640> going<00:04:02.880> to<00:04:02.970> go

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
going to do is I'm actually going to go

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.240 
going to do is I'm actually going to go

where<00:04:37.530> is<00:04:37.650> it<00:04:38.450> shaders<00:04:40.280> right<00:04:41.280> here<00:04:41.580> in<00:04:41.760> Seoul

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
where is it shaders right here in Seoul

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.000 
where is it shaders right here in Seoul
shaders<00:04:42.390> there<00:04:42.750> we<00:04:42.840> go<00:04:42.900> and<00:04:43.140> that's<00:04:43.890> how<00:04:43.950> I

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
shaders there we go and that's how I

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.870 
shaders there we go and that's how I
usually<00:04:44.400> have<00:04:44.640> my<00:04:44.730> setup<00:04:45.030> so<00:04:45.330> yeah<00:04:45.900> oh<00:04:46.880> and

shaders<00:05:00.470> see<00:05:01.470> this<00:05:01.650> they<00:05:01.920> kind<00:05:02.130> of

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
shaders see this they kind of

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.710 
shaders see this they kind of
implemented<00:05:02.700> this<00:05:02.910> in<00:05:03.060> a<00:05:03.120> new<00:05:03.360> one<00:05:03.510> but<00:05:03.660> I

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
implemented this in a new one but I

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.850 
implemented this in a new one but I
don't<00:05:03.900> really<00:05:03.990> like<00:05:04.110> how<00:05:04.410> they<00:05:04.530> did<00:05:04.680> it<00:05:04.710> this

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
don't really like how they did it this

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.320 
don't really like how they did it this
one<00:05:05.040> seemed<00:05:05.400> this<00:05:05.670> one's<00:05:05.850> actually<00:05:05.970> a<00:05:06.180> lot

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
one seemed this one's actually a lot

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.380 
one seemed this one's actually a lot
easier<00:05:06.540> than<00:05:07.020> a<00:05:07.320> new<00:05:07.560> one<00:05:07.740> that<00:05:08.700> uh<00:05:08.730> mojang

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
easier than a new one that uh mojang

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.670 
easier than a new one that uh mojang
came<00:05:09.600> up<00:05:09.750> with<00:05:09.960> so<00:05:10.410> yeah<00:05:10.950> I<00:05:11.540> just<00:05:12.540> do<00:05:12.780> that<00:05:12.930> and

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
came up with so yeah I just do that and

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.880 
came up with so yeah I just do that and
open<00:05:14.010> and<00:05:14.600> now<00:05:15.600> I<00:05:15.630> have<00:05:15.900> all<00:05:16.110> my<00:05:16.170> jars<00:05:16.650> and<00:05:16.830> I

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
open and now I have all my jars and I

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.230 
open and now I have all my jars and I
can<00:05:17.040> just<00:05:17.160> choose<00:05:17.580> which<00:05:17.760> one<00:05:17.880> I<00:05:17.910> want<00:05:18.090> to<00:05:18.120> do

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
can just choose which one I want to do

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.720 
can just choose which one I want to do
so<00:05:18.420> if<00:05:18.780> i<00:05:18.840> want<00:05:18.990> to<00:05:19.020> go<00:05:19.110> to<00:05:19.140> default<00:05:19.530> i<00:05:19.770> can<00:05:20.580> log

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
so if i want to go to default i can log

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.370 
so if i want to go to default i can log
into<00:05:20.910> default<00:05:21.300> and<00:05:22.230> got<00:05:22.440> notice<00:05:24.080> they<00:05:25.080> change

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
into default and got notice they change

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.920 
into default and got notice they change
the<00:05:25.680> icon<00:05:26.160> for<00:05:26.400> it<00:05:26.460> so<00:05:26.790> bye-bye<00:05:27.210> grass<00:05:27.630> block
