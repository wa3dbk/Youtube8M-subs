00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
pro there and in the reflection that

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.860 
pro there and in the reflection that
that's<00:00:59.609> what<00:00:59.789> I'm<00:00:59.879> taping<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.359> video<00:01:00.660> on

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
that's what I'm taping this video on

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.789 
that's what I'm taping this video on
right<00:01:01.109> now<00:01:05.840> looks<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.409> box

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
right now looks like this is a box

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.980 
right now looks like this is a box
inside<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.549> box<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.210> can<00:01:09.330> just<00:01:09.630> cut

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
inside of a box so I can just cut

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:20.930 
inside of a box so I can just cut
through<00:01:10.619> here

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.120 

looks<00:01:21.940> like<00:01:22.120> quite<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:22.420> box<00:01:23.020> I<00:01:23.470> think<00:01:23.920> that's

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
looks like quite the box I think that's

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.570 
looks like quite the box I think that's
why<00:01:24.310> it<00:01:24.370> was<00:01:24.580> so<00:01:24.760> expensive<00:01:25.090> I<00:01:26.310> seen<00:01:27.310> a<00:01:27.340> lot<00:01:27.550> of

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
why it was so expensive I seen a lot of

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.370 
why it was so expensive I seen a lot of
videos<00:01:27.940> about<00:01:28.150> people<00:01:28.510> talking<00:01:28.690> about<00:01:29.170> you

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
videos about people talking about you

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.410 
videos about people talking about you
know<00:01:29.500> how<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:29.770> box<00:01:30.250> seems<00:01:30.640> more<00:01:30.910> expensive

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
know how the box seems more expensive

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.180 
know how the box seems more expensive
than<00:01:31.510> the<00:01:31.570> machine<00:01:32.050> and<00:01:32.260> I<00:01:32.320> can<00:01:32.470> see<00:01:32.710> why<00:01:32.920> it's

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
than the machine and I can see why it's

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:42.060 
than the machine and I can see why it's
quite<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.900> quite<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.260> box<00:01:40.530> not<00:01:41.530> even<00:01:41.710> joking

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
quite it's quite the box not even joking

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:59.620 
quite it's quite the box not even joking
on<00:01:42.430> that

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:14.990

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
components i'm quite impressed with this

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
components i'm quite impressed with this
power<00:02:35.970> brick<00:02:36.300> because<00:02:36.690> i<00:02:36.720> have<00:02:37.020> am<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.320> am<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:38.660> put

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
power brick because i have am I am I put

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.830 
power brick because i have am I am I put
pro<00:02:40.050> one<00:02:40.320> here<00:02:40.910> if<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.060> just<00:02:42.270> compare<00:02:42.420> the

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
pro one here if you just compare the

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.060 
pro one here if you just compare the
size<00:02:43.140> of<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:44.250> power<00:02:44.550> brick<00:02:44.760> this<00:02:45.000> is<00:02:46.070> much

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
size of the the power brick this is much

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.460 
size of the the power brick this is much
much<00:02:47.550> smaller<00:02:47.610> I<00:02:48.300> like<00:02:48.600> that<00:02:48.810> that's<00:02:49.170> it's

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
much smaller I like that that's it's

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.250 
much smaller I like that that's it's
going<00:02:49.770> to<00:02:49.860> be<00:02:49.980> easy<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.310> carry<00:02:50.670> around<00:02:51.260> doesn't

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
going to be easy to carry around doesn't

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.110 
going to be easy to carry around doesn't
weigh<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.470> lot<00:02:52.740> here<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.580> course<00:02:53.610> is<00:02:53.880> the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
weigh a lot here of course is the

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:02.720 
weigh a lot here of course is the
extended<00:02:55.670> connector<00:02:56.670> for<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:59.190> then<00:03:01.730> here

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
extended connector for it and then here

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.670 
extended connector for it and then here
I<00:03:02.760> believe<00:03:03.120> that's<00:03:03.330> just<00:03:03.690> what<00:03:04.140> stores<00:03:04.470> the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
I believe that's just what stores the

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.270 
I believe that's just what stores the
cds<00:03:05.130> for<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.550> OS<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.800> ilife<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:07.980> whatnot

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280

well<00:04:01.989> personally<00:04:02.439> I<00:04:02.829> think<00:04:02.889> that's<00:04:03.249> one

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
well personally I think that's one

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.339 
well personally I think that's one
feature<00:04:03.700> that<00:04:03.819> should<00:04:04.150> have<00:04:04.269> been<00:04:04.299> kept<00:04:04.629> in<00:04:04.780> in

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
feature that should have been kept in in

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.399 
feature that should have been kept in in
the<00:04:05.769> system<00:04:06.219> because<00:04:06.579> I<00:04:06.819> mean<00:04:07.659> he<00:04:07.870> as<00:04:08.079> a<00:04:08.109> road

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:08.409 
the system because I mean he as a road

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.220 
the system because I mean he as a road
