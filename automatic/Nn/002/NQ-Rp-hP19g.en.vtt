enemy so where you just want to sort of
like<00:00:36.360> here<00:00:36.570> I've<00:00:36.690> sped<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.260> up<00:00:37.380> obviously

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
like here I've sped this up obviously

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.119 
like here I've sped this up obviously
just<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.879> make<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.210> bit<00:00:39.360> quicker<00:00:39.950> since<00:00:40.950> it

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
just to make it a bit quicker since it

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.340 
just to make it a bit quicker since it
does<00:00:41.250> take<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:42.329> good<00:00:42.570> two<00:00:42.780> minutes<00:00:42.930> sort<00:00:43.290> of

does take in good two minutes sort of

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.569 
does take in good two minutes sort of
three<00:00:43.590> minutes<00:00:43.860> depends<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.190> what<00:00:44.280> vehicle

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579

find new session and make sure actually

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.740 
find new session and make sure actually
before<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.130> do<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.640> you're<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.240> your

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
before you do this that you're and your

so<00:02:13.370> I<00:02:13.900> added<00:02:14.900> this<00:02:15.140> out<00:02:15.349> but<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.800> detainee<00:02:16.280> about

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
so I added this out but a detainee about

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.729 
so I added this out but a detainee about
three<00:02:16.730> tries<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.470> eventually<00:02:18.470> found<00:02:18.680> one

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
three tries and eventually found one

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.100 
three tries and eventually found one
it's<00:02:19.640> really<00:02:19.940> that<00:02:20.060> simple<00:02:20.090> does<00:02:20.569> not<00:02:20.840> take

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
it's really that simple does not take

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.199 
it's really that simple does not take
long<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.650> if<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.130> do<00:02:22.280> know<00:02:22.430> any<00:02:22.640> other<00:02:22.790> faster

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
long and if you do know any other faster

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.800 
long and if you do know any other faster
methods<00:02:23.569> post<00:02:24.230> in<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.500> comments<00:02:24.860> below<00:02:24.950> and

methods post in the comments below and

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.850 
methods post in the comments below and
this<00:02:26.810> is<00:02:26.930> definitely<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.290> fastest<00:02:27.650> way<00:02:27.709> I've

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
this is definitely the fastest way I've

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.620 
this is definitely the fastest way I've
found<00:02:27.920> I<00:02:28.430> just<00:02:28.730> need<00:02:28.849> to<00:02:28.880> get<00:02:29.000> these<00:02:29.090> cops<00:02:29.390> off

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
found I just need to get these cops off

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.839 
found I just need to get these cops off
me<00:02:29.840> that's<00:02:30.470> all<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:30.650> don't<00:02:30.920> say<00:02:31.130> to<00:02:31.190> do<00:02:31.400> this<00:02:31.580> is

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
me that's all I don't say to do this is

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.729 
me that's all I don't say to do this is
the<00:02:32.090> security<00:02:32.330> guards<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:32.930> police<00:02:33.140> arrest

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
I can't remember the level requirement

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.199 
I can't remember the level requirement
to<00:02:42.769> be<00:02:43.040> able<00:02:43.190> to<00:02:43.340> call<00:02:43.519> I<00:02:43.760> stuff<00:02:43.970> to<00:02:44.030> get<00:02:44.150> the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
cops off you a cool thing about this

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.210 
cops off you a cool thing about this
vehicle<00:02:47.540> is<00:02:47.690> you<00:02:47.900> can<00:02:48.049> actually<00:02:48.080> turn<00:02:48.590> into<00:02:48.650> a

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
vehicle is you can actually turn into a

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.650 
vehicle is you can actually turn into a
sultan<00:02:49.610> RS<00:02:49.700> as<00:02:50.060> you<00:02:50.120> can<00:02:50.239> see<00:02:50.360> this<00:02:50.480> is<00:02:50.630> a

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
sultan RS as you can see this is a

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.240 
sultan RS as you can see this is a
four-door<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:51.290> it's<00:02:51.410> not<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.560> Sultan<00:02:51.980> arias

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
four-door so it's not the Sultan arias

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.520 
four-door so it's not the Sultan arias
from<00:02:52.400> graphic<00:02:52.730> 04<00:02:53.180> I<00:02:53.360> don't<00:02:54.110> know<00:02:54.260> if<00:02:54.380> the

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
from graphic 04 I don't know if the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.339 
from graphic 04 I don't know if the
speed<00:02:54.860> and<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.190> speed<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.630> performance<00:02:56.870> wise

speed and the speed and performance wise

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.650 
speed and the speed and performance wise
is<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.890> exact<00:02:58.130> same<00:02:58.340> is<00:02:58.610> Bertha<00:02:59.450> thought<00:02:59.569> of

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
is the exact same is Bertha thought of

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.660 
is the exact same is Bertha thought of
force<00:02:59.840> or<00:03:00.019> maybe<00:03:00.290> worse<00:03:00.590> that<00:03:00.769> may<00:03:00.830> be<00:03:00.890> good<00:03:01.130> I

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
force or maybe worse that may be good I

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.250 
force or maybe worse that may be good I
don't<00:03:01.970> know<00:03:02.060> I<00:03:02.269> haven't<00:03:02.750> really<00:03:02.900> played<00:03:03.080> run

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260
