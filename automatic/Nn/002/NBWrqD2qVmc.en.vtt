00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 
around 250 to 253 far as I'm concerned

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:12.329 
around 250 to 253 far as I'm concerned
that's<00:06:09.219> the<00:06:09.779> way<00:06:10.779> that<00:06:10.929> I<00:06:11.049> look<00:06:11.229> best<00:06:11.589> at<00:06:11.829> so<00:06:12.099> I

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:12.339 
that's the way that I look best at so I

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:14.909 
that's the way that I look best at so I
probably<00:06:12.969> be<00:06:13.239> somewhere<00:06:13.779> around<00:06:13.839> and<00:06:14.439> they<00:06:14.709> do

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
probably be somewhere around and they do

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:20.219 
probably be somewhere around and they do
that<00:06:15.249> for<00:06:15.849> the<00:06:15.969> next<00:06:15.999> year<00:06:17.579> as<00:06:18.579> far<00:06:18.879> as<00:06:19.059> my<00:06:19.929> plan

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:20.229 
that for the next year as far as my plan

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:24.839 
that for the next year as far as my plan
is<00:06:20.649> competition<00:06:21.549> go<00:06:23.129> forward<00:06:24.129> on<00:06:24.429> the<00:06:24.669> Olivia

this<00:06:25.149> year<00:06:25.389> i<00:06:25.479> had<00:06:25.689> i<00:06:26.079> won<00:06:26.439> the<00:06:26.589> night<00:06:26.769> a

this year i had i won the night a
champion<00:06:27.309> so<00:06:27.459> i<00:06:27.549> had<00:06:27.699> to<00:06:27.789> peek<00:06:28.029> twice<00:06:28.739> this

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:29.739

champion so i had to peek twice this
year<00:06:29.799> which<00:06:30.369> i<00:06:30.519> think<00:06:30.579> is<00:06:31.059> kind<00:06:31.599> of<00:06:31.749> hard<00:06:31.899> to<00:06:32.019> do

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:32.229 
year which i think is kind of hard to do

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:35.819 
year which i think is kind of hard to do
but<00:06:32.889> i<00:06:33.009> was<00:06:33.189> able<00:06:33.279> to<00:06:33.459> do<00:06:33.609> it<00:06:34.499> next<00:06:35.499> year<00:06:35.679> is

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:35.829 
but i was able to do it next year is

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:37.049 
but i was able to do it next year is
going<00:06:35.889> to<00:06:36.099> be<00:06:36.159> a<00:06:36.219> whole<00:06:36.429> lot<00:06:36.459> difference

00:06:37.049 --> 00:06:37.059 
going to be a whole lot difference

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:39.899 
going to be a whole lot difference
because<00:06:37.449> i'm<00:06:38.049> only<00:06:38.259> going<00:06:38.619> to<00:06:38.679> do<00:06:38.829> one<00:06:39.129> chill

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:39.909 
because i'm only going to do one chill

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:41.969 
because i'm only going to do one chill
and<00:06:40.479> it<00:06:40.659> will<00:06:40.839> be<00:06:40.929> a<00:06:40.959> bitch<00:06:41.169> olympics<00:06:41.619> are<00:06:41.769> only
