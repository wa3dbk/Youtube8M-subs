00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
the weapons that I considered to not be

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.990 
the weapons that I considered to not be
so<00:01:00.719> good<00:01:00.870> at<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.140> beginning<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.590> game<00:01:01.710> and

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
so good at the beginning of the game and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.549 
so good at the beginning of the game and
the<00:01:03.000> only<00:01:03.180> reason<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.660> consider<00:01:04.019> these<00:01:04.140> weapons

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
the only reason I consider these weapons

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.340 
the only reason I consider these weapons
not<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.070> good<00:01:05.430> at<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.850> point<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.180> time<00:01:06.350> was

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
not that good at that point in time was

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.320 
not that good at that point in time was
the<00:01:07.500> fact<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:08.010> did<00:01:08.369> not<00:01:08.400> want<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.880> take<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
the fact that I did not want to take the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.270 
the fact that I did not want to take the
time<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.720> get<00:01:09.900> used<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.409> weapon<00:01:10.799> there's

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
time to get used to that weapon there's

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.530 
time to get used to that weapon there's
some<00:01:11.460> weapons<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:11.970> game<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.330> if<00:01:12.450> you

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
some weapons in this game that if you

pick up and get a few kills with just

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.170 
pick up and get a few kills with just
because<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.380> has<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.830> no<00:01:17.040> recoil<00:01:17.490> no<00:01:17.880> kick

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
because it has like no recoil no kick

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.760

all that sort of stuff that the pattern
is<00:01:19.920> literally<00:01:21.290> very<00:01:22.290> easy<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:23.009> manage<00:01:23.310> but

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
is literally very easy to manage but

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.249 
is literally very easy to manage but
when<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.360> comes<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.630> other<00:01:24.750> weapons<00:01:25.140> you

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
certain kind of pattern you really just

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
have to jump in and play a few games and

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.319 
have to jump in and play a few games and
understand<00:01:38.579> what's<00:01:38.820> going<00:01:38.909> on<00:01:39.119> with<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
understand what's going on with the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.719 
understand what's going on with the
weapon<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:40.259> actually<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:41.070> whole<00:01:41.460> lot

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
weapon and you actually have a whole lot

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.999 
weapon and you actually have a whole lot
more<00:01:41.970> fun<00:01:42.240> with<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.630> believe<00:01:43.320> me<00:01:43.590> I've

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
more fun with it believe me I've

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.679 
more fun with it believe me I've
actually<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.850> thought<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.360> thought<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.630> was

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
actually I thought I thought it was

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.030 
actually I thought I thought it was
burning<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.350> game<00:01:46.470> for<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.710> while<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
burning on this game for a while and

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.530 
burning on this game for a while and
then<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.220> started<00:01:47.850> playing<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.180> again<00:01:48.299> and

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
then I started playing it again and

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.999 
then I started playing it again and
figured<00:01:48.810> out<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.079> don't<00:01:49.170> want<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.560> wasn't

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
figured out you don't want I wasn't

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.310 
figured out you don't want I wasn't
Brandon<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.939> was<00:01:51.180> just<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.450> was<00:01:51.509> focusing

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
Brandon on it it was just I was focusing

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.730 
Brandon on it it was just I was focusing
too<00:01:52.530> much<00:01:52.560> attention<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:53.540> these<00:01:54.540> easier<00:01:55.290> type

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
too much attention on these easier type

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.709 
too much attention on these easier type
of<00:01:55.890> weapons<00:01:56.250> but<00:01:56.700> anyway<00:01:56.969> there<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.420> one<00:01:57.570> thing

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
of weapons but anyway there is one thing

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.060 
of weapons but anyway there is one thing
that<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.930> want<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.200> touch<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.469> briefly<00:01:58.649> I've

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
that I want to touch on briefly I've

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.690 
that I want to touch on briefly I've
seen<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.820> many<00:02:00.479> people<00:02:01.350> upload<00:02:02.040> black<00:02:02.310> ops<00:02:02.549> 2

for it came out like last night or the

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.279 
for it came out like last night or the
night<00:02:06.240> before<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:08.239> for<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.360> life<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.629> me<00:02:09.690> will

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
night before I for the life of me will

never upload a black ops 2 video

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.700 
never upload a black ops 2 video
until<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.940> game<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.180> very<00:02:15.630> close<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.140> release

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
until the game is very close to release

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.000 
until the game is very close to release
because<00:02:17.670> think<00:02:18.060> about<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.330> this<00:02:18.450> way<00:02:18.980> we<00:02:19.980> have

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
because think about it this way we have

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.400 
because think about it this way we have
at<00:02:20.490> least<00:02:20.640> six<00:02:20.940> seven<00:02:21.420> months<00:02:21.750> until<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.140> game

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
at least six seven months until the game

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.620 
at least six seven months until the game
comes<00:02:22.650> out<00:02:22.800> so<00:02:23.040> everybody<00:02:23.370> right<00:02:23.700> now<00:02:23.850> by

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
making these videos they're hyping up

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.220 
making these videos they're hyping up
the<00:02:26.040> game<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.580> point<00:02:26.820> that<00:02:26.910> uh<00:02:27.200> when<00:02:28.200> you

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
the game to the point that uh when you

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.110 
the game to the point that uh when you
get<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.680> game<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.130> when<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.670> expect

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120

get the game and when you expect
something<00:02:30.210> to<00:02:30.540> happen<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:31.110> it<00:02:31.260> doesn't

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
something to happen and it doesn't

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.680 
something to happen and it doesn't
happen<00:02:31.710> you're<00:02:32.040> gonna<00:02:32.220> be<00:02:32.430> disappointed<00:02:32.690> so

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
happen you're gonna be disappointed so

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.840 
happen you're gonna be disappointed so
I'm<00:02:33.990> not<00:02:34.170> gonna<00:02:34.350> set<00:02:34.620> myself<00:02:34.650> up<00:02:35.160> for<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.490> six

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
I'm not gonna set myself up for a six

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.540 
I'm not gonna set myself up for a six
seven<00:02:36.240> month<00:02:36.450> hype<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.470> then<00:02:38.100> when<00:02:38.220> i<00:02:38.250> get<00:02:38.460> the

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
seven month hype and then when i get the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.300 
seven month hype and then when i get the
game<00:02:38.670> i'm<00:02:38.880> not<00:02:39.120> gonna<00:02:39.300> like<00:02:39.570> it<00:02:39.600> when<00:02:40.320> modern

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
game i'm not gonna like it when modern

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.890 
game i'm not gonna like it when modern
warfare<00:02:41.520> 3<00:02:41.640> was<00:02:41.970> an<00:02:42.060> ant's<00:02:42.300> i<00:02:42.450> kind<00:02:42.750> of<00:02:42.780> figured

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
warfare 3 was an ant's i kind of figured

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
warfare 3 was an ant's i kind of figured
you<00:02:43.110> know<00:02:43.200> what<00:02:43.320> they<00:02:43.410> were<00:02:43.500> gonna<00:02:43.620> do<00:02:43.800> it

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
you know what they were gonna do it

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.170 
you know what they were gonna do it
anyway<00:02:44.190> just<00:02:44.220> because<00:02:44.550> they<00:02:44.820> went<00:02:45.000> with<00:02:45.150> a

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
anyway just because they went with a

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.850 
anyway just because they went with a
train<00:02:45.420> of<00:02:45.450> modern<00:02:45.810> warfare<00:02:45.959> one<00:02:46.320> they<00:02:46.590> went<00:02:46.709> in

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
train of modern warfare one they went in

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.230 
train of modern warfare one they went in
modern<00:02:47.100> warfare<00:02:47.250> 2<00:02:47.490> so<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.820> kind<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.090> makes

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
modern warfare 2 so it kind of makes

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.880 
modern warfare 2 so it kind of makes
sense<00:02:48.480> for<00:02:48.780> them<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:48.959> branch<00:02:49.290> out<00:02:49.470> into<00:02:49.800> the

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
sense for them to branch out into the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.800 
sense for them to branch out into the
third<00:02:50.130> one<00:02:50.340> considering<00:02:51.209> that<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.540> story

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
third one considering that the story

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.740 
third one considering that the story
line<00:02:52.070> continues<00:02:53.070> on<00:02:53.280> in<00:02:53.550> each<00:02:54.000> game<00:02:54.270> and<00:02:54.330> it

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
line continues on in each game and it

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.510 
line continues on in each game and it
seems<00:02:54.930> like<00:02:55.020> at<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.890> end<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:56.130> every<00:02:56.370> game

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
seems like at the end of every game

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.770 
seems like at the end of every game
there<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:56.910> something<00:02:57.239> they<00:02:57.390> could<00:02:57.540> probably

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
there is something they could probably

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.220 
there is something they could probably
add<00:02:58.050> on<00:02:58.260> in<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.709> next<00:02:58.860> one<00:02:59.130> um<00:02:59.310> but<00:03:00.300> really

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
add on in the next one um but really

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.890 
add on in the next one um but really
though<00:03:01.410> I<00:03:01.680> see<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:02.430> much<00:03:02.580> so<00:03:02.850> many<00:03:03.000> people<00:03:03.300> they

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
though I see so much so many people they

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.750 
though I see so much so many people they
play<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.260> call<00:03:04.680> duty<00:03:04.830> game<00:03:05.040> they<00:03:05.280> play<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.580> for

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
play a call duty game they play it for

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.150 
play a call duty game they play it for
like<00:03:05.910> four<00:03:06.660> months<00:03:06.690> or<00:03:07.140> so<00:03:07.320> i'd<00:03:07.830> say<00:03:08.040> at<00:03:08.100> least
