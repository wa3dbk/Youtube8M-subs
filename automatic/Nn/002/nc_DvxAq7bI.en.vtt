the screen and the metal casing what I
want<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.000> do<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.360> make<00:02:00.390> enough<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.350> an<00:02:01.710> opening

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
want to do is make enough of an opening

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.580 
want to do is make enough of an opening
so<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.210> can<00:02:03.299> easily<00:02:03.689> come<00:02:04.140> through<00:02:04.380> with<00:02:04.560> a

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
so that I can easily come through with a

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.700 
so that I can easily come through with a
different<00:02:05.040> tool<00:02:05.219> or<00:02:06.049> possibly<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.140> same<00:02:07.469> tool

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
different tool or possibly the same tool

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.870 
different tool or possibly the same tool
and<00:02:08.060> lift<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.209> iPad

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
and lift the iPad

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.920 
and lift the iPad
so<00:02:10.880> if<00:02:11.030> we<00:02:11.210> lift<00:02:11.450> here<00:02:11.990> very<00:02:12.770> carefully<00:02:13.930> there

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
so if we lift here very carefully there

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.030 
so if we lift here very carefully there
is<00:02:15.050> a<00:02:15.080> lot<00:02:15.350> of<00:02:15.380> adhesive<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:17.920> holds<00:02:18.920> the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
is a lot of adhesive that holds the

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.100 
is a lot of adhesive that holds the
screen<00:02:19.400> in<00:02:19.670> place<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:20.450> we<00:02:20.660> want<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:20.990> be<00:02:21.080> very

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
screen in place so we want to be very

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.910 
screen in place so we want to be very
careful<00:02:22.070> and<00:02:22.900> this<00:02:23.900> process<00:02:24.410> could<00:02:24.620> take<00:02:24.680> a

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
careful and this process could take a

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.220 
careful and this process could take a
little<00:02:25.130> while<00:02:25.460> which<00:02:26.390> will<00:02:26.570> probably<00:02:26.780> have<00:02:27.110> to

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
little while which will probably have to

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.000 
little while which will probably have to
skip<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.500> video<00:02:27.860> forward<00:02:28.370> so<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:29.360> way<00:02:30.010> we

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
skip the video forward so that way we

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.400 
skip the video forward so that way we
doesn't<00:02:31.760> take<00:02:32.060> us<00:02:32.210> an<00:02:32.330> hour<00:02:32.450> now<00:02:33.050> as<00:02:33.200> you<00:02:33.290> can

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
doesn't take us an hour now as you can

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.380 
doesn't take us an hour now as you can
see<00:02:33.470> because<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:34.040> screen<00:02:34.310> is<00:02:34.370> cracked<00:02:34.820> pieces

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
see because the screen is cracked pieces

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.960 
see because the screen is cracked pieces
will<00:02:35.660> be<00:02:35.810> coming<00:02:36.020> out<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.500> iPad<00:02:36.860> as<00:02:37.100> we<00:02:37.820> go

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
will be coming out of the iPad as we go

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.729 
will be coming out of the iPad as we go
to<00:02:38.030> take<00:02:38.330> it<00:02:38.510> off

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.080 

now<00:02:42.739> you<00:02:43.040> have<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:43.370> be<00:02:43.489> extremely<00:02:43.730> careful

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
now you have to be extremely careful

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.809 
now you have to be extremely careful
because<00:02:44.569> these<00:02:44.840> pieces<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:45.530> fly<00:02:45.830> out<00:02:46.069> our

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
because these pieces that fly out our

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.339

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
glass so you can hurt yourself and cut

00:02:51.349 --> 00:03:01.880 
glass so you can hurt yourself and cut
yourself<00:02:51.769> while<00:02:51.980> working

your LCD screen out you will notice two
parts<00:04:06.860> one<00:04:07.520> this<00:04:08.270> is<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.570> cable<00:04:08.810> ribbon<00:04:09.620> for

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
parts one this is the cable ribbon for

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.220 
parts one this is the cable ribbon for
your<00:04:10.130> digitizer<00:04:10.610> and<00:04:10.940> this<00:04:11.750> right<00:04:11.960> here<00:04:12.200> is

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
your digitizer and this right here is

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.340 
your digitizer and this right here is
the<00:04:12.380> connection<00:04:12.860> for<00:04:13.340> your<00:04:13.520> LCD<00:04:13.940> screen<00:04:14.570> the

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
the connection for your LCD screen the

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.289 
the connection for your LCD screen the
connection<00:04:15.800> for<00:04:15.980> your<00:04:16.100> LCD<00:04:16.430> screen<00:04:16.970> has<00:04:17.269> a

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
connection for your LCD screen has a

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:23.070 
connection for your LCD screen has a
nice<00:04:17.660> little<00:04:19.209> handle<00:04:20.209> that<00:04:20.720> if<00:04:20.840> you<00:04:20.959> pop<00:04:21.200> it<00:04:21.380> up

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
nice little handle that if you pop it up

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.070 
nice little handle that if you pop it up
like<00:04:24.080> so<00:04:24.160> you<00:04:25.160> can<00:04:25.310> actually<00:04:25.490> take<00:04:25.880> the<00:04:26.150> LCD

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
like so you can actually take the LCD

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.590 
like so you can actually take the LCD
screen<00:04:27.410> out<00:04:27.590> very<00:04:28.130> easily<00:04:31.180> then<00:04:32.180> you<00:04:32.300> just

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
screen out very easily then you just

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.420 
screen out very easily then you just
want<00:04:33.020> everything<00:04:33.230> set<00:04:33.680> and<00:04:33.710> therefore<00:04:34.250> your

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
want everything set and therefore your

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.870 
want everything set and therefore your
ribbon<00:04:35.060> if<00:04:35.900> everybody<00:04:36.290> can<00:04:36.500> see<00:04:37.840> along<00:04:38.840> the

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
ribbon if everybody can see along the

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.830 
ribbon if everybody can see along the
depending<00:04:40.880> on<00:04:40.970> how<00:04:41.090> you're<00:04:41.270> looking<00:04:41.600> at<00:04:41.720> the

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
depending on how you're looking at the

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.230 
depending on how you're looking at the
screen<00:04:42.110> but<00:04:42.410> on<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:42.919> other<00:04:43.190> side<00:04:43.850> of<00:04:44.090> where
