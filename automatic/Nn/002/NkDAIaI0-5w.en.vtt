00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 not 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.360
 hello to all so today I you 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.549
 find on minecraft for you 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.700
 explain how to make the hymn to the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.470
 joy thanks to the music blogs of 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.700
 dial by beethoven so I'll you 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.290
 directly shows what it's like 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:50.699
 then I explain to you how I 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:52.350
 realized my case then as you can 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.449
 see it I used a lot of aisne 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.300
 which is not interesting to do 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.469
 nonsense and music blogs it's 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.659
 just to be able to find me more 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.010
 easily so suddenly for everything 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.710
 first of all what you need to know is for 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.200
 a block of music com that if we him 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:12.900
 puts on him sends power finally he 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:15.870
 its these are sections of 2.2 covered in 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.310
 tic pressed it and so to 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.150
 the environment so it's located so by 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.050
 example we stealth to make a sound of 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.000
 percussion and then she takes effect the 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.060
 title on over the 120 and regulate or 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.650
 more serious then saluting if for 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.580
 to make the piano sound like I did it 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.070
 have to put a block to lift so 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.180
 along with their groom blizzard bites 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.460
 double it's like that before prosecution 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.290
 it depends that you can play 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.020
 notes me I do not do music theory but 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.060
 them but I went to see the wiki 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.430
 how to make balances with 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.120
 like a ticket all of that goes 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.600
 then I whose weight for najwa 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.240
 I was using if this black dong blog there is 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.100
 a little different because it blocks 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.880
 so I do not really have the goal I need 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.030
 know that I created 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.090
 it snows joy in the ear so I'm 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.709
 there I really know what what 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.050
 note that's so I started 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.060
 used the soil lefa the ore 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.850
 the dock but I scored like a little 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.460
 trait put them to have this note 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.700
 so I divided into three in three 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.520
 parties who are respect 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.860
 respectively here and there there and has 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.810
 then after that I superimposed and 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.120
 so we have part 2 that I used 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:41.700
 twice so I part 1 moment 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:46.890
 so this part of the coup I 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:50.190
 used so the mit the phallus hall beats 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.680
 all the notes but in fact it's if we 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.000
 can find the range on the internet this 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.620
 will be much simpler for me I 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.670
 did not especially find I had to 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.640
 to the ear so it's a little 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.930
 annoying it took me some time but hey 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.250
 so be it so you have to know so 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.710
 for the species, we have to go without 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.030
 so with your repeaters so we can 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.370
 to choose the type of milk I am 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.900
 put four guys like that it takes a 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.420
 little more time but well what if we 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.270
 do not put it that does something 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:19.080
 far too much too fast and 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.520
 brooms are they can do simultaneous 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.450
 which is not especially interesting 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.980
 for example I am here and I 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.209
 saw so much current went to do 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.770
 something to the rectorate did very 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:34.080
 so beautiful while sion - repeaters 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.870
 between the two we can do something 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.800
 relatively harmonious thing or even 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.800
 just the music 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:50.280
 after that depends on what we are going to do 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:53.070
 so then suddenly I can you 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.239
 to leave note that if ever 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.760
 you want to try to reproduce on 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.640
 your server good you and just had 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.260
 on break then then for the he must 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.830
 know that I put all the repeaters to 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.790
 4 tic 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:09.680
 except this one for the end for that 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.680
 goes around 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.050
 it was no I'm here for it to be 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.030
 faster so bah you I take you 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:22.210
 especially at that moment to be able to 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:32.890
 pretty much the model so then the 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:34.060
 second the party is then the 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.950
 third part so that's where I 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.440
 used the black block the black blue is 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.570
 not really we can also find better 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.090
 because women are not all 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.440
 just its end a bit like once this 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.660
 note but hey i have not i did not find 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.860
 especially better then I got there 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.380
 because you have to know that not everyone 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.430
 the notes ended up on the same fear 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.080
 that they are not interested in doing 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.710
 music blogs what is 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:00.850
 understandable 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:02.830
 so here are all three so have next 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.620
 so in the beginning I had done something 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.290
 from relatively early compact so that 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.120
 works very well so to the generous 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.080
 the investigators all that but hey I 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.220
 I'm told it was a little annoying 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.750
 early neupro I had not done on this 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:19.050
 model to be tested on models that 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:21.040
 was who were here here and there so 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.620
 left to use the four 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.120
 sides of the first block that operates 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.680
 ie this one and it was good 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.900
 practical if you integrate it into a project 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.630
 all that while that one can 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.460
 hide is relatively easily this 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.250
 which is rather interesting so then 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.440
 so I put part 1 the part of 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.550
 part 3 and I think that's the 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.350
 part 2 which is again below 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.560
 making something enough 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:47.640
 quite compact anyway so I know 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:51.940
 not exactly that make the 15 on ross 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:55.090
 maximum of 10 blocks that I'm not running from 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.070
 15 x 10 and height refers to predicts 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.440
 also blocks so it's pretty complete 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.580
 for that it's still short 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.520
 relatively big anyway 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.840
 then it's a pretty good rest project 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.850
 then against hours in survival mode 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.200
 worth it not to try 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.860
 to do that would be a lot of you will take 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:14.760
 far too many rexton resources 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:18.040
 because you have to know that for kraft is a 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:20.320
 music album it takes 8 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.290
 you have to make a chest and at m and 1 md 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.260
 remain a hen inside restaurant 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:28.480
 so at most it would cost me everything 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.130
 redstone so the bars blog restaurants 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.900
 it's still and then she inherits and 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.420
 then to the powders also beefy 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:38.200
 back - g I did so also with 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:40.450
 blocks to make drink this area and also 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.630
 suddenly for the size of the structure 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:45.430
 we can also remove a wool from each 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.960
 side because we see and serve nothing 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:51.160
 apart to find one's bearings when you count 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:53.920
 when we build the project then the 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:57.400
 blow we can also we are not obliged 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:59.140
 to stack all the all 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.710
 tracks we can also put them next 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:04.390
 across there on each side actually towards 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.640
 east to where that's important 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:09.720
 so I'll make you listen to it again 

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.720
 one last time 

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.460
 so I'll let you 

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.770
 subscribe to my channel if you liked 

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:42.920
 if you want to see other videos from 

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:45.380
 this style I would like you to 

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.180
 put a gem a comment we say this 

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.460
 which is fine with me, you go out 

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:52.040
 if it ever helps you or who has 

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.090
 can you help your friends I you 

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.630
 invite to share 

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:59.690
 or then give them the link then on 

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:02.800
 I wish you a good week 

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.800
 go hi to all
