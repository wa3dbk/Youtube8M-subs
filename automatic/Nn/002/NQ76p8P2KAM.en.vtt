first thing you should know is that you
are<00:00:19.170> not<00:00:19.380> alone<00:00:19.850> second<00:00:20.850> thing<00:00:21.000> have<00:00:21.660> a

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
are not alone second thing have a

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.540 
are not alone second thing have a
systematic<00:00:22.350> plan<00:00:22.710> for<00:00:23.010> how<00:00:23.130> you're<00:00:23.250> going<00:00:23.430> to

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
systematic plan for how you're going to

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.939 
systematic plan for how you're going to
check<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.970> area<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.630> starts<00:00:24.930> off<00:00:25.080> as<00:00:25.859> a

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
check the area so it starts off as a

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.370 
check the area so it starts off as a
fairly<00:00:26.340> large<00:00:26.519> area<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.390> i<00:00:27.599> decided<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.260> check

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
fairly large area so i decided to check

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.630 
fairly large area so i decided to check
a<00:00:28.529> few<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.890> guys<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.220> were<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.429> back

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
a few the guys that were in the back

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.669 
a few the guys that were in the back
alley<00:00:29.880> with<00:00:30.179> me<00:00:30.330> but<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.539> knew<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.349> hadn't

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
alley with me but I knew that I hadn't

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.620 
alley with me but I knew that I hadn't
seen<00:00:31.920> anything<00:00:32.189> very<00:00:32.489> strange<00:00:33.030> back<00:00:33.329> there

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
seen anything very strange back there

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.569 
seen anything very strange back there
and<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.469> had<00:00:34.620> been<00:00:34.710> looking<00:00:34.980> around<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.250> lot<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:35.430> I

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
and I had been looking around a lot so I

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.620 
and I had been looking around a lot so I
was<00:00:35.700> trying<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.940> get<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.210> top<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.540> that

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
was trying to get to that top of that

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.940 
was trying to get to that top of that
building<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.170> didn't<00:00:37.350> think<00:00:37.440> he<00:00:37.590> was<00:00:37.680> there

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
building so I didn't think he was there

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.920 
building so I didn't think he was there
so<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.610> decided<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:38.969> come<00:00:39.059> out<00:00:39.149> onto<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> street

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
so I decided to come out onto the street

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.150 
so I decided to come out onto the street
whether<00:00:40.079> it's<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.440> little<00:00:40.649> bit<00:00:40.739> more<00:00:40.890> crowded

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
whether it's a little bit more crowded

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.639 
whether it's a little bit more crowded
it<00:00:41.460> would<00:00:41.579> be<00:00:41.670> easier<00:00:42.120> for<00:00:42.390> him<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.570> hide<00:00:42.870> in

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
it would be easier for him to hide in

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.130 
it would be easier for him to hide in
the<00:00:43.770> vehicle<00:00:44.370> or<00:00:44.730> among<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.329> NPC's<00:00:45.840> or

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
the vehicle or among the NPC's or

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.110 
the vehicle or among the NPC's or
something<00:00:46.440> like<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.489> see<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:47.910> car

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
something like that so I see this car

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.639 
something like that so I see this car
right<00:00:48.300> here<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.600> looks<00:00:48.750> very<00:00:48.989> out<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.170> place<00:00:49.350> so

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
right here it looks very out of place so

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.529 
right here it looks very out of place so
I<00:00:49.680> assume<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.610> hacker<00:00:50.820> but<00:00:51.300> I

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
I assume that this is the hacker but I

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.330 
I assume that this is the hacker but I
didn't<00:00:51.930> pull<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.079> trigger<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.590> it's<00:00:52.860> giving

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
didn't pull the trigger and it's giving

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.680 
didn't pull the trigger and it's giving
that<00:00:53.489> info<00:00:53.730> trigger<00:00:54.090> because<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.660> not

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
that info trigger because that is not

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.660 
that info trigger because that is not
the<00:00:55.079> hacker<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.800> can<00:00:55.920> see<00:00:56.070> right<00:00:56.100> there<00:00:56.399> not

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
the hacker you can see right there not

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.930 
the hacker you can see right there not
the<00:00:56.940> hacker<00:00:57.149> okay<00:00:58.020> don't<00:00:58.320> shoot<00:00:58.410> okay<00:00:58.850> so<00:00:59.850> I

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
the hacker okay don't shoot okay so I

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.939 
the hacker okay don't shoot okay so I
run<00:01:00.210> around<00:01:00.300> here<00:01:00.629> I'm<00:01:01.469> going<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.649> check<00:01:01.800> these

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
run around here I'm going to check these

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.680 
run around here I'm going to check these
cars<00:01:02.280> over<00:01:02.520> here<00:01:02.550> there<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> side<00:01:03.359> because

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
cars over here there on the side because

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.320 
cars over here there on the side because
that's<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.019> very<00:01:04.260> common<00:01:04.470> thing<00:01:04.680> almost<00:01:05.330> almost

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
that's a very common thing almost almost

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.730 
that's a very common thing almost almost
every<00:01:06.600> single<00:01:06.750> person<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.320> video<00:01:07.619> you're

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
every single person in this video you're

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.649 
every single person in this video you're
going<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.010> see<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.220> hiding<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.670> car<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.570> if

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.410 
you guys are hiding in the car when

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
you're hacking somebody don't do which

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.390 
you're hacking somebody don't do which
it's<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.810> painfully<00:01:13.409> obvious<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:14.010> know<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.310> I

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
it's so painfully obvious I know that I

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.429 
it's so painfully obvious I know that I
did<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.600> first<00:01:15.689> tips<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.259> tricks

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
i'm going to go this far extremely see

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.219 
i'm going to go this far extremely see
some<00:01:41.790> people<00:01:41.939> moving<00:01:42.420> toward<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.840> end<00:01:42.990> over

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
some people moving toward the end over

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.679 
some people moving toward the end over
there<00:01:43.380> but<00:01:43.649> that's<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.159> hour<00:01:45.149> limit<00:01:45.450> right

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
there but that's the hour limit right

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.120 
there but that's the hour limit right
there<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:45.990> i<00:01:46.049> know<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.229> he's<00:01:46.470> not<00:01:46.649> back<00:01:46.890> down

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
there so i know that he's not back down

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.010 
there so i know that he's not back down
there<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.670> think<00:01:48.119> about<00:01:48.329> running<00:01:48.450> back<00:01:48.720> into

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
there I think about running back into

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.210 
there I think about running back into
the<00:01:49.110> alleyway<00:01:49.470> but<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.860> looks<00:01:50.009> like<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
the alleyway but it looks like the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.679 
the alleyway but it looks like the
circle<00:01:50.520> isn't<00:01:50.610> quite<00:01:50.850> cover<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.360> I'm<00:01:51.570> not

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
circle isn't quite cover it so I'm not

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.210 
circle isn't quite cover it so I'm not
going<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.899> waste<00:01:52.020> my<00:01:52.200> time<00:01:52.530> check<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.040> that

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
going to waste my time check in that

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.700 
going to waste my time check in that
area<00:01:54.049> I'm<00:01:55.049> starting<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.380> get<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.530> little<00:01:55.590> bit

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
area I'm starting to get a little bit

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.139 
area I'm starting to get a little bit
nervous<00:01:55.920> for<00:01:56.250> coming<00:01:56.460> up<00:01:56.549> on<00:01:56.640> seventy<00:01:57.000> percent

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
nervous for coming up on seventy percent

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.999 
nervous for coming up on seventy percent
I<00:01:57.420> checked<00:01:57.689> all<00:01:57.810> these<00:01:58.020> cars<00:01:58.320> i'm<00:01:58.619> pretty<00:01:58.829> sure

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
always important to check and double

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.279 
always important to check and double
check<00:02:08.310> because<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.599> hacker<00:02:09.840> isn't

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
check because the hacker isn't

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.890

stationary you know at least a good

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.820 
stationary you know at least a good
hacker<00:02:13.110> won't<00:02:13.349> be<00:02:13.410> stationed

in<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.290> dynamic<00:02:16.830> environment<00:02:16.890> like<00:02:17.430> there<00:02:17.640> was

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
in a dynamic environment like there was

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.210 
in a dynamic environment like there was
a<00:02:17.790> lot<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:17.970> traffic<00:02:18.210> moving<00:02:18.570> around<00:02:19.130> but<00:02:20.130> you

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
a lot of traffic moving around but you

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.590 
a lot of traffic moving around but you
do<00:02:20.340> have<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.520> be<00:02:20.670> careful<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.270> move<00:02:21.450> into

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
do have to be careful that you move into

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.370 
do have to be careful that you move into
an<00:02:21.810> area<00:02:22.130> that's<00:02:23.130> not<00:02:23.400> painfully<00:02:24.180> obvious

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
an area that's not painfully obvious

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.420 
an area that's not painfully obvious
here's<00:02:25.380> another<00:02:25.440> one<00:02:25.770> I<00:02:25.800> was<00:02:26.040> in<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.250> store

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
here's another one I was in the store

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.340 
here's another one I was in the store
trying<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.790> buy<00:02:26.910> something<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.510> oh<00:02:27.810> hey<00:02:27.990> this

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
is a sketch van with some guys sit in it

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.120 
is a sketch van with some guys sit in it
kind<00:02:32.100> of<00:02:32.130> weirdly<00:02:33.530> yeah<00:02:34.530> you're<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.920> hacker

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
kind of weirdly yeah you're the hacker

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.310 
kind of weirdly yeah you're the hacker
yeah<00:02:35.850> so<00:02:36.780> don't<00:02:36.900> do<00:02:37.050> that<00:02:38.300> you<00:02:39.300> that<00:02:40.200> was

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
yeah so don't do that you that was

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.450 
yeah so don't do that you that was
literally<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.680> first<00:02:40.920> thing<00:02:41.160> that<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.370> was

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
literally the first thing that I was

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.100 
literally the first thing that I was
going<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.700> see<00:02:41.880> when<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.060> walked<00:02:42.390> out<00:02:42.630> this<00:02:42.990> guy

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
going to see when I walked out this guy

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.750 
going to see when I walked out this guy
was<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.290> little<00:02:43.470> trickier<00:02:43.890> but<00:02:44.160> I<00:02:44.220> still<00:02:44.550> found

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
was a little trickier but I still found

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.280 
was a little trickier but I still found
it<00:02:44.970> means<00:02:45.120> painfully<00:02:45.570> obvious<00:02:45.720> sitting<00:02:46.170> there

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
it means painfully obvious sitting there

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.320 
it means painfully obvious sitting there
but<00:02:46.800> I<00:02:46.830> was<00:02:47.010> pretty<00:02:47.220> far<00:02:47.520> away<00:02:47.670> from<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.090> area

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
but I was pretty far away from that area

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.840 
but I was pretty far away from that area
when<00:02:48.630> he<00:02:48.750> cheated<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.320> hack<00:02:49.580> but<00:02:50.580> there's<00:02:50.760> not

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
when he cheated the hack but there's not

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
went there this was a funny 1i saw that

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.330 
went there this was a funny 1i saw that
NBC's<00:02:55.140> he<00:02:55.380> just<00:02:55.560> ran<00:02:55.709> around<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:55.980> corner

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340
