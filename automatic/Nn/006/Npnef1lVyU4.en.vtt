00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
case in my review that actually has a

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.130 
case in my review that actually has a
kickstand<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.710> uh<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:21.330> reason<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.869> may<00:01:22.020> appear

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
kickstand so uh the reason it may appear

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.230 
kickstand so uh the reason it may appear
a<00:01:22.530> little<00:01:22.650> bit<00:01:23.040> thicker<00:01:23.280> than<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.610> others<00:01:24.030> is

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
a little bit thicker than the others is

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.940 
a little bit thicker than the others is
if<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.720> turn<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.200> over<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:26.540> using<00:01:27.540> my<00:01:27.570> note<00:01:27.930> 2<00:01:27.960> we

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
if I turn it over and using my note 2 we

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.480 
if I turn it over and using my note 2 we
call<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.030> get<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.360> angle<00:01:30.780> right<00:01:31.490> you

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
call this if I get the angle right you

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.780 
call this if I get the angle right you
can<00:01:32.759> see<00:01:33.770> when<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:34.920> dead<00:01:35.130> flat<00:01:35.460> there's<00:01:35.729> a

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
can see when it's dead flat there's a

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.850 
can see when it's dead flat there's a
little<00:01:36.119> I'm<00:01:36.869> not<00:01:36.990> sure<00:01:37.049> what<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.350> call<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.680> a

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
little I'm not sure what you call that a

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.749 
little I'm not sure what you call that a
hinge<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.520> guess<00:01:38.729> for<00:01:39.650> which<00:01:40.650> makes<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.490> case

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
hinge I guess for which makes the case

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.639 
hinge I guess for which makes the case
at<00:01:42.060> least<00:01:42.090> when<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.720> put<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.290> table

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
at least when you put it on the table

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.429 
at least when you put it on the table
stick<00:01:44.610> out<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> little<00:01:44.970> bit<00:01:45.390> more<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.899> have<00:01:46.110> not

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
stick out a little bit more and have not

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.010 
stick out a little bit more and have not
even<00:01:46.680> when<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.520> put<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.820> on<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.090> on<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.360> table

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
even when you put it on the on the table

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.249 
even when you put it on the on the table
or<00:01:49.140> floor<00:01:49.470> or<00:01:49.740> something<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:51.149> will<00:01:51.509> wobble<00:01:51.960> a

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
or floor or something it will wobble a

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.249 
or floor or something it will wobble a
little<00:01:52.320> bit<00:01:52.920> but<00:01:53.130> not<00:01:53.310> much<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:54.360> big<00:01:54.720> plus<00:01:55.079> of

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
little bit but not much the big plus of

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.410 
little bit but not much the big plus of
this<00:01:55.500> case<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.520> for<00:01:56.790> me<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.939> really<00:01:57.030> big

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
this case and it is for me a really big

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.319 
this case and it is for me a really big
place<00:01:57.899> plus<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.670> side<00:01:59.969> grips<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:01.610> as<00:02:02.610> you

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
place plus is the side grips and as you

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.569 
place plus is the side grips and as you
can<00:02:03.479> see<00:02:03.509> all<00:02:04.110> these<00:02:04.409> cases<00:02:04.680> are<00:02:05.040> extremely

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
can see all these cases are extremely

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.080 
can see all these cases are extremely
well<00:02:05.759> made<00:02:06.090> all<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:07.020> cutouts<00:02:07.439> are<00:02:07.710> fine<00:02:08.090> this

the same case in a completely
transparent<00:02:37.239> nice<00:02:38.239> size<00:02:38.540> cutouts<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.530> have

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
transparent nice size cutouts I have

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.399 
transparent nice size cutouts I have
dropped<00:02:40.430> my<00:02:40.579> phone<00:02:40.939> using<00:02:41.599> this<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:42.019> it<00:02:42.260> has

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
dropped my phone using this and it has

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:46.330 
dropped my phone using this and it has
protected<00:02:42.980> it<00:02:43.099> 100%<00:02:44.109> I<00:02:45.109> just<00:02:45.920> really<00:02:46.189> don't

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
protected it 100% I just really don't

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.580 
protected it 100% I just really don't
like<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.819> back<00:02:47.030> texture<00:02:47.659> that<00:02:47.810> much<00:02:48.109> it<00:02:48.349> just

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
like the back texture that much it just

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.970 
like the back texture that much it just
builds<00:02:48.859> cheap<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:49.459> a<00:02:50.120> little<00:02:50.510> bit<00:02:50.659> slippery

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
builds cheap and a little bit slippery

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.759 
builds cheap and a little bit slippery
so<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.489> this<00:02:53.120> seems<00:02:53.450> to<00:02:53.599> be<00:02:53.629> the<00:02:53.780> only<00:02:53.930> phone

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
so and this seems to be the only phone

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.490 
so and this seems to be the only phone
with<00:02:55.250> a<00:02:55.280> cutout<00:02:55.939> I<00:02:56.180> have<00:02:56.329> no<00:02:56.510> idea<00:02:56.540> why<00:02:56.900> if<00:02:57.349> it's

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
with a cutout I have no idea why if it's

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.210 
with a cutout I have no idea why if it's
needed<00:02:57.919> on<00:02:58.099> the<00:02:59.030> top<00:02:59.769> right<00:03:00.769> hand<00:03:01.040> corner

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
needed on the top right hand corner

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.869 
needed on the top right hand corner
where<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.180> antenna<00:03:02.810> goes<00:03:03.459> all<00:03:04.459> the<00:03:04.730> other

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
where the antenna goes all the other

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.330 
where the antenna goes all the other
phone<00:03:05.209> cases<00:03:05.780> do<00:03:05.959> not<00:03:05.989> have<00:03:06.500> a<00:03:06.530> cutout<00:03:06.859> but

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
phone cases do not have a cutout but

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.309 
phone cases do not have a cutout but
I've<00:03:07.400> noticed<00:03:07.639> no<00:03:08.000> difference<00:03:08.510> in<00:03:08.689> reception

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
I've noticed no difference in reception

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.069 
I've noticed no difference in reception
or<00:03:10.689> Wi-Fi<00:03:12.189> so<00:03:13.189> that's<00:03:13.430> that<00:03:13.639> phone<00:03:13.939> done<00:03:14.239> case

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
or Wi-Fi so that's that phone done case

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.789 
or Wi-Fi so that's that phone done case
here<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:16.129> next<00:03:16.519> one<00:03:16.730> is<00:03:17.030> from<00:03:17.090> kc<00:03:17.900> oddity<00:03:18.440> it

here the next one is from kc oddity it

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.979 
here the next one is from kc oddity it
is<00:03:19.579> the<00:03:19.909> let<00:03:20.209> me<00:03:20.329> just<00:03:20.510> gain<00:03:20.900> look<00:03:21.109> it<00:03:21.229> up<00:03:22.989> the

is the let me just gain look it up the

is the let me just gain look it up the
vintage<00:03:24.500> high-bred<00:03:25.220> series<00:03:25.669> it<00:03:25.849> is<00:03:26.180> probably

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
vintage high-bred series it is probably

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.469 
vintage high-bred series it is probably
the<00:03:26.840> second<00:03:27.440> thickest<00:03:28.129> one<00:03:28.370> I've<00:03:28.549> got<00:03:28.579> the

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:29.479 
the second thickest one I've got the

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:32.080 
the second thickest one I've got the
texture<00:03:29.959> on<00:03:30.199> the<00:03:30.319> back<00:03:30.530> is<00:03:30.889> again<00:03:31.579> I'd<00:03:31.819> like<00:03:31.970> an

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
texture on the back is again I'd like an

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.599 
texture on the back is again I'd like an
imitation<00:03:32.540> leather<00:03:32.750> or<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.919> cutouts<00:03:34.340> are

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
imitation leather or the cutouts are

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:39.490 
imitation leather or the cutouts are
nice<00:03:34.849> but<00:03:35.780> I<00:03:35.840> found<00:03:36.349> this<00:03:36.650> one<00:03:38.079> to<00:03:39.079> be<00:03:39.290> the

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
nice but I found this one to be the

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.939 
nice but I found this one to be the
slipperiest<00:03:40.250> by<00:03:40.729> far<00:03:41.150> on<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:42.319> sides<00:03:44.949> but

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:45.949 
slipperiest by far on the sides but

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.610 
slipperiest by far on the sides but
other<00:03:46.250> than<00:03:46.519> and<00:03:46.729> it's<00:03:47.389> quite<00:03:47.750> thick<00:03:48.049> compared

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
other than and it's quite thick compared

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.789 
other than and it's quite thick compared
to<00:03:48.739> the<00:03:48.859> others<00:03:49.190> but<00:03:49.819> not<00:03:50.030> that<00:03:50.359> thick<00:03:50.799> but

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
to the others but not that thick but

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:52.930 
to the others but not that thick but
probably<00:03:52.220> gives<00:03:52.459> you<00:03:52.579> a<00:03:52.609> very<00:03:52.790> good

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
probably gives you a very good

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.449 
probably gives you a very good
protection<00:03:53.479> I<00:03:53.780> would<00:03:54.049> imagine<00:03:54.319> all<00:03:54.919> of<00:03:54.979> them

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
protection I would imagine all of them

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.479 
protection I would imagine all of them
have<00:03:55.579> got<00:03:55.699> nice<00:03:56.030> flips<00:03:56.479> at<00:03:56.720> our<00:03:56.959> that<00:03:57.650> go<00:03:57.859> over

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
have got nice flips at our that go over

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.229 
have got nice flips at our that go over
the<00:03:58.609> screen<00:03:58.909> to<00:03:59.120> protect<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.659> screen<00:04:01.239> the

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
the screen to protect the screen the

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.599 
the screen to protect the screen the
next<00:04:02.629> one<00:04:02.840> is<00:04:03.019> the<00:04:03.500> bounce<00:04:03.949> farm<00:04:04.669> spigen<00:04:05.449> a

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
next one is the bounce farm spigen a

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.249 
next one is the bounce farm spigen a
very<00:04:07.609> nice<00:04:07.879> design<00:04:08.389> on<00:04:08.419> the<00:04:08.689> back<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:09.169> I

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:09.259 
very nice design on the back and I

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:11.319 
very nice design on the back and I
actually<00:04:09.439> do<00:04:09.829> like<00:04:09.859> the<00:04:10.280> back<00:04:10.489> it's<00:04:10.790> nice<00:04:11.090> to

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
actually do like the back it's nice to

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.770 
actually do like the back it's nice to
hold<00:04:11.509> very<00:04:11.870> tactile<00:04:12.470> and<00:04:13.459> I<00:04:13.579> like<00:04:13.819> the<00:04:13.849> shape

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
hold very tactile and I like the shape

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.689 
hold very tactile and I like the shape
of<00:04:15.109> the<00:04:15.139> back<00:04:15.500> you<00:04:15.859> can<00:04:15.889> see<00:04:16.070> it's<00:04:16.400> a<00:04:16.489> nice

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
of the back you can see it's a nice

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:19.390 
of the back you can see it's a nice
little<00:04:17.000> cut<00:04:17.269> out<00:04:17.449> there<00:04:17.750> all<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.739> cutouts<00:04:19.159> are

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
little cut out there all the cutouts are

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.770 
little cut out there all the cutouts are
nice<00:04:19.609> probably<00:04:20.090> gives<00:04:20.359> you<00:04:20.419> very<00:04:20.690> good

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.650 
protection i'm guessing nice color
beautifully<00:04:24.229> made<00:04:24.469> but<00:04:24.800> once<00:04:25.639> again<00:04:25.880> I<00:04:26.300> have

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
beautifully made but once again I have

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.930 
beautifully made but once again I have
and<00:04:26.810> even<00:04:27.440> though<00:04:27.560> it<00:04:27.710> looks<00:04:27.740> mad<00:04:28.400> and<00:04:28.670> you

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
and even though it looks mad and you

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.960 
and even though it looks mad and you
would<00:04:29.090> expect<00:04:29.450> it<00:04:29.690> to<00:04:29.870> be<00:04:30.220> non<00:04:31.220> slippery<00:04:31.790> I

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
would expect it to be non slippery I

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.720 
would expect it to be non slippery I
found<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:32.990> sides<00:04:33.290> here<00:04:33.590> to<00:04:33.800> be<00:04:33.950> extremely

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
found the sides here to be extremely

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.480 
found the sides here to be extremely
slippery<00:04:35.350> extremely<00:04:36.350> now<00:04:36.950> these<00:04:37.160> are<00:04:37.340> all<00:04:37.460> new

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
slippery extremely now these are all new

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.530 
slippery extremely now these are all new
cases<00:04:38.710> so<00:04:39.710> maybe<00:04:40.100> over<00:04:40.580> time<00:04:40.610> the

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
cases so maybe over time the

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.110 
cases so maybe over time the
slipperiness<00:04:41.960> that's<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:43.010> right<00:04:43.160> word<00:04:43.430> will

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
slipperiness that's the right word will

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.000 
slipperiness that's the right word will
fade<00:04:44.360> away<00:04:44.390> and<00:04:44.870> it<00:04:44.960> becomes<00:04:45.200> more<00:04:45.470> grip<00:04:45.740> I

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
fade away and it becomes more grip I

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.120 
fade away and it becomes more grip I
don't<00:04:46.610> know<00:04:46.850> but<00:04:47.480> it<00:04:48.110> would<00:04:48.260> have<00:04:48.320> been<00:04:48.500> nice

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
don't know but it would have been nice

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.640 
don't know but it would have been nice
if<00:04:49.160> they<00:04:49.610> kept<00:04:49.880> this<00:04:50.060> texture<00:04:50.720> all<00:04:51.020> the<00:04:51.500> way

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
if they kept this texture all the way

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.920 
if they kept this texture all the way
round<00:04:51.920> and<00:04:52.400> that<00:04:52.880> we've<00:04:53.030> been<00:04:53.210> really<00:04:53.630> good

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
round and that we've been really good

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.210 
round and that we've been really good
for<00:04:54.170> the<00:04:54.290> grip<00:04:55.900> again<00:04:56.900> nicely<00:04:57.650> made<00:04:57.860> good

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
for the grip again nicely made good

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.570 
for the grip again nicely made good
quality<00:04:58.730> all<00:04:59.660> of<00:05:00.020> them<00:05:00.140> got<00:05:00.410> easy<00:05:00.650> pen<00:05:01.070> access

headphones the next one is the poetic
borderline<00:05:09.080> bumper<00:05:09.860> case<00:05:10.070> and<00:05:10.820> it's<00:05:11.210> probably

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
borderline bumper case and it's probably

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.980 
borderline bumper case and it's probably
the<00:05:11.930> thickest<00:05:12.470> are<00:05:12.830> in<00:05:13.520> my<00:05:13.970> review<00:05:14.270> here<00:05:14.510> of

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
the thickest are in my review here of

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.350 
the thickest are in my review here of
these<00:05:15.440> cases<00:05:15.950> but<00:05:16.160> probably<00:05:16.670> the<00:05:16.820> lightest

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
these cases but probably the lightest

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.920 
these cases but probably the lightest
and<00:05:18.010> again<00:05:19.090> one<00:05:20.090> of<00:05:20.180> the<00:05:20.270> reasons<00:05:20.420> I<00:05:20.660> don't

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
and again one of the reasons I don't

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.220 
and again one of the reasons I don't
like<00:05:21.200> it<00:05:21.500> is<00:05:21.650> that<00:05:22.490> it's<00:05:22.970> very<00:05:23.090> slippery<00:05:23.960> when

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
like it is that it's very slippery when

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.780 
like it is that it's very slippery when
I<00:05:24.260> take<00:05:24.560> it<00:05:24.590> out<00:05:24.740> my<00:05:24.920> pocket<00:05:25.160> you<00:05:25.490> can<00:05:25.520> actually

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
I take it out my pocket you can actually

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.960 
I take it out my pocket you can actually
almost<00:05:26.090> see<00:05:26.450> the<00:05:26.480> shine<00:05:27.140> but<00:05:28.010> what<00:05:28.220> is<00:05:28.370> amazing

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
almost see the shine but what is amazing

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.620 
almost see the shine but what is amazing
though<00:05:29.150> or<00:05:29.390> at<00:05:29.660> the<00:05:30.590> very<00:05:30.620> top<00:05:31.280> is<00:05:31.340> a<00:05:31.630> two-tone

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
though or at the very top is a two-tone

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.770 
though or at the very top is a two-tone
and<00:05:32.990> it's<00:05:33.560> a<00:05:33.710> nice<00:05:33.920> grey<00:05:34.400> at<00:05:34.640> the<00:05:34.790> top<00:05:35.030> and<00:05:35.300> that

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
and it's a nice grey at the top and that

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.620 
and it's a nice grey at the top and that
part<00:05:36.080> is<00:05:36.290> not<00:05:36.650> slippery<00:05:37.040> so<00:05:37.760> if<00:05:38.120> they<00:05:38.360> would

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
part is not slippery so if they would

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.990 
part is not slippery so if they would
have<00:05:38.720> made<00:05:38.900> the<00:05:39.080> whole<00:05:39.290> cave<00:05:39.830> out<00:05:40.160> of<00:05:40.520> that<00:05:40.730> it

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
have made the whole cave out of that it

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.060 
have made the whole cave out of that it

doing<00:06:39.480> this<00:06:40.040> very<00:06:41.040> slippery<00:06:41.790> but<00:06:42.300> not<00:06:42.570> as

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780 
doing this very slippery but not as

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.110 
doing this very slippery but not as
slippery<00:06:43.140> as<00:06:43.350> the<00:06:43.620> others<00:06:43.890> on<00:06:44.070> the<00:06:44.400> sides<00:06:44.670> I

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 
slippery as the others on the sides I

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.480 
slippery as the others on the sides I
would<00:06:46.430> again<00:06:47.430> if<00:06:47.700> they<00:06:47.880> put<00:06:48.150> the<00:06:48.270> same<00:06:48.510> back<00:06:49.490> as

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490 
would again if they put the same back as

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.030 
would again if they put the same back as
well<00:06:51.000> my<00:06:51.330> thumb<00:06:51.600> is<00:06:51.750> now<00:06:51.960> on<00:06:52.260> the<00:06:52.320> sides<00:06:52.710> this

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.040 
well my thumb is now on the sides this

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.190 
well my thumb is now on the sides this
would<00:06:53.190> have<00:06:53.310> been<00:06:53.370> a<00:06:53.550> superb<00:06:54.060> case<00:06:54.420> this<00:06:54.990> is

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:55.200 
would have been a superb case this is

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.570 
would have been a superb case this is
probably<00:06:55.650> the<00:06:55.800> thinnest<00:06:56.400> of<00:06:57.080> all<00:06:58.080> of<00:06:58.260> them

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:58.580 
probably the thinnest of all of them

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.940 
probably the thinnest of all of them
that's<00:06:59.580> the<00:06:59.730> one<00:06:59.910> I<00:07:00.180> like<00:07:00.750> the<00:07:00.990> most<00:07:01.110> at<00:07:01.740> the

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:01.950 
that's the one I like the most at the

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:06.740 
that's the one I like the most at the
moment<00:07:04.190> however<00:07:05.190> that<00:07:05.670> you<00:07:05.880> really<00:07:06.240> cheap<00:07:06.510> one

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:06.750 
moment however that you really cheap one

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.670 
moment however that you really cheap one
with<00:07:06.930> the<00:07:07.050> kickstand<00:07:07.680> is<00:07:08.090> uh<00:07:09.090> in<00:07:10.080> terms<00:07:10.440> of

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 
with the kickstand is uh in terms of

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.600 
with the kickstand is uh in terms of
grip<00:07:11.180> probably<00:07:12.180> the<00:07:12.300> best<00:07:12.350> actually<00:07:13.350> and

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:13.610 
grip probably the best actually and

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.980 
grip probably the best actually and
putting<00:07:14.610> it<00:07:14.730> down<00:07:14.910> flat<00:07:15.210> does<00:07:15.450> not<00:07:15.690> cause<00:07:15.960> a

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:15.990 
putting it down flat does not cause a

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.620 
putting it down flat does not cause a
problem<00:07:16.410> very<00:07:17.340> well<00:07:17.610> made<00:07:17.910> for<00:07:18.150> under<00:07:18.420> four

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:18.630 
problem very well made for under four

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.690 
problem very well made for under four
dollars<00:07:18.660> comes<00:07:19.380> in<00:07:19.530> a<00:07:19.620> whole<00:07:19.800> range<00:07:19.830> of<00:07:20.250> colors

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:20.700 
dollars comes in a whole range of colors

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:27.890 
dollars comes in a whole range of colors
and<00:07:21.950> that's<00:07:22.950> my<00:07:23.160> review<00:07:23.370> and<00:07:24.890> enjoy
