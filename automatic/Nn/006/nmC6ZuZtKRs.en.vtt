00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.930
 You can find the first part in www punto punto puntocom 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.029
 the next option is the spirit 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.300
 here we have the same scene and this tool works very 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.189
 similar to the previous one but you do not have to use the pacos 30 on the menu 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.779
 of animation just select the object 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.499
 and click on the esprit belt 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:28.009

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.389

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.810
 now new on the line that is our path this 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.560
 and when you are on the created line the pointer of evil becomes 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.450
 on a cross 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.080

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.650
 below this 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.770
 we found these options 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.120
 it appears predetermined that the counter option is enabled 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.250
 if you have increased decreases the counter more geeks appear or 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.500
 disappear in the pac separated at the same distance over the entire length 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.580
 of the path 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.460
 but the banks are not aligned with the path here near the part 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.940
 bottom of the window you can find the fordu option 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.520

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.130
 path 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.360
 but they are looking in the wrong direction to fix it 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.500
 click jail 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.280
 and now rock the goose as the crying is already selected click on rotary

 if we enable the option of issuing and disable moss the option of count 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.610
 we can establish the distance between the geese 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.170
 for example we can establish a distance of two meters between the geese 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.790
 the 50 centimeters that is zero point 5 meters 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.450
 we can enable the withdrawal at the beginning and write one to clear the first 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.230
 subway at the beginning of the row in the same way we can enable the withdrawal to 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.450
 end and write two to clear the last two meters in the love row 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.250
