00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:10.910
 The naehong market today, this time going to see the plane make that Bolt 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:14.510
 The arrows are quite long, as you see now. 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:18.980
 But in the case of arrows flying like this 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:26.330
 I 'm going to make a part that serves as an elevator. 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:28.880
 The elevator plane deunga be deunga rises vertically to the sky or falling 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:34.940
 It's the part that does it. 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:42.199
 So I will make an elevator on the wing part. 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:46.969
 There are two species of aircraft that have been built quite a long time. World War II 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:49.909
 I've been writing these types of paper planes since . 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:57.350
 Heuksa bullets and airplanes also gatjiyo 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:01:04.850
 When this plane was announced in the United States in 2003 , 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:08.180
 Since the nature of this role is critical to the elevator, probably far this 5 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.940
 I did not want to make between two kinds dressed 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.210
 I'll make it. 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:18.860
 One sheet of A4 paper that I did not prepare today. 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:23.960
 Next, we need scissors and a knife. 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:29.740
 It's easy for you to proof. A4 Put paper vertically. 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.740
 Give a good half to the right from left to right 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:41.530
 This half jusiguyo handing back pieoseo 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.530
 The center was made imaginative 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.780
 Lose the path to the left by the vertical line. 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.580
 4 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:58.110
 The right ear is also true of'm letting to log on vertical 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:02.310
 I'll take the road. Make it. 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:07.790
 I usually use a lot of these methods when making planes 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.790
 Let's catch your ears to the standard mountain once 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.180
 The same goes for the right. 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:32.819
 It would look like this. Now, when you fold the left and right keys here 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:39.090
 The opposite intrinsic value matches the vertical line in the middle . Based on this point 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:42.739
 This apko to the part of the paper plane kkeokeoseo 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.739
 Match it exactly 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:55.610
 If you do this 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:58.540
 Yijiyo base two days provided the arrow flight, so in this state to iron out 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.540
 Put a half 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.540
 Give me your wing tips. 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:10.190
 Clearly guide the center line 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:16.280
 If you refine it, now the arrow body is popular and the fuselage is completed. 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:21.680
 How do you set up your imagination to catch the wings of a snowy plane? 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:24.290
 Keep on the front line on the vertical line . 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:29.780
 Divide it in two, and you'll take a dot. 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:36.650
 Usually, we fly, take the back part of it, 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:42.350
 When the arrows are bisected in the front, 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:45.110
 In the same area as set jeonghyo length 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:52.030
 He took the store. 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:52.030
 If you think your virtual hands, grasp air would know 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.780
 The other side of the field you wrote down 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.060
 This completes the arrow bingo. 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:24.650
 So when I made the arrows fly, 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:29.330
 It will grow rapidly . 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:34.150
 Joggers kind of blown away, so now is the process of making the elevator control 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.150
 It's very wrapped in your wings. 

00:04:34.619 --> 00:04:45.749
 Position equally 

00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:51.229
 Place rolled parts made of the lower part of the body except 

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:51.229
 I'm thirds of its wingtips its end 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:58.700
 So I have two points on these two sides. 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:02.120
 This virtual two-point part 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:08.510
 Use the scissors to fit the tips 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:13.330
 It gives a sheath about 50cm which is 2cm half 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:17.370
 3 And look at the fish again . 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.370
 So now the elevator is made. 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:29.820
 Well, I guess you guys have a good look at the screen. 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:31.229
 Jalbo Silla do not know why this place is OK kkeokji made elevators 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.399
 You drink. 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:36.179
 A few million 

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:36.179
 This paper 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:45.550
 Two of these do not do so little 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:50.260
 In the sense of raising the elevator 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:56.560
 Do not be too thick. 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:59.230
 So when you build these elevators you probably do not have the elevator 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:05.410
 The arrows fly 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:09.730
 It's probably going to be a different form of carrying. 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:16.180
 Of course it jjimhan sharply increases when the blow as hard as possible to write in the first 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:21.370
 Now, this fell to the ground, perhaps even some self-control balanced in itself 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:26.770
 This is because the front part is suddenly caught by the elevator role 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:32.590
 It will be part of their many details so the arrow flight is 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:37.990
 Simple and crude, but also how to make a paper airplane between lovers far 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:38.830
 For a reason that has kept the right to existence is because the elevator did Role 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:44.200
 same 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:46.770
 So we'll have to introduce you to today's airplanes arrows far Hong party 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.770
 Market gets
