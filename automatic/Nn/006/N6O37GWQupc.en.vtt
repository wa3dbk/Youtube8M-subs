00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.770
 I am Lesley Neary. 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.440
 I am the Performance Intelligence Director of the Liverpool Community Health Care Services Trust. 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.670
 Our business intelligence and data warehousing solution is Opera. 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.400
 At the same time, Opera is also a performance electronic reporting program used by our organization. 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.870
 From the initial design of the Opera mobile to the presentation of the final product, I think it’s really fast. 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.710
 I think this is because during the development process, I can participate through the annotation function. 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.920
 I think it is the program that uses MicroStrategy during the development process that really helped us. 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.250
 The entire development process is really good and fast. 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.310
 It took us about two months from design to implementation. 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.900
 It’s really fast to use the MicroStrategy mobile development platform. 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.600
 We use the mobile-side Opera developed by MicroStrategy, from front-line employees to board members. 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.800
 The benefit of the board is that they are guaranteed. 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.059
 They don't have to wait until the board meets to get the documents. 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.420
 They can view relevant documents at any time. 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.800
 And further data drilling can be done to prepare the appropriate questions that need to be raised on the board. 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.100
 We very much hope to promote an agenda for sustainable development, 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.190
 In order to reduce our printing costs and the amount of paper used. 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.889
 We can send a set of information by email. 

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:12.500
 They can get all the information at any time, which is great. 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.310
 Instead of passively accepting information, you can actively use it to handle work. 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.600
 One of the things I really want to do, 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.600
 It is to get direct contact with the first line from the information reported to the board of directors. 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.700
 So that our employees can see their contribution to achieving organizational goals. 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.300
 We have 3,500 employees in 100 community service centers and 60 services. 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.600
 At LCH, we use transactional services to get real-time patient experience feedback. 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.990
 We are providing information to all clinical staff through the mobile side. 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.919
 This makes the mobile device part of the work device, 

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:55.400
 Enable clinical staff to get the right information in the right format at the right time, 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.200
 This will improve the quality of the clinical diagnosis they provide to patients. 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:03.400
 Instead of going back to the fixed seat to upload data to a fixed computer. 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.299
 The app needs to be perfectly suited to our mobile office. 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.700
 Now, almost all of our clinicians have some mobile devices. 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.220
 This saves time and allows you to spend more time looking after and facing the patient. 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.000
 This mobile app helps implement this feature. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.200
 This is why I will introduce this application at some conferences. 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.800
 I also showed it to colleagues outside of NHS and NHS. 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.900
 Many of the feedback is really positive. 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.700
 Many companies have never seen such an intuitive product. 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.200
 I really feel very proud of the development of Opera mobile. 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.819
 Not only because it looks good, but really works very well. 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.910
 As far as the board is concerned, 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.400
 We recognize that due to the amount of paper saved and working time, 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.220
 The cost of running a mobile device can be recovered in less than a year. 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.100
 When we consider developing mobile device programs throughout the organization, 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.600
 We will consider whether it is possible to recover the investment in less than three years. 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.600
 Our technology, innovation and smart strategy, 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.100
 Information needs to be at the heart of the decision. 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.400
 The Opera mobile app implements this situation.
