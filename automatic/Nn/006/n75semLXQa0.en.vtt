most people have this one online so like

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.510 
most people have this one online so like
you<00:00:57.870> know<00:00:57.960> if<00:00:58.050> you're<00:00:58.170> going<00:00:58.379> Amazon<00:00:58.829> or<00:00:59.460> other

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
you know if you're going Amazon or other

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.069 
you know if you're going Amazon or other
sides<00:01:00.000> most<00:01:00.210> people<00:01:00.359> have<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:00.930> is

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
sides most people have this so this is

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.660 
sides most people have this so this is
part<00:01:01.289> about<00:01:01.500> like<00:01:01.739> twelve<00:01:02.039> thirteen<00:01:02.370> dollars

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
part about like twelve thirteen dollars

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.759 
part about like twelve thirteen dollars
and<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.780> think<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> little<00:01:04.409> bit<00:01:04.619> more

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
and I think this is a little bit more

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.530 
and I think this is a little bit more
like<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.489> one<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.729> more<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.030> par<00:01:06.299> with<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
like this one is more on par with the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.160 
like this one is more on par with the
Mario<00:01:06.869> pricing<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.590> you'll<00:01:07.710> probably<00:01:07.830> pay

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
Mario pricing so you'll probably pay

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.039 
Mario pricing so you'll probably pay
anywhere<00:01:10.170> from<00:01:11.510> fourteen<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.540> twenty<00:01:12.960> dollars

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
anywhere from fourteen to twenty dollars

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.570 
anywhere from fourteen to twenty dollars
for<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.500> plays<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.890> little<00:01:14.100> bigger<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.520> it

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
for this plays a little bigger and it

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:24.890

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.890 
in the market just beware of the ones
you<00:02:22.350> buy<00:02:22.530> online<00:02:22.740> some<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.310> them<00:02:23.430> have<00:02:23.840> like<00:02:24.840> a

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
you buy online some of them have like a

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.520 
you buy online some of them have like a
backwards<00:02:25.410> L<00:02:26.270> but<00:02:27.270> but<00:02:27.930> kind<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.200> upside<00:02:28.500> down

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
backwards L but but kind of upside down

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.430 
backwards L but but kind of upside down
so<00:02:28.950> just<00:02:29.070> be<00:02:29.220> careful<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.730> think<00:02:30.150> those<00:02:30.540> are<00:02:30.570> not

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
so just be careful I think those are not

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.530 
so just be careful I think those are not
authentic<00:02:31.590> but<00:02:32.210> didn't<00:02:33.210> want<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.420> buy

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
authentic but didn't want to buy

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.480 
authentic but didn't want to buy
something<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.560> then<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:35.060> L<00:02:37.040> yeah<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.070> think<00:02:38.250> I

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
something so then the L yeah I think I

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.370 
something so then the L yeah I think I
think<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.760> ones<00:02:38.940> online<00:02:39.150> some<00:02:39.660> of<00:02:39.870> them<00:02:40.020> are

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
think the ones online some of them are

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.460 
think the ones online some of them are
actually<00:02:41.270> like<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.360> backwards<00:02:42.630> L<00:02:43.020> is<00:02:43.110> upside

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
actually like the backwards L is upside

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.050 
actually like the backwards L is upside
down<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:43.860> that's<00:02:43.950> like<00:02:44.070> a<00:02:44.160> 7<00:02:44.550> so<00:02:44.790> just<00:02:44.970> be

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
down so that's like a 7 so just be

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.720 
down so that's like a 7 so just be
careful<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:46.590> then<00:02:46.830> like<00:02:47.130> just<00:02:47.160> be<00:02:47.370> careful

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
careful and then like just be careful

00:02:47.730 --> 00:03:07.699 
careful and then like just be careful
