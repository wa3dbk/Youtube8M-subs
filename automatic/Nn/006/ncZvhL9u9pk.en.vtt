00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:10.250
 so here is an automotive fk filter that 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.330
 I sought to replace to have 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.350
 a cheaper alternative 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.600
 a cane filter i'm going to find so 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.630
 on the website is created automotive 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.280
 it was 9 euros and more dust 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.910
 15 euros postage so it's done 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:33.109
 a filter at 25 euros 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:37.909
 so the problem is a problem that's 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:41.780
 that their entry the high-level meter 

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:45.710
 of the coach the rubber does the 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.289
 same size so it does not happen 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.269
 tinker to be able to put it 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:54.940
 so I just cut 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:01:01.969
 here the rubber sent to be able 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:06.439
 take out the this part that allows to 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:08.619
 adapt and I return it I put it 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.619
 in 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.810
 we put in the groove 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.890
 but OK 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.800
 this case is 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:36.820
 so there and the months again that the seal 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:42.590
 it's good to stick so it's a filter 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:44.710
 washable and reusable notice to the 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.170
 only difference as compared to those 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:52.400
 adaptable as the kenya not the party 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:55.730
 plastic on the original that comes 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:04.010
 clip in the wood messine earth 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:06.170
 send dimensions so then 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:11.210
 now suddenly this part she 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:13.880
 then return this part then with the 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.790
 larger diameter a little by forcing 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.070
 a little to tomorrow at the fort I pose in paris 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.660
 we can adapt it to those on stage 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.170
 we want you to do that and for 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.960
 the entrance after how are you so there 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.230
 I'm going it's really damn 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:34.700
 close to the air inlet we see that the 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:38.209
 toy a little apart and one hand 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.270
 I have trouble turning to show to 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.070
 how much I like I think that even 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.980
 with the vibrations 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:49.430
 he should not move too much I'm going when 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.459
 even for security to put a little bit 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.550
 of foam there in front for that he 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:59.170
 stay well clad and after I 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.170
 will make a video of the sound 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.760
 as I am a little paranoid that I 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.160
 do not know the quality of this filter and 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.540
 I have no cayenne at hand 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.010
 to compare it if only 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.940
 visually to see it's pretty much 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:16.330
 the thickness is just the same 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.990
 took an old tights I cut a 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.570
 stretch is jelly slide on games 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:27.040
 music saffron sort of pre- filter 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:29.860
 what any case limited all big 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.520
 particles to come get stuck in the 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.930
 teeth the fins and like that they 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.670
 should come out sooner 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.700
 more than 1 wessels blow a little or 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.670
 outright put another end and that's it 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.590
 otherwise you maintain it like a 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.310
 case is so a green or that all 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:51.760
 filters like that for life clean the wash 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.120
 oil lightly and then I think that 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.120
 It will be ok 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.420
 curci concerns the aesthetics I am 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.290
 plug a little bit because I'm going to put some 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.840
 the cover of the air box so 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:08.650
 here we do not care it will not be seen and at 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.500
 less a little more reassured what I do you 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.660
 will say what it gives but I think that 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.239
 that's funny to have go into a 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:21.540
 next video I show you how 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.540
 it is felt at the nationality level
