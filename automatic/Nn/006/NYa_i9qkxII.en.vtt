00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
here there's actually a med pack right

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.979 
here there's actually a med pack right
down<00:00:40.370> there<00:00:40.580> I<00:00:40.610> can't<00:00:40.910> really<00:00:41.120> show<00:00:41.630> it<00:00:41.780> to<00:00:41.870> you

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
down there I can't really show it to you

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.330 
down there I can't really show it to you
right<00:00:42.140> now<00:00:42.290> but<00:00:42.500> it's<00:00:42.620> down<00:00:42.890> there<00:00:43.070> and<00:00:43.280> you

right now but it's down there and you
can<00:00:43.460> grab<00:00:43.700> that<00:00:43.820> easily<00:00:44.210> just<00:00:44.390> by<00:00:44.510> using<00:00:44.690> the

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
can grab that easily just by using the

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.720 
can grab that easily just by using the
ledges<00:00:45.260> I'm<00:00:46.190> not<00:00:46.370> going<00:00:46.489> to<00:00:46.550> worry<00:00:46.670> about

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
ledges I'm not going to worry about

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.500 
ledges I'm not going to worry about
though<00:00:46.970> hop<00:00:47.630> over<00:00:47.900> here<00:00:47.930> to<00:00:48.260> this<00:00:48.380> area

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.049 

and<00:00:53.600> then<00:00:54.219> so<00:00:55.219> she<00:00:55.280> can<00:00:55.460> gret<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:55.789> reason<00:00:56.000> why

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
and then so she can gret the reason why

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.069 
and then so she can gret the reason why
we<00:00:56.149> push<00:00:56.329> that<00:00:56.449> thing<00:00:56.570> over<00:00:56.660> there<00:00:56.750> swishing

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
we push that thing over there swishing

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.880 
we push that thing over there swishing
at<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.260> footing<00:00:57.589> to<00:00:57.739> hop<00:00:58.100> over<00:00:58.280> here<00:00:59.890> small

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
at the footing to hop over here small

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:09.500 
at the footing to hop over here small
medpac<00:01:01.570> and<00:01:02.859> now<00:01:03.859> we<00:01:03.920> want<00:01:04.339> to<00:01:06.790> come<00:01:07.790> over<00:01:07.880> here

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
medpac and now we want to come over here

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:17.110 
medpac and now we want to come over here
and<00:01:09.630> slide<00:01:10.350> down<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.860> Damocles

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.590 

we<00:01:18.120> need<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:19.070> pull<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.250> block<00:01:20.610> out<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.300> some

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
we need to pull this block out this some

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.740 
we need to pull this block out this some
gates<00:01:21.990> broken<00:01:23.210> every<00:01:24.210> time<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:24.450> pull<00:01:24.630> this

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
gates broken every time we pull this

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.320 
gates broken every time we pull this
lever<00:01:24.960> it's<00:01:25.200> actually<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:26.090> we<00:01:27.090> try<00:01:27.270> to

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
lever it's actually going to we try to

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.850 
lever it's actually going to we try to
hop<00:01:27.480> on<00:01:27.660> that<00:01:27.690> thing<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.110> actually<00:01:28.230> showing

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
hop on that thing it's actually showing

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.380 
hop on that thing it's actually showing
us<00:01:29.010> so<00:01:29.190> we<00:01:29.280> need<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.640> push<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.360> block<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:31.110> here

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
us so we need to push this block in here

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.330 
us so we need to push this block in here
so<00:01:33.390> when<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.690> shuts<00:01:34.110> it'll<00:01:34.740> stay<00:01:34.979> open<00:01:35.280> a

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
right above the key well as soon as you

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.830 
right above the key well as soon as you
grab<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.450> key<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:02.280> get<00:02:02.700> off<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.000> screen<00:02:03.390> we

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
grab this key and get off the screen we

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.749 
grab this key and get off the screen we
need<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.080> get<00:02:04.200> off<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.560> platform<00:02:04.890> ASAP

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.800

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:43.420 

submit<00:02:32.209> back

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.730 

now<00:02:44.430> over<00:02:44.700> there<00:02:44.820> is<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.120> artifact<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:46.620> can

there's<00:02:49.200> blades<00:02:49.770> blocking<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:50.370> we<00:02:50.640> can't

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
there's blades blocking it so we can't

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.610 
there's blades blocking it so we can't
exactly<00:02:51.090> get<00:02:51.300> it<00:02:51.420> right<00:02:51.540> now<00:02:51.660> I'll<00:02:52.410> show<00:02:52.560> you

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.600 
fall
they<00:05:02.000> gotta<00:05:02.180> be<00:05:02.240> careful<00:05:02.390> about<00:05:02.630> that<00:05:03.610> we

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
they gotta be careful about that we

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.240 
they gotta be careful about that we
basically<00:05:04.790> need<00:05:05.030> to<00:05:05.210> head<00:05:05.330> back<00:05:05.510> over<00:05:05.720> here<00:05:05.900> to

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
basically need to head back over here to

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.990 
basically need to head back over here to
climb<00:05:07.250> up<00:05:07.460> and<00:05:07.990> around<00:05:08.990> to<00:05:09.410> open<00:05:09.980> the<00:05:10.130> the<00:05:10.760> door
