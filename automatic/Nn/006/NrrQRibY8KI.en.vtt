00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:13.639
 hello to you all the gift we want with 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.710
 presentations n 3 from the company about 16 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.980
 sony exmor megapixel camera 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:22.369
 she made turning around the cameras goes 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:27.369
 stories i have a camera now 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:33.880
 turned on me if i start 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:35.830
 as metal be i turned the camera over 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:42.180
 there is such a plus i can flip 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:44.840
 him on herself she went that is 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.840
 in fact 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.590
 notice that i can 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.510
 camera 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:00.090
 camera move i mean i slowly can her 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.300
 move somewhere I will come an hour she goes 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:07.440
 from face mode I feel like saying 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.590
 Ruddle but such a series in fact I can 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.570
 do here now see the picture 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.420
 dogs were photographed but there are modes 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.220
 which I can do automatically 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.830
 panoramas both vertical and 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.300
 horizontal for example 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.710
 I can determine 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:32.470
 two apparatus should work 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.100
 in fact now for example i click 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.100
 auto panorama 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.860
 Vanya what 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.920
 This is auto vertical vertical 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.260
 in just six seconds it should 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.050
 turn out but not very vertical 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.750
 interesting let's say i stop 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.440
 let's try and get mad at the panorama 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.440
 tall 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.500
 I better go to the counter 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.860
 the frame stops working when the herd 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.470
 more or less firm hold but here you are 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.470
 you see my hands are not that shaking but 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.550
 they move a little 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:30.590
 if people walk at this moment you are not 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:33.459
 see actually it defines 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.190
 motion blurred motion will not 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:41.110
 live he tries to choose people in the frame 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.110
 which is motionless but at the same time 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:55.660
 No, I've been. Look, here's a man. 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:00.430
 moved the girl moved and she is with me 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.650
 fine slicing goes here otherwise 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.940
 if we talk about this device he 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.850
 fairly typical 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.390
 because here is the second colors 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.880
 Version 5 qualcomm narrow models 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:17.020
 processor 2 and 3 gigahertz 2 gigabytes 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.680
 RAM there is a micro sd card up to 128 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:24.070
 in general, everything is quite typical if 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.300
 looked at how this device works 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:30.820
 quickly how much does it cost it separate 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.470
 a separate question 4 thousand yuan for 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.140
 Russian money from respectively 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:39.930
 will be about 28 thousand rubles that is 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:42.580
 28 thousand rubles for the top machine 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.250
 much to or little in my opinion he 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.050
 well compiled here here copied 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.940
 metal frame which we saw 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:54.390
 first time on n4 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:57.120
 there is a fingerprint sensor so this 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.159
 button to press it 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.379
 take a picture of yourself beloved when 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:04.019
 make a link that is now unfolded 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:06.659
 you can take a picture like this and will 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.970
 taken a picture speaking of 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:10.829
 the capabilities of this apparatus they 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.709
 repeat some measure until the 100th by 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:16.109
 the case is in the village 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.850
 interesting model to interesting is it possible 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.030
 say she is definitely there 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:24.449
 wins everything in the market but 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.910
 probably not a good screen good 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:29.760
 photos good performance but 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:33.000
 At the same time, the screensavers are by the way standard for 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.889
 to laura from but here's the highlight 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.310
 is exactly such a camera to someone this 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.700
 like someone no price is high for 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.650
 China but 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.920
 this vase will feel him 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.450
 pretty good so they have 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.840
 customers who are willing to consume this 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.840
 product
