00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.049 
coming from down there in the Belt area
I<00:00:12.090> think<00:00:12.179> it<00:00:12.389> might<00:00:12.540> be<00:00:12.660> like<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.019> tensioner

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
I think it might be like the tensioner

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:16.820 
I think it might be like the tensioner
water<00:00:15.059> palm<00:00:15.420> for<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.809> water<00:00:16.260> pump<00:00:16.529> but<00:00:16.710> the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
water palm for the water pump but the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.859 
water palm for the water pump but the
power<00:00:17.100> steering<00:00:17.369> pump<00:00:17.490> for<00:00:17.789> something<00:00:18.150> but

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
power steering pump for something but

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.620 
power steering pump for something but
I'm<00:00:18.960> not<00:00:19.050> really<00:00:19.199> sure<00:00:19.350> what<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:20.539> start<00:00:21.539> it

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
I'm not really sure what it is start it

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.460 
I'm not really sure what it is start it
up<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.939> figure<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.060> out<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.660> got<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.320> front

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
up and figure it out I got the front

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.450 
up and figure it out I got the front
wheel<00:00:25.680> apart<00:00:26.039> there<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.279> can't<00:00:26.640> get<00:00:26.789> those<00:00:28.460> in

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
wheel apart there I can't get those in

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.170 
wheel apart there I can't get those in
there<00:00:30.019> the<00:00:31.019> old<00:00:31.199> one<00:00:31.380> way<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.679> there<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:32.180> can't

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
get the new one in so I'm gonna try to

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.540 
get the new one in so I'm gonna try to
grease<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.600> but<00:00:36.899> haven't<00:00:37.739> yet<00:00:40.219> now<00:00:41.219> if<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.430> can

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
grease it but haven't yet now if we can

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:50.709 
grease it but haven't yet now if we can
get<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> key<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.090> work<00:00:42.270> long<00:00:42.840> enough

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:01:15.010 

and<00:00:51.320> it's<00:00:51.469> fancy<00:00:53.710> hold<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.829> key

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:27.270 

that<00:01:16.020> worked<00:01:16.380> fine<00:01:16.619> earlier

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.830 

I'm<00:01:28.280> not<00:01:28.430> sure<00:01:28.610> what<00:01:28.729> that<00:01:28.880> rattle<00:01:29.240> is<00:01:29.390> back<00:01:29.659> in

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
I'm not sure what that rattle is back in

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.940 
I'm not sure what that rattle is back in
the<00:01:29.900> back<00:01:30.080> either<00:01:30.290> I<00:01:30.439> never<00:01:30.740> heard<00:01:30.920> that

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
the back either I never heard that

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:44.000 
the back either I never heard that
before<00:01:31.250> oh<00:01:32.229> come<00:01:33.229> on

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.840 

there

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.820 

and<00:01:47.330> of<00:01:47.420> course<00:01:47.660> the<00:01:47.840> exhaust<00:01:48.140> bill<00:01:48.410> not<00:01:48.590> just

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
and of course the exhaust bill not just

00:01:48.830 --> 00:02:06.230 
and of course the exhaust bill not just
this<00:01:48.980> weekend

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:39.030 

really<00:02:06.930> low<00:02:07.110> on<00:02:07.140> gas

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.979 

I'm<00:02:39.519> not<00:02:39.610> sure<00:02:39.819> what<00:02:39.969> that's<00:02:40.120> about<00:02:40.329> either

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.729 

I<00:02:47.019> figured<00:02:47.709> that<00:02:47.859> out<00:02:49.200> it's<00:02:50.200> running<00:02:50.560> her<00:02:50.650> up

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
I figured that out it's running her up

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:57.510 
I figured that out it's running her up
needs<00:02:51.129> us<00:02:51.510> bring<00:02:52.510> them

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.390 

that's<00:02:58.510> fixed

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:10.399 

I<00:03:02.510> need<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:08.540> well<00:03:09.540> feel<00:03:09.750> light<00:03:09.989> apparently

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
I need that well feel light apparently

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:11.630 
I need that well feel light apparently
doesn't<00:03:10.560> work<00:03:10.799> on<00:03:10.920> this<00:03:11.010> car<00:03:11.220> either<00:03:11.340> unless

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
doesn't work on this car either unless

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.589 
doesn't work on this car either unless
it<00:03:11.790> doesn't<00:03:12.030> have<00:03:12.180> one<00:03:16.670> as<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:17.909> can<00:03:17.939> see<00:03:18.329> it<00:03:18.480> is

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
it doesn't have one as you can see it is

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:19.729 
it doesn't have one as you can see it is
low<00:03:18.810> on<00:03:19.049> gas

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
low on gas

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:27.080
