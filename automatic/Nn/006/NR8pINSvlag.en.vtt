of<00:00:26.039> jump<00:00:26.279> rope<00:00:26.519> doing<00:00:26.939> both<00:00:27.119> legs<00:00:27.449> here<00:00:27.960> we'll

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
of jump rope doing both legs here we'll

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.109 
of jump rope doing both legs here we'll
also<00:00:28.740> have<00:00:28.890> her<00:00:28.980> do<00:00:29.099> some<00:00:29.279> single<00:00:29.640> leg<00:00:29.789> jump

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
also have her do some single leg jump

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.269 
also have her do some single leg jump
rope<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:31.019> see<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.410> our<00:00:31.529> own<00:00:31.619> involved<00:00:32.099> right

on<00:00:34.260> her<00:00:34.380> left<00:00:34.680> which<00:00:35.309> actually<00:00:35.610> does<00:00:35.730> quite

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
on her left which actually does quite

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.430 
on her left which actually does quite
well<00:00:36.210> on<00:00:36.239> considering<00:00:36.840> she's<00:00:36.960> never<00:00:37.170> done

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
well on considering she's never done

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
deficits when her center of gravity was

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.299 
deficits when her center of gravity was
displaced<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> lateral<00:01:00.629> direction<00:01:01.309> we

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
displaced in the lateral direction we

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.529 
displaced in the lateral direction we
continue<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.789> work<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.120> our<00:01:03.239> strength

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
continue to work on our strength

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.990 
continue to work on our strength
baseball<00:01:04.110> your<00:01:04.260> traditional<00:01:04.860> lower<00:01:05.729> body

baseball your traditional lower body

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.840 
baseball your traditional lower body
strengthen<00:01:06.479> equipment<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:07.229> press<00:01:07.590> etc<00:01:08.310> but

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
strengthen equipment like press etc but

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.280 
strengthen equipment like press etc but
we<00:01:08.970> also<00:01:09.119> want<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.390> bring<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> dynamic

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
we also want to bring in the dynamic

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.260 
we also want to bring in the dynamic
components<00:01:10.890> such<00:01:11.040> as<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.460> single<00:01:11.760> leg<00:01:11.880> lunges

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
components such as the single leg lunges

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.480 
components such as the single leg lunges
that<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.600> see<00:01:12.810> here<00:01:13.229> again<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.070> do<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.280> onto

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
that you see here again we do it onto

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.100 
that you see here again we do it onto
our<00:01:14.580> dynamic<00:01:15.060> surface<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.630> she<00:01:15.720> has<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.080> a

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
our dynamic surface so she has to a

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.410 
our dynamic surface so she has to a
Dutch<00:01:16.320> those<00:01:16.619> changes<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:18.060> can<00:01:18.180> see<00:01:18.299> that

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
Dutch those changes and you can see that

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.300 
Dutch those changes and you can see that
her<00:01:18.479> body<00:01:18.780> position<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.409> much<00:01:19.590> better<00:01:19.799> as<00:01:20.100> is

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
her body position is much better as is

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.230 
her body position is much better as is
our<00:01:20.460> hip<00:01:20.880> flexor<00:01:21.740> flexibility<00:01:22.759> we<00:01:23.759> did<00:01:23.939> some

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
our hip flexor flexibility we did some

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.320 
our hip flexor flexibility we did some
single<00:01:25.170> leg<00:01:25.290> rows<00:01:25.530> as<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.830> see<00:01:26.159> here<00:01:26.610> we<00:01:27.180> also

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
single leg rows as you see here we also

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
single leg rows as you see here we also
would<00:01:27.479> incorporate<00:01:27.720> some<00:01:28.049> upper<00:01:28.320> body

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
would incorporate some upper body

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.980 
would incorporate some upper body
strengthening<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> curl<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.970> press<00:01:30.150> if

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
strengthening like the curl and press if

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.749 
strengthening like the curl and press if
we<00:01:31.110> put<00:01:31.259> them<00:01:31.409> on<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.560> dyno<00:01:31.860> disk<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
we put them on the dyno disk the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.039 
we put them on the dyno disk the
movement<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.329> upper<00:01:33.420> body<00:01:33.720> actually

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
movement of the upper body actually

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.289 
movement of the upper body actually
displaces<00:01:34.650> our<00:01:34.799> center<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.100> gravity<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:36.030> also

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
displaces our center of gravity and also

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.510 
displaces our center of gravity and also

rest in between and should go back the
opposite<00:02:22.000> direction<00:02:22.329> now<00:02:22.840> as<00:02:23.680> we've<00:02:23.859> seen

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
opposite direction now as we've seen

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.649 
opposite direction now as we've seen
with<00:02:24.189> most<00:02:24.430> of<00:02:24.579> our<00:02:24.670> functional<00:02:25.209> drills<00:02:25.480> that

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
with most of our functional drills that

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.289 
with most of our functional drills that
we<00:02:25.780> do<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.109> can<00:02:26.260> do<00:02:26.349> it<00:02:26.439> as<00:02:26.530> an<00:02:26.650> activity<00:02:27.299> but

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
we do you can do it as an activity but

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.789 
we do you can do it as an activity but
then<00:02:28.420> you<00:02:28.510> can<00:02:28.659> also<00:02:28.840> do<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.319> for<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.560> specific

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
then you can also do it for a specific

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.130 
then you can also do it for a specific
length<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.519> time<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:31.510> work<00:02:31.659> on<00:02:31.840> it<00:02:31.900> as<00:02:32.109> a

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
length of time to work on it as a

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.349
