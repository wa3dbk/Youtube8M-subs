00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 the purest wonderland kai orlovskaya 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.170
 the advice has become a healer of what the servants 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.950
 a card queen painted white roses in 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.080
 Red color 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.360
 Perhaps then the author did not suspect that 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.950
 after some century and a half color 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.440
 really can be given 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.119
 almost any shade and at home 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.789
 terms without recourse 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.980
 brushes and rollers are best taken 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.900
 heterogeneous coloring moisture-loving flowers 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.000
 for the experiment we chose a rose 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.830
 chrysanthemums and al style least and they 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.109
 quite thick vessels for which it is easy 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.730
 they quickly rise paints 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.440
 and to give color to fit 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.899
 ordinary food coloring 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.000
 the more it is contrasting the stronger the effect and 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.350
 it is safer than covering the petals 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.300
 toxic auto paint 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.760
 however, none of these methods 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.860
 florists do not consider humane such 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.620
 the procedure will shorten the life 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.469
 flowers flowers such bouquet they are collected 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.699
 long not worth it they live somewhere well 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.699
 several hours 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.399
 clogged pores because the rose is the same 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.930
 the queen of all flowers she loves pure 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:06.720
 water is necessary when you buy a flower 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.760
 Need to cut with a knife not scissors 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.840
 not shears because they are compressed then 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.730
 flower time 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.880
 namely our slanting cut 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.130
 clear water clear water also water 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.230
 how we wash also colors must 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.360
 become pure water without any chemicals 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.400
 however, there are some flowers that 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.440
 love the transformation and willingly 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.960
 get the right shade right in the soil 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.510
 without cutting the stems for example hydrangeas 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.930
 they are very fond of water and they are very 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.060
 sensitive and soil acidity 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.820
 hydrangea but those who are engaged 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.540
 flowers gardeners they know that this 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.840
 flower can can change color in 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.980
 whichever way the soil is oxidized 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.290
 will change from white to red however 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.660
 homemade staining makes sense if you 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.910
 plan to dry the bouquet leaving him 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.830
 exotic colors flowers can be long 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.610
 please the eye and at the same time will be safe 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.130
 for home 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.530
 However, it still does not replace the living in this. 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.090
 Lewis Carroll was right Julia Russian 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.080
