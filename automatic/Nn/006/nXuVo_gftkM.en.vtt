didn't want to pay to be in the book and
but<00:03:32.180> it's<00:03:32.299> also<00:03:32.450> good<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:33.310> use<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.489> trade

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
but it's also good to use the trade

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.520 
but it's also good to use the trade
directory<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.299> try<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:35.570> discover<00:03:35.870> who<00:03:36.440> were

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
name not the place name so we go to the

who's the major landowner and then we

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.050 
who's the major landowner and then we
can<00:03:54.650> direct<00:03:54.980> them<00:03:55.100> as<00:03:55.459> to<00:03:55.610> whether<00:03:55.760> we've<00:03:55.910> got

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
can direct them as to whether we've got

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.060 
can direct them as to whether we've got
the<00:03:56.209> estate<00:03:56.600> records<00:03:56.980> particularly<00:03:57.980> useful

people who rented on an estate and so we

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.850 
people who rented on an estate and so we
can<00:04:01.400> hopefully<00:04:02.060> maybe<00:04:02.750> find<00:04:03.140> me

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
can hopefully maybe find me

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.070 
can hopefully maybe find me
and<00:04:03.980> things<00:04:04.190> like<00:04:04.280> that<00:04:04.400> so<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:05.450> more<00:04:05.630> they<00:04:05.840> do

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
and things like that so the more they do

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.230 
and things like that so the more they do
the<00:04:06.320> easier<00:04:06.770> it<00:04:06.890> becomes<00:04:06.980> for<00:04:07.490> them<00:04:07.640> yeah<00:04:07.820> do

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
the easier it becomes for them yeah do

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.550 
the easier it becomes for them yeah do
you<00:04:08.330> find<00:04:08.510> that<00:04:08.630> they<00:04:08.750> get<00:04:08.900> obsessive<00:04:09.230> about

you find that they get obsessive about
this<00:04:09.740> it<00:04:10.160> can<00:04:10.370> be<00:04:10.400> pretty<00:04:10.760> addictive<00:04:11.300> I<00:04:11.510> mean<00:04:11.660> a

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
this it can be pretty addictive I mean a

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.870 
this it can be pretty addictive I mean a
lot<00:04:11.930> of<00:04:11.960> people<00:04:12.050> watch<00:04:12.920> who<00:04:13.400> do<00:04:13.460> you<00:04:13.580> think<00:04:13.790> you

are or air hunters and think oh that's
easy<00:04:16.130> I<00:04:16.190> can<00:04:16.280> do<00:04:16.489> it<00:04:16.549> within<00:04:16.670> an<00:04:16.880> hour<00:04:17.000> often

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
easy I can do it within an hour often

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.720 
easy I can do it within an hour often
it's<00:04:18.049> not<00:04:18.140> it<00:04:18.560> can<00:04:18.829> turn<00:04:19.040> into<00:04:19.310> an<00:04:19.430> absolute

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
it's not it can turn into an absolute

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.810 
it's not it can turn into an absolute
labor<00:04:20.030> of<00:04:20.269> love<00:04:20.329> and<00:04:21.109> it<00:04:21.620> can<00:04:21.829> become<00:04:22.220> quieter

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
labor of love and it can become quieter

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.070 
labor of love and it can become quieter
we<00:04:22.940> do<00:04:23.090> have<00:04:23.300> regular<00:04:23.720> users<00:04:24.110> here<00:04:24.380> who

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
we do have regular users here who

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.390 
we do have regular users here who
they're<00:04:27.080> doing<00:04:27.290> their<00:04:27.410> own<00:04:27.500> family<00:04:28.010> history

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
and they've they keep finding more and

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.940 
and they've they keep finding more and
more<00:04:31.070> things<00:04:31.460> and<00:04:31.870> I<00:04:32.870> mean<00:04:33.170> every<00:04:33.590> family<00:04:33.890> is

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950

more things and I mean every family is
different<00:04:34.010> if<00:04:34.730> your<00:04:34.940> family<00:04:35.330> were<00:04:35.480> regular

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
different if your family were regular

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.300 
different if your family were regular
churchgoers<00:04:36.440> you<00:04:36.530> probably<00:04:36.770> got<00:04:36.890> more<00:04:37.040> chance

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
churchgoers you probably got more chance

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.040 
churchgoers you probably got more chance
of<00:04:37.430> finding<00:04:37.640> them<00:04:37.910> in<00:04:38.060> the<00:04:38.090> parish<00:04:38.419> registers

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
of finding them in the parish registers

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.510 
of finding them in the parish registers
and<00:04:40.180> but<00:04:41.180> sometimes<00:04:41.690> you<00:04:42.500> do<00:04:42.740> hit<00:04:43.010> brick<00:04:43.250> walls

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
and but sometimes you do hit brick walls

should say but before that date that
didn't<00:05:54.800> exist<00:05:55.190> so<00:05:55.520> you<00:05:55.880> are<00:05:56.270> reliant<00:05:56.660> on

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
didn't exist so you are reliant on

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.230 
didn't exist so you are reliant on
church<00:05:57.110> records<00:05:57.620> and<00:05:58.040> estate<00:05:58.640> records<00:05:58.880> and
