00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Start with priming your lid

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
to make sure the eyeshadows won't loose intensity once you've applied them on your eye

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.000
We're going to start with the color called Factory from the Naked3

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Take a fluffy blending brush and apply this shade right into your crease

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.000
As you can already see on the right side this color is going to dominate the look along with the black eyeshadow

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Make sure you blend really well

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
so there will be no hard edges left!

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Let's go on with the typical color of a smokey eye: black

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.000
Apply that eyeshadow on your lower lid going more and more upwards until you'll reach your crease

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.000
Again it is important that there are no hard edges left

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
but we are going to perfect the transition between those shades during the next step

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.000
Which is applying a transition color - grey - right into your crease

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
blending it to and fro 

00:02:33.435 --> 00:02:36.000
Don't worry if some eyeshadow falls down during the makeup application process

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Just clean up your lower lash line using makeup remover

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.000
Highlight your inner corner using a shimmery grey eyeshadow

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Sorry guys there has been a thunderstorm while I was recording 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and I thought I looked so funny as I was soo scared ^^

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.500
Even the music I was listening to has fit to the weather

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Whatever - hightlight your inner corner again using a shimmery white eyeshadow

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Now let's go on with the eyeliner:

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.428
I have applied the eyeliner pretty acute-angled today

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I have first used a gel eyeliner by Motives

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
but then specified the line using a new liquid eyeliner by Beby

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
As always I'll be using false eyelashes to complete the look

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Actually this look looks fine without falsies, too, so it's up to you wether you want to add some or not

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.500
Mine are by Town of Lashes 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
But I don't know how they're called as the name has not been on the packaging

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Last but not least highlight your brow bone

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.000
And I'm also going over the whole look with my blending brush again to finish the eye makeup

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Moving on to my face I'll be applying powder all over it to set my foundation and concealer in place

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.000
That's it with my face makeup: 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.000
I did neither contour my face nor applied any blush

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Cuz I think it fits better to the smokey eye look 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.000
Therefore I completed the look using a light pink lipgloss

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
