00:00:01.619 --> 00:00:04.619
 this process we want reside 

00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:10.949
 exercise 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.250
 happens in some kind of exercise does not happen in the intense spin does not happen 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.460
 intense racing does not happen in the 100 meters to swim to the maximum does not happen 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.770
 in the 400 meters to the maximum does not happen in a letter with swimming race of 50 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:43.290
 meters why candon time does not happen in the jump did not happen in the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.070
 Olympic lifting what happens in the launch of the rocha does not happen in 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.500
 the triple jump in the high jump does not happen in all that type of exercises 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.910
 that as they realized at first sight are very intense exercises 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:00:59.950
 short maximum duration 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.570
 neither does it happen in a race of five thousand meters to the maximum 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.510
 neither its in a race of three thousand meters to the maximum nor in 1500 and it happens 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.480
 percent 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.090
 in exercises 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.000
 percent e 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.060
 which requires 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.060
 an addict intensity level 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.550
 if it happens in a soft aerobic exercise 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.940
 correlatively smooth until when this metabolism predominates 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.250
 adipocyte 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.090
 lipolysis 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.020
 and peace in the pÃ³sito 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.870
 percent albumin triglycerides and in the muscle for oxidation when 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.940
 predominates predominates predominates 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.700
 I repeat this word for q3 aan a fundamental word in physiology 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.020
 of the exercise one of the three or four fundamental words in the rows 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.320
 figel that exercise when metabolism predominates in activities aroca and 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.770
 playful 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.929
 mild I love decades until when it predominates up to the anaerobic threshold 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.990
 that's why we insist on the aerobic pair 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.200
 because 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.230
 we have to take detroit man and we have to know what it is about 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.910
 the aerobic name of the aerobic man unemployed fell in intensity that 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.239
 not even though fat predominates and this is the proxy that happens in the 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.409
 organism 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.459
 it does not happen more intense 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.360
 when we passed ironic lighting from there up in intensity 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.400
 but rich 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.290
 we have degraded or high very high very intense aerobic maximum consumption of 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.439
 oxygen ok 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.450
 Explosive exercises of power strength and speed 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.810
 January placed in the spa box and does not burn pesic fat and more glucose and other 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.679
 things 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:49.039
 lipids 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:50.939
 Tripoli lipolysis 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:52.559
 policemen 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:53.729
 reduce 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:56.729
 the triglyceride level of the adipocyte 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.149
 very very very very sought after by 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:03.279
 almost everyone 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:04.799
 happens 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.430
 in the circumstances that receives a national
