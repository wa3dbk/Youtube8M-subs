00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.180 

we<00:00:14.270> came<00:00:14.510> across<00:00:14.660> the<00:00:14.990> number<00:00:15.290> station<00:00:15.740> about

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
we came across the number station about

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.210 
we came across the number station about
two<00:00:16.250> years<00:00:16.760> ago<00:00:17.030> now<00:00:17.270> we<00:00:17.570> knew<00:00:18.110> it<00:00:18.950> was<00:00:19.100> the

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
two years ago now we knew it was the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.450 
two years ago now we knew it was the
kind<00:00:19.430> of<00:00:19.640> movie<00:00:19.940> that<00:00:19.970> could<00:00:20.420> be<00:00:20.660> financed

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
kind of movie that could be financed

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.440 
kind of movie that could be financed
independently<00:00:22.460> we<00:00:22.730> thought<00:00:22.940> that<00:00:23.150> you<00:00:23.330> know

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:23.450 
independently we thought that you know

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.910 
independently we thought that you know
maybe<00:00:23.750> bringing<00:00:24.170> it<00:00:24.260> to<00:00:24.380> Europe<00:00:24.619> would<00:00:24.740> be<00:00:24.800> a

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
maybe bringing it to Europe would be a

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.950 
maybe bringing it to Europe would be a
good<00:00:25.130> idea<00:00:25.310> when<00:00:25.910> you<00:00:26.000> see<00:00:26.210> good<00:00:26.390> writing<00:00:26.660> it

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
good idea when you see good writing it

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.330 
good idea when you see good writing it
really<00:00:27.290> stands<00:00:27.890> out

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.590 

we<00:00:30.849> got<00:00:31.240> this<00:00:31.559> setting<00:00:32.559> was<00:00:32.680> interesting<00:00:33.600> you

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
we got this setting was interesting you

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.660 
we got this setting was interesting you
know<00:00:34.690> the<00:00:34.800> milieu<00:00:35.800> was<00:00:35.980> pretty<00:00:36.280> interesting

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
know the milieu was pretty interesting

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.100 
know the milieu was pretty interesting
he's<00:00:37.660> kind<00:00:37.930> of<00:00:38.610> abstract<00:00:39.610> outpost<00:00:40.150> you<00:00:41.050> know

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
he's kind of abstract outpost you know

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.110 
he's kind of abstract outpost you know
at<00:00:41.170> the<00:00:41.260> end<00:00:41.290> of<00:00:41.470> empire<00:00:41.620> it's<00:00:42.220> kind<00:00:42.460> of<00:00:42.489> cool

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
at the end of empire it's kind of cool

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.560 
at the end of empire it's kind of cool
the<00:00:43.600> main<00:00:43.809> attraction<00:00:44.140> was<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.820> wasn't<00:00:46.149> it's

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
the main attraction was it wasn't it's

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.600 
the main attraction was it wasn't it's
not<00:00:46.720> just<00:00:46.930> a<00:00:47.019> thriller<00:00:47.290> and<00:00:47.620> and<00:00:47.949> you<00:00:48.489> know

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
not just a thriller and and you know

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.119 
not just a thriller and and you know
some<00:00:48.850> some<00:00:49.300> cars<00:00:50.230> that<00:00:50.440> blow<00:00:50.589> up<00:00:50.620> and<00:00:50.980> some

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
some some cars that blow up and some

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.710 
some some cars that blow up and some
guns<00:00:51.430> that<00:00:51.550> go<00:00:51.760> off<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:54.309> was<00:00:54.519> more<00:00:54.910> about<00:00:55.150> a

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
guns that go off it was more about a

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.670 
guns that go off it was more about a
character<00:00:56.470> piece<00:00:56.710> than<00:00:57.040> anything<00:00:57.280> else<00:00:57.579> I

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.479 

would<00:01:02.680> say<00:01:02.890> there<00:01:03.010> have<00:01:03.100> been<00:01:03.129> a<00:01:03.250> lot<00:01:03.460> of

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
would say there have been a lot of

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:04.799 
would say there have been a lot of
theories<00:01:03.940> over<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:04.239> years<00:01:04.390> about<00:01:04.540> what

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
theories over the years about what

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.330 
theories over the years about what
numbers<00:01:05.229> stations<00:01:05.710> are<00:01:05.890> and<00:01:06.070> do<00:01:06.159> they<00:01:06.310> really

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
numbers stations are and do they really

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.120 
numbers stations are and do they really
exist<00:01:06.760> do<00:01:07.270> they<00:01:07.420> not<00:01:07.630> exist<00:01:08.110> are<00:01:08.380> they<00:01:08.650> you

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
exist do they not exist are they you

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.370 
exist do they not exist are they you
know<00:01:09.250> someone's<00:01:09.790> imagination<00:01:09.970> or<00:01:10.810> is<00:01:10.840> it<00:01:11.170> or

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
know someone's imagination or is it or

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.590 
know someone's imagination or is it or
are<00:01:11.439> they<00:01:11.590> really<00:01:11.830> ways<00:01:12.220> that<00:01:12.610> agencies

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
are they really ways that agencies

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.940 
are they really ways that agencies
communicate<00:01:14.140> with<00:01:14.260> their<00:01:14.409> agents<00:01:14.710> in<00:01:14.860> the

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
communicate with their agents in the

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.010 
communicate with their agents in the
field<00:01:15.159> it's<00:01:15.610> a<00:01:15.760> place<00:01:16.000> that<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.540> government's

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
field it's a place that the government's

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.560 
field it's a place that the government's
used<00:01:17.260> to<00:01:17.500> send<00:01:18.400> out<00:01:18.520> coded<00:01:18.880> messages<00:01:19.330> to

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
used to send out coded messages to

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.990 
used to send out coded messages to
agents<00:01:20.140> to<00:01:20.710> do<00:01:20.890> things<00:01:21.159> like<00:01:21.460> could<00:01:21.820> be<00:01:21.850> a

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
agents to do things like could be a

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.990 
agents to do things like could be a
drone<00:01:22.330> attack<00:01:22.689> or<00:01:23.220> cyber<00:01:24.220> warfare<00:01:24.549> or

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
drone attack or cyber warfare or

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.350 
drone attack or cyber warfare or
assassinations<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:27.189> from<00:01:27.549> the<00:01:27.700> station<00:01:28.180> you

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
assassinations so from the station you

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.870 
assassinations so from the station you
have<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:28.869> broadcaster<00:01:29.740> who<00:01:29.950> will<00:01:30.159> send<00:01:30.490> code

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
have the broadcaster who will send code

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.030 
have the broadcaster who will send code
to<00:01:31.600> other<00:01:31.930> agents<00:01:32.409> that<00:01:32.560> are<00:01:32.619> out<00:01:32.799> in<00:01:32.830> the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
to other agents that are out in the

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:41.370 
to other agents that are out in the
field

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.870

seven six nine zero one zero it's this

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.920 
seven six nine zero one zero it's this
broadcasting<00:01:49.880> code<00:01:50.180> that<00:01:50.450> they<00:01:50.540> sent<00:01:50.810> out

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
broadcasting code that they sent out

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.690 
broadcasting code that they sent out
that<00:01:51.260> only<00:01:51.500> certain<00:01:51.770> people<00:01:51.980> can't<00:01:52.370> decode

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
that only certain people can't decode

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.900 
that only certain people can't decode
and<00:01:53.050> understand<00:01:54.050> those<00:01:54.770> agents<00:01:55.400> have<00:01:55.640> to

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
and understand those agents have to

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.100 
and understand those agents have to
decipher<00:01:56.630> what<00:01:56.840> it<00:01:57.680> is<00:01:57.940> that<00:01:58.940> code<00:01:59.330> means<00:01:59.690> and

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
decipher what it is that code means and

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.680 
decipher what it is that code means and
then<00:02:00.650> go<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.070> execute<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:02.090> plan<00:02:02.390> that<00:02:02.600> has

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
then go and execute the plan that has

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.420 
then go and execute the plan that has
been<00:02:02.750> sent<00:02:03.170> out<00:02:03.320> from<00:02:03.530> their<00:02:03.740> superior<00:02:04.220> so

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
been sent out from their superior so

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.190 
been sent out from their superior so
it's<00:02:04.610> sort<00:02:04.760> of<00:02:04.820> a<00:02:04.910> mode<00:02:05.180> of<00:02:05.420> getting<00:02:06.050> the

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
it's sort of a mode of getting the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.300 
it's sort of a mode of getting the
message<00:02:06.590> out<00:02:06.800> to<00:02:07.220> those<00:02:07.340> field<00:02:07.670> agents<00:02:08.180> when

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
message out to those field agents when

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.770 
message out to those field agents when
sort<00:02:10.310> of<00:02:10.340> regular<00:02:10.760> means<00:02:10.970> of<00:02:11.150> communication

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
sort of regular means of communication

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:21.450 
sort of regular means of communication
could<00:02:12.050> compromise<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.970> agenda<00:02:14.480> with<00:02:15.200> nd<00:02:15.470> yeah

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460
