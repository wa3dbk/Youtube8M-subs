the<00:01:24.410> film<00:01:24.560> myself<00:01:25.280> because<00:01:25.790> it's<00:01:25.940> not

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
the film myself because it's not

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.260 
the film myself because it's not
released<00:01:26.270> as<00:01:26.510> yet<00:01:26.690> but<00:01:27.680> the<00:01:28.490> idea<00:01:28.730> I<00:01:28.820> get<00:01:29.090> is

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
released as yet but the idea I get is

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.910 
released as yet but the idea I get is
that<00:01:29.420> it's<00:01:29.750> a<00:01:29.840> lot<00:01:29.990> of<00:01:30.110> fun<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:30.500> obviously<00:01:30.830> I

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
that it's a lot of fun and obviously I

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.910 
that it's a lot of fun and obviously I
know<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.130> story<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:32.260> before<00:01:33.260> I<00:01:33.290> got<00:01:33.680> to<00:01:33.830> do

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
know the story and before I got to do

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.110 
know the story and before I got to do
the<00:01:34.040> sound<00:01:34.190> I<00:01:34.400> obviously<00:01:34.610> knew<00:01:34.820> about<00:01:34.910> the

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
the sound I obviously knew about the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.790 
the sound I obviously knew about the
film<00:01:35.330> and<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.510> story<00:01:35.750> and<00:01:36.290> I<00:01:36.440> think<00:01:36.500> that

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
film and the story and I think that

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.100 
film and the story and I think that
should<00:01:37.130> be<00:01:37.450> it<00:01:38.450> should<00:01:38.510> be<00:01:38.690> really<00:01:38.870> successful

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
should be it should be really successful

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.570 
should be it should be really successful
because<00:01:39.500> I<00:01:39.740> think<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.010> story<00:01:40.340> is<00:01:40.460> really

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
because I think the story is really

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:49.900 
because I think the story is really
lovely<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.000> it's<00:01:41.210> active<00:01:42.110> brilliantly<00:01:48.910> you

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
lovely and it's active brilliantly you

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.000 
lovely and it's active brilliantly you
know<00:01:49.970> I<00:01:50.030> think<00:01:50.120> it's<00:01:50.510> just<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:51.770> way<00:01:51.950> the

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
know I think it's just the way the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.490 
know I think it's just the way the
letter<00:01:52.340> was<00:01:52.820> done<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.390> music<00:01:53.870> producer<00:01:54.140> put

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
letter was done a music producer put

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.110 
letter was done a music producer put
this<00:01:54.650> whole<00:01:54.830> ethnic<00:01:55.280> touch<00:01:55.520> to<00:01:55.760> it<00:01:55.790> and<00:01:56.060> I

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
this whole ethnic touch to it and I

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.450 
this whole ethnic touch to it and I
think<00:01:56.330> that's<00:01:56.480> just<00:01:56.690> that's<00:01:56.990> why<00:01:57.310> setup<00:01:58.310> was

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
think that's just that's why setup was

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.700 
think that's just that's why setup was
chosen<00:01:58.730> like<00:01:59.030> that<00:01:59.210> and<00:01:59.450> plus<00:01:59.960> it<00:02:00.230> matches<00:02:00.590> the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
chosen like that and plus it matches the

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.920 
chosen like that and plus it matches the
film<00:02:00.950> no<00:02:01.160> there<00:02:01.400> in<00:02:01.520> Rajasthan<00:02:02.150> I<00:02:02.390> think<00:02:02.720> it's

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
film no there in Rajasthan I think it's

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.840 
film no there in Rajasthan I think it's
it's<00:02:03.260> not<00:02:03.440> about<00:02:03.710> how<00:02:03.890> we<00:02:03.950> promote<00:02:04.220> it<00:02:04.520> really

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
it's not about how we promote it really

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.820 
it's not about how we promote it really
it's<00:02:05.030> just<00:02:05.390> all<00:02:05.930> about<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.170> song<00:02:06.440> and<00:02:06.740> how

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
it's just all about the song and how

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.470 
it's just all about the song and how
people<00:02:07.160> connect<00:02:07.400> to<00:02:07.430> it<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:07.880> of<00:02:08.270> course

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:08.480 
people connect to it and of course

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.760 
people connect to it and of course
people<00:02:08.660> should<00:02:08.929> connect<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.200> it<00:02:09.380> because<00:02:09.619> it

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
people should connect to it because it

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.210 
people should connect to it because it
was<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:09.950> superhero<00:02:10.790> once<00:02:11.060> upon<00:02:11.360> a<00:02:11.390> time<00:02:11.660> but<00:02:12.590> you

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
was a superhero once upon a time but you

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.370 
was a superhero once upon a time but you
know<00:02:13.760> today<00:02:13.970> it<00:02:14.210> turns<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.630> difference<00:02:14.960> so

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
know today it turns a difference so

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.690 
know today it turns a difference so
let's<00:02:15.620> see

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.460 

it's<00:02:23.700> free<00:02:23.909> to<00:02:24.090> do<00:02:24.209> an<00:02:24.420> item<00:02:24.750> number<00:02:24.989> after<00:02:25.290> so

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
it's free to do an item number after so

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.220 
it's free to do an item number after so
long<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.980> obviously<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.970> wasn't<00:02:27.510> around<00:02:27.840> for<00:02:28.200> a

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
long and obviously I wasn't around for a

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.270 
long and obviously I wasn't around for a
while<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:29.450> something<00:02:30.450> like<00:02:30.900> bapuji's<00:02:31.709> it<00:02:32.129> was

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
while and something like bapuji's it was

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.070 
while and something like bapuji's it was
such<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.430> great<00:02:32.640> hit<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.299> it<00:02:33.659> was<00:02:33.780> always

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
such a great hit that it was always

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.690 
such a great hit that it was always
difficult<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.590> beat<00:02:34.769> it<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.099> was<00:02:35.220> difficult<00:02:35.459> to

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
difficult to beat it it was difficult to

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.800 
difficult to beat it it was difficult to
do<00:02:35.819> something<00:02:36.209> that<00:02:36.329> would<00:02:36.390> be<00:02:36.510> that<00:02:36.690> popular
