your digital camera I just want to

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.440 
your digital camera I just want to
explain<00:00:13.769> exactly<00:00:14.340> what<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:14.940> is

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
explain exactly what it is

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.010 
explain exactly what it is
it's<00:00:16.289> called<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.890> heli<00:00:17.190> coin<00:00:17.630> because<00:00:18.630> heli

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
it's called the heli coin because heli

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.769 
it's called the heli coin because heli
Koide<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:19.830> twisting<00:00:20.580> shape<00:00:21.300> it's<00:00:21.570> like<00:00:21.750> a

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
Koide is that twisting shape it's like a

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.080 
Koide is that twisting shape it's like a
piece<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.260> DNA<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.519> so<00:00:24.029> as<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:25.050> twist<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:26.820> goes

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
piece of DNA and so as you twist it goes

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.550 
piece of DNA and so as you twist it goes
in<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:28.289> twists<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.099> goes<00:00:29.310> out<00:00:30.410> so<00:00:31.410> that's

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
in it twists and it goes out so that's

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.750 
in it twists and it goes out so that's
what's<00:00:31.859> called<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.399> helical<00:00:33.440> it<00:00:34.440> seems<00:00:34.770> unusual

you might well be familiar with them

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.889 
you might well be familiar with them
because<00:00:54.800> they<00:00:55.800> often<00:00:56.039> use<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.850> helical<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.750> help

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899

helical type is actually sits at the
front

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
front

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.520

the changing the aperture at the back

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.540 
the changing the aperture at the back
here<00:02:07.470> and<00:02:09.060> you're<00:02:10.060> focusing<00:02:10.740> Pelle<00:02:11.740> could<00:02:12.070> is

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
here and you're focusing Pelle could is

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.450 
here and you're focusing Pelle could is

aperture changing is that at the front
here<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.930> we've<00:02:22.930> put<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.290> helicoil

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
here and we've put the helicoil

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.630 
here and we've put the helicoil
at<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.250> back<00:02:25.380> now<00:02:26.380> here's<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.610> other

at the back now here's the other

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.699 
at the back now here's the other
interesting<00:02:28.450> difference<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.290> amount<00:02:29.530> of

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
interesting difference is the amount of

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.430 
interesting difference is the amount of

travel the stop of the smallest one

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.480 
travel the stop of the smallest one
first<00:02:32.709> this<00:02:33.430> one<00:02:33.700> here<00:02:35.910> going<00:02:36.910> from

I know you can't see that but I just
thought<00:02:47.980> I<00:02:48.040> put<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.370> rule<00:02:48.520> are<00:02:48.700> there<00:02:48.820> any<00:02:48.970> way

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
thought I put the rule are there any way

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.990 
thought I put the rule are there any way
the<00:02:50.830> Chinon<00:02:52.050> it's<00:02:53.050> traveling<00:02:53.500> about<00:02:54.000> seven

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
the Chinon it's traveling about seven

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.310 
the Chinon it's traveling about seven
millimeters<00:02:56.640> from<00:02:57.640> closest<00:02:58.570> focus<00:02:59.019> to

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
millimeters from closest focus to

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:08.060 
millimeters from closest focus to
infinity<00:03:01.530> now<00:03:04.260> with<00:03:05.260> this<00:03:05.670> separate<00:03:06.670> helicoil

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
infinity now with this separate helicoil

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:14.940 
infinity now with this separate helicoil
it<00:03:09.070> travels<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:09.940> massive<00:03:10.890> 14<00:03:11.890> millimeters<00:03:13.950> Wow

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
it travels a massive 14 millimeters Wow

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.370 
it travels a massive 14 millimeters Wow
you<00:03:15.010> might<00:03:15.519> say<00:03:15.820> oh<00:03:15.850> that's<00:03:16.390> awesome

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
you might say oh that's awesome

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.100 
you might say oh that's awesome
well<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:18.310> downside<00:03:18.910> of<00:03:19.090> that<00:03:19.120> is<00:03:19.300> is<00:03:19.720> that<00:03:19.750> it

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
well the downside of that is is that it

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.699 
well the downside of that is is that it
actually<00:03:20.550> takes<00:03:21.550> the<00:03:22.480> lens<00:03:22.720> out<00:03:22.959> beyond

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
actually takes the lens out beyond

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.990 
actually takes the lens out beyond
infinity<00:03:24.670> focus<00:03:24.940> so<00:03:25.660> whilst<00:03:26.440> these<00:03:26.709> ones<00:03:27.010> stop

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
infinity focus so whilst these ones stop

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000 
infinity focus so whilst these ones stop
nicely<00:03:28.600> at<00:03:28.959> infinity<00:03:31.200> this<00:03:32.200> lens<00:03:32.560> will<00:03:32.890> in

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
nicely at infinity this lens will in

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.070 
nicely at infinity this lens will in
fact<00:03:33.190> go<00:03:33.459> beyond<00:03:33.850> infinity<00:03:34.239> and<00:03:34.660> so<00:03:34.810> you<00:03:34.900> have

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
fact go beyond infinity and so you have

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.770 
fact go beyond infinity and so you have
to<00:03:35.230> pull<00:03:35.470> back<00:03:35.500> a<00:03:35.769> bit<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.930> get<00:03:38.200> to<00:03:38.230> infinity

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
to pull back a bit to to get to infinity

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.729 
to pull back a bit to to get to infinity
that's<00:03:40.780> all<00:03:40.900> right

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
that's all right

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.900 
that's all right
taking<00:03:42.489> still<00:03:43.120> photos<00:03:43.410> but<00:03:44.519> if<00:03:45.519> you're<00:03:45.700> using

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
taking still photos but if you're using

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.670 
taking still photos but if you're using
it<00:03:46.150> on<00:03:46.299> video<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:46.989> you're<00:03:47.140> trying<00:03:47.380> to<00:03:47.440> do<00:03:47.650> a

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
it on video and you're trying to do a

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.789 
it on video and you're trying to do a
nice<00:03:47.980> zoom<00:03:48.310> out<00:03:48.489> to<00:03:48.700> infinity<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:50.500> you<00:03:50.650> go

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
nice zoom out to infinity and you go

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.650 
nice zoom out to infinity and you go
pass<00:03:51.100> well<00:03:51.400> you've<00:03:51.580> kind<00:03:52.120> of<00:03:52.209> ruined<00:03:52.510> your

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
pass well you've kind of ruined your

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.240 
pass well you've kind of ruined your
shot<00:03:53.370> but<00:03:54.370> yes

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
shot but yes

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.820 
shot but yes
take<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.400> lens<00:03:57.640> out<00:03:57.819> and<00:03:58.690> that's<00:03:59.379> it

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
take the lens out and that's it

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.970 
take the lens out and that's it
the<00:04:00.040> hell<00:04:00.220> Accord<00:04:00.580> that<00:04:01.410> twisting<00:04:02.410> motion

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
the hell Accord that twisting motion

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.209 
the hell Accord that twisting motion
like<00:04:03.190> a<00:04:03.220> piece<00:04:03.790> of<00:04:03.970> DNA
