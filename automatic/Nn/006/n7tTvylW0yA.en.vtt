00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello my name is alexander and this 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.560
 fifth edition of the project simple vinyl in 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.840
 our releases we talk about how 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:17.100
 can be cheap and easy to make 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:18.869
 applique of vinyl film in 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.869
 last edition we did here 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.140
 such an application or regulation of the flag 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:29.180
 type disi layout we prepared the program 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.180
 coreldraw used ellipse tool 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.790
 today we will talk about creating 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.380
 two logos of cult computer 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.170
 of games 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.400
 counter-strike and half-life to create 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.780
 these applications 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.510
 we will use the program as always 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.920
 corel draw and already known to us 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.750
 tool and 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.800
 Well, let's start creating layouts 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:54.040
 our first bitmap 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.330
 which we opened the coreldraw program 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.800
 must be positioned 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:04.100
 shelves axes now stands at 83 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.800
 approximately x and 216 y 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:15.280
 level road numbers 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:18.680
 83 216 take the tool ellipse and draw 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.799
 approximate contour ellipse 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.490
 the outer circle what we need to do 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:28.090
 further it is also to position it 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:36.280
 same asian coordinator 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:39.850
 that is 83 by 216 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:46.299
 take the approximate height it is with us 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:48.959
 is going to be eighty six 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:56.409
 millimeters and width we should set 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:59.619
 this is already 86 years we got perfect 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:03.039
 even circle which is aligned with us 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.409
 coordinate axes with raster 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:13.540
 image we do the same with 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:17.960
 second inner circle 83 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:25.550
 216 this or the coordinates to be in 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:27.090
 center and now size is seventy eight 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.190
 millimeters 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.640
 what we see we put the corresponding 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:38.030
 seventy eight millimeters here we are 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:41.190
 got two laps which between each other 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.099
 absolutely centered now with the help 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:48.000
 familiar to us tool broken line 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:51.620
 we trace the outline of the character who 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.620
 is in the middle of the logo 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.880
 in the end we get this 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.880
 picture 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.920
 come up 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:18.090
 counter strike we tried 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.350
 copy saving can format corel 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.730
 draw 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.310
 all we have to do is 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.420
 order opera cut and put 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.420
 the resulting image 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:09.799
 Thanks for watching our video. 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:12.549
 like subscribe to the channel all good luck 

00:05:09.799 --> 00:05:12.549
 until
