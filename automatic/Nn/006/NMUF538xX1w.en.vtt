00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340
 and we had a long meeting in the 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.980
 security pricing was talked about 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:12.250
 yesterday and conditions 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.429
 dangerous that the pilots do not 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.779
 we cut the security levels well 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.060
 the security committee was also not 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.250
 very fine and good 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.960
 a little is assumed that if he could have done 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.270
 better but good the fact is that today 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.550
 let's make a manga there's a lot 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.530
 wind forecast pretty wind would be 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:35.330
 86 km 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.330
 and opening us to the valley to avoid 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:42.030
 to people we have to be multiple today 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.420
 from the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.920
 two and a half 245 three and three quarters and 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.920
 good a trail of people to clear 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.520
 history this 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.179
 for me 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.840
 ah 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.060
 do not 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.090
 or not 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.450
 no not at all 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.200
 the truth is that it is a bitch to have 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.120
 went out to fly in today's condition with 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.490
 the middle part that had to put it 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.610
 all windy with the best of the 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.590
 intentions because they have put this 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.770
 manga and in the end it has been nothing more 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.070
 take off 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.690
 did not move forward and endured punctured by 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.780
 other side pilots we can always 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.250
 say level 3 and land and nobody 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.800
 did until they canceled the manga 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.840
 then there we have everything a bit the 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.510
 fault but today there has to be 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.960
 pose this manga so good for 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.340
 luck here we landed in the 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.680
 highway under construction this was a 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.490
 hotbed of thermal and not down and 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.790
 well we had a couple of 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.230
 shows luckily nobody has left 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.970
 injured 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.209
 has been maintained for another day more than 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.209
 flight
