00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
your cooking so I think this guy as you

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.770 
your cooking so I think this guy as you
can<00:00:42.329> see<00:00:42.540> starting<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.079> go<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.230> seed<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:44.780> most

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
can see starting to go to seed so most

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.569 
can see starting to go to seed so most
herbs<00:00:46.020> are<00:00:47.059> cyclical<00:00:48.890> they'll<00:00:49.890> grow<00:00:50.250> they'll

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
herbs are cyclical they'll grow they'll

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.990 
herbs are cyclical they'll grow they'll
peter<00:00:50.820> out<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.270> cut<00:00:51.420> them<00:00:51.539> down<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.079> then

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
peter out you cut them down and then

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.130 
peter out you cut them down and then
they'll<00:00:54.000> usually<00:00:54.360> come<00:00:54.570> back<00:00:54.719> for<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.020> next

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
they'll usually come back for the next

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.340 
they'll usually come back for the next
season<00:00:56.030> but<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.180> guy<00:00:57.329> was<00:00:57.539> real<00:00:57.750> easy<00:00:58.109> we

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
season but this guy was real easy we

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.080 
season but this guy was real easy we
bought<00:00:58.530> him<00:00:58.649> as<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> seedling<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.340> while<00:00:59.460> ago<00:00:59.760> and

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
bought him as a seedling a while ago and

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.229 
bought him as a seedling a while ago and
just<00:01:00.559> planted<00:01:01.559> him<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:01.920> pot<00:01:02.129> yeah<00:01:02.879> and

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
just planted him in this pot yeah and

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.649 
just planted him in this pot yeah and
let<00:01:03.390> him<00:01:03.539> go<00:01:04.760> and<00:01:05.760> at<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.060> point<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.450> think

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
let him go and at this point I think

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.200 
let him go and at this point I think
this<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.990> maybe<00:01:07.490> you<00:01:08.490> know<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.700> maybe<00:01:08.760> about

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
this is maybe you know this maybe about

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.810 
this is maybe you know this maybe about
four<00:01:09.479> months<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.840> growth<00:01:10.369> one<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.520> reasons

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
four months of growth one of the reasons

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.550 
four months of growth one of the reasons
what<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.000> really<00:01:12.390> like<00:01:12.600> putting<00:01:12.840> parsley<00:01:13.409> and

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
most of my herbs in pots

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.950 
most of my herbs in pots
there's<00:01:15.869> some<00:01:16.020> marjoram<00:01:16.229> there<00:01:16.590> some<00:01:17.040> mint

time<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.610> like<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.640> put<00:01:20.820> them<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.000> pots<00:01:21.259> for

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
time I like to put them in pots for

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.399 
time I like to put them in pots for
several<00:01:22.530> reasons<00:01:22.920> one<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> mobility<00:01:24.409> so

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
several reasons one is the mobility so

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.320 
several reasons one is the mobility so
if<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:25.770> guy<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.040> getting<00:01:26.340> too<00:01:26.939> much<00:01:26.970> Sun

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
if this guy is getting too much Sun

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.149 
if this guy is getting too much Sun
let's<00:01:27.689> say<00:01:27.810> parsley<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.409> full<00:01:28.680> Sun<00:01:28.920> and

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
let's say parsley is full Sun and

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.679 
let's say parsley is full Sun and
sometimes<00:01:29.340> partial<00:01:29.909> shade<00:01:30.119> depending<00:01:30.600> in

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
sometimes partial shade depending in

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.350 
sometimes partial shade depending in
your<00:01:30.840> area<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.740> have<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.610> mobility<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.150> just

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
your area you have the mobility to just

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.359 
your area you have the mobility to just
kind<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.570> grab<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.110> move<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.740> around<00:01:34.860> find

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
kind of grab it and move it around find

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.920 
kind of grab it and move it around find
a<00:01:35.460> place<00:01:35.640> that's<00:01:35.880> more<00:01:36.000> conducive<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
a place that's more conducive to the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.850 
a place that's more conducive to the
growth<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.590> plant<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:39.439> other<00:01:40.439> thing<00:01:40.829> that

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
growth of the plant the other thing that

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.530 
growth of the plant the other thing that
I<00:01:40.979> really<00:01:41.340> like<00:01:41.490> about<00:01:41.700> putting<00:01:42.000> these<00:01:42.240> in

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
I really like about putting these in

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.810 
I really like about putting these in
pots<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.320> you're<00:01:44.250> gonna<00:01:44.310> get<00:01:44.490> plenty<00:01:44.640> of

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
as it gets some sunlight it'll do fine

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.289 
as it gets some sunlight it'll do fine
indoors<00:02:05.189> as<00:02:05.340> well<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:05.850> you've<00:02:06.030> got<00:02:06.180> the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
indoors as well so you've got the

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.660 
indoors as well so you've got the
mobility<00:02:06.810> I've<00:02:07.320> got<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.680> planet<00:02:08.039> right<00:02:08.250> next

to the door to our kitchen so while I'm

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.950 
to the door to our kitchen so while I'm
cooking

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
cooking

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.570 
cooking
I<00:02:12.990> need<00:02:13.230> some<00:02:13.380> parsley<00:02:13.710> I<00:02:13.800> can<00:02:14.190> just<00:02:14.340> come<00:02:14.460> out

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
I need some parsley I can just come out

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.570 
I need some parsley I can just come out
here<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.120> grab<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.330> couple<00:02:15.570> of<00:02:15.750> twigs<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.580> snap

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
here and grab a couple of twigs and snap

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.500 
here and grab a couple of twigs and snap
them<00:02:17.760> off<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:19.730> continue<00:02:20.730> on<00:02:20.880> with<00:02:20.910> my<00:02:21.150> cooking

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
them off and continue on with my cooking

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.980 
them off and continue on with my cooking
and<00:02:22.070> I<00:02:23.070> think<00:02:23.340> just<00:02:23.520> in<00:02:23.640> general<00:02:23.780> having<00:02:24.780> fresh

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
and I think just in general having fresh

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.670 
and I think just in general having fresh
herbs<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:26.580> really<00:02:28.040> efficient<00:02:29.040> way<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.660> to

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
herbs is a really efficient way to to

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.500 
herbs is a really efficient way to to
utilize<00:02:31.680> herbs<00:02:32.340> for<00:02:32.580> your<00:02:32.730> cooking<00:02:33.030> because

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
utilize herbs for your cooking because

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.360 
utilize herbs for your cooking because
you<00:02:33.630> only<00:02:33.750> use<00:02:33.960> what<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.230> need<00:02:34.380> so<00:02:34.920> let's<00:02:35.250> say

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
you only use what you need so let's say

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.340 
you only use what you need so let's say

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
for example if I wanted to come out here

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.470
