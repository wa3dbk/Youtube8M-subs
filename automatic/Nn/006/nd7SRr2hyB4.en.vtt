00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.850
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.710
 video are the videos comment a bit 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.940
 about the September event good and 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.940
 let's go with the video 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.500
 do not 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.119
 it's worth as a first point we have the 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.590
 I return the chances good for those who 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.150
 do not know that at the chance or she has 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.380
 started playing recently radio 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.849
 Latin simply the chances are 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.380
 opportunities that you have Latin region 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.379
 to be able to redeem these opportunities 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.210
 by items either good items to luck 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.610
 I mean and I'll explain a little more or less 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.930
 how to get these chance points 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.659
 there are simply three way to 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.430
 get it either the first one is to redeem 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:44.930
 30 30 event points for one 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.030
 opportunity of chance the second is 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.860
 spend a thousand of cash and they give you a 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.390
 Chance opportunity for change of 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.579
 street until the third is good for 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.949
 this only for new users who 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.600
 they create an account and at the moment of 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.269
 do a street reload of that account 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.800
 they give you 10 chance point 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.449
 automatically and good and how it is redeemed 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.280
 good the way to use these points of 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.479
 chance is quite simple simply 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.920
 we have to go to the event page 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.509
 of Latin ranking that would be the event of 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.220
 September that I will leave the description 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.780
 of the video directly so that they 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.940
 direct directly here and simply 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.410
 As you can see on the first page , the 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.450
 stay has come back we are just going 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.009
 to take the chance that will ask you to 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.020
 enter your good account here is 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.400
 entered my account and just to 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.870
 redeem for example if you want to change 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.370
 you use point of sale for one 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:31.370
 about to events and young for every 30 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.100
 points you can take an opportunity and 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.420
 it's worth, then, we exchange and try our luck 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.590
 with any attempt you want by 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.180
 example and I will try my luck with a 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.250
 leopard of the 99 the three opportunities 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.840
 well this is just to test and 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.480
 mistake is not that you're going to leave 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.310
 always so this is practically a 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.290
 get lucky and then nothing for this is 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.890
 for those who did not know and we go with the 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.890
 next point 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.490
 and good as next point we have the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.410
 special event for users who 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.710
 They have been inactive since June 1 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.690
 from 2013 to the date practically 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.790
 just what it will be 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.830
 give them practically 6 points of 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.810
 completely permanent stacks which 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.490
 it would cost 6400 of streets in the store 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.890
 but a here that there is no 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.810
 confusion because the 1400's of houses that 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.430
 says that in the store it is practically 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.320
 what it would cost the six points stacks 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.960
 I do not have to give you the 6400's 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.490
 houses for being an inactive user and 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.110
 well here the truth is that there was not much 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.650
 that clarify so we go with the 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.650
 next point 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.700
 well I feel we have the event of 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.560
 combo of creatures that practically 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.080
 as a creature came out in the event of 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.280
 July in regular and obviously in this 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.890
 September event what he proposes 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.069
 Latin radio is to use three creatures to 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.900
 make a combo practically and good we 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.150
 gives different prizes when using 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.620
 for example a creature two creatures or 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.900
 at the moment use the three creatures that 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.250
 would be the absolute prize and good the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.880
 creature of the moment that you are to do 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.040
 the combo are the wire blaster vassilis 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.440
 and finally that would be the creature 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.450
 Subus relatively at the time of use 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.340
 as you will see here the combo creatures you 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.720
 the benefit that I would give you for 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.459
 example of using a creature would make you 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.400
 experience per hundred when using two 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.950
 creatures would make you experience for 200 and 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.360
 gold per 100 and at the time of using it 3 of 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.130
 height not varying one hundred percent of 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.280
 event point 300 percent of 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.730
 experience and experience or gold for 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.590
 2 practically this can already vary already 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.120
 that in this first week this what 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.269
 has not proposed Latin radio but already 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.830
 this is updated on September 16 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.209
 that they would practically change 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.680
 creatures I think every week or every 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.170
 two weeks change 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.640
 creatures and good to know what are 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.959
 the creatures that are in combos 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.879
 we just do not go to the book of 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.159
 creatures and we look for the creature that 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.769
 have the word on the top 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:54.439
 event that would be the creature that is in 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.060
 that moment of events practically and 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:58.010
 would give us the same benefits and then 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.579
 nothing this is all and we go with the 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.579
 next point 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.010
 well as seven points we have a 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.420
 special event commemorating the 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.740
 new pond that have closed the region 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.630
 to you but it practically consists of 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.400
 take a picture with your biggest record or 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.080
 be it with the best record you have ever made 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.739
 to overcome is these people take a picture 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.209
 upload it to facebook share it with the 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.880
 official facebook page of region 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.830
 I know that the winner is practically 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.800
 Do it in less time or you will have to 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.600
 be legendary plus 15 good one thing 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.820
 I wanted to clarify is not that you 're going to give 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.040
 a legendary being simply that you 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.510
 will make this armor practically no no 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.390
 is that he is going to be a legendary being with 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.100
 background or with red background practically 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.250
 it would simply be this legendary that 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.280
 this one would seat armor that still more 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.110
 15 and one day cloud plus 15 practically 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.460
 It is that's the prize and going for nothing 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.460
 with the next point 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.919
 and good as the next point the truth 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.110
 which is quite clear simply 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.090
 we will get 100 of recas for each 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.760
 victory that we have per day by 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.889
 example spend the midnight hour 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.990
 Peruvian obviously spent midnight if 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.540
 das is a victory and virtually 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.220
 'he does not have regÃ¡s during all that day and 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.110
 practically you will not be able to get the 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.550
 100 of recas during all that day until 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.530
 that midnight does not arrive 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.090
 next day and then nothing simply 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.200
 this is quite simple to understand and 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.200
 we go with the following 

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:33.839
 as next point we have the the 

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:36.119
 award the tie capsule for a new 

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:38.099
 achievement title that you simply get 

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:40.020
 gives us an example here and regional worth 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.459
 for example to obtain the achievement 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.259
 curious to practically buy you 

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:45.240
 simply a cost interest although it is 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:47.520
 any of these costumes you buy one 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.469
 this and they would make you an achievement and at the moment 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.419
 in which you in achievement for example the 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:54.059
 you will receive the prize at the moment 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:56.309
 use but you go to the achievement and see 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:58.409
 achievements that are not used and for example 

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:59.819
 the moment you get for example the 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:02.039
 curious achievement or any other achievement 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:03.839
 you simply give it to use and at the moment 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.419
 that is already in use should give you the 

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:09.179
 prize of the die capsule to me not me what 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.949
 they will do it because I have already obtained it so 

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:13.439
 Well nothing this is simple to understand well 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:15.149
 that we go with the following good one 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:18.330
 thing first of all does not have to be 

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:19.740
 necessarily obtain or be the achievement of 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.479
 curious can be any other achievement 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.769
 that there is in Latin arc and then nothing 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:24.769
 we go with 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.139
 do not 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.700
 well the truth the last point there is no 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.600
 much to explain because it is what 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.980
 we have always had the 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.260
 letter collection on this occasion is 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.870
 simply september and its fraction and what 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.520
 what would be the exchange of event items 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.560
 in the store that is practically what 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.540
 we have always had so here there is no 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.580
 a lot to tell and well here I say goodbye 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.120
 with this video and then nothing until a 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.120
 next video
