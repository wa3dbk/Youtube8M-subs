00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.180 

you

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.570 

all<00:02:43.460> right<00:02:43.610> so<00:02:43.790> tip<00:02:44.180> for<00:02:44.360> doing<00:02:44.570> this<00:02:44.690> is<00:02:44.960> to

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
all right so tip for doing this is to

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.240 
all right so tip for doing this is to
not<00:02:46.580> do<00:02:46.820> it<00:02:46.850> downhill<00:02:47.300> at<00:02:47.780> all<00:02:47.930> because<00:02:48.250> you

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
not do it downhill at all because you

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.970 
not do it downhill at all because you
just<00:02:49.460> get<00:02:49.850> going<00:02:50.180> too<00:02:50.330> fast<00:02:50.570> flat<00:02:51.530> is<00:02:51.740> pretty

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
just get going too fast flat is pretty

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.010 
just get going too fast flat is pretty
good<00:02:52.130> but<00:02:52.400> like<00:02:52.580> a<00:02:52.640> little<00:02:53.150> bit<00:02:53.300> of<00:02:53.390> a<00:02:53.480> slope<00:02:53.780> is

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
good but like a little bit of a slope is

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.590 
good but like a little bit of a slope is
this<00:02:54.200> perfect<00:02:54.920> because<00:02:55.610> you<00:02:55.820> just<00:02:56.030> won't<00:02:56.360> pick

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
this perfect because you just won't pick

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.630 
this perfect because you just won't pick
up<00:02:56.720> much<00:02:56.990> speed<00:02:57.320> you<00:02:57.530> can<00:02:57.680> just<00:02:57.860> keep<00:02:58.040> going<00:02:58.070> so

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
up much speed you can just keep going so

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.960 
up much speed you can just keep going so
it's<00:02:58.820> like<00:02:59.030> perfect<00:02:59.890> another<00:03:00.890> tip<00:03:01.100> is<00:03:01.250> like<00:03:01.580> my
