00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.120
 very well 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.770
 welcome to a new video tutorial 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.200
 what I'm going to teach you to do 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.299
 turning istac in achievement or trophy 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.610
 the flesh is death these steps are 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.560
 much more complicated and tedious than 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.330
 the americans so do not trust and 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.670
 as always this interest can be done 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.050
 from one to four people and like me 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.330
 I say, I recommend you do it from one 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.650
 because the first step is much easier 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.089
 is to activate the four valves that 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.740
 may appear throughout the 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.570
 culvert to know what these are 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.520
 valves just see how they can see 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.110
 on the screen is a tube in the middle and as 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.700
 than a thicker tube and if the valve 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.950
 is there they will see a wheel 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.170
 orange as I said there are 30 possible 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.820
 locations 15 in the first zone of 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.710
 the sewer 15 in the second zone 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.230
 near burger town and only in four of 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.789
 these are going to find this orange wheel 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.410
 I'm showing you the locations 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.879
 on screen in a slightly fast way 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.649
 so that they more or less know where to look 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.300
 where can you find them and once 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.460
 find these 4 valves have to 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.570
 activate the with x the wheel will rotate and 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.800
 will start to smoke 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.480
 once you activate the four 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.860
 corresponding valves one door 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.480
 secret behind the waterfall to the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.159
 the sewer entrance is going to open and 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.530
 will give us access to a new 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.119
 in this new room in the center is going to 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.829
 have as a platform where 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.509
 we have to place the golden pan 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:17.890
 this is in the first zone in 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.689
 the start at the top 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.460
 we need the exo suit to be able 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.590
 reach it we will go up to these 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.969
 platforms that are in this area and 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.069
 then we will jump to be able 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:28.899
 take it press x and the icon goes to 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:30.490
 appear in the file on the right 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.079
 of our identification after 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.240
 we get we have to go to the area that 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:36.130
 we just discovered and we're going to put the 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.810
 pan in the middle part we're going to 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.939
 see that the platform is going to go down and it's going 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.500
 to be sealed on the floor now what 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.259
 we have to do is kill around 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.969
 50 to 70 zombies if they are playing alone 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.950
 if I'm not wrong, more people more 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:50.259
 zombies but it 's a theory like I said 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.670
 we kill around 60 or 70 zombies by 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.020
 of the pan it is worth mentioning that the 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.789
 zombies have to be in the area 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.829
 circular you can be anywhere 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.149
 with the weapon that is but the zombies 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.950
 they have to be in the middle part 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.659
 so that the sacrifice so to speak 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.399
 count once you have completed this 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.289
 step the platform will ascend from 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.429
 new and can take the pan once 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.599
 that they do the icon will be a 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.399
 little different from what I was at 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:10.989
 principle since the pan is loaded 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.970
 so to speak, we have to take it to 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.230
 burger town burger and in the 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.280
 part of inside let's find the 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.050
 stove let's press 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.580
 to put the pan on top now what 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.530
 we have to do is find four 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.360
 pieces of meat different one for each 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.160
 map area except at the beginning 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.680
 which are burger sound station 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.120
 load culverts and command atlas like 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.190
 I already said there is one meat for each of 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.110
 these zones and in each area there are around 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.190
 of six locations where you can 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.660
 find the meat 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.640
 Here I show you the locations 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.400
 possible of all these areas first 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.260
 burgers even after the sewers 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.850
 after the atlas command and finally 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.800
 the charging station what they have to 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.230
 do one by one is to find these 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.610
 meats take them and take them to the pan 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.810
 they will see that every time they arrive and 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.820
 press here is going to form a 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.260
 little pile of meat does not matter the order 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.850
 that you all choose to appear 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.250
 at the same time however they can only 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.900
 Load one meat at a time once 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.310
 have put all the meat on top of the 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.510
 pan are going to realize that the meat 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.610
 is going to be compressed and now what 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.590
 we need is to cook it for it we go 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.569
 to use the special weapon the magnetron the 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.270
 which appears in the box and we 're going to 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.070
 shoot until a bell rings 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.990
 since it will be the bell and that they come out 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.760
 sparks to the meat is that it is ready 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.040
 Now what we have to do is look 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.180
 the hamburger bun to get it 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.430
 what we have to do is kill 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.380
 zombies and eventually a zombie 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.000
 hamburger one of those zombies that 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.190
 has a burger town report will 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.050
 drop this bread as you can see is in 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.760
 turkey shape is floating and is very 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.320
 easy to see, I recommend that what 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.970
 do is that at the beginning of the round go 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.590
 to the sewers to gather everyone 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.180
 the zombies and then kill them out of 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.100
 they this is because the sewers 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.780
 is where there is more percentage of appearance 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.490
 of the hamburger zombies since 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.020
 have the bread this is going to be at your base 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.880
 and what they have to do is go back to 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.500
 pan and place it once they do 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.000
 the hamburger is going to form and they have 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.620
 to take it once you take it 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.720
 they are going to be infected and they have to go to the 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.310
 disinfection area to be disinfected and 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.960
 once they do it they will have the 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.760
 hamburger and they have to give it to 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.110
 bobby burger mascot and now 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.940
 what we have to do is get a 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.440
 battery and charge it first for 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.150
 get it we have to go to the command 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.500
 atlas and construction where 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.880
 find the box will be a panel 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.140
 where they will show us a diagram of 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.030
 bobby what we have to do is 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.490
 press x and we will hear a sound of 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.200
 confirmation immediately since this 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.940
 It is proof of time we have to run 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.780
 towards the other construction and opposite 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.700
 generator 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.709
 is going to be a gray box which is going to 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.000
 open for about 5 or 10 seconds after 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.740
 that you press x on the 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.419
 diagram and inside being the battery 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.770
 to take it simply press x 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.510
 as I said in this have to be 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.740
 fast because otherwise the box will 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.540
 it's going to close again and they have to go back 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.160
 to personar x in the diagram once 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.720
 have the battery have to charge it and 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.610
 to do this they have to take it to the 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.710
 charging station and just in this 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.669
 zone has to put the pressure on xy 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.650
 they will realize that on the screen 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.960
 you see start loading they are going to load 4 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.000
 bars from 0 to 4 one and another and 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.620
 again they have to wait around 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.750
 one minute for this battery to charge 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.490
 without any zombie hitting him because the 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.800
 zombies can throw it away if this happens 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.390
 press x on the battery thrown and it goes 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.100
 to start charging again this is because 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.660
 time and not by rounds that you 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.340
 can keep a zombie distracted and 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.810
 just be loading it wait for a 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.430
 minute and then having it is not 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.690
 necessary that it be in the middle of the 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.370
 round plus it's more difficult 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.570
 when the battery is charged in the 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.860
 screen will show us the four 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.780
 completely static bars 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.430
 blinking meaning that the charge 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.229
 is complete now we are going to take it from 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.669
 new with xy in the battery file 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.200
 now it will be red meaning that 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.880
 it's loaded since we have it 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.950
 to go back with bobby and we're going to 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.960
 delivering the change will give us a 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.230
 key this key will serve us for 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.880
 open 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.590
 the hatch that's in the hamburger 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.850
 giant burger town to access 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.860
 We have to go to the burger ceiling 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.540
 town climb these stairs and press x 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.710
 in this hatch once we do 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.510
 let's go into the giant hamburger 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.190
 which is like a command center and 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.660
 opposite we're going to have a screen in 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.400
 which if we press x will tell us 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.380
 that we do not have access to get 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.790
 access first we need a unit of 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.620
 memory that is in the locker 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.000
 at the beginning however for this 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.950
 we have to identify ourselves but 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.020
 we need help from a zombie and the 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.580
 crocodiles we have to go to the area of 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.440
 the sewer where the 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.580
 crocodile trap what are we going to 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.320
 to do is activate the trap and 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.540
 crocodiles and just when a crocodile 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.550
 you eat a zombie no matter what kind of 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.080
 zombie no matter what kind of animation 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.790
 make the crocodile no matter what weapon 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.770
 have you just once the 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.390
 crocodile be like a zombie and come out 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.040
 you have to shoot them zombie as well 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.540
 if they were stealing the zombie from 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.340
 crocodile as if you wanted to kill him 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.870
 before he did it and once 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.670
 that this happens you will see that the arm goes 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.560
 to keep flying and going to fall in the water 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.840
 the arm is floating and you have to 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.610
 approach him and press x once 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.350
 let's have the arm of the zombie or the hand 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.580
 specifically we have to go back to 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.530
 start where there will be a 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.270
 hand identifier we are going to press 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.350
 x and we're going to use the zombie hand to 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.480
 that reminded us 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.130
 once this happens the box goes away 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.900
 open and inside this is going to be the 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.880
 memory unit that we need to 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.890
 identify ourselves in the hamburger so 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.780
 let's go back up there we're going to 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.980
 press x on the screen and let's see 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.750
 that the memory unit is going to stay 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.190
 in this place he will expel us from the 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.230
 burger and it's going to start raining 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.910
 burger pumps shortly after 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.440
 to start a countdown and a 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.090
 rocket is going to be launched from the 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.410
 burger to the sky when this 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.880
 pass we can climb back to the 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.070
 hamburger take the memory unit 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.170
 which will be blue instead of red and 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.790
 we 're going to deliver it to bobby once 

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:03.340
 that we do this the interest will be 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:05.230
 completed by taking advantage of this video 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.970
 I want to deny that rumor that says 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.680
 There are two different endings with steps 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:11.050
 completely different this is false 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.150
 gentlemen because it was understood in a way 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.460
 incorrect what they saw in two videos 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.500
 different specifically first the 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.390
 first video that many of us saw from the end 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.860
 of view that was the one of noa and what happens 

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.780
 if when not delivery the unit of 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.120
 bobby bobby memory self-destructs 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.590
 immediately in many other videos already 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.420
 after this we realize that 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.610
 bobby as in mine comes alive and 

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.840
 start killing zombies a lot of people that 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.880
 me that how these two things were 

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.740
 different were different steps but not 

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.449
 what happens is that I do not deliver 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.160
 of memory maybe with the zombie with the 

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:40.870
 last about what was very far away such 

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.490
 At the end of the round, what happens is 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.780
 that there were no zombies so I'm going to kill 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.340
 then since I have nothing to do 

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.050
 there he self-destructed in a way 

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.130
 immediate however if there are zombies 

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.509
 close to bobby is going to help 

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.400
 kill them and after about five minutes 

00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:53.080
 it's going to happen the same thing he went back to dancing and 

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.639
 then it goes self-destruct 

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.830
 deliver the four possible clubs of 

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:58.539
 map and to disappear once leaving 

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.009
 this clear gentlemen that already mole the video 

00:07:58.539 --> 00:08:01.630
 today I hope you have stayed very 

00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:03.069
 clear the steps and anything I 

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.360
 can ask for twitter or in the 

00:08:03.069 --> 00:08:05.919
 comments so well nothing thanks 

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:09.270
