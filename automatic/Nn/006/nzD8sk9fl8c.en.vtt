00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
guys to start off it's a lot longer than

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.110 
guys to start off it's a lot longer than
I<00:00:12.000> thought<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.240> was<00:00:13.490> but<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.519> like<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.969> length

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
I thought it was but I like the length

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.210 
I thought it was but I like the length
because<00:00:15.389> it<00:00:15.540> definitely<00:00:16.170> allows<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.039> do<00:00:17.190> a

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
because it definitely allows you to do a

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.279 
because it definitely allows you to do a
lot<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.609> different<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.330> can<00:00:18.510> get<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.020> lot<00:00:19.199> of

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
lot of different you can get a lot of

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.290 
lot of different you can get a lot of
stuff<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.650> there<00:00:19.770> when<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.180> when<00:00:21.180> you're

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
stuff in there when you when you're

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.640 
stuff in there when you when you're
trying<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.600> do<00:00:21.750> lines<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.320> stuff<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:24.500> if<00:00:25.500> I

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
trying to do lines and stuff so if I

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.830 
trying to do lines and stuff so if I
were<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.830> guess<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.340> would<00:00:26.369> say<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:26.910> about<00:00:28.039> 12

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
were to guess I would say it's about 12

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.740 
were to guess I would say it's about 12
12<00:00:30.840> 13<00:00:31.560> inches<00:00:31.920> long<00:00:31.980> about<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.700> foot<00:00:32.969> long<00:00:33.000> and

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
about you know five inches wide which is

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.430 
about you know five inches wide which is
definitely<00:00:37.620> enough<00:00:37.829> width<00:00:38.610> for<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.440> to

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.080 
as a said before then you can also
combine<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.460> with<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:03.470> rail<00:01:04.470> or<00:01:04.799> something<00:01:05.220> to

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
combine it with the rail or something to

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.390 
combine it with the rail or something to
have<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> little<00:01:07.439> like<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.920> could<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.130> up<00:01:08.280> a

little<00:01:09.110> set<00:01:10.110> here<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.560> go<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> rail<00:01:12.110> for

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
little set here you go on the rail for

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.870 
little set here you go on the rail for
sure<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.439> guys<00:01:13.560> can<00:01:13.740> think<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.130> many<00:01:14.280> ways<00:01:14.580> to

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
sure you guys can think of many ways to

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.679 
sure you guys can think of many ways to

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.899 
everything is really smooth
both<00:01:21.210> copings<00:01:21.930> are<00:01:22.229> very<00:01:23.040> smooth<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.490> there

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
both copings are very smooth like there

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.390 
both copings are very smooth like there
is<00:01:24.000> not<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> single<00:01:24.840> little<00:01:25.049> dent<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.220> this

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
is not a single little dent in this

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.760 
is not a single little dent in this
besides<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.689> ones<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.140> I've<00:01:28.259> already<00:01:28.470> made

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
from Rodney on so this side has a square

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.609 
from Rodney on so this side has a square
coping<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.950> which<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.810> good<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.560> don't

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
coping to it which is good and I don't

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.230 
coping to it which is good and I don't
really<00:01:40.799> know<00:01:41.040> what's<00:01:41.280> bad<00:01:41.549> about<00:01:41.579> having<00:01:42.060> a

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
really know what's bad about having a

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.539 
really know what's bad about having a
square<00:01:42.509> coping<00:01:43.049> but<00:01:43.500> yeah<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.009> it's<00:01:44.130> nice<00:01:44.340> how

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
square coping but yeah so it's nice how

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.700 
square coping but yeah so it's nice how
it<00:01:44.670> also<00:01:44.790> has<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.509> side<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.200> round

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
it also has on this side the round

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.550 
it also has on this side the round
coping<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:48.960> then<00:01:49.229> over<00:01:49.619> here<00:01:50.810> is<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.200> square

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
coping and then over here is the square

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.319 
coping and then over here is the square
coping<00:01:54.259> look<00:01:55.259> at<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.470> detail<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:56.189> like<00:01:57.119> both

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
coping look at that detail I like both

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.719 
coping look at that detail I like both
of<00:01:57.360> them<00:01:57.920> probably<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.070> one<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.520> like

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
of them probably in the one that I like

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.030 
of them probably in the one that I like
more<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.450> round<00:02:01.380> coping

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
more is the round coping

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.770 
more is the round coping
there's<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.130> lot<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.700> don't<00:02:05.939> know<00:02:06.119> just<00:02:06.450> it's<00:02:06.689> a

there's a lot I don't know just it's a
little<00:02:06.869> up<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:07.560> higher<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.520> can<00:02:08.729> have<00:02:08.849> a

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
little up it's higher so you can have a

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.479 
little up it's higher so you can have a
little<00:02:09.060> more<00:02:09.229> nicer<00:02:10.229> ride<00:02:10.860> when<00:02:11.250> you're<00:02:11.400> just

the<00:02:22.950> only<00:02:23.280> issue<00:02:23.519> I<00:02:23.760> have<00:02:24.120> with<00:02:24.150> this<00:02:24.599> which<00:02:24.959> is

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
the only issue I have with this which is

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.589 
the only issue I have with this which is
just<00:02:25.140> just<00:02:25.709> mine<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.280> don't<00:02:26.760> know<00:02:26.910> if<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.450> know

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
just just mine I don't know if you know

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.030 
just just mine I don't know if you know
I<00:02:27.720> don't<00:02:28.019> know<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.140> don't<00:02:28.349> think<00:02:28.410> all<00:02:28.709> of<00:02:28.739> them

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
I don't know I don't think all of them

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.630 
I don't know I don't think all of them
are<00:02:29.220> like<00:02:29.370> this<00:02:29.550> but<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:30.870> can<00:02:31.080> see<00:02:31.550> there's<00:02:32.550> a

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
are like this but you can see there's a

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.190 
are like this but you can see there's a
little<00:02:32.849> wobble<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.599> it<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:33.959> this<00:02:34.140> is

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
little wobble to it and this is

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.890 
little wobble to it and this is
definitely<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.769> flat<00:02:35.040> surface<00:02:35.780> it's<00:02:36.780> only

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
definitely a flat surface it's only

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.650 
definitely a flat surface it's only
about<00:02:37.019> a<00:02:37.110> couple<00:02:37.350> millimeters<00:02:37.769> but<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.340> mean<00:02:38.660> so

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
about a couple millimeters but I mean so

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.680 
about a couple millimeters but I mean so
it's<00:02:39.780> not<00:02:39.900> like<00:02:40.110> it's<00:02:40.620> not<00:02:40.769> like<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:41.480> but<00:02:42.480> ya

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
it's not like it's not like that but ya

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.750 
it's not like it's not like that but ya
know<00:02:42.930> there's<00:02:43.230> so<00:02:43.500> much<00:02:43.650> wobble<00:02:43.980> but<00:02:44.640> yeah

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
know there's so much wobble but yeah

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.690 
know there's so much wobble but yeah
other<00:02:45.030> than<00:02:45.299> that<00:02:45.510> this<00:02:45.810> this<00:02:46.319> this<00:02:47.100> ramp<00:02:47.400> is

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
other than that this this this ramp is

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.770 
other than that this this this ramp is

very nice it's simple yet effective
