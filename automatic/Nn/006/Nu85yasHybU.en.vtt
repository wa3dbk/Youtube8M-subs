wanting<00:00:48.260> to<00:00:48.380> do<00:00:48.500> this<00:00:48.650> I<00:00:48.950> was<00:00:49.220> reading<00:00:49.930> online

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
wanting to do this I was reading online

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.780 
wanting to do this I was reading online
that<00:00:53.120> what<00:00:53.239> this<00:00:53.420> actually<00:00:53.690> does<00:00:54.610> is<00:00:55.610> that

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
that what this actually does is that

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.600 
that what this actually does is that
there<00:00:56.030> is<00:00:56.210> a<00:00:56.360> way<00:00:57.489> to<00:00:58.489> speed<00:00:59.390> up<00:00:59.860> the<00:01:00.860> lag<00:01:01.130> that

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
there is a way to speed up the lag that

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.940 
there is a way to speed up the lag that
is<00:01:02.180> in<00:01:02.329> the<00:01:02.450> camera<00:01:02.690> I<00:01:02.960> don't<00:01:03.020> use<00:01:03.410> the<00:01:03.620> camera

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
is in the camera I don't use the camera

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.730 
is in the camera I don't use the camera
very<00:01:04.129> often<00:01:04.699> but<00:01:05.509> when<00:01:05.659> I<00:01:05.719> do<00:01:05.840> I<00:01:06.289> haven't

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
very often but when I do I haven't

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.700 
very often but when I do I haven't
experienced<00:01:07.340> any<00:01:07.609> lag<00:01:07.909> issues<00:01:08.450> but<00:01:09.409> if<00:01:09.530> you

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
experienced any lag issues but if you

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:17.649 
experienced any lag issues but if you
have<00:01:09.979> then<00:01:10.729> this<00:01:10.939> is<00:01:11.210> a<00:01:14.709> step<00:01:15.709> to<00:01:16.459> go<00:01:16.670> about

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
have then this is a step to go about

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.230 
have then this is a step to go about
fixing<00:01:17.899> that<00:01:18.289> so<00:01:19.130> basically<00:01:19.549> I<00:01:19.909> have<00:01:20.119> this

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
fixing that so basically I have this

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.580 
fixing that so basically I have this
print<00:01:20.569> variant<00:01:21.079> which<00:01:21.200> is<00:01:21.409> the<00:01:21.560> LS<00:01:21.920> 980<00:01:22.429> I<00:01:23.590> need

so but I did click on device test and I

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:07.539 
so but I did click on device test and I
mean<00:02:05.569> there's<00:02:06.169> just<00:02:06.439> all<00:02:06.679> kinds<00:02:06.709> of<00:02:07.369> things

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
mean there's just all kinds of things

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.960 
mean there's just all kinds of things
that<00:02:07.669> come<00:02:07.939> up<00:02:07.969> and<00:02:08.299> then<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:08.750> can<00:02:09.379> go<00:02:09.500> in<00:02:09.649> here

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
that come up and then you can go in here

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.940

control<00:02:13.400> it

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
control it

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.430 
control it
you<00:02:14.290> slide<00:02:14.710> it<00:02:14.890> if<00:02:15.520> you<00:02:15.670> do<00:02:15.820> this<00:02:16.080> click<00:02:17.080> on<00:02:17.260> it

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
you slide it if you do this click on it

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.010
