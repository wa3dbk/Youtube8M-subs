00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.849
 hello all good morning today let's see 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.849
 some wicks berries 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.789
 the many battles can be reached 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.310
 confuse with the Californian mass but 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.380
 it's really not the same many 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.329
 examples that were looking yes that is 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.699
 true that they resemble a lot but it's 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:34.170
 which is a combination in the end what 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:37.149
 I'm looking between a name or a few wicks 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.550
 Californian a man battles worth 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.550
 You really have the bullet technique already 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.290
 would be the word battles comes from the 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.899
 French that means sweep and it would be 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.390
 make some freehand wicks with the 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.300
 back of the palentina soaking and 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.149
 letting drag the palentina we would go 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.660
 making sweeping movements of 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.460
 there his name so the tip goes a 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.989
 little bit more than red can be applied 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.179
 a little more discoloration in the 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.280
 tip to make that feeling that the 

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:08.080
 hair we've been on the beach and it 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.420
 colored has been clarified a 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.240
 little bit with the sun's rays that's the 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.580
 technique that is the result that is sought 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.790
 with the wicks go 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.810
 when we want more quantity of 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.420
 degraded in the hair because if 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.460
 would apply more amount of dye 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.170
 discoloration at the tips but in a 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.520
 beginning of the wicks battles 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.580
 another of the differences with the 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.100
 Californian is that they begin to little 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.730
 centimeters of the root and that becomes a 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.880
 bar code effect that not all 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.310
 they start at the same height 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.410
 the wick another fundamental difference with 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.320
 the california that the California wick 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.870
 it is nothing more what is the gradient in 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.660
 the tips even though then then that 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.240
 to the each professional takes his 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.510
 land the theory and practice there is no 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.150
 a little bit the way of doing 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.160
 the Californians or the battles but I 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.630
 I'm going to roll more than I know myself and 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.150
 I start talking and I stay alone 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.700
 let's see how we made some 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.280
 wicks for ya san andreas and there and over 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.500
 the march you go see and explain a 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.300
 little bit more step by step I hope that you 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.210
 like it and see you in the next video 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.250
 a kiss to all 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.200
 here we see Andrew to the length of your 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.840
 hair and the tone that takes it in a 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.160
 medium blond height we brush well and 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.050
 The first thing I'm going to do is 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.430
 partitions so then the application 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.430
 be much faster 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.550
 we have prepared discoloration at 30 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.220
 volumes and let's start with the 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.350
 application as you see I have not loaded the 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.390
 hair he seems kind of mixtures I do not 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.030
 because the grade is already going to 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.160
 create by making tables in code 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.650
 bars and marking a little more the 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.920
 tip is not necessary the loaded but if 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.170
 I tell you of people who do it and do not 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.300
 that's why it's badly done or badly said 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.330
 mine each in the end what I said before 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.030
 has its own practice to achieve the 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.910
 same result we are applying the 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.860
 discoloration as you see sweeping and in the 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.010
 tip we put a little bit more 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.350
 amount and so let's go layering 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.600
 per layer until finishing on top of the 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.350
 everything where we are going to mark a little more 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.350
 of quantity 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.140
 between layer and layer if you want you can 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.330
 put a protective plastic 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.430
 I do not put it because really in the 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.130
 decoration I leave a little more pomp 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.860
 and it did not leave it so creamy anymore and this makes 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.200
 that does not stain your hair when it falls 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.430
 on top also the convents that 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.830
 it paints a little bit let's say the 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.230
 surface of the lock is not not a 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.690
 decoration that will penetrate to the 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.940
 another side of the mix that we are 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.400
 painting and then what I tell you if 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.200
 you want to put a plastic but I think 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.920
 that is not necessary is not going to 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.920
 stain the hair 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.050
 this technique the good thing that it has at 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.620
 opposite with the Californian is that it is 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.620
 quickie 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.760
 joining the palentina and you are doing the 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.139
 wicks and is something very quick with some 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.519
 wicks the silver as the master and 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.620
 cutting so you always get the double 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.199
 of time you see that it is 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.150
 paint up down down up and you're 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:29.090
 done in a jiffy I think that as 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:32.229
 very late in doing it with ten minutes 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.229
 a quarter of an hour at the most 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.360
 You see we are painting very close to 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.910
 the root and we are doing different 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.070
 heights do not all go to the same height 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.110
 one takes two centimeters from the root of 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.720
 another one below and this is the effect that 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.470
 I was telling you with a barcode that 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.490
 the length 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.490
 They are different 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.650
 it helped me if you have posted down support 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.660
 with the comb you can use the comb 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.640
 or a palette that already 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.590
 what you use what you have by hand 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.680
 It is very comfortable because you support the lock 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.360
 on the comb and when sweeping the 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.850
 discoloration because of course it is more comfortable 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.380
 than having nothing underneath to fine tune the 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.540
 Your hair is going down, not knowing what 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.950
 you are painting with the comb you cited because you 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.950
 supports if it applies phenomenally 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.050
 well we have already reached the top and 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:42.320
 we separate where usually the 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.240
 line and we are going to end up making a 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.040
 a little more of quantity to frame a 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.990
 little bit more facial features 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.360
 It will always give us more luminosity 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.910
 If we make some more framed tables 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.690
 the face this discoloration we are going to 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:59.060
 let act approximately was 45 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.880
 minutes with her and when we see that the 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.040
 tips are already cleared and we will wash 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:07.070
 the head and if necessary nuance 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.660
 nuance we will do if not then to dry 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.550
 here has been the exposure time 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.620
 with a plastic to raise it before 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.840
 the discoloration you can see the tone that has 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.740
 caught on the tip so then nothing to 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:21.569
 wash we are already combing 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.569
 I'm going to take a bit off the tip 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.440
 and this is the final result the little tables 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.390
 you already know that they look pretty good 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.890
 point is more clarified and that is the 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.370
 effect that we look for with the wicks 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.370
 several 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.070
 because nothing else is there andrea has a 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.630
 very pretty face this girl so she 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.120
 Do what you do is beautiful 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.010
 thanks to Andrea for collaborating I hope 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.750
 that you will like your new look and a little kiss 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.170
 we'll all see each other in the next video 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.170
 bye
