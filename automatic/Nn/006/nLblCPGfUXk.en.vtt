lot of stretch and a large amounts into
the<00:01:47.790> stretch<00:01:48.060> more<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:49.369> this<00:01:50.369> has<00:01:50.939> proven

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
the stretch more but this has proven

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.109 
the stretch more but this has proven

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
thumbnail from about 10 feet away with a

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.150 
thumbnail from about 10 feet away with a
stone<00:02:30.780> mind<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.740> just<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.430> Flintstone<00:02:33.830> so<00:02:34.830> I

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
stone mind you just a Flintstone so I

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.730 
stone mind you just a Flintstone so I
was<00:02:35.310> really<00:02:35.520> quite<00:02:35.880> pleased<00:02:36.120> with<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.740> I

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
was really quite pleased with that and I

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.430 
was really quite pleased with that and I
was<00:02:37.890> very<00:02:38.220> surprised<00:02:38.790> just<00:02:39.450> how<00:02:39.570> much<00:02:39.810> power

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
was very surprised just how much power

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.440 
was very surprised just how much power
one<00:02:40.800> band<00:02:41.070> could<00:02:41.280> have<00:02:41.520> but<00:02:42.030> this<00:02:42.150> was<00:02:42.330> the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
one band could have but this was the

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.390 
one band could have but this was the
original<00:02:42.770> experimentation<00:02:43.770> anyway<00:02:44.069> I<00:02:44.100> wanted

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
original experimentation anyway I wanted

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.920 
original experimentation anyway I wanted
to<00:02:44.489> see<00:02:44.700> just<00:02:44.970> how<00:02:45.000> much<00:02:45.209> power<00:02:45.360> one<00:02:45.720> band

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
to see just how much power one band

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.290 
to see just how much power one band
could<00:02:46.140> have<00:02:46.410> in<00:02:47.220> at<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.430> moment<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:48.030> doesn't

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
could have in at the moment it doesn't

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.170 
could have in at the moment it doesn't
seem<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.720> be<00:02:48.810> able<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.080> go<00:02:49.310> too<00:02:50.310> far<00:02:50.760> with<00:02:51.060> a

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
seem to be able to go too far with a

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.460 
seem to be able to go too far with a
great<00:02:51.420> deal<00:02:51.630> of<00:02:51.750> power<00:02:52.760> but<00:02:53.989> nonetheless<00:02:54.989> it

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
great deal of power but nonetheless it

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.110 
great deal of power but nonetheless it
has<00:02:55.500> power<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.370> reckon<00:02:56.700> it's<00:02:56.850> enough<00:02:57.090> for

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
has power and I reckon it's enough for

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.290 
has power and I reckon it's enough for
hunting<00:02:58.370> but<00:02:59.370> it<00:03:00.000> will<00:03:00.090> take<00:03:00.269> some

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
hunting but it will take some

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.660 
hunting but it will take some
experimentation<00:03:00.840> yet<00:03:01.380> so<00:03:01.800> let<00:03:02.370> me<00:03:02.430> show<00:03:02.580> you

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
experimentation yet so let me show you

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.180 
experimentation yet so let me show you
the<00:03:02.790> full<00:03:02.940> draws<00:03:04.160> and<00:03:05.160> we'll<00:03:05.280> go<00:03:05.400> from<00:03:05.519> there

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
we're going to be shooting the stick

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.550 
we're going to be shooting the stick
shop<00:03:13.920> now<00:03:14.070> and<00:03:14.690> we're<00:03:15.690> gonna<00:03:15.780> be<00:03:15.930> doing<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.260> full

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
shop now and we're gonna be doing a full

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
the butter stick we're going to be

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.330 
the butter stick we're going to be
shooting<00:03:21.650> 9.4<00:03:22.650> for<00:03:22.890> steer<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:25.040> no<00:03:26.040> shooting

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
shooting 9.4 for steer and no shooting

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.770 
shooting 9.4 for steer and no shooting
at<00:03:26.430> any<00:03:26.580> target<00:03:26.850> today<00:03:27.240> we're<00:03:27.420> just<00:03:27.510> playing

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
at any target today we're just playing

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:41.380 
at any target today we're just playing
around

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:04:16.690 

damn<00:03:42.390> good<00:03:51.379> little<00:03:52.379> shooter

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.160 

it's<00:04:17.700> very<00:04:17.910> pleasing<00:04:18.150> it's<00:04:18.870> very<00:04:19.080> good<00:04:19.970> I

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
it's very pleasing it's very good I

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.170 
it's very pleasing it's very good I
think<00:04:22.170> with<00:04:22.290> eight<00:04:22.440> millimeter<00:04:22.860> steel<00:04:23.180> this

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
think with eight millimeter steel this

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.270 
think with eight millimeter steel this
would<00:04:24.360> be<00:04:24.450> actually<00:04:24.720> deadly<00:04:25.320> it's<00:04:25.740> not<00:04:26.070> bad

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
would be actually deadly it's not bad

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.480 
would be actually deadly it's not bad
now<00:04:26.520> but<00:04:27.210> with<00:04:27.390> eight<00:04:27.600> millimeter<00:04:28.020> steel<00:04:28.490> that

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
now but with eight millimeter steel that

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.130 
now but with eight millimeter steel that
would<00:04:29.610> be<00:04:29.670> absolutely<00:04:30.000> deadly<00:04:30.210> definitely

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
would be absolutely deadly definitely

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.740 
would be absolutely deadly definitely
and<00:04:31.790> you<00:04:32.790> should<00:04:32.970> be<00:04:33.060> able<00:04:33.150> to<00:04:33.330> take<00:04:33.480> down<00:04:33.630> all

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
and you should be able to take down all

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.540 
and you should be able to take down all
the<00:04:33.810> game<00:04:34.050> that<00:04:34.200> you<00:04:34.260> could<00:04:34.440> wish<00:04:34.620> you<00:04:35.430> know

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
the game that you could wish you know

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.920 
the game that you could wish you know
all<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:35.940> usual<00:04:36.060> stuff<00:04:36.420> anyway

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
all the usual stuff anyway

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.610 
all the usual stuff anyway
and<00:04:37.940> yeah<00:04:38.940> I'm<00:04:39.300> extremely<00:04:39.840> happy<00:04:40.140> with<00:04:40.380> it<00:04:40.470> and

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
and yeah I'm extremely happy with it and

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.810 
and yeah I'm extremely happy with it and
I<00:04:40.680> think<00:04:40.890> these<00:04:40.980> bands<00:04:41.280> are<00:04:41.310> gonna<00:04:41.490> work<00:04:41.640> out

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
I think these bands are gonna work out

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.850 
I think these bands are gonna work out
just<00:04:41.850> fine<00:04:42.150> so<00:04:43.050> I<00:04:43.110> don't<00:04:43.290> know<00:04:43.380> if<00:04:43.470> you<00:04:43.560> can<00:04:43.710> see

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
just fine so I don't know if you can see

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.030 
just fine so I don't know if you can see
this<00:04:44.120> but<00:04:45.120> we're<00:04:45.870> starting<00:04:46.110> to<00:04:46.230> get<00:04:46.380> a<00:04:46.440> tear<00:04:46.770> on

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
this but we're starting to get a tear on

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.510 
this but we're starting to get a tear on
the<00:04:47.670> pouch<00:04:47.880> end<00:04:48.150> of<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.330> taper<00:04:49.100> and<00:04:50.100> it's<00:04:50.340> not

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
the pouch end of the taper and it's not

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.360 
the pouch end of the taper and it's not
actually<00:04:51.060> off<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:52.350> balance<00:04:52.860> of<00:04:53.130> these

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
actually off the balance of these

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.710 
actually off the balance of these
connector<00:04:54.330> bands<00:04:54.510> so<00:04:55.230> I<00:04:56.150> think<00:04:57.150> this<00:04:57.450> proves

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
connector bands so I think this proves

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.230 
connector bands so I think this proves
to<00:04:57.840> be<00:04:57.870> a<00:04:57.960> successful<00:04:58.440> experiment<00:04:59.040> I<00:04:59.280> really

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
to be a successful experiment I really

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.680 
to be a successful experiment I really
do<00:05:02.360> okay

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
do okay

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.350 
do okay
thank<00:05:03.960> you<00:05:04.050> very<00:05:04.200> much
