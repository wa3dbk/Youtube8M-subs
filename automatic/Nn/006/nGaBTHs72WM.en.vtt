00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
all the seals off there the head studs

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.059 
all the seals off there the head studs
in<00:03:12.599> there<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:13.590> can't<00:03:13.829> see<00:03:14.129> with<00:03:14.579> AARP<00:03:15.030> ones

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
in there you can't see with AARP ones

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.650 
in there you can't see with AARP ones
I'm<00:03:17.069> just<00:03:17.310> going<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.489> retighten<00:03:18.150> them<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.480> to

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
I'm just going to retighten them and to

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.940 
I'm just going to retighten them and to
retighten<00:03:19.139> them<00:03:19.200> you'll<00:03:19.440> need<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.620> torque

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
retighten them you'll need a torque

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.250 
retighten them you'll need a torque
wrench<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:21.079> for<00:03:22.190> evo<00:03:23.190> engines<00:03:23.959> do<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.019> need

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
wrench and for evo engines do you need

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.300 
wrench and for evo engines do you need
to<00:03:25.459> but<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.519> think<00:03:26.819> 80<00:03:27.060> 80<00:03:27.510> Newtons<00:03:28.109> so<00:03:28.980> just

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
to but I think 80 80 Newtons so just

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.220 
to but I think 80 80 Newtons so just
check<00:03:29.730> them<00:03:29.879> if<00:03:30.150> they're<00:03:30.359> 80<00:03:30.510> Newtons<00:03:30.989> all<00:03:31.139> of

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
check them if they're 80 Newtons all of

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.780 
check them if they're 80 Newtons all of
them<00:03:31.349> step<00:03:31.650> by<00:03:31.680> step<00:03:32.239> I<00:03:33.239> can<00:03:34.099> if<00:03:35.099> you<00:03:35.310> go<00:03:35.489> to<00:03:35.549> my

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
them step by step I can if you go to my

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
exactly on what pattern exactly to

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.369 
exactly on what pattern exactly to
tighten<00:03:49.829> all<00:03:49.949> the<00:03:49.980> head<00:03:50.280> studs<00:03:50.549> in<00:03:50.760> and

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
tighten all the head studs in and

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.520 
tighten all the head studs in and
that'll<00:03:52.379> show<00:03:52.560> you<00:03:52.620> how<00:03:52.769> to<00:03:52.829> do<00:03:53.069> it<00:03:53.129> all<00:03:54.139> but<00:03:55.139> if

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
that'll show you how to do it all but if

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.599 
that'll show you how to do it all but if
you're<00:03:56.129> installing<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:56.730> new<00:03:56.760> ARP<00:03:57.660> ones

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
you're installing the new ARP ones

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.849 
you're installing the new ARP ones
you'll<00:03:59.609> need<00:03:59.790> to<00:03:59.879> remove<00:04:00.180> them<00:04:00.359> first<00:04:00.629> you

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
you'll need to remove them first you

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:04.280 
you'll need to remove them first you
just<00:04:01.859> on<00:04:02.010> dawn<00:04:02.359> you'll<00:04:03.359> need<00:04:03.540> I<00:04:03.569> think<00:04:04.049> it's<00:04:04.169> a

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
just on dawn you'll need I think it's a

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:12.910 
just on dawn you'll need I think it's a
sized<00:04:04.590> for<00:04:05.190> size<00:04:06.169> 12<00:04:07.459> size<00:04:08.459> 12<00:04:08.910> year<00:04:09.470> in

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.630 

in<00:04:13.920> those<00:04:14.630> to<00:04:15.630> remove<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.079> studs<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.640> they're

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
in those to remove the studs and they're

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.150 
in those to remove the studs and they're
the<00:04:17.790> same<00:04:17.820> as<00:04:18.150> ARP<00:04:18.570> so<00:04:19.170> you<00:04:19.739> won't<00:04:19.890> need<00:04:20.040> to<00:04:20.100> go

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
the same as ARP so you won't need to go

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.900 
the same as ARP so you won't need to go
buy<00:04:20.489> a<00:04:20.790> new<00:04:21.690> one<00:04:21.959> install<00:04:22.890> the<00:04:23.010> ARP<00:04:23.490> ones<00:04:23.760> and

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
buy a new one install the ARP ones and

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.400 
buy a new one install the ARP ones and
you<00:04:26.910> you'll<00:04:27.330> get<00:04:27.510> some<00:04:27.750> lubricant<00:04:28.260> that

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
you you'll get some lubricant that

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.530 
you you'll get some lubricant that
you'll<00:04:28.820> use

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
you'll use

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.870 
you'll use
they<00:04:31.080> got<00:04:31.380> fairly<00:04:31.860> good<00:04:32.100> instructions<00:04:32.730> on

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
they got fairly good instructions on

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.700 
they got fairly good instructions on
there<00:04:33.030> and<00:04:33.510> leader<00:04:33.750> tighten<00:04:34.260> them<00:04:34.350> down<00:04:34.380> into

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
there and leader tighten them down into

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.590 
there and leader tighten them down into
three<00:04:35.100> stages<00:04:35.490> you<00:04:35.790> can't<00:04:36.030> just<00:04:36.270> tie<00:04:36.420> them

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
three stages you can't just tie them

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.350 
three stages you can't just tie them
really<00:04:37.020> hard<00:04:37.170> down<00:04:37.410> on<00:04:37.470> one<00:04:37.770> side<00:04:37.800> or<00:04:38.010> else

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
really hard down on one side or else

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.290

I'm not going to probably see your fine

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.980 
I'm not going to probably see your fine
and<00:07:00.820> worst<00:07:01.820> comes<00:07:02.060> to<00:07:02.150> worst<00:07:02.210> you<00:07:02.480> don't<00:07:02.690> apply

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:02.990 
and worst comes to worst you don't apply

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.760 
and worst comes to worst you don't apply
the<00:07:03.050> RTV<00:07:03.770> properly<00:07:04.250> or<00:07:05.060> don't<00:07:05.510> clean<00:07:06.500> the<00:07:06.740> oil

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:06.770 
the RTV properly or don't clean the oil

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.760 
the RTV properly or don't clean the oil
off<00:07:07.190> properly<00:07:07.700> before<00:07:08.240> you<00:07:08.570> apply<00:07:08.870> the<00:07:08.900> new<00:07:09.169> TV

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:09.770 
off properly before you apply the new TV

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.520 
off properly before you apply the new TV
it<00:07:10.250> will<00:07:10.580> leak<00:07:10.850> and<00:07:11.090> you'll<00:07:11.810> need<00:07:12.050> to<00:07:12.140> redo<00:07:12.470> it

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:12.530 
it will leak and you'll need to redo it

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.270 
it will leak and you'll need to redo it
and<00:07:13.540> therefore<00:07:14.540> more<00:07:14.900> time<00:07:15.140> so<00:07:15.650> if<00:07:16.010> you<00:07:16.160> do

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.280 
and therefore more time so if you do

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.469 
and therefore more time so if you do
probably<00:07:16.550> the<00:07:16.729> first<00:07:16.910> time<00:07:17.090> you<00:07:17.270> won't<00:07:17.390> need

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:17.479 
probably the first time you won't need

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:21.340 
probably the first time you won't need
to<00:07:17.860> do<00:07:18.860> it<00:07:18.950> again<00:07:19.130> the<00:07:19.250> second<00:07:19.550> time<00:07:20.169> that's<00:07:21.169> it

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:21.350 
to do it again the second time that's it

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.060 
to do it again the second time that's it
oh<00:07:21.500> and<00:07:21.919> it<00:07:22.250> was<00:07:22.430> a<00:07:22.460> half<00:07:22.729> inch<00:07:23.860> half<00:07:24.860> inch

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.070 
oh and it was a half inch half inch

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.150 
oh and it was a half inch half inch
