 this is the after a tournament 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.119
 international gaming with a squad 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.119
 different 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.710
 with what what is wrong sector 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.960
 neo is that you already come packed for 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.920
 get to a semifinal and they tell you 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.880
 that the second leg of the cup 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.880
 america because it is 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.190
 at the moment that Mexican soccer 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.040
 linking the liberating cup is over 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.040
 the sponsorship and now 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.300
 thing that they can beat the game of 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.800
 the league and the cup liberators themselves 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.460
 and I do not think that conmebol is going to 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.930
 help 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.930

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.780
 unfortunately we still want 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.770
 clothe and have that paternalistic stance 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.770
 that they always treat us badly 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.360
 gerardo they sell it to blue cross for the 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.400
 next season 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:08.250
 what happens if I grab it they sell it to the real 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:10.980
 madrid what happens if you do not want to work 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.440
 the street does not make quarters semifinal of 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.880
