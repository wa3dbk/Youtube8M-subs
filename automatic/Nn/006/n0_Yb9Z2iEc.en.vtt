 to welcome a chance 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.890
 my father has a lot of this company 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.209
 adopted and a hot dog 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:17.180
 Contract workshop led to the turn 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.720
 after the turn we were a ford main 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.069
 dealer 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.610
 and I have been the company since 2005 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.610
 taken over by my father 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.300
 as announced, we are busy 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.290
 today with the topic of cleaning that 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.640
 soot particulate filters would like them now 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.510
 show where this is on the vehicle 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.910
 The soot particle filter is located 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.410
 after the engine directly in the 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.799
 exhaust system and cleans the exhaust emission 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.860
 in front of the existing particles and 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.959
 pollutants of diesel vehicles to 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.080
 viewpoint we have of a 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.180
 another model a soot particle filter 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.239
 sliced 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.069
 on the basis of the small slats one can 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.840
 realize that sometime after a certain 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.510
 kilometers these run to 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:23.750
 put and the vehicle at power 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:25.849
 Loses some vehicle manufacturers have 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.430
 a self-cleaning in their vehicles 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.400
 built-in system that gets you though 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.760
 not at all based on that 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.690
 highway at certain speeds itself 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.730
 but not always 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.910
 100% sufficient and around 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.720
 an exchange of the particulate filter too 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.150
 save 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.970
 the cost amounted to from 600 to 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.160
 We offer 1200 euro in our 3d audio 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.700
 Serves in all a cleaning system 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.810
 the company liquidate moly at 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.470
 this is a 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:02.389
 cleaning fluid by means of a 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:05.660
 compressed air cylinder and a probe in front of the 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:07.670
 particulate filter 1 is sprayed this 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.940
 Liquid will be with several saying 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.160
 filled and then acts approximately 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.450
 15 to 20 minutes in these 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.450
 soot particle filter 1 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.940
 After that we will fill the conditioner 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.669
 these over this mouth before the 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.970
 soot particulate filter and rinse all 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.830
 dissolved particles and soot components 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.180
 out of the field 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.950
 after that the filter has an almost 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.950
 mint condition 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:42.399
 as you could see dear spectators 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.550
 is the cleaning of one 

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:46.899
 soot particle filter no witchcraft 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.819
 towards the exchange of such 

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:50.739
 save you immense costs
