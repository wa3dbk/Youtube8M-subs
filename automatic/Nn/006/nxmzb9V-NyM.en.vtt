00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.820
 all very good friends behind 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.339
 special sessions that we have made 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.620
 by the thousand subscribers we are here of 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:10.030
 new with a new video of celadas en 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.160
 this time we are going to try the 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.440
 Ponciano opening that is then going to 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.539
 like 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.509
 this opening is characterized by 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:20.460
 movements of four of five horse 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.779
 efe three horses of six and in this 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.560
 chance if you do not want to play in a 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:30.820
 opening of the Spanish adventure type with 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.890
 the film 5 or Italian opening with the c4 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.520
 there are other variants like it could be 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.110
 the Scottish opening where four but 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.309
 this time we are going to focus on the 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.410
 puncture and that plays c3 the opening 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.800
 what good 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:51.130
 of a ranked match but in many 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.930
 of its variants can become very 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.340
 Tactic has enough tricks 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.900
 hidden 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.090
 usually black for example can 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.720
 Eph 6 play today as in the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.240
 game and here you play 4 trying 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.760
 to black capture the pawn of 4 is one of 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.630
 the answers in fact in the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.440
 game was made horse by 4 but there 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.960
 three very valid plays such as 5 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.049
 operated by 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.880
 which we are not going to analyze but 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.640
 we are going to focus on the one that was played in 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.369
 the game that is horse by 4 of 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.009
 horse for the 4 the move that should 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.890
 make the target is 5 hugging the 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:38.869
 16 horse that has to be retired 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:41.030
 well bird 8 well there are 7 and in the game of 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.070
 retirement there are 7 already a very movement 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.110
 tempting 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:50.020
 at some point when the 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.020
 horse would be 6 but 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.630
 this time the white plays the 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.500
 theoretical that is the horse by pawn 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.060
 and the black moves his horse ag6 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.860
 trying to change the horse so 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.540
 centralized that have white and 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.090
 so powerful 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.330
 and a variant that you usually play is 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.670
 horse per pawn per bishop of 3 with 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.280
 good position for white without 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.430
 But here White decided 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.439
 play bishop 3 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.700
 directly threatening the horse of 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:26.390
 four and leaving his 5 horse without 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.130
 defending 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.760
 could be changed for example here 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.939
 capture horse for 5 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.120
 and white would capture this horse 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:40.360
 from here in 40 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.790
 Black decided to spin thinner 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:48.110
 they thought that with the horse play by 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.920
 efe 2 simply in the case that the 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.560
 white capture 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.160
 they have a good game in the first 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.349
 place for example horse for winning a 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.650
 pawn and then enter with the lady giving 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:05.040
 a series of checks is also could be 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.040
 very valid 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.710
 however the amazing play by 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:17.170
 part of white 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.170
 finally by g6 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.370
 this move was taken into account by 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.500
 blacks who thought that with horse by 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.540
 efe 2 are already going to stay at least with 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.200
 a pawn of magas as well as having a 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:32.530
 very misplaced position of the white king 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.060
 however bishop by axis 6 and a play 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.330
 totally surprising since it is 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:41.990
 sacrificing his lady at a glance 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.700
 the black takes it because you do not see that the 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.280
 white can have compensation for it 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.740
 however it has totally fallen into the 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.140
 and we are going to see what the 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.800
 outcome of the game 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.740
 obviously bishop by black only 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:02.240
 you can move your king of 7 comes another check 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:06.950
 around here the g5 returns the black to move to 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:11.150
 a single box of 6 as we see here 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.680
 is already threatening the way but there is 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.250
 an even better movement to capture 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:19.820
 the lady who is riding c4 giving you new 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.610
 check as you see the black king always 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.010
 has totally limited boxes and 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.280
 you have to go if 5 is doing 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.430
 a tour around the board and here 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.800
 you could have eaten too 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.310
 the white ladies if they have material of 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.530
 plus 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.930
 As you can see, the black king also begins 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.960
 is poorly placed the white will put 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.310
 get enrooted and this black horse has 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.710
 difficulties to leave 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:52.110
 however they decided to play a play 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:56.340
 much more aesthetic I do not know if you see it 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:58.140
 it's horse ba3 I want it to be threatened 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.540
 well, in the event that a 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:03.020
 move 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:06.230
 meaningless for example to 6 is 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.920
 threatening b4 by checkmate the king in 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.920
 the center of the board 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:17.609
 precisely the one that came to the end of 

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:19.109
 the game but in the event that 

00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:20.879
 make the best move that is horse 

00:05:19.109 --> 00:05:23.939
 by c3 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:25.649
 simply after the film by de ama 25 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:28.739
 always making the best movements 

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:30.350
 for the black pawn per pawn for 

00:05:28.739 --> 00:05:32.600
 castling 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:37.310
 planner develops the profile for example 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:40.820
 to 6 and the white catch as of balls 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.590
 white have a piece besides the black king 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.600
 is in the center of the board and also 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.490
 Black does not have any kind of 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:50.750
 development so the advantage on the part 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:53.780
 of white is very big is decisive 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:57.620
 so nothing, let's go over what it is 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.590
 today's C3 opening trap 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.250
 Ponciano 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:06.580
 of 4 and in the case of capture the pawn 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:09.480
 Blacks of 4 simply have to 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:12.010
 move forward to annoy the horse and 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.680
 capture the pawn that defended 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:17.320
 precisely the horse of cesc and is 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.180
 good move horse g6 that normally 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.610
 the horse is usually done by g6 but in 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.310
 the game was made bishop of 3 trying 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.920
 the black ones to capture in f2 and 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.050
 it was precisely what happened with what 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.540
 that here already white has a 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:35.770
 pretty favorable departure 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:39.150
 in this case after bishop if it is done 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:41.530
 pawn for simply doing lady fingers 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:44.590
 beginning a mortal discovery with 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:47.230
 stage horse has to come the lady 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:50.980
 there are seven and with report 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:54.580
 White has cleaner pieces 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:56.919
 they will be able to enter the tower there is one 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.120
 at any time that they will be by 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:02.010
 middle of the column 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:07.100
 but what is the trap is simply 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:09.880
 he makes bishop for and on this occasion 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:13.180
 after horse 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:17.800
 the fil per check since all these 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:22.150
 unique players again check and move the 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:25.660
 horse to 3 threatening checkmate m4 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:27.300
 this is where they abandoned them since 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:31.090
 after any movement for example 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:33.610
 inconsequential type to 6 look at me 4 with 

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:35.230
 Checkmate any other variant to 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:38.080
 white women are left with great material 

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:40.690
 more so nothing friends today has become 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:43.900
 republish videos with greater 

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:46.840
 frequency and good I guess there's 

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:48.430

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.640
