it's a little bit of an oddball I wonder
if<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:40.170> almost<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:41.250> kind<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.329> prerequisite<00:00:43.320> to

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
if it's almost a kind of prerequisite to

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.250 
if it's almost a kind of prerequisite to
a<00:00:43.649> release<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.550> mirrorless<00:00:44.969> camera<00:00:45.629> anyway

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
a crop sensor bodies so I'm gonna be

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.520 
a crop sensor bodies so I'm gonna be
testing<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:50.879> out<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.329> both<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.989> Canon<00:00:52.320> 5d

I'll also be filming a little bit with

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.010 
I'll also be filming a little bit with
this<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.309> can<00:01:05.489> get<00:01:05.580> an<00:01:05.700> idea<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:06.180> how<00:01:06.450> this

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
this so you can get an idea of how this

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.679 
this so you can get an idea of how this
lens<00:01:07.320> performs<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.369> both<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.090> crop<00:01:09.299> sensor

and<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> full-frame<00:01:10.290> camera<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.189> let's<00:01:11.400> get

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
and a full-frame camera so let's get

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.670 
and a full-frame camera so let's get
started<00:01:11.909> testing<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> Canon<00:01:12.840> 40<00:01:13.290> millimeter

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680

I<00:01:37.140> will<00:01:37.590> warn<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.220> focus<00:01:38.549> ring<00:01:38.700> is

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
I will warn you that the focus ring is

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.270 
I will warn you that the focus ring is
actually<00:01:39.180> fly-by-wire<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.650> same<00:01:40.860> system

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
actually fly-by-wire the same system

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.569 
actually fly-by-wire the same system
that<00:01:41.310> Canon<00:01:42.090> used<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.869> 85<00:01:43.170> millimeter<00:01:43.770> f12

with 5d Mark 3 on a full frame body

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.640 
with 5d Mark 3 on a full frame body
you'll<00:04:56.669> be<00:04:56.790> able<00:04:56.970> to<00:04:57.030> see<00:04:57.270> pretty<00:04:57.810> much<00:04:57.960> all<00:04:58.169> of

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
you'll be able to see pretty much all of

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.460 
you'll be able to see pretty much all of
the<00:04:58.979> lens<00:04:59.220> in<00:04:59.520> action<00:05:00.240> and<00:05:00.419> get<00:05:00.630> an<00:05:00.750> idea<00:05:01.229> of

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
the lens in action and get an idea of

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.100 
the lens in action and get an idea of
how<00:05:01.890> well<00:05:02.160> it<00:05:02.280> performs<00:05:02.850> in<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.479> corners<00:05:03.900> as

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
how well it performs in the corners as

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.140 
how well it performs in the corners as
far<00:05:04.320> as<00:05:04.440> sharpness<00:05:04.979> is<00:05:05.130> concerned<00:05:05.580> let's<00:05:06.000> look

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
far as sharpness is concerned let's look

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.240 
far as sharpness is concerned let's look
at<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.330> vignetting<00:05:06.810> test<00:05:07.350> first

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
at the vignetting test first

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.240 
at the vignetting test first
so<00:05:09.030> you'll<00:05:09.570> notice<00:05:09.840> right<00:05:10.169> away<00:05:10.229> at<00:05:10.800> this

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
so you'll notice right away at this

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.370 
so you'll notice right away at this
perspective<00:05:11.550> that<00:05:11.910> the<00:05:12.390> center<00:05:12.870> brightness

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
perspective that the center brightness

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.280 
perspective that the center brightness
is<00:05:13.620> pretty<00:05:14.580> decent<00:05:14.790> as<00:05:15.150> you<00:05:15.570> start<00:05:16.050> to<00:05:16.140> go<00:05:16.229> to

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
is pretty decent as you start to go to

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.540 
is pretty decent as you start to go to
the<00:05:16.380> edges<00:05:16.680> you'll<00:05:16.800> notice<00:05:17.100> that<00:05:17.280> there<00:05:17.520> is

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
the edges you'll notice that there is

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.420 
the edges you'll notice that there is
fairly<00:05:18.270> strong<00:05:18.750> vignette<00:05:19.380> in<00:05:19.560> the<00:05:19.950> corners

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
fairly strong vignette in the corners

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.990 
fairly strong vignette in the corners
here<00:05:20.970> and<00:05:21.290> here<00:05:22.290> if<00:05:22.650> we<00:05:22.800> go<00:05:22.979> ahead<00:05:23.100> and<00:05:23.310> zoom<00:05:23.940> in

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
here and here if we go ahead and zoom in

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.890 
here and here if we go ahead and zoom in
and<00:05:24.810> pull<00:05:25.650> over<00:05:25.919> it's<00:05:26.520> pretty<00:05:26.820> noticeable<00:05:27.180> the

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
and pull over it's pretty noticeable the

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.270 
and pull over it's pretty noticeable the
change<00:05:28.380> in<00:05:29.030> exposure<00:05:30.030> from<00:05:30.540> the<00:05:30.660> corner<00:05:31.350> to

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
change in exposure from the corner to

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.860 
change in exposure from the corner to
the<00:05:32.910> center's<00:05:33.300> you<00:05:33.419> can<00:05:33.540> see<00:05:33.690> that

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
the center's you can see that

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.830 
the center's you can see that
brightening<00:05:34.650> up<00:05:34.919> pretty<00:05:35.640> fast<00:05:35.940> and<00:05:36.390> we'll<00:05:36.720> go

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
brightening up pretty fast and we'll go

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.350 
brightening up pretty fast and we'll go
to<00:05:36.930> 50%<00:05:37.500> so<00:05:38.070> it's<00:05:38.700> a<00:05:38.760> little<00:05:38.940> bit<00:05:39.030> easier<00:05:39.060> to

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
to 50% so it's a little bit easier to

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.420 
to 50% so it's a little bit easier to
see<00:05:39.660> you<00:05:39.840> can<00:05:39.990> see<00:05:40.169> the<00:05:40.320> difference<00:05:40.740> up<00:05:40.979> here

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
see you can see the difference up here

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.450 
see you can see the difference up here
from<00:05:42.090> down<00:05:42.360> here<00:05:42.810> there<00:05:43.169> is<00:05:43.320> very<00:05:43.770> strong<00:05:44.190> venn

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
from down here there is very strong venn

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.420 
from down here there is very strong venn
getting<00:05:44.910> on<00:05:45.150> a<00:05:45.210> full-frame<00:05:45.900> camera<00:05:46.290> at<00:05:46.470> F<00:05:46.650> 2.8

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
getting on a full-frame camera at F 2.8

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.620 
getting on a full-frame camera at F 2.8
now<00:05:47.910> let's<00:05:48.270> switch<00:05:48.510> over<00:05:48.780> to<00:05:49.310> the<00:05:50.630> sharpness

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
now let's switch over to the sharpness

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.890 
now let's switch over to the sharpness
test<00:05:52.200> here<00:05:52.710> and<00:05:52.910> you<00:05:53.910> can<00:05:54.060> see

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
test here and you can see

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.439 
test here and you can see
ready<00:05:55.110> just<00:05:55.470> from<00:05:55.740> this<00:05:56.100> bit<00:05:56.669> that<00:05:57.090> it<00:05:57.240> looks

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
ready just from this bit that it looks

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:59.270 
ready just from this bit that it looks
pretty<00:05:57.840> sharp<00:05:57.960> we'll<00:05:58.830> go<00:05:58.949> to<00:05:59.009> a<00:05:59.070> hundred

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
pretty sharp we'll go to a hundred

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.460 
pretty sharp we'll go to a hundred
percent<00:05:59.520> here<00:06:00.000> and<00:06:00.030> look<00:06:00.479> in<00:06:00.600> the<00:06:00.660> center<00:06:01.169> and

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
percent here and look in the center and

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.230 
percent here and look in the center and
you<00:06:01.800> can<00:06:01.949> see<00:06:02.130> that<00:06:02.310> Center<00:06:02.580> sharpness<00:06:03.030> is

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
you can see that Center sharpness is

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.540 
you can see that Center sharpness is
excellent<00:06:03.930> as<00:06:04.080> we<00:06:04.680> scroll<00:06:05.009> out<00:06:05.190> to<00:06:05.430> the

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
excellent as we scroll out to the

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.550 
excellent as we scroll out to the
corners<00:06:05.940> you<00:06:06.509> will<00:06:06.660> notice<00:06:06.990> the<00:06:07.139> vignetting

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
corners you will notice the vignetting

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.790 
corners you will notice the vignetting
but<00:06:08.070> you<00:06:08.250> still<00:06:08.669> get<00:06:09.000> very<00:06:09.300> good<00:06:09.900> sharpness<00:06:10.620> in

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
but you still get very good sharpness in

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.770 
but you still get very good sharpness in
the<00:06:10.889> corners<00:06:11.310> even<00:06:11.520> on<00:06:11.820> a<00:06:11.850> full<00:06:12.210> frame<00:06:12.449> body

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
the corners even on a full frame body

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.740 
the corners even on a full frame body
and<00:06:13.080> scrolling<00:06:13.919> up<00:06:14.160> to<00:06:14.340> the<00:06:14.460> top<00:06:14.699> corner<00:06:15.000> there

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
and scrolling up to the top corner there

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.499 
and scrolling up to the top corner there
is<00:06:16.020> still<00:06:16.500> pretty<00:06:16.889> decent<00:06:17.130> sharpness<00:06:17.970> overall

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:18.509 
is still pretty decent sharpness overall

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:23.810 
is still pretty decent sharpness overall

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:07.169 
the 40 millimeter lens its size means

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:08.450 
the 40 millimeter lens its size means
that<00:07:07.380> it'll<00:07:07.500> probably<00:07:07.560> get<00:07:08.010> packed<00:07:08.250> in<00:07:08.430> your

of<00:07:11.430> a<00:07:11.849> body<00:07:12.389> cap<00:07:12.810> so<00:07:13.139> it's<00:07:13.289> something<00:07:13.500> that<00:07:13.650> you

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:13.770 
of a body cap so it's something that you

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.800 
of a body cap so it's something that you
could<00:07:14.010> leave<00:07:14.190> on<00:07:14.340> your<00:07:14.460> camera<00:07:14.940> all<00:07:15.210> the<00:07:15.510> time

the<00:07:16.470> positives<00:07:17.010> are<00:07:17.220> definitely<00:07:17.909> the<00:07:18.060> size

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:18.330 
the positives are definitely the size

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.290 
the positives are definitely the size
and<00:07:18.690> the<00:07:19.530> focusing<00:07:20.039> distance<00:07:20.580> the<00:07:20.970> focus

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.300 
and the focusing distance the focus

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.120 
and the focusing distance the focus
rings<00:07:21.539> a<00:07:21.690> little<00:07:22.050> bit<00:07:22.199> hokey<00:07:22.620> and<00:07:22.650> I<00:07:22.949> would

rings a little bit hokey and I would
have<00:07:23.220> liked<00:07:23.490> to<00:07:23.580> have<00:07:23.639> seen<00:07:23.760> a<00:07:23.909> window<00:07:24.389> on<00:07:24.539> here

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 
have liked to have seen a window on here

have liked to have seen a window on here
indicating<00:07:25.409> the<00:07:25.590> focus<00:07:26.039> distance<00:07:26.580> but<00:07:27.240> you

00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 
indicating the focus distance but you

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:29.480 
indicating the focus distance but you
can't<00:07:27.870> ask<00:07:27.990> for<00:07:28.139> everything<00:07:28.500> especially<00:07:28.949> at<00:07:29.460> a
