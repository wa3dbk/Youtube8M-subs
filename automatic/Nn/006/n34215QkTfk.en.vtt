00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.920 
sound of the lid screwing off is is like
Pavlovian<00:00:48.010> so<00:00:48.970> as<00:00:49.269> soon<00:00:49.390> as<00:00:49.510> they<00:00:49.629> hear<00:00:49.750> the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
Pavlovian so as soon as they hear the

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.680 
Pavlovian so as soon as they hear the
lid<00:00:50.280> they're<00:00:51.280> salivating<00:00:51.610> there's<00:00:52.239> dopamine

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
lid they're salivating there's dopamine

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.380 
lid they're salivating there's dopamine
firing<00:00:53.260> you<00:00:53.530> know<00:00:55.769> exactly<00:00:56.769> exactly<00:00:57.280> so<00:00:57.790> you

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
firing you know exactly exactly so you

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.399 
firing you know exactly exactly so you
get<00:00:58.540> a<00:00:58.570> little<00:00:58.659> bit<00:00:58.780> of<00:00:58.839> conditioning<00:00:59.290> there

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
get a little bit of conditioning there

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:00.990
