also<00:02:37.820> that<00:02:38.000> rotation<00:02:38.630> lock<00:02:38.780> switch<00:02:39.080> now<00:02:39.530> these

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
also that rotation lock switch now these

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.949 
also that rotation lock switch now these
are<00:02:40.040> quite<00:02:40.340> buried<00:02:40.880> inside<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.420> case<00:02:41.720> and

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
are quite buried inside the case and

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.320 
are quite buried inside the case and
that<00:02:42.470> is<00:02:42.650> both<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:43.040> good<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.489> bad<00:02:43.910> point

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
that is both a good and bad point

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.290 
that is both a good and bad point
because<00:02:45.019> the<00:02:45.170> case<00:02:45.380> Oh<00:02:45.620> does<00:02:46.400> overhang<00:02:47.030> the

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
because the case Oh does overhang the

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.610 
because the case Oh does overhang the
actual<00:02:47.660> iPad<00:02:47.930> it's<00:02:48.140> going<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.350> offer<00:02:48.470> that

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
actual iPad it's going to offer that

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.040 
actual iPad it's going to offer that
extra<00:02:49.100> protection<00:02:49.580> from<00:02:50.180> drops<00:02:50.750> on<00:02:50.989> the

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
extra protection from drops on the

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.229 
extra protection from drops on the
corners<00:02:51.650> on<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:52.190> top<00:02:52.430> or<00:02:52.640> from<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:52.940> bottom

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
corners on the top or from the bottom

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.000 
corners on the top or from the bottom
but<00:02:53.690> that<00:02:53.840> does<00:02:54.019> make<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.380> a<00:02:54.440> little<00:02:54.500> bit<00:02:54.800> more

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
but that does make it a little bit more

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.949 
but that does make it a little bit more
difficult<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.760> get<00:02:56.150> your<00:02:56.299> finger<00:02:56.660> in<00:02:56.750> there

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
difficult to get your finger in there

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.750 
difficult to get your finger in there
and<00:02:56.989> adjust<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.560> volume<00:02:57.799> but<00:02:58.459> I'm<00:02:58.549> quite

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
and adjust the volume but I'm quite

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.940 
and adjust the volume but I'm quite
happy<00:02:58.970> with<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.690> way<00:02:59.840> it<00:02:59.870> does<00:03:00.290> protect<00:03:00.650> the

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
happy with the way it does protect the

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.880 
happy with the way it does protect the
