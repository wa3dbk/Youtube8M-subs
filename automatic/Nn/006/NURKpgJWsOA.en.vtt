00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.979

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.550
 remove their skin, whether it's their dice in the 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.190
 rubber bag 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.310
 Note that freshly cleaned and so we 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.500
 clean and already clean once I'm going to 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.230
 slice like the onion in lines 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.060
 while I keep showing how they have been 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.670
 already clean 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.980
 but totally our 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.930

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.330
 it also makes them were not totally 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.520

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.560

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.819
 There I went, the name 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:28.260
 habanero but this one does not buy it 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.030
 because the truth is very very this 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.579
