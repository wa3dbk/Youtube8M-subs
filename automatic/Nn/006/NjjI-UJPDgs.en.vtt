it<00:04:23.990> was<00:04:24.200> the<00:04:24.320> best<00:04:24.590> race<00:04:24.800> that<00:04:24.950> I've<00:04:25.040> ever<00:04:25.190> had

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
it was the best race that I've ever had

it was the best race that I've ever had
to<00:04:25.880> that<00:04:26.120> point<00:04:26.420> when<00:04:26.990> I<00:04:27.050> crossed<00:04:27.320> that<00:04:27.500> finish

to that point when I crossed that finish

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.060 
to that point when I crossed that finish
line<00:04:27.980> I<00:04:28.040> almost<00:04:28.610> lost<00:04:29.060> it<00:04:29.390> when<00:04:29.750> I<00:04:30.140> saw<00:04:30.410> the

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
line I almost lost it when I saw the

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.540 
line I almost lost it when I saw the
time<00:04:31.340> board<00:04:31.820> and<00:04:32.140> how<00:04:33.140> fast<00:04:33.590> I<00:04:33.830> had<00:04:33.980> gone<00:04:34.190> and

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
time board and how fast I had gone and

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.270 
time board and how fast I had gone and
when<00:04:35.090> I<00:04:35.120> saw<00:04:35.390> where<00:04:35.720> I<00:04:35.750> was<00:04:35.990> in<00:04:36.170> the<00:04:36.260> field<00:04:36.590> but

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
when I saw where I was in the field but

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.560 
when I saw where I was in the field but
it<00:04:37.370> was<00:04:37.490> a<00:04:37.520> very<00:04:37.670> emotional<00:04:38.210> for<00:04:38.240> me<00:04:38.450> because

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
it was a very emotional for me because

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.150 
it was a very emotional for me because
had<00:04:39.470> worked<00:04:39.800> so<00:04:40.100> hard<00:04:40.130> for<00:04:40.730> so<00:04:41.510> long<00:04:42.040> and<00:04:43.040> it

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
had worked so hard for so long and it

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.710 
had worked so hard for so long and it
seemed<00:04:43.430> there<00:04:43.640> was<00:04:43.700> a<00:04:43.760> couple<00:04:44.150> times<00:04:44.390> I<00:04:44.540> had

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
seemed there was a couple times I had

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.480 
seemed there was a couple times I had
been<00:04:44.870> close<00:04:45.260> to<00:04:45.440> qualifying<00:04:45.590> for<00:04:45.950> Kona<00:04:46.250> but<00:04:46.460> I

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
been close to qualifying for Kona but I

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.360 
been close to qualifying for Kona but I
made<00:04:46.670> a<00:04:46.700> mistake<00:04:46.820> and<00:04:47.540> this<00:04:47.990> time<00:04:48.200> I<00:04:48.230> I<00:04:48.620> really

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
made a mistake and this time I I really

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.470 
made a mistake and this time I I really
nailed<00:04:49.730> it<00:04:50.000> and<00:04:50.770> it<00:04:51.770> was<00:04:51.980> the<00:04:52.310> realization<00:04:52.940> of

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
nailed it and it was the realization of

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.940 
nailed it and it was the realization of
a<00:04:53.600> dream<00:04:53.630> of<00:04:54.110> mine

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
a dream of mine

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.620 
a dream of mine
what<00:04:55.520> started<00:04:55.910> for<00:04:56.060> him<00:04:56.150> as<00:04:56.300> a<00:04:56.330> couple

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
what started for him as a couple

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.090 
what started for him as a couple
push-ups<00:04:56.990> in<00:04:57.110> a<00:04:57.200> cellblock<00:04:57.440> eventually

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
push-ups in a cellblock eventually

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.270 
push-ups in a cellblock eventually
became<00:04:58.370> qualifying<00:04:59.090> for<00:04:59.330> Hawaii<00:04:59.630> I<00:05:00.280> think

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
became qualifying for Hawaii I think

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.760 
became qualifying for Hawaii I think
he's<00:05:01.460> becoming<00:05:01.970> the<00:05:02.150> voice<00:05:02.330> for<00:05:02.540> people<00:05:02.870> that

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
he's becoming the voice for people that

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.100 
he's becoming the voice for people that
have<00:05:04.130> used<00:05:04.370> the<00:05:04.580> sport<00:05:04.910> to<00:05:05.450> turn<00:05:05.870> their<00:05:05.990> lives

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
have used the sport to turn their lives

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.560 
have used the sport to turn their lives
around<00:05:06.290> in<00:05:06.590> a<00:05:06.650> positive<00:05:07.130> way<00:05:07.280> I<00:05:07.550> think<00:05:08.150> it's

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
around in a positive way I think it's

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.410 
around in a positive way I think it's
the<00:05:08.960> idea<00:05:09.290> of<00:05:09.700> whatever<00:05:10.700> it<00:05:10.940> was<00:05:11.090> you<00:05:11.270> were
