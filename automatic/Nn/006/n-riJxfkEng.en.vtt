think the fact that all of us the cast

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:09.609 
think the fact that all of us the cast
together

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.750 

nobody's<00:01:10.619> competing<00:01:11.100> against<00:01:11.430> each<00:01:11.520> other

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
nobody's competing against each other

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.000 
nobody's competing against each other
you<00:01:12.540> know<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.810> monkey<00:01:12.930> star<00:01:13.260> costume<00:01:13.439> but

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
you know it's a monkey star costume but

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.370 
you know it's a monkey star costume but
we<00:01:14.130> all<00:01:14.310> have<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.630> know<00:01:15.750> been<00:01:15.869> on<00:01:16.020> each<00:01:16.200> other

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
each other to towards a better product I

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.010 
each other to towards a better product I
think<00:01:23.280> that's<00:01:23.580> that's<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.909> USP<00:01:24.360> off<00:01:24.509> off<00:01:24.780> of

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
think that's that's the USP off off of

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.330 
think that's that's the USP off off of
them<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.200> think<00:01:25.259> that's<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> primary<00:01:25.770> reason

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
them I think that's the primary reason

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.120 
them I think that's the primary reason
why<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.549> film<00:01:26.880> has<00:01:27.509> had<00:01:27.780> such<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> happy<00:01:28.890> ending

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
why the film has had such a happy ending

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.280 
why the film has had such a happy ending
the<00:01:29.880> reviews<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.299> have<00:01:30.540> come<00:01:30.810> out<00:01:30.930> have<00:01:31.170> been

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
the reviews that have come out have been

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.380 
the reviews that have come out have been
very<00:01:31.590> favorable<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.640> some<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.360> said

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
very favorable to you and some have said

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.960 
very favorable to you and some have said
that<00:01:33.810> perhaps<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:34.890> overshadowed<00:01:35.310> ABI

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
that perhaps you have overshadowed ABI

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.520 
that perhaps you have overshadowed ABI
shake<00:01:36.210> that's<00:01:36.720> not<00:01:36.900> possible

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
shake that's not possible

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.390 
shake that's not possible
no<00:01:37.950> one<00:01:38.159> can<00:01:38.340> overshadow<00:01:39.470> anyone<00:01:40.470> else<00:01:40.650> that's

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
no one can overshadow anyone else that's

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.039 
no one can overshadow anyone else that's
what<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.579> said<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.240> spirit<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.689> film<00:01:42.930> is

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
what I said the spirit of the film is

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.300 
what I said the spirit of the film is
the<00:01:43.079> fact<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.649> know<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:43.829> work<00:01:44.040> as<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.220> team

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
the fact that you know we work as a team

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.550 
the fact that you know we work as a team
and<00:01:44.670> that's<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.570> think<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.990> reason<00:01:46.259> why<00:01:46.380> it's

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
and that's I think the reason why it's

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.800 
and that's I think the reason why it's
it's<00:01:46.829> such<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> big<00:01:47.220> success<00:01:47.369> we<00:01:48.240> can<00:01:48.390> see<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
it's such a big success we can see the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.510 
it's such a big success we can see the
amount<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.110> hard<00:01:49.320> work<00:01:49.560> we've<00:01:49.770> also<00:01:50.130> read

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
amount of hard work we've also read

about the chemistry with Aishwarya Rai

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.580 
about the chemistry with Aishwarya Rai
this<00:02:50.600> was<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.750> thing<00:02:51.930> with<00:02:52.050> chemistry

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
this was the thing with chemistry

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.310 
this was the thing with chemistry
I<00:02:52.739> believed<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:53.489> that<00:02:53.790> it's<00:02:54.030> always<00:02:54.420> inherent

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
I believed is that it's always inherent

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.580 
I believed is that it's always inherent
in<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:56.220> writing<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:56.940> any<00:02:57.810> two<00:02:58.050> good<00:02:58.230> actors

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
in the writing and any two good actors

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.220 
in the writing and any two good actors
can<00:02:59.430> pull<00:02:59.910> that<00:03:00.000> off<00:03:00.769> but<00:03:01.769> it's<00:03:02.690> piques<00:03:03.690> the

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
can pull that off but it's piques the

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.160 
can pull that off but it's piques the
expression<00:03:04.920> is<00:03:05.040> always<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:06.480> know<00:03:06.510> motivated

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
expression is always you know motivated

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.840 
expression is always you know motivated
and<00:03:07.290> trickles<00:03:07.920> down<00:03:07.950> from<00:03:08.130> from<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.640> sauce

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
and trickles down from from the sauce

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.280 
and trickles down from from the sauce
which<00:03:09.120> is<00:03:09.150> which<00:03:09.480> is<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.660> writing<00:03:09.870> which<00:03:10.140> is

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
which is which is the writing which is

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.190 
which is which is the writing which is
the<00:03:10.380> scene<00:03:10.560> so<00:03:11.489> it's<00:03:11.670> not<00:03:11.760> inherent<00:03:12.360> in<00:03:12.570> the

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
the scene so it's not inherent in the

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.539 
the scene so it's not inherent in the
reading<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.799> know<00:03:13.890> when<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.280> read<00:03:14.430> the

not even Herren tin that it's never
going<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.060> come<00:03:18.120> out<00:03:18.329> you<00:03:18.720> know<00:03:18.750> no<00:03:19.290> matter<00:03:19.470> who

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
going to come out you know no matter who

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.259 
going to come out you know no matter who
the<00:03:19.950> actors<00:03:20.280> are<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.000> think<00:03:21.180> it's

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
the actors are so you think it's

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.880 
the actors are so you think it's
possible<00:03:21.420> to<00:03:21.750> have<00:03:21.840> for<00:03:22.380> a<00:03:22.410> hero<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:22.860> a

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
possible to have for a hero and a

possible to have for a hero and a
heroine<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.280> have<00:03:23.400> good<00:03:23.579> chemistry<00:03:23.810> even<00:03:24.810> if

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
heroine to have good chemistry even if

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.210 
heroine to have good chemistry even if
the<00:03:25.140> script<00:03:25.350> is<00:03:25.500> well<00:03:25.709> written<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.040> they're

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
the script is well written and they're

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.100 
the script is well written and they're
good<00:03:26.340> actors<00:03:26.489> even<00:03:27.000> if<00:03:27.120> maybe<00:03:27.660> they<00:03:27.840> hate<00:03:28.049> each

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
good actors even if maybe they hate each

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.960 
good actors even if maybe they hate each
other<00:03:28.440> off<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.860> sets<00:03:29.100> absolutely

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
other off the sets absolutely

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.509 
other off the sets absolutely
okay<00:03:31.519> yeah<00:03:32.519> okay<00:03:33.390> but<00:03:33.840> it<00:03:34.769> has<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.160> be<00:03:35.250> said<00:03:35.489> you

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
okay yeah okay but it has to be said you

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.340 
okay yeah okay but it has to be said you
think<00:03:35.760> that<00:03:35.940> there<00:03:36.180> are<00:03:36.209> some<00:03:36.600> heroines<00:03:37.079> with

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
think that there are some heroines with

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.620 
think that there are some heroines with
which<00:03:37.560> an<00:03:37.799> actor<00:03:38.340> has<00:03:38.519> much<00:03:38.850> more<00:03:39.090> chemistry

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
which an actor has much more chemistry

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.560 
which an actor has much more chemistry
on-screen<00:03:39.780> than<00:03:40.440> with<00:03:40.709> others<00:03:41.040> so<00:03:41.549> then<00:03:41.700> what

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
on-screen than with others so then what

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.390 
on-screen than with others so then what
is<00:03:42.720> fail<00:03:42.930> because<00:03:43.230> clearly<00:03:43.769> there's<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.160> lot

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
is fail because clearly there's a lot

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.060 
is fail because clearly there's a lot
going<00:03:44.700> for<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.329> film<00:03:45.510> too<00:03:46.019> as<00:03:46.380> I<00:03:46.560> said<00:03:46.829> it's

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
going for the film too as I said it's

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.030 
going for the film too as I said it's
it's<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.760> it's<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.299> writing<00:03:48.630> that<00:03:48.750> fails<00:03:49.739> if

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
it's the it's the writing that fails if

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.590 
it's the it's the writing that fails if
if<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.180> don't<00:03:51.360> see<00:03:51.570> a<00:03:51.600> chemistry<00:03:52.110> then<00:03:52.620> I<00:03:53.600> I've

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
if you don't see a chemistry then I I've

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.720 
if you don't see a chemistry then I I've
always<00:03:55.019> believed<00:03:55.290> in<00:03:55.410> this<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.860> that<00:03:56.190> first

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
always believed in this that that first

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.280 
always believed in this that that first
so<00:03:57.000> first<00:03:57.209> of<00:03:57.390> all<00:03:57.450> there<00:03:57.630> are<00:03:57.660> no<00:03:57.810> bad<00:03:57.959> actors

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
so first of all there are no bad actors

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.400 
so first of all there are no bad actors
there's<00:03:59.190> it's<00:03:59.489> just<00:03:59.670> bad<00:03:59.820> casting<00:04:00.410> because

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
there's it's just bad casting because

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.970 
there's it's just bad casting because
every<00:04:02.340> face<00:04:02.610> and<00:04:03.000> every

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
every face and every

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.069 
every face and every
individual<00:04:04.980> has<00:04:05.310> something<00:04:05.670> to<00:04:05.760> express<00:04:06.079> so

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
individual has something to express so

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.130 
individual has something to express so
if<00:04:07.680> if<00:04:08.519> a<00:04:08.670> person<00:04:09.030> is<00:04:09.180> not<00:04:09.209> look<00:04:09.629> good<00:04:09.870> in<00:04:10.049> a

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
if if a person is not look good in a

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.069 
if if a person is not look good in a
film<00:04:10.379> or<00:04:10.560> has<00:04:10.980> not<00:04:11.220> performed<00:04:12.120> well<00:04:12.540> I<00:04:12.720> believe

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
film or has not performed well I believe

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.659 
film or has not performed well I believe
it's<00:04:13.439> bad<00:04:13.650> casting<00:04:14.129> you<00:04:14.459> know<00:04:16.160> so<00:04:17.160> in<00:04:17.280> in<00:04:17.489> the

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
it's bad casting you know so in in the

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.199 
it's bad casting you know so in in the
same<00:04:17.880> regard<00:04:19.100> if<00:04:20.100> there<00:04:20.669> is<00:04:20.789> no<00:04:20.940> chemistry

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
same regard if there is no chemistry

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.960 
same regard if there is no chemistry
then<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.169> writing<00:04:22.350> has<00:04:22.620> failed<00:04:22.889> and<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.669> mean

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
then the writing has failed and I mean

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.490 
then the writing has failed and I mean
this<00:04:24.300> is<00:04:24.479> taking<00:04:24.810> for<00:04:24.960> granted<00:04:24.990> that<00:04:25.320> the

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
this is taking for granted that the

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.110 
this is taking for granted that the
actors<00:04:25.740> are<00:04:25.770> good<00:04:25.979> and<00:04:26.550> you<00:04:26.669> have<00:04:26.789> two<00:04:26.940> good

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
actors are good and you have two good

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.570 
actors are good and you have two good

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
actors and you see no spark you see no

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.710 
actors and you see no spark you see no
chemistry<00:04:29.850> then<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.180> writing<00:04:30.479> is<00:04:30.570> filled

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
chemistry then the writing is filled

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.200 
chemistry then the writing is filled
which<00:04:31.259> is<00:04:31.410> completely<00:04:31.770> untrue<00:04:32.220> where<00:04:32.850> Doom<00:04:33.030> is

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
which is completely untrue where Doom is

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.560 
which is completely untrue where Doom is
concerned<00:04:33.810> because<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:36.000> reaction<00:04:36.389> that<00:04:36.539> I

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
concerned because the reaction that I

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.450 
concerned because the reaction that I
have<00:04:36.870> gone<00:04:37.050> everywhere<00:04:37.650> is<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:37.889> fact<00:04:38.340> that

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
have gone everywhere is the fact that

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.710 
have gone everywhere is the fact that
you<00:04:38.760> know<00:04:38.910> it's<00:04:39.350> okay<00:04:40.970> there<00:04:41.970> is<00:04:42.090> also<00:04:42.270> been<00:04:42.539> of
