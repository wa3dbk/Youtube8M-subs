00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.259
 saha him the geeks and the geekettes these 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.880
 videos was I hope you did well 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.769
 let's go for a little video 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.530
 remember of dofus 1 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.240
 I had to hunt or perhaps soyaux 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.869
 it was he who had me on track 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.400
 we will see at the end following the result of the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.289
 fight but in any case he was playing fairly 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.240
 anti game that's because he knows he was 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.039
 came to hide in this house then 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.199
 if my memories are good 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.060
 it was in that house, so there we 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.800
 on the first floor of this little house 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.410
 it was in that house that we could 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.540
 find phantom do the famous spell of arak 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.100
 in fact there was an Arab did not kill and 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.270
 it was a little kate affair 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.190
 either on lara have recovered 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.960
 directly the parchment of the spell 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.530
 direct invocations remember more 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.270
 exactly 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.160
 but this act art I believe it 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.000
 reappeared once or twice a day 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
 in the House 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.840
 so it was super rare and suddenly there 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.850
 had people camping there 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.829
 was waiting in this house to fall 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.239
 on their actions but hey there seals stack 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.969
 was rather there for something else he 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.399
 was there to have a lot 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.519
 quite favorable for his tracks for 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.600
 to be quiet and a map rather small 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.500
 that way they were sure they could 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.479
 very well bang on his opponents but 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.150
 with my friend I was finally done 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.850
 I manage to get out even controlled ya 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.740
 at that time how to say the wronged neither 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.140
 for me was slightly unbalanced 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.960
 in the game and when we knew little 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.799
 close to play them well 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.600
 it was really uncomfortable but good 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.860
 in any case for me I really find 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.170
 that at the time the game was better 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.240
 balanced that now in pvp 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.950
 it really hurts me to say that 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.960
 because already at the time he was very 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.610
 poorly balanced but it's true that 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.380
 now with too many were the 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.909
 class teams 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.220
 it has nothing to do and it's true 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.460
 that when I think about it when I look at these 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.259
 fighting dofus 1 I find that 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.530
 the time makes it the number of points of 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.509
 life we ​​had was roughly 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.399
 adequacy with the damage that the 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.840
 players could do so that's right 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.590
 that players could type very 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.270
 strong with melee but there is 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.410
 had no abused stocks either 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.789
 like stocks that exist 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.220
 currently there was no 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.330
 opportunity to do because the video 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.280
 that I showed you the other day a 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.070
 guy doing 2000 damage with the 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.769
 petoches I mean even at the time of 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.440
 control cac did not do 2000 damage 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.420
 with one with a melee so 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.239
 it was I thought it was more 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.440
 balanced we had fights there 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.820
 had a single big one there was a 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.329
 huge concern at the time was the 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.880
 shields 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.410
 in fact the graded shields and the 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.030
 new scratching drover created big 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.459
 worries in the game so that's true 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.739
 that it should have been changed at the time 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.640
 but I think that if he had made it nose 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.680
 redo the loops anyway 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.299
 balance the shields and with 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.040
 some small changes to make on 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.079
 some classes of the xelor stylus that 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.280
 withdraw is far too much country they 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.470
 put on each turn their 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.630
 opponents to 0 1 p ah that's true that 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.080
 it was a little bit abused skimped rip 16 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.850
 had maybe 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.840
 a little too much care 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.220
 maybe it should have been redone 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.440
 a little bit but roughly the game 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.220
 was well balanced 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.330
 now I can not say he was 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.130
 well balanced but he was less 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.480
 unbalanced than now now 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.110
 it's simply from the big 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.660
 whatever 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.390
 at the level of the balanced game finally 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.090
 good web shot it's true that it's me 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.180
 recalls a good part because we 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.530
 had all been having each one 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.910
 we had one or two classes 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.370
 hated having there certainly a 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.780
 match up that was difficult for everything 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.540
 the world for example my elder rip that 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.950
 it was very complicated against the osa 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.830
 because he desiccate look there he 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.400
 makes me angry at 2400 then 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.740
 frankly that means it hurt a lot 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.959
 it hurt a lot but now the 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.070
 guys doing this to the toga pretty much the 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.940
 fight I showed you the other day 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.700
 it was a man who was not 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:53.130
 specially optimized it was 2000 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.300
 damage to the task it's still 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.660
 still big anyway 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.730
 compare to that so that even starts at 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.340
 the time a sword of a sword diop finally 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.170
 a share in yop anger 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.730
 to indulge in there is a big advantage 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.200
 in the fight and as soon as they get to 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.820
 place the anger of the jap he had some 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.769
 big chances to win but the 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.120
 most of the time it was not 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.040
 lose not all the points of life 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.720
 the salted opponent is still 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.340
 a chance to the opponent of being able 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.080
 make it out 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.850
 so that's it now as I you 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.950
 showed a iop it can turn brown 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.180
 tank the iop there are few shots a shot 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.500
 sacrier so that's it's a real 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.630
 worry and because if nothing happens to 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.040
 turn each a laughing bag he can turn 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.720
 shock all the classes of the game what in 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.669
 big unless we have a guy who is 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.919
 specific who put themselves 50 % of 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.630
 earth resistance and again he 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.100
 would have to make 50% risk 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.260
 earth and actually since there are the ec to 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.510
 fire and the and cater 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.220
 finally brief blow there the mind 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.350
 at that time you see it was not 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.430
 as easy to have 11 and sweet or 12 p 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.640
 has like now so we were 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.500
 many said fathers and in the yacht 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.720
 do I do it he said p1 so at each 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.610
 I needed to get to him at least 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.320
 take away a father so that he is 9 father 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.210
 because at nine perry could not me 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.590
 give two astek shots very often 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.270
 the shocks matches against the iops it's 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.680
 play that an ipsa emir who does not 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.910
 managed not to remove pirates who 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.260
 was not going to take the adventure not 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.000
 hyper passes that was taking 2 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.470
 koudougou two big sword strokes in the 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.330
 facing each turn and it was not 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.140
 possible to heal 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.280
 on the other hand, how the token 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.500
 which I was playing so really 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.000
 most important shaktoi at every turn 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.310
 I had to do one thing 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.300
 that's him removing minimum 1 lose everything 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.040
 by doing some damage 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.020
 it can pass you see that the fight 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.390
 is very very tense I end up at 92 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.740
 points of life but it was feasible 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.020
 there iop rise I must say I think 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.190
 that he had a little bit less stuff 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.860
 optimized as mine but good of another 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.450
 side the map was to his advantage suddenly 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.500
 here it was really well handled 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.500
 cool in 2 ie when 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.780
 I play it not rebuild very often 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.310
 when we are at 1000 1500 health 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.390
 do we play it right now art 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.580
 consists is what is played on the turn 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:58.180
 according to this tactical aspect of the game 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.530
 for me was more we saw it better 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.210
 because because it was less 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.010
 unbalanced than now now 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.870
 just take in collison three 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.850
 classes has abused and then it's good it's 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.260
 physics at high school auto win there are more 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.600
 really tactics in there it's 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.310
 just to make the right pre-fight choices 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.740
 in any case that reminded me of good 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.630
 memories of showing you this little 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.770
 fight stalking against yop stalking 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.060
 so it's true that it's really 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.860
 pity that it was removed from the game 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.120
 it was something that was 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.000
 really atmosphere on the servers 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.010
 something that I found 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.570
 very nice in any case thank you 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:32.270
 to have followed this video it was 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:32.270
