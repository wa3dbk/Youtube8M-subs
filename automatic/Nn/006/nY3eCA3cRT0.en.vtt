 everything done or weight so 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.230
 layer over ropes 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.989
 I cost around 400 euros prints and net 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.250
 slightly more expensive because they are pretty neat price 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.600
 for when you compare it with the on 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.850
 journey in the juries 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.680
 who have the same options in terms of options 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.809
 are a lot more expensive 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.250
 fit of a cell is so story is that 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.990
 that means we are for the back of 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.770
 your head is too long as from left to 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.880
 right 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.100
 He sees that he is free at the bottom 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.060
 tight on the cheek now runs so yes 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.380
 that makes it tasty too 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.939
 sit tight on the cheeks you have something 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.950
 narrower face is this l 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.700
 probably good too 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.090
 suzie is 2.2 mm thick two positions too 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.909
 adjust 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.549
 so open and closed and it closes whole 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.200
 neatly finished so completely watertight 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.299
 sure that it also becomes a bit quieter and 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.299
 is easy to swap if you have this 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.740
 loosen screws and both sides 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.210
 Valve is also easy if you stand off 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.650
 can also use it without a flap you would 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.180
 can take the visor off and enough 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.650
 you can just do it as normal 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.450
 use 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.840
 and if you have taken both of them off 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.159
 just an open integral so to speak 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.560
 ventilation in the front 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.560
 there are two discs at the top 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.780
 also at the top a 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.780
 vent 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.780
 and you see through these grooves on the 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.490
 the back of wp2 mufflers becomes the hot one 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.539
 air sucked out so that ensures 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.829
 also ensure that you have maximum ventilation 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.899
 experience 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.209
 for she is very big bite there is one 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.459
 filter behind that field in gold and can 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.650
 you can pick up this entire kappa 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.450
 for the croo stand so if you go for it 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.050
 the costs of a match are for one 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.050
 maximum ventilation 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.030
 lining is completely removable 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.660
 made so cool max and turn lex and 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.400
 trae-lyx material that you lose whole 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.049
 fast moisture so it dries quickly too 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:41.670
 it is the last face you can 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:42.930
 There out of focus and the second we also is quite 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.519
 easy to pull out 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.519
 so you can also wash a baby well 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:55.049
 inside bed is stuck with buttons on you 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.970
 pretty thick we too 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.280
 thick padding ensures that you get the 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.079

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.079
 ventilation flows out over the head 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.670
 inside you see the ventilation in and 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.290
 exits through the grooves that ill another 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.859
 can the lies also maximally or your mind 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.040
 over closure is a double d closure 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.299
 was required for the knaw inspection 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.739
 very easy you can wash every time 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.400
 twice that will work feverishly 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.400
