00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
this is an easy ten by ten squared now

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.399 
this is an easy ten by ten squared now
the<00:01:56.009> field<00:01:56.340> size<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.969> either<00:01:57.270> small<00:01:57.719> or<00:01:57.780> big<00:01:58.170> a

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
the field size is either small or big a

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.950 
the field size is either small or big a
small<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.040> ten<00:01:59.250> by<00:01:59.399> ten<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.939> large<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.570> 40

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
small is ten by ten in a large is a 40

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.380 
small is ten by ten in a large is a 40
by<00:02:01.079> 40<00:02:01.500> now<00:02:02.159> an<00:02:02.310> easy<00:02:02.490> will<00:02:02.790> only<00:02:02.939> have<00:02:03.149> one

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
by 40 now an easy will only have one

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.050 
by 40 now an easy will only have one
bomb<00:02:03.659> /<00:02:04.020> 10<00:02:04.320> title<00:02:04.799> average<00:02:05.219> meaning<00:02:05.549> for<00:02:06.000> a

bomb / 10 title average meaning for a

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.020 
bomb / 10 title average meaning for a
hundred<00:02:06.509> square<00:02:06.979> field<00:02:07.979> like<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.369> 10<00:02:08.610> by<00:02:08.759> 10

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
hundred square field like this 10 by 10

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.460 
hundred square field like this 10 by 10
that<00:02:09.390> means<00:02:09.450> there's<00:02:09.720> only<00:02:09.780> about<00:02:09.989> 10<00:02:10.289> bombs

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470

sweeper<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:24.960> mean<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.320> mine<00:02:25.530> detector<00:02:25.980> the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
sweeper I mean a mine detector the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.070 
sweeper I mean a mine detector the
reason<00:02:26.460> why<00:02:26.610> is<00:02:26.670> because<00:02:26.910> this<00:02:27.360> will<00:02:27.570> beep<00:02:27.840> in
