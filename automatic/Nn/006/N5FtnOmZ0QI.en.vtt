coinciding<00:02:26.590> stories<00:02:27.069> the<00:02:27.549> gameplay<00:02:27.849> is<00:02:28.329> just

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
coinciding stories the gameplay is just

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.009 
coinciding stories the gameplay is just
dramatically<00:02:29.650> different<00:02:29.980> furthermore<00:02:30.970> if<00:02:31.630> it

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
dramatically different furthermore if it

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.620 
dramatically different furthermore if it
were<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.470> true<00:02:32.920> sequel<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.430> robotron<00:02:34.000> what<00:02:34.540> did

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
were a true sequel to robotron what did

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.900 
were a true sequel to robotron what did
it<00:02:34.750> be<00:02:34.959> called<00:02:35.169> robotron<00:02:36.040> two<00:02:36.340> or<00:02:36.669> perhaps

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
it be called robotron two or perhaps

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.909 
it be called robotron two or perhaps
even<00:02:37.440> robotron<00:02:38.549> 2085<00:02:40.139> so<00:02:41.139> really<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.709> choice

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:41.919 
even robotron 2085 so really the choice

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:43.949 
even robotron 2085 so really the choice
is<00:02:42.190> yours<00:02:42.370> do<00:02:42.910> you<00:02:43.000> think<00:02:43.209> it's<00:02:43.359> a<00:02:43.450> sequel<00:02:43.750> or

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
is yours do you think it's a sequel or

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.849 
is yours do you think it's a sequel or
just<00:02:44.319> a<00:02:44.440> spin-off<00:02:46.109> this<00:02:47.109> game<00:02:47.349> could<00:02:47.620> be

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.510 
I have no complaints with this game
plain<00:06:26.360> and<00:06:26.600> simple<00:06:26.690> its<00:06:27.260> use<00:06:27.740> of<00:06:27.770> color<00:06:28.220> is

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
plain and simple its use of color is

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.330 
plain and simple its use of color is
bold<00:06:28.970> to<00:06:29.300> say<00:06:29.330> the<00:06:29.630> least<00:06:29.660> and<00:06:30.140> the<00:06:30.950> game<00:06:31.130> never

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.340 
bold to say the least and the game never

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.100 
bold to say the least and the game never
becomes<00:06:31.850> repetitive<00:06:32.030> because<00:06:32.960> they're

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
becomes repetitive because they're

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.960 
becomes repetitive because they're
always<00:06:33.350> changing<00:06:33.530> up<00:06:34.130> what<00:06:34.520> you<00:06:34.640> will<00:06:34.790> do<00:06:34.940> next

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 
always changing up what you will do next

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.480 
always changing up what you will do next
so<00:06:35.870> I'm<00:06:35.960> going<00:06:36.230> to<00:06:36.260> give<00:06:36.410> blaster<00:06:36.950> a<00:06:36.980> perfect

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
so I'm going to give blaster a perfect

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.690 
so I'm going to give blaster a perfect
score<00:06:37.700> of<00:06:38.030> 5<00:06:38.390> out<00:06:38.720> of<00:06:38.750> 5<00:06:38.900> so<00:06:39.680> until<00:06:39.980> next<00:06:40.010> time<00:06:40.340> I
