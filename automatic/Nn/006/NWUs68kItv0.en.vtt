00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
over the log bridge which is just like a

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.220 
over the log bridge which is just like a
two<00:02:01.640> or<00:02:01.670> three<00:02:01.940> foot<00:02:02.090> high<00:02:02.150> bridge<00:02:02.570> that<00:02:03.080> goes

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
two or three foot high bridge that goes

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.140 
two or three foot high bridge that goes
in<00:02:03.409> between<00:02:03.710> two<00:02:03.920> hills<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:04.400> there's<00:02:04.850> two

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
in between two hills and there's two

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.000 
in between two hills and there's two
wooden<00:02:05.510> logs<00:02:05.780> that<00:02:06.110> you<00:02:06.170> have<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.470> drive<00:02:06.740> over

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
wooden logs that you have to drive over

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.410 
wooden logs that you have to drive over
and<00:02:07.070> you<00:02:07.159> know<00:02:07.250> get<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.550> wheels<00:02:07.729> on<00:02:07.970> and<00:02:08.149> the

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
and you know get the wheels on and the

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.969 
and you know get the wheels on and the
thing<00:02:08.600> is<00:02:08.720> is<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.050> logs<00:02:09.290> are<00:02:09.470> super<00:02:09.800> skinny

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
thing is is the logs are super skinny

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.740 
thing is is the logs are super skinny
they're<00:02:10.190> like<00:02:10.310> six<00:02:10.550> inches<00:02:10.700> wide<00:02:10.880> whereas<00:02:11.630> the

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
they're like six inches wide whereas the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.300 
they're like six inches wide whereas the
Humvees<00:02:12.050> tires<00:02:12.290> were<00:02:12.470> like<00:02:12.620> 10<00:02:12.890> inches<00:02:13.190> you

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
Humvees tires were like 10 inches you

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.520 
Humvees tires were like 10 inches you
know<00:02:13.400> nearly<00:02:13.730> double<00:02:14.209> that<00:02:14.239> so<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:15.170> was<00:02:15.320> like

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
know nearly double that so it was like

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.050 
know nearly double that so it was like
it<00:02:15.920> was<00:02:16.070> just<00:02:16.160> it<00:02:16.310> was<00:02:16.340> incredible<00:02:16.850> to<00:02:17.030> think

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
it was just it was incredible to think

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.640 
it was just it was incredible to think
about<00:02:17.450> doing<00:02:17.660> something<00:02:17.780> like<00:02:18.140> this<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:18.590> it

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
about doing something like this and it

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.440 
about doing something like this and it
was<00:02:18.739> nerve<00:02:18.950> wracking<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:19.489> so<00:02:20.150> as<00:02:20.239> you<00:02:20.330> can<00:02:20.360> see

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
was nerve wracking and so as you can see

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.150 
was nerve wracking and so as you can see
this<00:02:20.750> was<00:02:20.900> my<00:02:21.049> turn<00:02:21.260> right<00:02:21.440> here<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:21.830> the

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
this was my turn right here and the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.949 
this was my turn right here and the
thing<00:02:22.370> is<00:02:22.549> is<00:02:22.760> that<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.030> Humvee<00:02:23.299> is<00:02:23.390> so<00:02:23.630> big

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
thing is is that the Humvee is so big

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.199 
thing is is that the Humvee is so big
and<00:02:24.200> so<00:02:24.380> wide<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:25.160> can't<00:02:25.430> see<00:02:25.730> in<00:02:25.850> front<00:02:26.150> of

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
and so wide you can't see in front of

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.310 
and so wide you can't see in front of
you<00:02:26.299> on<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.540> ground<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:26.810> know<00:02:26.930> you<00:02:26.989> can't

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
you on the ground you know you can't

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.630 
you on the ground you know you can't
look<00:02:27.530> at<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.799> logs<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:28.220> make<00:02:28.370> sure<00:02:28.519> you're

they did that to him it was like a
suicide<00:02:53.540> mission<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:54.019> as<00:02:54.709> you're<00:02:54.890> gonna<00:02:54.980> see

here
it<00:02:55.849> didn't<00:02:56.299> really<00:02:56.540> turn<00:02:56.750> out<00:02:56.930> too<00:02:57.170> well<00:02:57.349> so

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
it didn't really turn out too well so

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.710 
it didn't really turn out too well so
the<00:02:58.159> thing<00:02:58.340> about<00:02:58.370> these<00:02:58.640> Humvees<00:02:58.849> was<00:02:59.180> is<00:02:59.360> you

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
the thing about these Humvees was is you

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
was amazing you know and it seems pretty

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.030 
was amazing you know and it seems pretty
self-explanatory<00:05:28.780> like<00:05:29.440> I'm<00:05:29.560> sure<00:05:29.740> some<00:05:29.950> of

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
self-explanatory like I'm sure some of

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.410 
self-explanatory like I'm sure some of
you<00:05:30.100> guys<00:05:30.220> have<00:05:30.490> done<00:05:30.640> like<00:05:30.820> donuts<00:05:31.210> and<00:05:31.330> the

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
you guys have done like donuts and the

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.910 
you guys have done like donuts and the
snow<00:05:31.630> and<00:05:31.750> things<00:05:31.960> but<00:05:32.440> when<00:05:32.800> you're<00:05:32.890> on

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
snow and things but when you're on

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.830 
snow and things but when you're on
actual<00:05:33.400> pavement<00:05:34.000> where<00:05:34.120> the<00:05:34.240> car<00:05:34.450> seems<00:05:34.750> to

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
actual pavement where the car seems to

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.810 
actual pavement where the car seems to
stick<00:05:35.230> a<00:05:35.260> little<00:05:35.470> bit<00:05:35.590> more<00:05:35.830> it<00:05:36.010> was<00:05:36.400> a<00:05:36.460> lot

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
stick a little bit more it was a lot

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.610 
stick a little bit more it was a lot
more<00:05:36.850> difficult<00:05:37.360> but<00:05:37.900> I<00:05:38.080> think<00:05:38.290> it<00:05:38.350> see<00:05:38.470> I

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
more difficult but I think it see I

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.870 
more difficult but I think it see I
wasn't<00:05:38.800> half<00:05:38.980> bad<00:05:39.010> I<00:05:39.460> did<00:05:39.610> pretty<00:05:39.790> well

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
wasn't half bad I did pretty well

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.370 
wasn't half bad I did pretty well
probably<00:05:40.630> one<00:05:40.720> of<00:05:40.750> the<00:05:40.870> better<00:05:40.990> ones<00:05:41.230> out<00:05:41.320> of

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
probably one of the better ones out of

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.650 
probably one of the better ones out of
the<00:05:41.500> group<00:05:41.710> and<00:05:41.850> overall<00:05:42.850> it<00:05:43.000> was<00:05:43.120> just<00:05:43.150> it<00:05:43.570> was

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
the group and overall it was just it was

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.000 
the group and overall it was just it was
a<00:05:43.690> lot<00:05:43.870> of<00:05:43.960> fun<00:05:44.230> it<00:05:44.470> was<00:05:44.500> a<00:05:44.590> really<00:05:44.860> cool

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
a lot of fun it was a really cool

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.250 
a lot of fun it was a really cool
experience<00:05:45.070> and<00:05:45.630> it<00:05:46.630> was<00:05:46.690> just<00:05:46.900> I<00:05:46.990> don't<00:05:47.110> know
