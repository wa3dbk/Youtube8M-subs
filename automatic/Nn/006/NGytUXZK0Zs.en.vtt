got it has network support but and let's
start<00:00:29.099> getting<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.429> thing<00:00:29.609> open<00:00:29.910> here

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
start getting this thing open here

you've also got support much like the

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.500 
you've also got support much like the
popcorn<00:00:32.910> our<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:34.050> put<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.739> drive<00:00:35.430> inside<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.420> you

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
popcorn our to put a drive inside so you

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.720 
popcorn our to put a drive inside so you
can<00:00:36.780> actually<00:00:36.960> open<00:00:37.559> up<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.800> unit<00:00:38.070> itself<00:00:38.399> and

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
can actually open up the unit itself and

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.150 
can actually open up the unit itself and
pop<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.510> two<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.809> half<00:00:39.989> inch<00:00:40.230> drive<00:00:40.500> so

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
pop in a two and a half inch drive so

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.799 
pop in a two and a half inch drive so
that<00:00:41.190> means<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.760> can<00:00:41.969> store<00:00:42.239> media<00:00:42.450> on

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.060 
it you can store media on a USB device
and<00:00:45.180> plug<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.809> or<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.559> can<00:00:46.710> store<00:00:46.920> media

and plug it in or you can store media
over<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.430> network<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.059> play<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.420> way

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
over the network and play it that way

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.810 
over the network and play it that way
now<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> pre-production<00:00:49.950> sample<00:00:50.670> so

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
now this is a pre-production sample so

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.549 
now this is a pre-production sample so
it's<00:00:50.969> not<00:00:51.090> gonna<00:00:51.300> be<00:00:51.510> perfect<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:52.199> terms<00:00:52.410> of

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
it's not gonna be perfect in terms of

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.590 
it's not gonna be perfect in terms of
the<00:00:52.649> retail<00:00:52.949> packaging<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.670> I've<00:00:54.329> been

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
the retail packaging and I've been

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.119 
the retail packaging and I've been
informed<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.260> they<00:00:55.469> actually<00:00:55.949> may<00:00:56.100> be

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
informed that they actually may be

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.950 
informed that they actually may be
changing<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.760> finish<00:00:57.059> on<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.360> top<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.780> more

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
changing the finish on the top to more

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.540 
changing the finish on the top to more
like<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> matte<00:00:58.410> finish<00:00:58.770> instead<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.280> brushed

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
like a matte finish instead of a brushed

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.520 
like a matte finish instead of a brushed
finish<00:00:59.760> but<00:01:00.390> let's<00:01:00.690> have<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.870> look<00:01:01.050> at<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.260> unit

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
finish but let's have a look at the unit

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.500 
finish but let's have a look at the unit
itself<00:01:01.770> anyway<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.640> want<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.090> compare<00:01:03.449> it

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
itself anyway so I want to compare it

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.020 
itself anyway so I want to compare it
quickly<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.170> size<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.710> WD<00:01:05.189> TV<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.820> it's<00:01:05.939> a

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
quickly in size to the WD TV so it's a

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.730 
quickly in size to the WD TV so it's a
little<00:01:06.210> bit<00:01:06.390> bigger<00:01:06.630> it's<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.380> little<00:01:07.619> bit

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
little bit bigger it's a little bit

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.219 
little bit bigger it's a little bit
wider<00:01:08.070> but<00:01:08.850> it's<00:01:09.030> about<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.420> same<00:01:09.450> height<00:01:09.900> and

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
wider but it's about the same height and

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.140 
wider but it's about the same height and
it's<00:01:10.799> kind<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.189> don't<00:01:11.729> for<00:01:11.880> all<00:01:11.939> I'd<00:01:12.119> say

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
it's kind of don't for all I'd say

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.030 
it's kind of don't for all I'd say
similar<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:12.869> size<00:01:13.049> once<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.500> put<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:13.830> your

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
similar in size once you put it on your

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.280 
similar in size once you put it on your
shelf<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.520> at<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.150> front<00:01:15.299> we've<00:01:15.600> got<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.020> USB

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
shelf so at the front we've got the USB

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.499 
shelf so at the front we've got the USB
port<00:01:16.770> we've<00:01:17.040> got<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.340> IR<00:01:17.640> receiver<00:01:18.030> for<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
port we've got the IR receiver for the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.910 
port we've got the IR receiver for the
remote<00:01:18.810> which<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.170> actually<00:01:19.650> really

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
remote which is actually really

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.950 
remote which is actually really
impressive<00:01:20.430> more<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.850> later<00:01:21.060> then<00:01:21.750> we've

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
impressive more on that later then we've

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.870 
impressive more on that later then we've
got<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> USB<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.740> hard<00:01:23.040> drive<00:01:23.280> signaling

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
got a USB and hard drive signaling

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.109 
got a USB and hard drive signaling
lights<00:01:24.470> power<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.040> land<00:01:26.189> signal<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.970> is

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
lights power and the land signal this is

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.300 
lights power and the land signal this is
a<00:01:27.150> full<00:01:27.450> HD<00:01:27.479> device<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.439> supports<00:01:28.860> 1080

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
a full HD device so it supports 1080

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.090 
a full HD device so it supports 1080
that<00:01:29.759> means<00:01:29.970> MKV<00:01:30.630> all<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.229> good<00:01:31.530> stuff<00:01:31.560> but

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
that means MKV all that good stuff but

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.039 
that means MKV all that good stuff but
you<00:01:32.189> should<00:01:32.369> probably<00:01:32.579> have<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.820> look<00:01:33.030> at<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
you should probably have a look at the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.810 
you should probably have a look at the
side<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.439> box<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.860> can<00:01:35.009> just<00:01:35.040> pause<00:01:35.490> and

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
side of the box you can just pause and

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.179 
side of the box you can just pause and
read<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.119> if<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.810> desire<00:01:37.140> okay<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:37.920> on

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
read that if you so desire okay so on

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.240 
read that if you so desire okay so on
the<00:01:38.310> back<00:01:38.520> we<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:39.560> I'm<00:01:40.560> assuming<00:01:41.100> these<00:01:41.189> are

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
the back we have I'm assuming these are

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.830 
the back we have I'm assuming these are
composite<00:01:41.670> but<00:01:41.939> until<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.240> get<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.540> off<00:01:42.720> I

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
composite but until I get this off I

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.539 
composite but until I get this off I
won't<00:01:42.990> know<00:01:43.110> for<00:01:43.170> sure<00:01:43.320> yes<00:01:44.130> we<00:01:44.369> have

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
won't know for sure yes we have

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.300 
won't know for sure yes we have
composite<00:01:45.180> video<00:01:45.329> output<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:46.229> audio<00:01:46.590> then<00:01:46.860> we

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
composite video output and audio then we

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.069 
composite video output and audio then we
have<00:01:47.490> optical<00:01:48.030> audio<00:01:48.329> out

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
have optical audio out

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.460 
have optical audio out
we've<00:01:49.439> got<00:01:49.649> HDMI<00:01:50.130> supporting<00:01:50.820> 5.1<00:01:51.420> or<00:01:51.659> 7.1

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
we've got HDMI supporting 5.1 or 7.1

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.319 
we've got HDMI supporting 5.1 or 7.1
audio<00:01:52.799> we've<00:01:53.310> actually<00:01:53.460> got<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.790> power<00:01:54.060> switch

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
audio we've actually got a power switch

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.179 
audio we've actually got a power switch
and<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.689> lot<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.930> these<00:01:55.020> devices<00:01:55.350> don't<00:01:55.829> have<00:01:55.979> a

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
and a lot of these devices don't have a

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.590 
and a lot of these devices don't have a
power<00:01:56.460> switch<00:01:56.670> if<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.000> want<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.270> turn<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.509> off

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
power switch if you want to turn it off

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.289 
power switch if you want to turn it off
you<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.899> just<00:01:58.170> unplug<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.770> here<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> USB

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
you have to just unplug it here is a USB

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.810 
you have to just unplug it here is a USB
plug<00:02:01.200> now<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:01.950> different<00:02:02.369> from<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.790> normal

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
plug now this is different from a normal

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.060 
plug now this is different from a normal
USB<00:02:03.360> plug<00:02:03.719> in<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.229> can<00:02:04.380> actually<00:02:04.590> use

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
USB plug in that you can actually use

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.469 
USB plug in that you can actually use
this<00:02:05.280> device<00:02:05.520> as<00:02:05.939> an<00:02:06.119> external

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
two-and-a-half inch hard drive so that

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.309 
two-and-a-half inch hard drive so that
means<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.910> don't<00:02:09.090> actually<00:02:09.390> even<00:02:09.750> have<00:02:09.929> to

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
means you don't actually even have to

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.009 
means you don't actually even have to
have<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.709> we're

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
have and that we're

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.960 
have and that we're
attachment<00:02:11.860> to<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.099> you<00:02:12.430> throw<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.790> hard

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
attachment to it you throw the hard

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.210 
attachment to it you throw the hard
drive<00:02:13.150> inside<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:14.110> plug<00:02:14.379> into<00:02:14.560> here<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.099> then

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
drive inside you plug into here and then

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.949 
drive inside you plug into here and then
you<00:02:15.370> can<00:02:15.489> just<00:02:15.670> drag-and-drop<00:02:15.909> files<00:02:16.450> from

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
you can just drag-and-drop files from

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.929 
you can just drag-and-drop files from
your<00:02:17.019> desktop<00:02:17.230> on<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.189> hard<00:02:18.340> drive<00:02:18.519> inside

see how this works oh there we go that
was<00:02:54.099> easy

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
was easy

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.860 
was easy
so<00:02:56.019> here<00:02:56.680> is<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.220> inside<00:02:57.790> of<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.389> unit<00:02:58.569> so

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
so here is the inside of the unit so

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.330 
so here is the inside of the unit so
first<00:02:59.200> of<00:02:59.349> all<00:02:59.439> we've<00:02:59.620> got<00:02:59.799> what<00:02:59.980> appears<00:03:00.010> to

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
first of all we've got what appears to

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.759 
first of all we've got what appears to
be<00:03:00.519> a<00:03:00.549> 40<00:03:00.909> millimeter<00:03:01.090> cooling<00:03:01.750> fan<00:03:01.989> so<00:03:02.590> that's

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
be a 40 millimeter cooling fan so that's

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.530 
be a 40 millimeter cooling fan so that's
gonna<00:03:02.950> be<00:03:03.040> cooling<00:03:03.549> the<00:03:03.700> chipset<00:03:04.120> which<00:03:04.329> is

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
gonna be cooling the chipset which is

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.030 
gonna be cooling the chipset which is
underneath<00:03:04.959> there<00:03:05.319> as<00:03:05.409> well<00:03:05.590> as<00:03:05.709> some<00:03:05.859> of<00:03:05.980> the

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
underneath there as well as some of the

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.250 
underneath there as well as some of the
power<00:03:06.220> delivery<00:03:06.700> circuitry<00:03:07.180> we<00:03:07.329> can<00:03:07.510> see<00:03:07.720> you

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
power delivery circuitry we can see you

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.500 
power delivery circuitry we can see you
can<00:03:08.439> see<00:03:08.620> at<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.859> front<00:03:09.099> we've<00:03:09.280> got<00:03:09.310> our<00:03:09.909> our

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
can see at the front we've got our our

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.720 
can see at the front we've got our our
infrared<00:03:10.870> thingamajiggy<00:03:11.799> we've<00:03:11.920> got<00:03:12.129> our<00:03:12.250> USB

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
infrared thingamajiggy we've got our USB

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.250 
infrared thingamajiggy we've got our USB
and<00:03:12.909> then<00:03:12.970> there's<00:03:13.239> all<00:03:13.480> of<00:03:13.510> our<00:03:13.810> indicator

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
and then there's all of our indicator

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.189 
and then there's all of our indicator
lights<00:03:14.879> here<00:03:15.879> you<00:03:16.030> can<00:03:16.209> see<00:03:16.449> we've<00:03:16.660> got<00:03:16.690> what

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:17.199 
lights here you can see we've got what

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:19.289 
lights here you can see we've got what
is<00:03:17.349> that<00:03:17.709> so<00:03:18.400> that's<00:03:18.609> some<00:03:18.849> kind<00:03:19.120> of<00:03:19.239> that's

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
is that so that's some kind of that's

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.539 
is that so that's some kind of that's
must<00:03:19.720> be<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.959> power<00:03:20.139> input<00:03:20.650> right<00:03:20.769> there<00:03:21.250> no

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
must be the power input right there no

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.030 
must be the power input right there no
no<00:03:21.760> it's<00:03:21.879> not<00:03:22.030> what<00:03:22.569> is<00:03:22.720> that<00:03:22.989> well<00:03:23.799> I'm<00:03:23.980> not

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
no it's not what is that well I'm not

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.500 
no it's not what is that well I'm not
gonna<00:03:24.280> guess<00:03:24.519> here's<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.120> power<00:03:25.269> switch

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
gonna guess here's the power switch

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.059 
gonna guess here's the power switch
though<00:03:25.870> so<00:03:26.260> there<00:03:26.530> you<00:03:26.590> go<00:03:26.739> there's<00:03:27.010> the

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
though so there you go there's the

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.009 
though so there you go there's the
wiring<00:03:27.459> for<00:03:27.639> that<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:27.970> then<00:03:28.389> here<00:03:28.810> is<00:03:28.989> your

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
wiring for that and then here is your

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.819 
wiring for that and then here is your
SATA<00:03:29.590> interface<00:03:30.099> so<00:03:30.280> this<00:03:30.400> accepts<00:03:30.849> a<00:03:30.940> SATA

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
SATA interface so this accepts a SATA

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.250 
SATA interface so this accepts a SATA
2.5<00:03:32.829> inch<00:03:33.069> drive<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.609> you<00:03:33.669> just<00:03:33.849> put<00:03:34.449> force<00:03:34.780> no

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
2.5 inch drive and you just put force no

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.800 
2.5 inch drive and you just put force no
two<00:03:35.709> screws<00:03:36.069> on<00:03:36.099> the<00:03:36.280> sides<00:03:36.579> one<00:03:36.879> here<00:03:37.180> and<00:03:37.359> one

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
two screws on the sides one here and one

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.390 
two screws on the sides one here and one
here<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:38.290> then<00:03:38.590> you<00:03:38.709> seal<00:03:38.889> it<00:03:39.040> right<00:03:39.159> back<00:03:39.340> up

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
here and then you seal it right back up

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.460 
here and then you seal it right back up
it's<00:03:39.760> just<00:03:40.000> 2<00:03:40.180> screws<00:03:40.479> to<00:03:40.690> pop<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:40.989> unit<00:03:41.199> open

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
it's just 2 screws to pop the unit open

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.219 
it's just 2 screws to pop the unit open
that<00:03:41.620> is<00:03:41.829> pretty<00:03:42.220> cool<00:03:42.849> ok<00:03:43.569> so<00:03:43.629> now<00:03:43.900> let's<00:03:43.930> have

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:44.229 
that is pretty cool ok so now let's have

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:45.750 
that is pretty cool ok so now let's have

files now you've got some batteries they

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.460 
files now you've got some batteries they
are<00:04:18.310> ignite<00:04:18.940> hopefully<00:04:19.810> they<00:04:19.930> don't<00:04:20.049> ignite

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
are ignite hopefully they don't ignite

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.210 
are ignite hopefully they don't ignite
you<00:04:21.920> know<00:04:22.130> it's<00:04:22.280> not<00:04:22.430> very<00:04:22.610> funny<00:04:22.820> actually

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
you know it's not very funny actually

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.710 
you know it's not very funny actually
then<00:04:25.220> you've<00:04:25.400> got<00:04:25.580> a<00:04:25.700> power<00:04:25.940> brick<00:04:26.210> okay

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
then you've got a power brick okay

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.170 
then you've got a power brick okay
pretty<00:04:27.350> straightforward<00:04:28.010> and<00:04:28.220> that<00:04:28.940> brings

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
pretty straightforward and that brings

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.180 
pretty straightforward and that brings
us<00:04:29.330> to<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:29.660> remote<00:04:29.780> actually<00:04:30.290> this<00:04:30.650> remote<00:04:30.980> is

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
us to the remote actually this remote is

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.610 
us to the remote actually this remote is
very<00:04:31.580> impressive<00:04:32.000> compared<00:04:32.630> to<00:04:32.840> some<00:04:33.440> of<00:04:33.530> the

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
very impressive compared to some of the

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.200 
very impressive compared to some of the
other<00:04:33.770> remotes<00:04:34.130> we've<00:04:34.370> seen<00:04:34.610> in<00:04:34.760> a<00:04:34.820> similar

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
other remotes we've seen in a similar

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.420 
other remotes we've seen in a similar
price<00:04:35.480> point<00:04:35.810> so<00:04:36.230> you've<00:04:36.380> got<00:04:36.650> full<00:04:37.070> number

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
price point so you've got full number

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.980 
price point so you've got full number
pad<00:04:37.670> you<00:04:37.940> got<00:04:38.060> your<00:04:38.210> power<00:04:38.390> switch<00:04:38.570> home

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
pad you got your power switch home

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.110 
pad you got your power switch home

must be pretty simple to set up or I'm

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.450 
must be pretty simple to set up or I'm
thinking<00:05:39.500> they<00:05:39.620> would<00:05:39.770> have<00:05:39.950> a<00:05:39.979> more<00:05:40.280> detailed
