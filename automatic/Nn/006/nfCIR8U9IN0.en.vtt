like this is written by a woman so it's

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.299

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
going to be like that I don't think so I

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.860 
going to be like that I don't think so I
think<00:00:47.400> it<00:00:47.699> all<00:00:47.790> depends<00:00:48.150> on<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.360> writing<00:00:48.570> and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
think it all depends on the writing and

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.780 
think it all depends on the writing and
the<00:00:48.930> content<00:00:49.409> I<00:00:49.589> really<00:00:50.220> don't<00:00:50.400> think<00:00:50.460> gender

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
the content I really don't think gender

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.350 
the content I really don't think gender
has<00:00:51.150> a<00:00:51.360> role<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.809> play<00:00:51.839> in<00:00:52.019> writing<00:00:52.970> when<00:00:53.970> JK

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
has a role to play in writing when JK

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.420 
has a role to play in writing when JK
Rowling<00:00:54.690> wrote<00:00:54.720> her<00:00:55.110> book<00:00:55.290> the<00:00:56.100> publisher

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
Rowling wrote her book the publisher

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.660 
Rowling wrote her book the publisher
said<00:00:56.820> maybe<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.629> shouldn't<00:00:57.989> write<00:00:58.409> a<00:00:58.769> Joe<00:00:59.489> and

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
said maybe you shouldn't write a Joe and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.670 
said maybe you shouldn't write a Joe and
Kathleen<00:01:00.089> Rowling<00:01:00.479> because<00:01:00.809> then<00:01:01.049> boys

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
Kathleen Rowling because then boys

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.350 
Kathleen Rowling because then boys
wouldn't<00:01:02.070> pick<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.430> up<00:01:02.549> what<00:01:02.970> do<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.119> have<00:01:03.239> to

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
wouldn't pick it up what do you have to

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.369 
wouldn't pick it up what do you have to
say<00:01:03.510> about<00:01:03.689> something<00:01:04.019> like<00:01:04.140> that

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
say about something like that

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.469 
say about something like that
I<00:01:04.589> would<00:01:05.040> say<00:01:05.220> probably<00:01:05.430> Indian<00:01:06.060> scene<00:01:06.270> it's

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
I would say probably Indian scene it's

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.440 
I would say probably Indian scene it's
not<00:01:06.659> relevant<00:01:07.080> at<00:01:07.380> all<00:01:07.500> because<00:01:08.360> because<00:01:09.360> I

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
not relevant at all because because I

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.120 
not relevant at all because because I
think<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.780> Indians<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.260> Leon<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.740> know<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:11.040> all

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
think it Indians in Leon you know we all

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.039 
think it Indians in Leon you know we all
write<00:01:11.490> our<00:01:11.670> names<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:12.210> our<00:01:12.360> books<00:01:12.600> there's<00:01:12.900> no

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
write our names on our books there's no

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.929 
write our names on our books there's no
there's<00:01:13.320> no<00:01:13.380> concept<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.890> pen<00:01:14.189> name<00:01:14.430> as<00:01:14.670> such

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
there's no concept of pen name as such

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.660 
there's no concept of pen name as such
so<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.840> don't<00:01:16.110> think<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.560> really<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.310> know<00:01:17.460> is

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
so I don't think that really you know is

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.130 
so I don't think that really you know is
relevant<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.270> Indians<00:01:18.540> non-indian

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
relevant in the Indians non-indian

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.480 
relevant in the Indians non-indian

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.859 
publishing scene which is again
completely<00:01:20.880> different<00:01:21.270> from<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> scene<00:01:21.689> out

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869
