00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
and we kind of go from there but when I

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.200 
and we kind of go from there but when I
was<00:01:24.000> trying<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.300> think<00:01:24.480> of<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.720> hundred<00:01:24.870> recipes

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.030 
was trying to think of a hundred recipes
I<00:01:27.210> started<00:01:28.140> off<00:01:28.230> with<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.650> breakfast

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.170 
I started off with just the breakfast
chapter<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.520> just<00:01:29.610> trying<00:01:29.910> to<00:01:30.030> make<00:01:30.150> it

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
chapter and just trying to make it

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.990 
chapter and just trying to make it
breakfast<00:01:30.690> things<00:01:31.250> but<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.400> ended<00:01:32.670> up<00:01:32.760> sort

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
breakfast things but that ended up sort

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.270 
breakfast things but that ended up sort
of<00:01:33.030> feeling<00:01:33.300> confining<00:01:33.660> so<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.950> went<00:01:35.190> like

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
of feeling confining so I just went like

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.270 
of feeling confining so I just went like
as<00:01:35.610> as<00:01:36.510> it<00:01:36.960> came<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.440> wherever<00:01:37.830> whatever

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
as as it came and wherever whatever

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.520 
as as it came and wherever whatever
chapter<00:01:38.940> it<00:01:39.060> fit<00:01:39.240> into<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.570> think<00:01:39.930> there's<00:01:40.110> six

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
chapter it fit into I think there's six

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.830

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
lot of life I think so it's fun when the

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.199 
lot of life I think so it's fun when the
food<00:02:59.640> kind<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.090> plays<00:03:00.720> along<00:03:01.459> helps<00:03:02.459> out<00:03:02.610> so<00:03:02.640> I

cooking seasonally does make a

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.310
