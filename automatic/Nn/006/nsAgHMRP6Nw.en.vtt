00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.280 
running out of time here there's lots of
stuff<00:03:03.390> we're<00:03:03.599> running<00:03:03.870> after<00:03:04.049> me<00:03:05.120> come<00:03:06.120> on

well<00:03:07.290> we<00:03:07.500> ran<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:08.010> wrong<00:03:08.160> way<00:03:08.430> how<00:03:08.670> many<00:03:08.730> out

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000

well we ran the wrong way how many out
of<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.390> videos<00:03:09.660> running<00:03:09.780> out<00:03:09.989> of<00:03:10.019> time<00:03:10.290> I

found<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:11.970> well<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.360> think<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.750> might<00:03:12.870> be<00:03:12.900> that

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
found it well I think it might be that

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.339 
found it well I think it might be that
weld<00:03:13.319> that<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.590> saw<00:03:13.769> before<00:03:14.239> maybe<00:03:15.239> um

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
I'm gonna f to the coordinates of this

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.740 
I'm gonna f to the coordinates of this
place<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.459> just<00:03:20.459> so<00:03:20.549> I<00:03:20.579> can<00:03:20.730> get<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.060> good<00:03:21.600> idea

of where this another well another it's
a<00:03:25.560> different<00:03:25.859> one<00:03:25.920> Wells<00:03:26.190> right<00:03:26.459> next<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.850> each

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
a different one Wells right next to each

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.150 
a different one Wells right next to each
other<00:03:27.090> then<00:03:27.720> that's<00:03:27.810> not<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.200> one<00:03:28.380> in<00:03:28.859> a<00:03:28.980> lava

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
other then that's not the one in a lava

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.110 
other then that's not the one in a lava
pit<00:03:31.190> with<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.220> lighting<00:03:32.579> we<00:03:32.700> want<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:32.910> go<00:03:33.000> back
