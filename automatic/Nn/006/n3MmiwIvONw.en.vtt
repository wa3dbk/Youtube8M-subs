00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 We are here today giving a lesson. 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.420
 on floral arrangements and with step a 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.069
 step for you to understand is all your 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.080
 particularities and you can 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.460
 produce at home the most important 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.820
 When we talk about floral arrangement, it's 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.230
 proportion notes that he has intense in 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.820
 pot size 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.170
 This is very important because it does not 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.640
 very robust compared to any other 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.439
 container you are going to make 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.300
 these attacks are examples of arrangements 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.359
 because we have a glass of 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.250
 contemporary design with straight lines 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.410
 few textures interferences and 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.260
 people have more loose arrangements as 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.480
 you did and did not have a format 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.460
 very rigid of these arrangements 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.620
 here we have three examples where 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.899
 people can create compositions between them 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.579
 and you can have a nice decoration 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.110
 for dinner or for your house 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.180
 here for example we have a 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.620
 bouquet of roses and 15 years 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.559
 clean flowers look if they have screens 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.940
 illuminated a rastelo a simple 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.090
 kitchen knife 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.129
 You pass by and take the mirrors off the rose. 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.540
 some leaves on the edge is very 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.170
 interesting that it gives a movement to 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.229
 arrangement and then you join a form one 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.939
 book and you fit in your container 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.159
 the flowers have to be chosen by the 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.140
 appearance or here it is noted that it 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.450
 does not have these burns that she has good 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.189
 state that they are firm they do not 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.200
 are saying pedaling 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.270
 that means they will last for a 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.070
 days in your house, people usually 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.729
 put water software or enough 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.070
 to cover the stalks the flower ideal for 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.259
 you have an angel good result at home is 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.189
 that are made on the day or the day before 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.320
 later 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.060
 and then you have a better presentation 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.729
 you have better durability your 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.670
 arrangement, what is important is that everyone 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.670
 the days you cut diagonally post 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.009
 it and return this water because the ball it 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.250
 retains an accumulation of bacteria and the 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.290
 hard - she dies she gets sick to 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.729
 people have a good combination the ideal 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.340
 would we respect the textures and 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.909
 colors of flowers complementary colors or 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.069
 Can you make an arrangement? 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.840
 the color and texture is similar here 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.149
 we have romantic flowers policing 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.260
 and the pink notes that her textures do not 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.060
 fight each other 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.610
 some flowers and particularly the sea 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.799
 has a very large format structure 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.510
 as in the case of sunflower and 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.549
 then we recommend not mixing it with 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.280
 something else only looks beautiful only 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:26.200
 sunflower orchids 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.849
 and there you simply put it there 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.040
 Basque you have an arrangement 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.560
 wonderful people adorn the houses 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.900
 with arrangements because besides being beautiful and 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.780
 gives an air of festivity there is a 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.069
 well maintained house was of the usual 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.489
 When the person is afraid it is very 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.799
 Good, she transfers her house and goes to 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.310
 your house to the force also at home 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.310
 energizing
