00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
and then now we're going to go ahead and

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.480 
and then now we're going to go ahead and
start<00:01:53.360> on<00:01:53.509> this<00:01:53.630> side<00:01:53.950> actually<00:01:54.950> if<00:01:55.159> you<00:01:55.189> want

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
start on this side actually if you want

to<00:01:55.580> create<00:01:55.790> a<00:01:55.850> little<00:01:56.119> bit<00:01:56.240> of<00:01:56.330> volume<00:01:56.479> it's

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
to create a little bit of volume it's

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.630 
to create a little bit of volume it's
probably<00:01:57.259> a<00:01:57.350> good<00:01:57.560> idea<00:01:57.619> so<00:01:58.130> we're<00:01:58.280> just<00:01:58.310> going

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640
