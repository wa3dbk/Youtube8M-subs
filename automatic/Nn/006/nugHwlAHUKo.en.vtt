00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello my name is adriana lima and ours 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.180
 Today's tip is respect for tissues 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.180
 fabrics for double room 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.439
 the double bedroom usually use box in the 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.009
 so you can work and in the skirt of the 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:23.160
 box is a state in the top part of the 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:26.009
 a thicker fabric is a full bodied 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.290
 plain fabric right and you can work with 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.689
 the pads of various patterns that you 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.220
 can compose but also make it well 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.870
 harmonic frame 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.059
 we also have other fabric 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.520
 which is already a fabric of a line 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.920
 difference even perceives itself 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.690
 its own thickness, and here it is already a 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.339
 thicker fabric have been more 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.039
 full-bodied fabric you can use 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:50.190
 on the walls if you go to work 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.499
 with these 11 to the silver utis but in the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.749
 wall you can also use is a 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:57.030
 fabric and also a fabric 

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:58.199
 which fits very well to put in a 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.089
 armchair 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.680
 We are also working here with 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:07.800
 this fabric he is for silver and black 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.950
 to use a much more 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.930
 more sober and is a fabric that 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.020
 you can use in addition to the room of the 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.730
 couple to another male office 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.290
 No problem at all. 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.240
 inside this situation we have a 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.360
 state that can compose together also 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.550
 so here's a joke you can do 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.120
 in many ways can put a black 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.280
 absolute also together in such a curtain 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.270
 black velvet can also be placed 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.580
 with more tissue is stronger color 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.100
 for example a red for 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.750
 example also a yellow is not a silk 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.220
 The sea was a burnt yellow 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.220
 wonderful within that composition 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.970
 then in this situation you can 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.560
 work inside the room that like the 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.780
 people have to be careful to work 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.760
 with the room is always male and 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.610
 Female sound is a couple that will be there 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.590
 then gray is the junction of the two and the 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.900
 gray also within itself coat within 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.550
 this situation is what will never tire 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.050
 and that will always be contemporary 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.360
 here we also have the list 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.610
 again, that composes very well with 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.200
 this situation work with plain cloth 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.930
 here with a fabric 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.150
 of these 11 with a white is always very 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.160
 Welcome and also composes very well. 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.810
 inside your room on the walls you can 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.850
 play a wallpaper can come back with 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.280
 some other fabric that also fits a lot 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.420
