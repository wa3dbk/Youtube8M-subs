00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.810
 ae 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.920
 beauty talk can make collective 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.480
 between nokia lumia 739 at least 630 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.010
 You can see that we have twice the 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.439
 final touch 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.590
 how do we start with the design of the two 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:30.779
 appliances can see the 780 is thinner 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.120
 lighter only 180 grams or less 630 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.520
 It has 185 grams 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.170
 so basically this means that 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.570
 we have a flash two microphones through 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.790
 audio capture and that we have only one 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.100
 microphone or seven years old and has glass 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.980
 curved and anti-dusty it ours already 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.899
 much to do is not much of you 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.390
 their leaders and all the children 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:01:00.050
 sleeping on the screen of the two devices 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.050
 number 630 we have the resolution of 854 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:09.360
 480 resulting in 221 pb ips craybas than the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.350
 proof of it and on the fire at 730 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.770
 we have the resolution of 1280 by 720 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.310
 result shows 16 pp an oled screen 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:25.680
 here are 4.7 inches and here we have 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:28.860
 4 5 inches can check black took 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:35.400
 LED and Dodô 1780 is well over black shades 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:38.909
 white the white is so plays there the camera 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.869
 of the handsets in September we have the 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.210
 6 mil to 7 megapixel rear camera 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:49.110
 poetic use always saw and flash 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.759
 here in the 60's and we do not have flashes 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:57.810
 only 5 megapixels at its base here 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.030
 filming in HD is that the movie full hd by 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.380
 fact of the lens cause Sergio catches them 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.369
 more details here 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.829
 already the other being two to the wall below 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.770
 Let's just keep what the camera promises. 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.480
 front Sunday 6 780 is 5 megapixels 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.760
 full hd 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:22.799
 in the name to 689 we have as frontal functions 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.319
 and etap shines from it and we can hide 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:28.049
 button is not made and has no 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.690
 It's not easy here. 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:33.930
 then on the sensor part or less 60 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.180
 70 and does not have a gyroscope or has 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.440
 light sensor here we have the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.879
 among some others. 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.700
 Things you get out of closeness 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:48.269
 we love you, windows phone 8.1 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.030
 by 1980 it is domiciled and here it is 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.840
 on black or here we can do 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:58.280
 definitive step just by what we do not 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.959
 we can make passes from applications 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.859
 so she will talk about the hardware of the two 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.200
 gadgets 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:07.440
 both with the processor cualcomm 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.530
 snapdragon 404 and core 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.840
 but here we have 32 and ram and here we have 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.280
 a wrong way 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.430
 means that it plays more games and 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.310
 with better graphic quality 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:26.840
 both have the gpu adreno 205 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:32.030
 Let's see how you two get out of the games. 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.030
 the brightness of the lower 780 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.269
 so basically this will open 11 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:41.450
 other applications what we have a 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.450
 notion 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.859
 houses at the same time let's go 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:56.849
 to see 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:04:06.859
 the opera that was on the site 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:06.859
 we open we will open whatsapp ie 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.560
 September 17 we are - resuming 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:19.530
 so let's talk about the battery of the 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:24.060
 9780 devices we are the battery 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:28.650
 2,200 m perez both with similar to the 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:32.490
 788 just over 170 681 hit in 1880 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:37.970
 my perez both are very good endure 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:41.820
 16 hours 7 hours of intense use of 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:45.509
 8GB storage with expansion up to 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:52.860
 128 target chip yet to the next 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:05:01.880
 area to talk about 970 connections he 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:05:10.009
 difference because fc and dna have not 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:21.870
 630 they are most basic of the dual chip chip 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:25.770
 wifi and gps from cheap handset but not 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:28.580
 I take many good features empty 1,680 if 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:33.120
 you already want qué camera screen performance 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.740
 radio is best games goes since 1737 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.190
 we have a larger set 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.780
 both play their part well then it is 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.190
 basically this is it guys 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.050
 if you liked the video left is that the 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.800
 favorite sign in the channel on your 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.800
