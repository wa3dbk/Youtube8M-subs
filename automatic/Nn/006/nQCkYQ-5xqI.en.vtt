00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
whatever you say about them i don't

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.810 
whatever you say about them i don't
think<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:41.680> defending<00:02:42.190> is<00:02:42.340> still<00:02:42.610> their

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
think that defending is still their

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.390 
think that defending is still their
strong<00:02:43.090> point<00:02:43.830> there's<00:02:44.830> a<00:02:44.890> way<00:02:45.040> in<00:02:45.070> here

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
strong point there's a way in here

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.070 
strong point there's a way in here
somewhere<00:02:45.670> yeah<00:02:46.240> that's<00:02:46.570> probably<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.960> better

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
somewhere yeah that's probably a better

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.420 
somewhere yeah that's probably a better
way<00:02:47.290> in<00:02:47.470> there<00:02:47.650> certainly<00:02:47.920> what<00:02:48.040> we<00:02:48.070> think

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
way in there certainly what we think

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.210 
way in there certainly what we think
anyway<00:02:48.700> we've<00:02:48.850> gone<00:02:49.000> on<00:02:49.120> over<00:02:49.740> 2.5<00:02:50.740> goals<00:02:50.800> is

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
anyway we've gone on over 2.5 goals is

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.550 
anyway we've gone on over 2.5 goals is
our<00:02:51.370> first<00:02:51.640> bet<00:02:51.940> 21<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.750> 20<00:02:53.140> i<00:02:53.170> thought<00:02:53.440> this

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
our first bet 21 to 20 i thought this

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.080 
our first bet 21 to 20 i thought this
would<00:02:53.740> be<00:02:53.770> all<00:02:53.950> done<00:02:54.160> actually<00:02:54.520> not<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.850> yours

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
would be all done actually not to yours

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.580 
would be all done actually not to yours
on<00:02:55.270> but<00:02:55.450> maybe<00:02:55.630> tend<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:55.990> be<00:02:56.080> that<00:02:56.200> ya<00:02:56.350> know

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
on but maybe tend to be that ya know

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.980 
on but maybe tend to be that ya know
this<00:02:56.890> is<00:02:57.070> a<00:02:57.100> right<00:02:58.000> side<00:02:58.270> for<00:02:58.480> us<00:02:58.570> at<00:02:58.720> yeah

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
this is a right side for us at yeah

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.290 
this is a right side for us at yeah
absolutely<00:02:59.410> 21<00:03:00.070> 2<00:03:00.190> 20's<00:03:00.580> a<00:03:00.670> good<00:03:00.820> price<00:03:01.060> so

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
absolutely 21 2 20's a good price so

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.810 
absolutely 21 2 20's a good price so
that's<00:03:01.450> our<00:03:01.630> strongest<00:03:01.930> bet<00:03:02.530> on<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.800> game<00:03:02.980> the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
that's our strongest bet on the game the

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.520 
that's our strongest bet on the game the
second<00:03:04.240> bet<00:03:04.420> well<00:03:04.660> there<00:03:05.110> have<00:03:05.230> been<00:03:05.380> like
