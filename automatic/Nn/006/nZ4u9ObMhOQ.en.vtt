00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
Beatles and they were so impressed by it

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.289 
Beatles and they were so impressed by it
that<00:01:45.960> they<00:01:46.350> decided<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.040> be<00:01:47.759> more<00:01:47.909> actively

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
that they decided to be more actively

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.270 
that they decided to be more actively
involved<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:48.990> believe<00:01:49.259> they<00:01:49.409> wrote<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.070> may

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
involved and I believe they wrote it may

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.490 
involved and I believe they wrote it may
be<00:01:50.340> an<00:01:50.460> additional<00:01:50.670> song<00:01:51.119> or<00:01:51.299> two<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.780> then

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
be an additional song or two and then

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.690 
be an additional song or two and then
