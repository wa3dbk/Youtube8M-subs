00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.820
 as you probably understood today 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.520
 let's talk about a smartwatch in 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.350
 lg watch r detail as you can 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.390
 easily guess from the title of this one 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.400
 review is a very device 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.340
 interesting because it arises live 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.050
 competition with another smartwatch with 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.730
 android huayra board especially with 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.520
 circular display ie we talk about 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.430
 motorola moto 360 obviously not 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.320
 we could not make a comparison 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.969
 video and above all textual among the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.410
 two devices that will arrive in 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.210
 coming days obviously on the canal 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.789
 youtube of pace and the on red bull point 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.829
 com 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.510
 lg watch r is a device we say 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.660
 of the second generation of devices 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.340
 android ue was the first era lg watch 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.100
 launched this summer with samsung 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.230
 of ar live device that has not 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.510
 had a huge market success 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.600
 but that has however paved the way for 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.339
 the android devices were android wear and al 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.590
 operating system that just comes 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.180
 made by google e 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.390
 related to android as a system 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.800
 operating for mobile devices 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:20.020
 in fact this watch must be connected in 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.150
 combination with a phone a tablet 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.250
 android to work then the 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.870
 first requirement for owning a 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.280
 android device where he have a 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.460
 android device 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.520
 for example I combined it with the mx4 medium 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.590
 these days for the test on red bol 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.950
 is a device that as we have said 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.930
 on the front there is a display 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.560
 completely circular in technology 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.759
 plastic oled therefore low consumption e 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.460
 rather vivid and bright colors 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.640
 resolution 320 x 320 pixels then 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.470
 we are obviously talking about the sides that 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.220
 so we cannot say defined 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:03.460
 because it is a coated circular display 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.430
 on a 1.3-inch display 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.250
 the display is then surrounded by it 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:13.239
 let's say from this ring that follows 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.040
 very real clocks and this is a 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.650
 element that differentiates it and much from 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.390
 motorola 360 360 because the circuitry 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.420
 of this device is hidden behind 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.430
 this frame while the 360 motion is more 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.610
 compact in size though it has 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.320
 a larger display, however, hides the 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.900
 circuitry behind a small band 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.610
 black on the display so that unfortunately 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.489
 makes the device not completely 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.340
 circular to complete the overview 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:42.160
 on design we have this body in 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.620
 steel plastic with a single button 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.260
 physical on the right side a strap in 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.230
 black leather in this case and on the side 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.299
 rear pins for charging and 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.030
 optical sensor for reading the 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.310
 heartbeat function that integrates 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.140
 with the operating system and with google 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.260
 fit application designed precisely for the 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.400
 fitness and developed by google itself 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.989
 android wear is now we know it 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.090
 quite well it allows interaction 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.620
 rather immediate with what they are 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.980
 smartphone functions ie 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.350
 reply display notifications 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.910
 see the google now tabs then the 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.070
 weather or traffic 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.510
 however other useful information on 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.910
 place where we are 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.890
 also allows you to interact with the 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.910
 applications such as google maps 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.390
 to see driving directions 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.910
 or with third-party applications 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.100
 can be music match to see i 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.350
 song lyrics as it can be 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.410
 the same google camera app 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.960
 to be able to see the shot just 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.360
 resumed and above all use the 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.070
 the clock as a sort of remote control 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.380
 and all this is animated by a 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.840
 processor qualcomm snapdragon 400 from 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.360
 1.12 that frequency is half a gigabyte of 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.040
 ram memory and 4 gigabytes of storage 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.900
 finally after a few months we can 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.240
 tell what this storage is for is 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.640
 now it's possible to download the 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.740
 music on this device and listen to it 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.550
 directly through it with 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.350
 bluetooth headphones 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.320
 the application that allows this is 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.950
 google play music which obviously goes 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.420
 installed on the android terminal and then 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.400
 works in conjunction with this 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.470
 smartwatch what i liked 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.660
 Much of this device has been 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.940
 the benefits because precisely the 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.100
 qualcomm snapdragon processor succeeds in 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.750
 offer good performances below 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.730
 every use and above all the duration 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.460
 of the battery that you spy on it and make it stand out 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.100
 compared to the average of the other watches 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.240
 I did more than one day of use 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.590
 also with the display mode always 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.230
 active with the spending method 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.480
 imperative one makes a day and a half almost 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.210
 2 if you don't use a lot of clock by 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.680
 use it also goes to three if you are a bit 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.110
 more thrifty with use and 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.240
 especially disabling the mode 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.190
 of the display always on 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.190
 otherwise it is a device that I am 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:58.669
 really liked small holes 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:01.040
 that is, it lacks respect to the motorola moto 360 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.470
 for example the common sensor stands 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.910
 therefore it is necessary from the regular 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.740
 manually from the settings and 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.930
 above all I think I found one 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.580
 a little big in size is true 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.400
 that the display is very nice and is 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.140
 completely circular however on mine 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.330
 wrist that is not so big 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.100
 I find that it is a bit excessive as 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.480
 size so maybe in the next 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.000
 generation would be more interesting 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.890
 have a little more compact design for 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.229
 the rest is a device that does not weigh 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.830
 the strap is not very visible on the wrist 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:29.840
 Leather 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.340
 realized quite so well the 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.930
 it also makes a device pretty 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.150
 elegant and is designed for that user 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.490
 that precisely does not want a device a 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.700
 bit of a bit nerd but something of a 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:43.450
 a little more elegant than you can wear 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.870
 around without attracting too many glances 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.230
 unwanted 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.830
 otherwise it costs under 300 euros yes 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:54.170
 will find from mid-November 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.400
 also in our country and what to say 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.680
 surely it is a device 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.570
 interesting android ue was still 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.310
 according to me some small thing to 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.860
 to fix at the level of functionality not 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.240
 it's still so interesting to bring 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.540
 always on the wrist such an object 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:11.360
 but surely it can be something 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:15.420
 delicious and different from the usual 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.860
 another tiny flaw I owe 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.290
 surely detect this 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.870
 device is that I also say 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.580
 detected on motorola moto 360 with i 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.560
 circular displays sometimes the text comes 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.850
 cut a little brutally or 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.280
 however the elements are not well 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:32.550
 unfortunately the text is not centered 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:35.670
 developed to be put on one 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.560
 round surface so sometimes it comes 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.720
 slightly cut though, of course 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.620
 the effect with the various dials 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:45.960
 of the watch is definitely a pretty 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.620
 effect as it looks like a watch 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.830
 true 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.210
 well this was lgg watch rv invitation 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.180
 especially to read the review 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:56.250
 complete that you find on reed bol.com and 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.200
 which you can access via the 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.790
 link present in the description vi 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.460
 I also invite you to review the 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.960
 motorola moto 360 to make a quick one 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.390
 comparison between the two devices but 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.340
 especially waiting for our video 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.770
 comparison and comparison that you will find in 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:14.180
 coming days we say goodbye here for
