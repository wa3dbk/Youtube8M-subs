Extension and we're here to talk about
how<00:00:11.210> to<00:00:11.270> prune<00:00:11.660> and<00:00:11.870> train<00:00:11.930> a<00:00:12.200> young<00:00:12.410> grapevine

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
how to prune and train a young grapevine

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.970 
how to prune and train a young grapevine
now<00:00:14.059> this<00:00:14.270> is<00:00:14.389> a<00:00:14.420> vine<00:00:14.719> that<00:00:14.750> was<00:00:15.199> planted<00:00:15.709> last

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
now this is a vine that was planted last

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.519 
now this is a vine that was planted last
spring<00:00:16.129> and<00:00:16.640> we<00:00:17.360> got<00:00:17.600> it<00:00:17.750> from<00:00:17.900> a<00:00:18.020> dormant

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
spring and we got it from a dormant

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.769 
spring and we got it from a dormant
plant<00:00:18.770> or<00:00:19.039> rooted<00:00:19.400> cutting<00:00:19.789> and<00:00:19.970> you<00:00:20.480> can<00:00:20.600> see

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
plant or rooted cutting and you can see

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:22.900 
plant or rooted cutting and you can see
the<00:00:20.900> original<00:00:21.169> part<00:00:21.710> of<00:00:21.949> the<00:00:22.310> planting<00:00:22.730> right

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
the original part of the planting right

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.120 
the original part of the planting right
here<00:00:23.300> okay<00:00:24.050> so<00:00:24.080> this<00:00:24.349> is<00:00:24.499> what<00:00:24.679> we<00:00:24.769> got<00:00:25.009> from

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
here okay so this is what we got from

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.169 
here okay so this is what we got from
the<00:00:25.220> nursery<00:00:25.460> with<00:00:25.730> a<00:00:25.759> good<00:00:25.970> root<00:00:26.150> system

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:26.179 
the nursery with a good root system

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.989 
the nursery with a good root system
under<00:00:26.720> it<00:00:26.839> we<00:00:27.109> planted<00:00:27.560> it<00:00:27.710> and<00:00:27.859> we<00:00:28.550> had<00:00:28.699> a<00:00:28.730> bud

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:28.999 
under it we planted it and we had a bud

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.019 
under it we planted it and we had a bud
break<00:00:29.300> and<00:00:29.599> some<00:00:30.320> vine<00:00:30.560> growth<00:00:30.890> so<00:00:31.730> this<00:00:31.909> is

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
break and some vine growth so this is

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.640 
break and some vine growth so this is
last<00:00:32.300> year's<00:00:32.630> growth<00:00:32.870> right<00:00:33.170> here<00:00:33.410> so<00:00:33.530> this

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
last year's growth right here so this

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.819 
last year's growth right here so this
was<00:00:33.829> a<00:00:33.890> green<00:00:34.130> shoe<00:00:35.110> typically<00:00:36.110> you<00:00:36.380> may<00:00:36.530> get

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
was a green shoe typically you may get

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:38.680 
was a green shoe typically you may get
more<00:00:37.220> than<00:00:37.280> one<00:00:37.580> chute<00:00:37.880> developing<00:00:38.480> you<00:00:38.570> may

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
more than one chute developing you may

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.690 
more than one chute developing you may
have<00:00:38.840> several<00:00:39.080> buds<00:00:39.410> on<00:00:39.620> here<00:00:39.950> but<00:00:40.400> we<00:00:40.460> want<00:00:40.640> to

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
have several buds on here but we want to

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.000 
have several buds on here but we want to
prune<00:00:40.940> this<00:00:41.150> back<00:00:41.390> to<00:00:41.660> one<00:00:41.900> strong<00:00:42.320> vine<00:00:42.710> your

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
prune this back to one strong vine your

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.220 
prune this back to one strong vine your
strongest<00:00:43.460> one<00:00:43.760> and<00:00:44.060> we're<00:00:44.630> going<00:00:44.780> to<00:00:44.870> arrange

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
strongest one and we're going to arrange

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.110 
strongest one and we're going to arrange
for<00:00:45.470> that<00:00:45.680> to<00:00:45.920> be<00:00:46.040> tied<00:00:46.310> up<00:00:46.490> to<00:00:46.610> a<00:00:46.640> trellis

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
for that to be tied up to a trellis

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.330 
for that to be tied up to a trellis
because<00:00:47.660> this<00:00:48.110> particular<00:00:48.500> vine<00:00:48.920> is<00:00:49.130> what's

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
because this particular vine is what's

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.070 
because this particular vine is what's
going<00:00:49.520> to<00:00:49.610> become<00:00:49.970> our<00:00:50.000> permanent<00:00:50.360> trunk<00:00:50.900> or

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
going to become our permanent trunk or

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.480 
going to become our permanent trunk or
the<00:00:51.170> permanent<00:00:51.410> part<00:00:51.800> of<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:51.980> plant<00:00:52.250> that's

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:52.490 
the permanent part of the plant that's

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.680 
the permanent part of the plant that's
going<00:00:52.610> to<00:00:52.670> be<00:00:52.790> with<00:00:52.970> us<00:00:53.060> for<00:00:53.240> the<00:00:53.300> life<00:00:53.480> of<00:00:53.600> the

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
going to be with us for the life of the

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.630 
going to be with us for the life of the
planting<00:00:54.170> so<00:00:54.830> we<00:00:54.890> want<00:00:55.040> to<00:00:55.100> make<00:00:55.220> sure<00:00:55.250> it's

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
planting so we want to make sure it's

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.610 
planting so we want to make sure it's
the<00:00:55.760> strongest<00:00:56.210> of<00:00:56.450> the<00:00:56.960> vines<00:00:57.170> that<00:00:57.320> we<00:00:57.470> can

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
the strongest of the vines that we can

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.380 
the strongest of the vines that we can
choose<00:00:57.830> from<00:00:57.890> any<00:00:58.310> other<00:00:58.520> one<00:00:58.760> that<00:00:58.940> developed

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
choose from any other one that developed

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.720 
choose from any other one that developed
it's<00:00:59.540> very<00:00:59.720> weak<00:00:59.960> we<00:01:00.170> can<00:01:00.320> just<00:01:00.500> cut<00:01:01.100> that<00:01:01.250> out

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
it's very weak we can just cut that out

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.880 
it's very weak we can just cut that out
select<00:01:02.210> our<00:01:02.360> best<00:01:02.570> one<00:01:02.840> now<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:03.380> time<00:01:03.650> of<00:01:03.680> year

select our best one now the time of year

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.620 
select our best one now the time of year
to<00:01:04.040> make<00:01:04.070> these<00:01:04.430> cuts<00:01:04.729> or<00:01:04.970> when<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.210> Canes<00:01:05.449> are

at<00:01:35.329> least<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:35.630> bottom<00:01:36.020> wire<00:01:36.229> but<00:01:36.950> in<00:01:37.039> order<00:01:37.219> to

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
at least the bottom wire but in order to

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.859 
at least the bottom wire but in order to
make<00:01:37.490> sure<00:01:37.520> it's<00:01:37.789> growing<00:01:37.999> straight<00:01:38.420> you<00:01:38.689> can

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
make sure it's growing straight you can

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.020 
make sure it's growing straight you can
see<00:01:39.079> we<00:01:39.229> supported<00:01:39.829> this<00:01:40.009> with<00:01:40.670> a<00:01:40.700> small

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
see we supported this with a small

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.789 
see we supported this with a small
bamboo<00:01:41.240> pole<00:01:41.659> any<00:01:41.899> kind<00:01:42.109> of<00:01:42.200> planting<00:01:42.560> stake

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
bamboo pole any kind of planting stake

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.039 
bamboo pole any kind of planting stake
will<00:01:42.979> work<00:01:43.159> and<00:01:43.399> we<00:01:43.819> just<00:01:44.060> tie<00:01:44.270> that<00:01:44.299> vine<00:01:44.840> up

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
will work and we just tie that vine up

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.779 
will work and we just tie that vine up
as<00:01:45.200> it<00:01:45.319> grows<00:01:45.530> rather<00:01:45.859> than<00:01:46.130> let<00:01:46.249> it<00:01:46.369> grow<00:01:46.520> on

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
as it grows rather than let it grow on

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.090 
as it grows rather than let it grow on
the<00:01:46.909> ground<00:01:46.969> where<00:01:47.420> it<00:01:47.509> can<00:01:47.659> get<00:01:47.810> rot<00:01:48.560> problems

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
the ground where it can get rot problems

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.800 
the ground where it can get rot problems
and<00:01:49.310> not<00:01:49.459> develop<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:49.939> nice<00:01:50.090> straight<00:01:50.539> growth

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
and not develop a nice straight growth

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.899 
and not develop a nice straight growth
like<00:01:51.079> we<00:01:51.229> want<00:01:51.439> so<00:01:51.950> we<00:01:52.100> tie<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:52.369> up<00:01:52.549> just<00:01:52.819> like

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
like we want so we tie it up just like

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.699 
like we want so we tie it up just like
you<00:01:53.060> tie<00:01:53.270> up<00:01:53.420> a<00:01:53.539> beefsteak<00:01:53.929> tomato<00:01:54.259> get<00:01:54.590> the

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:54.709 
you tie up a beefsteak tomato get the

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:57.309 
you tie up a beefsteak tomato get the
growth<00:01:54.889> that<00:01:55.069> you<00:01:55.159> want<00:01:55.399> and<00:01:55.869> as<00:01:56.869> I<00:01:56.959> said<00:01:57.020> we've

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
growth that you want and as I said we've

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.069 
growth that you want and as I said we've
got<00:01:57.469> pretty<00:01:57.770> good<00:01:57.920> buds<00:01:58.340> here<00:01:58.759> reaching<00:01:59.719> up<00:01:59.959> to

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
got pretty good buds here reaching up to

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.590 
got pretty good buds here reaching up to
the<00:02:00.229> first<00:02:01.100> wire<00:02:01.399> you<00:02:02.029> can<00:02:02.179> see<00:02:02.389> that<00:02:02.569> I

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
the first wire you can see that I

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.929 
the first wire you can see that I
actually<00:02:02.840> make<00:02:03.350> it<00:02:03.499> to<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.709> top<00:02:03.979> wire<00:02:04.340> but<00:02:04.850> you

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
actually make it to the top wire but you

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:06.489 
actually make it to the top wire but you
can<00:02:05.090> see<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.420> growth<00:02:05.630> up<00:02:05.869> here<00:02:06.139> is<00:02:06.259> very

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:06.499 
can see the growth up here is very

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:08.949 
can see the growth up here is very
scrawny<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:07.429> spindly<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:08.240> isn't<00:02:08.869> really

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
scrawny and spindly and isn't really

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.500 
scrawny and spindly and isn't really
going<00:02:09.229> to<00:02:09.289> lead<00:02:09.500> to<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.890> good<00:02:10.369> strong<00:02:10.789> trunk<00:02:11.300> I'd

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
going to lead to a good strong trunk I'd

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.470 
going to lead to a good strong trunk I'd
rather<00:02:11.810> actually<00:02:12.410> start<00:02:12.770> new<00:02:13.370> growth<00:02:13.730> for

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
rather actually start new growth for

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.630 
rather actually start new growth for
reaching<00:02:14.989> to<00:02:15.110> this<00:02:15.230> top<00:02:15.500> wire<00:02:15.769> for<00:02:16.040> next<00:02:16.340> year

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
reaching to this top wire for next year

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.610 
reaching to this top wire for next year
so<00:02:17.150> what<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:17.510> means<00:02:17.810> is<00:02:17.959> that<00:02:17.989> I<00:02:18.140> max

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
so what that means is that I max

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.110 
so what that means is that I max
going<00:02:18.739> to<00:02:18.799> cut<00:02:19.040> this<00:02:19.250> off<00:02:20.080> here<00:02:21.080> rather<00:02:21.319> low<00:02:22.120> to

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
going to cut this off here rather low to

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.070 
going to cut this off here rather low to
try<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.360> get<00:02:23.690> this<00:02:24.560> bud<00:02:24.920> here<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:26.420> break<00:02:26.690> and

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
try to get this bud here to break and

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.649 
try to get this bud here to break and
give<00:02:27.470> me<00:02:27.560> a<00:02:27.620> much<00:02:27.920> stronger<00:02:28.340> shoot<00:02:28.849> to<00:02:29.299> develop

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
give me a much stronger shoot to develop

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.740 
give me a much stronger shoot to develop
my<00:02:29.780> trunk<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.319> top<00:02:30.620> wire<00:02:30.950> next<00:02:31.790> year<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:32.720> I

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
my trunk to the top wire next year so I

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.979 
my trunk to the top wire next year so I
can<00:02:33.049> just<00:02:34.060> take<00:02:35.060> that<00:02:35.269> there<00:02:35.599> and<00:02:35.780> then

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
can just take that there and then

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.350 
can just take that there and then
instead<00:02:36.470> of<00:02:36.530> using<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.950> bamboo<00:02:37.129> pole<00:02:37.360> this

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
instead of using the bamboo pole this

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.360 
instead of using the bamboo pole this
year<00:02:38.870> I<00:02:39.019> can<00:02:39.530> just<00:02:39.769> tie<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.579> the<00:02:40.670> wire<00:02:43.810> and

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
year I can just tie it to the wire and

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.979 
year I can just tie it to the wire and
this<00:02:46.370> bud<00:02:46.640> will<00:02:46.849> hopefully<00:02:47.209> break<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.840> give

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
this bud will hopefully break and give

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.869 
this bud will hopefully break and give
them<00:02:48.200> you<00:02:48.319> a<00:02:48.379> good<00:02:48.560> strong<00:02:48.860> shoot<00:02:49.220> I'm<00:02:49.670> going

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
them you a good strong shoot I'm going

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.240 
them you a good strong shoot I'm going
to<00:02:49.940> reach<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.269> second<00:02:50.629> wire<00:02:50.810> next<00:02:51.530> year<00:02:51.950> of

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
to reach the second wire next year of

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.220 
to reach the second wire next year of
course<00:02:52.310> these<00:02:52.730> buds<00:02:53.000> lower<00:02:53.299> down<00:02:53.599> will<00:02:53.870> also

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
course these buds lower down will also

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.289 
course these buds lower down will also
break<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:55.160> if<00:02:55.250> this<00:02:55.370> one<00:02:55.549> happens<00:02:55.849> to<00:02:55.940> be<00:02:56.030> weak

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
break and if this one happens to be weak

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.809 
break and if this one happens to be weak
I<00:02:56.480> may<00:02:56.629> select<00:02:56.930> one<00:02:57.140> of<00:02:57.170> these<00:02:57.440> but<00:02:57.859> if<00:02:58.310> these

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
I may select one of these but if these

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.849 
I may select one of these but if these
if<00:02:59.299> this<00:02:59.510> bud<00:02:59.720> does<00:02:59.959> turn<00:03:00.170> out<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.410> be<00:03:00.440> a<00:03:00.530> strong

if this bud does turn out to be a strong

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.069 
if this bud does turn out to be a strong
shoot<00:03:01.190> I'll<00:03:01.370> be<00:03:01.700> cutting<00:03:01.970> these<00:03:02.150> off<00:03:02.480> next

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
shoot I'll be cutting these off next

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.649 
shoot I'll be cutting these off next
winter<00:03:03.440> and<00:03:03.560> getting<00:03:04.400> my<00:03:04.519> single<00:03:04.940> trunk<00:03:05.180> back

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
winter and getting my single trunk back

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.190 
winter and getting my single trunk back
up<00:03:05.900> to<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:06.109> top<00:03:06.319> wire<00:03:07.359> next<00:03:08.359> year<00:03:08.720> when<00:03:09.049> this

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
up to the top wire next year when this

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.920 
up to the top wire next year when this

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
does reach the top wire eventually what

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.479 
does reach the top wire eventually what
we'll<00:03:12.079> be<00:03:12.170> doing<00:03:12.470> is<00:03:12.620> taking<00:03:12.769> one<00:03:13.129> year<00:03:13.310> old

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
we'll be doing is taking one year old

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.640 
we'll be doing is taking one year old
cane<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:14.060> either<00:03:14.480> draping<00:03:14.989> it<00:03:15.079> over<00:03:15.170> this<00:03:15.409> top

wire in an umbrella Kniffin

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.759 
wire in an umbrella Kniffin
or<00:03:18.709> we'll<00:03:19.430> be<00:03:19.549> taking<00:03:19.970> one<00:03:20.599> cane<00:03:20.930> at<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.560> top
