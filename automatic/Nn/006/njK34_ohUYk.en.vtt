00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
to lead this move it's important to

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.749

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
to do that with the crossover breaks is

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.580 
to do that with the crossover breaks is
to<00:01:56.130> keep<00:01:56.310> your<00:01:56.460> arms<00:01:56.759> accessible<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:58.439> I'll

four so right there I gave my hand back
in<00:02:24.490> an<00:02:24.970> area<00:02:25.420> where<00:02:25.570> he<00:02:25.600> can<00:02:25.720> kind<00:02:26.080> of<00:02:26.170> see<00:02:26.440> it

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
in an area where he can kind of see it

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.260 
in an area where he can kind of see it
and<00:02:26.740> easily<00:02:27.160> grab<00:02:27.400> it<00:02:27.580> so<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:27.850> he<00:02:27.940> could<00:02:28.090> lead

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
and easily grab it so that he could lead

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.180

me<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.450> another<00:02:29.290> crossover<00:02:29.680> break<00:02:29.980> or<00:02:30.130> a

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
me to another crossover break or a

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.740

different figure two three four two
three<00:02:35.020> and<00:02:35.710> four<00:02:36.220> so<00:02:36.580> for<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.880> turn<00:02:37.180> I'm<00:02:37.480> going

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
three and four so for the turn I'm going

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.750 
three and four so for the turn I'm going
to<00:02:38.020> take<00:02:38.170> my<00:02:38.320> left<00:02:38.500> foot<00:02:38.890> cross<00:02:39.250> it<00:02:39.460> over<00:02:39.520> my

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
to take my left foot cross it over my

to take my left foot cross it over my
right<00:02:39.940> foot<00:02:40.300> I'm<00:02:40.510> going<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.410> pivot<00:02:41.680> around<00:02:41.890> on

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
right foot I'm going to pivot around on

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.890 
right foot I'm going to pivot around on
that<00:02:42.520> left<00:02:42.790> foot<00:02:43.090> so<00:02:43.300> that<00:02:43.330> left<00:02:43.600> foot<00:02:43.780> is

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
that left foot so that left foot is

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.410 
that left foot so that left foot is
essentially<00:02:44.410> stuck<00:02:44.770> in<00:02:44.950> place<00:02:45.300> transfer<00:02:46.300> my

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
essentially stuck in place transfer my

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.870 
essentially stuck in place transfer my
weight<00:02:46.600> back<00:02:46.840> onto<00:02:47.110> my<00:02:47.350> right<00:02:47.590> foot<00:02:47.890> close<00:02:48.640> my

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
weight back onto my right foot close my

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.880 
weight back onto my right foot close my

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
feet with my left foot have my right

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.420 
feet with my left foot have my right
foot<00:02:51.100> available<00:02:51.520> to<00:02:51.700> go<00:02:51.790> back<00:02:51.970> to<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.180> basic

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
foot available to go back to the basic

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:19.640 
foot available to go back to the basic
let's<00:02:54.430> try<00:02:54.640> that<00:02:54.700> with<00:02:54.850> some<00:02:54.910> music

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650
