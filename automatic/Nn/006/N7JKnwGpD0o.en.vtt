00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.900
 to the girls and girls well I 'm 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:09.219
 here again and good today I bring you a 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:11.530
 video and I bring you two homemade masks 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.900
 for our skin are two masks 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.140
 to clean our skin to soften 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:21.600
 a little bit our skin on top that helps 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:24.300
 clarify our skin and clarify 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.670
 to remove spots I have already made a 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.130
 mask similar to this one what is 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.860
 I did it last night and I really liked it 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.250
 very much very much the result and you see 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.040
 in a day but I 'm not less skin 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.610
 super good I do not know if it's me that I'm very 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.400
 weird but I like so much good 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.350
 the video that you like the mask that 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.489
 put it into practice and let's start 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.559
 the ingredients are oatmeal you know 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.820
 you can find it in mercadona enrique 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.400
 it's a supermarket and well the truth is not 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.100
 he 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.320
 It serves to exfoliate the skin because 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.230
 be like granites because it's going very well 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.000
 Also, the ingredients are like 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.830
 natural so instead of being 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.540
 using masks so they contain 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.300
 chemical things and I prefer to do my 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.550
 natural masks that I like a lot 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.580
 a natural yogurt has to be natural 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.060
 that has to say that it is natural and 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.060
 ready 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.149
 good to apply in half yogurt you 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.030
 you can apply much less because to me 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:36.210
 I had a lot of mask left over so 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.230
 good half yogurt and two tablespoons of 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.440
 oats 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.670
 and we 're going to mix everything very very very 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.050
 well until there is a paste like that 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.250
 next mask we will use what 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.350
 same what we are going to add a 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.810
 ingredient and to remove spots and 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.830
 that we're going to use a spoonful of 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.830
 juice of a lemon 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.850
 we do the same thing from before simply 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.370
 that now we are going to take a spoonful 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.370
 of the lemon juice 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.159
 and ready 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.530
 to apply the mask simply 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:19.090
 we have to apply the face giving 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.640
 circular movements all over the face 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.160
 avoiding applying it by the contour of 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.269
 the eyes and we're just going to clarify 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.269
 with plenty of water 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.850
 we already have our two masks 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.520
 made the need to allow 15 minutes 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.560
 on the skin and then remove with abundant 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.080
 You can use water as a rod 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.900
 I will use it every week what 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.630
 happens is that sometimes I forget but 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.240
 many times when I'm bored in my 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.430
 house suddenly I say good I'm going to apply 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.290
 a mask as you see both 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.750
 Masks are super easy you can 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.520
 choose between one or the other if you do not want 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.710
 use lemon because you already know that the 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.900
 lemon you have to be very careful because 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.270
 when we apply lemon we can not 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.220
 get out in the sun so this mask the 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.660
 of lemon should be done preferably 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:13.480
 at night I was worth yesterday I did it 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.360
 night so in the night please and 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.010
 for those who do not want to use it with 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.720
 lemon and just want to soften a 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.790
 little his skin to clarify a bit then 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.340
 choose the second option that is only the 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.920
 Natural yogurt with oatmeal will leave you 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.530
 super soft skin I do not know to me 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.020
