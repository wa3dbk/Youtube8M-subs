00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:09.870
 Welcome to this video 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:13.139
 Today, we would like to have the optics 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.750
 from the black galaxy s 4 with the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.000
 compare white 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.539
 and there are a few 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.869
 particularities you definitely 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.900
 should know otherwise because you will later 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.449
 I'm so surprised I got the samsung 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.940
 galaxy s here in white and the samsung 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.940
 galaxy in black 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:43.170
 yes I would say at the beginning first 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:45.239
 the back of something like that believes so 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.260
 I realize and pretty well 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.340
 was just here at the time 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.000
 black fashion on and in this 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.629
 model 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.600
 there you realize that I would something 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.789
 say that such a carbon look 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:05.189
 So that's really different than that 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:08.420
 at the galaxy s3 where just that 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:12.119
 high-gloss plastic was installed 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:15.270
 gms 4 you can see this pattern there 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.360
 So that's really different 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:23.340
 and of course that's the whole thing 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:27.869
 Back is the edge in this design 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.900
 Silver is the same with both 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:35.030
 Models are the same with the white model 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:41.060
 and the black model here 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.060
 it looks like that 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:51.700
 you can also see that very well again 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:53.550
 had to compare now once with 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.040
 the white galaxy s 4 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.370
 So the country eyes of the country 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.370
 same 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.170
 However, at the back there falls 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.170
 This carbon look is not that strong 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.880
 in my opinion, so it does 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:24.130
 already a different impression that times 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.300
 to make something clear but then realizes 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.590
 it already is much harder 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.310
 here with the camera to show and 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.870
 Of course, that's also possible 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.080
 conclude that the worse too 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.540
 knowledge of this carbon look so it 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.620
 Of course, it's a matter of taste 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:46.870
 Which one I like better here 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:50.200
 personally like the black quite well 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.400
 but I have to say that I know 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.230
 Not if I am after my time 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.930
 maybe I would bother if ever 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.050
 here this pattern on the back 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.290
 it looks great in any case 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:06.660
 but if that's the case in the long run 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.950
 I dare to doubt that 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.510
 So of course, everyone has to do it himself 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.850
 that's pretty clear 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.560
 the best you look at the devices 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:20.049
 Nevertheless, again in your specialty markets 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.630
 and then compares them again 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:25.060
 which of course both devices, both the 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.440
 black as well as the white available 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.910
 have and be prepared 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.360
 otherwise I hope my video you can 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:38.830
 help you a little bit 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:45.690
 and yes, I would say it was 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:45.690
 that and calls for the next video
