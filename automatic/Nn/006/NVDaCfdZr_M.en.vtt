minutes today talking about a couple of

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.390 
minutes today talking about a couple of
features<00:00:09.540> which<00:00:09.900> make<00:00:10.200> live<00:00:10.559> viewing<00:00:11.040> and

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
features which make live viewing and

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.749 
features which make live viewing and
enix<00:00:11.880> Control<00:00:12.300> Center<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.840> little<00:00:13.110> bit<00:00:13.230> easier

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:13.759 
enix Control Center a little bit easier

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.770 
enix Control Center a little bit easier
first<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.910> want<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.150> deal<00:00:15.269> with<00:00:15.330> something<00:00:15.630> that

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
first I want to deal with something that

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.330 
first I want to deal with something that
frustrated<00:00:16.470> me<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.619> little<00:00:16.890> when<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.100> first

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
frustrated me a little when I first

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.550 
frustrated me a little when I first
started<00:00:17.640> using<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.060> program<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:19.350> was

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
started using the program and that was

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.599 
started using the program and that was
that<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:20.930> pop-up<00:00:21.930> mode<00:00:22.320> here<00:00:22.680> where<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.039> goes

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
that this pop-up mode here where it goes

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.160 
that this pop-up mode here where it goes
larger<00:00:24.119> when<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.390> hover<00:00:24.600> your<00:00:24.689> mouse<00:00:24.779> over

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
larger when you hover your mouse over

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.070 
larger when you hover your mouse over
I'd<00:00:26.099> found<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.789> rather<00:00:27.029> annoying<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.779> that

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
I'd found that rather annoying and that

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.230 
I'd found that rather annoying and that
more<00:00:28.410> than<00:00:28.529> anything<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.519> didn't<00:00:29.880> like<00:00:30.029> it

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
more than anything so I didn't like it

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.299 
more than anything so I didn't like it
and<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:31.109> can<00:00:31.260> turn<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.619> off<00:00:31.740> very<00:00:32.070> easily

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
and you can turn that off very easily

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.110 
and you can turn that off very easily
just<00:00:32.489> go<00:00:32.820> up<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.090> tools<00:00:33.360> options<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:37.730> you<00:00:38.730> and

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
just go up to tools options and you and

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.110 
just go up to tools options and you and
then<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.260> can<00:00:40.770> see<00:00:40.980> here<00:00:41.160> mouse<00:00:41.370> over<00:00:41.820> and

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
then you can see here mouse over and

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.779 
then you can see here mouse over and
just<00:00:42.239> go<00:00:42.390> off<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.960> then<00:00:43.260> okay<00:00:43.770> all<00:00:44.340> right<00:00:44.520> and

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
just go off and then okay all right and

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.479 
just go off and then okay all right and
then<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.149> won't<00:00:45.300> happen<00:00:45.450> again<00:00:45.600> now<00:00:46.489> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
then that won't happen again now the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.490 
then that won't happen again now the
next<00:00:47.760> issue<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.180> how<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.480> zoom<00:00:48.840> around<00:00:49.050> within

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
next issue is how to zoom around within

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.069 
next issue is how to zoom around within
the<00:00:49.649> image<00:00:50.030> so<00:00:51.030> let's<00:00:51.239> look<00:00:51.420> at<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:51.719> bottom

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
the image so let's look at this bottom

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.600 
the image so let's look at this bottom
image<00:00:52.199> here<00:00:52.559> fit<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.949> first<00:00:53.129> thing<00:00:53.370> where

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
image here fit the first thing where

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.100 
image here fit the first thing where
you've<00:00:53.760> got<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.969> layout<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.539> we've<00:00:54.899> got

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
you've got a layout like this we've got

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.650 
you've got a layout like this we've got
multiple<00:00:55.620> camera<00:00:56.430> views<00:00:56.699> perhaps<00:00:57.210> different

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
multiple camera views perhaps different

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.979 
multiple camera views perhaps different
cameras<00:00:59.180> let's<00:01:00.180> just<00:01:00.390> look<00:01:00.510> at<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.719> bottom

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
cameras let's just look at the bottom

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.590 
cameras let's just look at the bottom
left<00:01:01.170> here<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.520> we'll<00:01:02.670> click<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.359> and

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
left here and so we'll click on that and

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.899 
left here and so we'll click on that and
when<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.930> select<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.559> camera<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.430> has<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
when you select a camera it has the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.060 
when you select a camera it has the
yellow<00:01:06.119> border<00:01:06.450> around<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.860> we've

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
yellow border around it so we've

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.070 
yellow border around it so we've
achieved<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.610> now<00:01:08.880> but<00:01:09.479> you'll<00:01:09.630> notice<00:01:09.840> that

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
achieved that now but you'll notice that

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.440 
achieved that now but you'll notice that
when<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.380> bring<00:01:10.530> up<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.830> PTZ<00:01:11.310> controls<00:01:11.880> at

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
when you bring up the PTZ controls at

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.750 
when you bring up the PTZ controls at
the<00:01:12.630> moment<00:01:12.990> they've<00:01:13.140> greyed<00:01:13.409> out<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.890> you

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
the moment they've greyed out so you

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.850 
the moment they've greyed out so you
can't<00:01:15.060> use<00:01:15.360> them<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.840> zoom<00:01:16.049> around<00:01:16.200> unless<00:01:16.710> in

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
can't use them to zoom around unless in

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.590 
can't use them to zoom around unless in
it<00:01:17.009> what<00:01:17.820> you've<00:01:17.939> got<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.119> do<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.299> come<00:01:18.509> over

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
it what you've got to do is come over

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.320 
it what you've got to do is come over

unchanged<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:25.259> zoom<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.860> now<00:01:26.400> you'll<00:01:26.549> notice

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
unchanged to zoom and now you'll notice

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.399 
unchanged to zoom and now you'll notice
that<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.090> controls<00:01:27.509> are<00:01:27.689> available<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:28.350> you

that the controls are available to you

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.760 
that the controls are available to you
so<00:01:29.220> now<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.460> can<00:01:30.470> zoom<00:01:31.470> right<00:01:31.530> up<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.720> pan

so now you can zoom right up and pan

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.710 
so now you can zoom right up and pan

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
can also use this control here which is

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.179 
can also use this control here which is
really<00:01:41.729> useful<00:01:42.240> for<00:01:42.560> moving<00:01:43.560> around<00:01:43.770> quickly

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
really useful for moving around quickly

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.780 
really useful for moving around quickly
