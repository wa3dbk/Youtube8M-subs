00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.810
 I assume lico lula is for a long time 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.100
 was known as crack add to neura 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.170
 including the scientific name of 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.210
 launch was exactly what it was for 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.640
 what the neura grow January 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.740
 but as there was a mistake in the 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.200
 classification of the cultivar stock it was 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.060
 corrected and today the correct name is 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.980
 humidiculture 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.990
 and the famous one of January 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.560
 this release was made by matsuda 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.840
 in the year 1991 and precisely for 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.850
 replace the humidÃ­cula brachiaria 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.770
 aim to replace over meat said 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.150
 squid and some situations 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.700
 one of the situations that get 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.250
 will replace 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.530
 known is precisely in 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.880
 low fertility poor lands 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.920
 sandy land 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.750
 a difference that I added work 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.119
 better quality 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.330
 as you tell me will take into 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.869
 around 2 3% and black protein addiction 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.509
 can reach 4 to 5 to 7% protein 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.490
 then there is a large differential in 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.429
 relation to nutritional quality 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.649
 the production of forage fodder from 10 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:24.049
 up to 12 points 12 tons of matter 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:26.270
 per hectare per year and the large 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.640
 advantage gained in europe is that 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.799
 also that I dedicate myself to it tolerates 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.990
 soils with poor drainage 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.119
 the difference in this case speaking of 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.429
 soil moisture is what I do there 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.499
 tolerate waterlogged soil has spoken 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:41.899
 very serious problem of humidity and 

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:44.749
 I added the only tolerated soil with a 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.060
 drainage problem is not to say that only 

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:49.100
 those with more than 30 days 40 days 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.659
 unit got to read the work goes 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.420
 presenting problems in another 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.670
 characteristic of the team the neura to ao 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.009
 doctor besides January is just them 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.780
 and tolerant attack spittlebugs that 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.479
 means being tolerant she suffers 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.270
 attack but it does not show any symptoms 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.759
 little defined living loving her not 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.100
 is attacked by a spittlebug, I then 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.500
 she suffers an attack but does not have 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.560
 symptoms are not different from a plant 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.930
 resistant plant and a tolerant plant 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.080
 launch unit first made by 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.180
 was 91 and the record of that 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:28.290
 neura is the number 0 2 314 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.359
 made on May 13, 99 in the ministry 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.420
 of agriculture then one sees that there is 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:36.840
 a time difference entered the 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.030
 registration 91 and registration 99 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.579
 because the record happened after 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.139
 she was passed the law of protection 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.139
 to cultivate the new seed law
