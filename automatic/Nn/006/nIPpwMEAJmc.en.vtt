experiment<00:02:25.990> technology<00:02:26.740> is<00:02:27.180> really<00:02:28.180> what

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
experiment technology is really what

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.780 
experiment technology is really what
makes<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:28.690> technology<00:02:29.320> if<00:02:29.890> people<00:02:30.340> didn't<00:02:30.610> sit

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
makes it technology if people didn't sit

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.340 
makes it technology if people didn't sit

back in the days of Newton nothing would

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.470 
back in the days of Newton nothing would
have<00:02:35.470> happened<00:02:35.500> it's<00:02:36.370> paving<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:36.850> way<00:02:36.940> for<00:02:37.090> us

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
have happened it's paving the way for us

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.020 
have happened it's paving the way for us
to<00:02:37.630> move<00:02:38.560> forward<00:02:38.620> as<00:02:39.070> a<00:02:39.100> species<00:02:39.670> in<00:02:39.940> a

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
to move forward as a species in a

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.710 
to move forward as a species in a
civilization<00:02:41.310> like<00:02:42.310> in<00:02:42.490> life<00:02:42.700> if<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:43.180> keep

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
civilization like in life if you keep

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.870 
civilization like in life if you keep
playing<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:44.050> soccer<00:02:44.260> game<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:44.800> you<00:02:44.950> miss<00:02:45.280> the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
playing a soccer game and you miss the

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.240 
playing a soccer game and you miss the
shot<00:02:46.090> you<00:02:46.480> can't<00:02:46.750> go<00:02:46.930> back<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.290> that<00:02:47.320> and<00:02:47.680> while

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
shot you can't go back to that and while

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.030 
shot you can't go back to that and while
you're<00:02:48.280> working<00:02:48.730> in<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:48.940> computer<00:02:50.040> designing

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
you're working in the computer designing

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.430 
you're working in the computer designing
a<00:02:51.190> site<00:02:51.430> or<00:02:51.790> doing<00:02:52.570> your<00:02:52.690> homework<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:53.320> could

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
a site or doing your homework you could

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.310 
a site or doing your homework you could
just<00:02:53.650> delete<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.310> do<00:02:54.880> it<00:02:55.000> again<00:02:55.090> we<00:02:55.810> started

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
just delete and do it again we started

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.770 
just delete and do it again we started
and<00:02:56.770> so<00:02:57.160> like<00:02:57.430> that's<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.360> cool<00:02:58.570> thing<00:02:58.600> about

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
and so like that's the cool thing about

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.110 
and so like that's the cool thing about
technology<00:02:59.680> it's<00:02:59.860> just<00:03:00.280> like<00:03:00.459> you<00:03:00.610> can<00:03:00.790> change

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
technology it's just like you can change

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.870 
technology it's just like you can change
things<00:03:01.420> when<00:03:01.660> if<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:02.050> want<00:03:02.260> when<00:03:02.860> you<00:03:03.670> have

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
things when if you want when you have

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.830 
things when if you want when you have
access<00:03:04.570> to<00:03:04.600> everything<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:06.550> sort<00:03:07.060> of<00:03:07.180> learn

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
access to everything you sort of learn

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.240 
access to everything you sort of learn
how<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.290> know<00:03:09.280> yourself<00:03:09.430> better<00:03:10.440> because<00:03:11.440> you

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
how to know yourself better because you

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.150 
how to know yourself better because you
are<00:03:12.580> forced<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.239> decide<00:03:14.140> what<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:14.950> use<00:03:15.130> and

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
are forced to decide what to use and

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.640 
are forced to decide what to use and
what<00:03:15.519> to<00:03:15.670> not<00:03:15.820> news<00:03:16.090> I'd<00:03:16.720> say<00:03:16.930> technology<00:03:17.500> does

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
what to not news I'd say technology does

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.410 
what to not news I'd say technology does
make<00:03:17.860> you<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.010> better<00:03:18.250> learner<00:03:18.519> I<00:03:18.850> mean<00:03:19.209> when

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
make you a better learner I mean when

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.820 
make you a better learner I mean when
you're<00:03:19.540> working<00:03:19.660> with<00:03:19.840> technology<00:03:20.530> you<00:03:20.709> have

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
you're working with technology you have

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.920 
you're working with technology you have
to<00:03:20.950> sit<00:03:21.190> and<00:03:21.310> figure<00:03:21.459> out<00:03:21.580> okay<00:03:22.090> this<00:03:22.600> is<00:03:22.780> what

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
to sit and figure out okay this is what

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.210 
to sit and figure out okay this is what
I<00:03:22.959> had<00:03:23.110> to<00:03:23.140> work<00:03:23.380> with<00:03:23.410> these<00:03:23.950> are<00:03:24.130> my
