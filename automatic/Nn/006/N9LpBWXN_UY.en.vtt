00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.120

 then with the mouse pointer on it then drive 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.590
 I learn that the title is called foil 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.539
 and that this title slide so the 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.480
 slide master of the title slide in the 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.550
 film 1 is used when I'm the same 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.500
 edit all slides at once 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.589
 I would like to click here on the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.479
 top of these slides and now add 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.060
 I once the logo of the hotel the party 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:16.549
 Here's a click on that 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:19.049
 register insert graphic and here it is 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:22.950
 and the target here in the lower right 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.680
 corner, let's look at each other 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.400
 I've changed that here 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.130
 back to register foils master it 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.570
 is unfortunately very small but you can see 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.939
 after all, it is here at all 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.409
 currently displayed slides of the preview 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.640
 I can see that once I see it 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.899
 are also some teachers though it were the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.060
 we are not in this presentation 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.530
 used 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.780
 I'll click master view once 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.600
 So close this logo we have 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.950
 now on all slides on those where 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.100
 the photos on it we will of course 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.689
 not see 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.549
 thus is with those who are full screen 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:05.909
 because the covert the photo the film 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:08.420
 overall they click back on the 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.630
 register view 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:15.980
 and choose foil master a few 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.930
 There are already exceptions, I go 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.599
 again on the first slide if I am here 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.040
 I change the font color I click 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:26.900
 first in the text and then on the 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.540
 frame then start and here I choose 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.130
 another font color from the 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.069
 does not concern all of them now 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.239
 the slides below are the titles 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.269
 foils are excluded 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.470
 you would have to work extra so 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.540
 if I have the same font color here 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.060
 I also want to have it here 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.640
 the click frame and one more time 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.110
 select this color 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.600
 down here you can see that is now 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.680
 not with you 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.720
 how can you make a head and a head now 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.380
 footer setup I change here 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.640
 then the first of these slides was measured 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.950
 below you can see the placeholders 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.250
 there is a placeholder for 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.660
 the date then one for a foot line 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.200
 which you can label freely 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.459
 and for this the page number that is so 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.890
 thought that here only the 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.620
 font size the font font color 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.540
 and so on represents the actual 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.269
 set up the head and footer done 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.090
 where else, please click on 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:26.660
 insert the register 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.470
 Here 's the head and footer and then 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.540
 choose here 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.790
 date and time only now 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.950
 really indicated in the presentation 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.390
 there could be an automatically updated 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.489
 start to install or a fixed date 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.930
 would automatically update that 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.359
 every time they say that 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.549
 Presentation data becomes the current one 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:49.730
 Date displayed and not the date of 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:51.950
 then make the presentation here 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.750
 could you activate the slide number 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.750
 and here the footer 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.750
 and then you can choose 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.120
 whether this should apply to all 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.040
 So for all slides or only for 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.409
 the currently current where that yes 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.370
 and for itself a measure of the film is so 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.159
 probably will not 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.299
 especially different 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.729
 so now i can get up here again 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.169
 slides master and on master view 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:24.520
 close and go to the first slide 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.990
 this is my opinion 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.150
 taste a bit too small 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:33.090
 So I'm going to be the foil master again 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:35.500
 return with view foils master 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.690
 and enlarge the font here 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.250
 for both I get the shift key 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.349
 and click both 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:47.710
 then I switch back to start and 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:50.169
 Here I enlarge the font and 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.009
 back on slides master master 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.009
 close view
