00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.779
 There are directly produced here 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.300
 no additional burden on the 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.039
 chain and the chainrings the higher 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.050
 weight on the rear axle offers one 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.140
 high contact pressure and thus a good 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.000
 traction even on a smooth surface with 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.340
 a battery in the drinking bottle position 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.469

 Rear engine can not have a hub gear 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.969
 it only stays to be used

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.300
 the frame for a pedelec with rear engine 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.280
 does not have to be specially designed 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.339
 that is the variety of frames is very 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.899
 Great that Villa Evo 10 is an elegant one

 The hook can be used on both bike and 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.820
 Also loaded in disassembled condition 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:15.979
 become 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.290
 the charging socket time with red light the 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.360
 ongoing charging and with green 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.490
 light the end of the charging process 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.350
 On the way you can just state 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.310
 Battery with a short meaning of the 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.860
