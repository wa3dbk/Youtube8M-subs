00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.830
 More people are talking about the bike today. 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.020
 mogi guaÃ§u interior of sÃ£o paulo in 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.460
 and I'll show you to 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.850
 you the new suzuki gsx r750 we will give 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.850
 a few turns 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.130
 the suzuki gsx r750 came out in the middle of 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.650
 the 1980s and even today 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.840
 preserve a unique recipe by talking about 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.960
 celestial cell reigns alone in the 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.870
 750 which represents a good 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.150
 the track edge on a 600 and 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:04.290
 certainly helps in cost-effective 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:06.270
 before Mario feeling the gsx on the track 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.910
 you can tell that the engine works well 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.700
 at high engine speeds reaches the 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.520
 150 horsepower above 13 thousand 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.680
 rotations per minute and from 11,000 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.270
 delivering just under nine kilograms 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.270
 tokyo metro force 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.560
 the six-speed transmission counts 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:30.590
 with a clutch system with relief 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.689
 touch panel is possible 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.780
 select two control maps 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.719
 the injection is very balanced 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.920
 however I really like the bike 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.439
 come with tires 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.810
 the higher the performance the softer the 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.640
 originals do not compare to the 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.399
 tires like pirelli diablo 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.469
 super strength that offer much more grip 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.490
 and this improves handling and 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:54.490
 driver safety 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.330
 the rear suspension equipped with a 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.450
 single damper with external adjustment 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.640
 and in front of the control 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.680
 according to the speed 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.200
 the brake system comes with discs 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.530
 floats with four- 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.530
 pistons 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.710
 on the track although he did not deliver as much 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.760
 reply like a thousand motorcycle 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.280
 a gs xr 750 presents a good cost 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.680
 benefit if we compare the price 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.480
 this may be decisive for that 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.910
 interested in entering the world of 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.460
 sports, the difference between the 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.590
 gsx and another thousand-cylinder model 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.590
 may exceed 10 thousand reais 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.110
 impressions are the best possible 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.180
 This bike really is fine. 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.349
 resolved starting with the fact that it 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.400
 it's not a thousand 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:19.290
 no 600 is the only 750 on the market 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.959
 I'm sure you liked it. 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.400
 meanwhile until next Saturday visit 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.590
 on my website to have 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.430
 piloting be tuned in the world of 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.190
 two wheels 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.640
