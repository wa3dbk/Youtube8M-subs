00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
strings up here and what we do is we'll

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.650 
strings up here and what we do is we'll
put<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.219> number<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.120> string<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:42.570> want

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.600 
put a number on the string that we want
and<00:00:43.079> all<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.649> number<00:00:44.010> does<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.460> it

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
and all the number does is it

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.170 
and all the number does is it
corresponds<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.390> what<00:00:45.629> fret<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.110> play<00:00:46.430> so<00:00:47.430> if

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
corresponds on what fret to play so if

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.920

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
we have a two here on the g string then

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.810 
we have a two here on the g string then
we<00:00:52.079> count<00:00:52.289> let<00:00:52.800> me<00:00:52.890> find<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> g<00:00:53.340> string<00:00:53.610> which

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
we count let me find the g string which

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.880 
we count let me find the g string which
is<00:00:53.850> here<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.840> go<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> second<00:00:55.710> fret

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
this is first and this is second so I'll

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.930 
this is first and this is second so I'll

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
hold this down and I'll pluck it that is

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.880 
hold this down and I'll pluck it that is
our<00:01:03.090> note<00:01:03.680> if<00:01:04.680> we<00:01:05.430> see<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> zero<00:01:06.650> that<00:01:07.650> means

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
our note if we see a zero that means

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.789 
our note if we see a zero that means
that<00:01:08.250> we<00:01:08.909> don't<00:01:09.119> play<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.720> fret<00:01:10.200> we<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:10.530> play

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799

easy huh
just<00:01:43.220> look<00:01:43.400> at<00:01:43.550> it<00:01:43.580> and<00:01:43.880> it's<00:01:44.060> from<00:01:44.300> your<00:01:44.480> point

of<00:01:44.810> view<00:01:44.870> and<00:01:45.170> with<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.470> numbers<00:01:45.830> it<00:01:46.070> points

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
of view and with the numbers it points

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.130 
of view and with the numbers it points
to<00:01:46.610> exactly<00:01:47.060> what<00:01:47.270> fret<00:01:47.480> you<00:01:47.600> need<00:01:47.720> to<00:01:47.810> go<00:01:47.930> on

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
to exactly what fret you need to go on

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.970 
to exactly what fret you need to go on
what<00:01:48.410> string

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
what string

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.570 
what string
so<00:01:49.610> using<00:01:50.420> Guitar<00:01:50.840> Tabs<00:01:51.050> there's<00:01:51.830> a<00:01:51.920> few<00:01:52.310> cons

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
so using Guitar Tabs there's a few cons

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.150 
so using Guitar Tabs there's a few cons
about<00:01:52.790> it<00:01:53.060> because<00:01:53.300> you<00:01:54.200> don't<00:01:54.410> know<00:01:54.710> what

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
about it because you don't know what

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.920 
about it because you don't know what
rhythm<00:01:55.490> to<00:01:55.640> play<00:01:55.820> so<00:01:56.060> it's<00:01:56.210> really<00:01:56.390> good<00:01:56.690> to

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
rhythm to play so it's really good to

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.110 
rhythm to play so it's really good to
figure<00:01:57.470> out<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.710> song<00:01:57.920> beforehand<00:01:58.640> give<00:01:58.970> it<00:01:59.060> a

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
figure out the song beforehand give it a

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.240 
figure out the song beforehand give it a
few<00:01:59.240> listens<00:01:59.630> and<00:01:59.840> then<00:02:00.320> you<00:02:00.500> know<00:02:00.680> what<00:02:01.040> notes

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
few listens and then you know what notes

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.040 
few listens and then you know what notes
