 Japan and Germany now Ditib redaktions- or as the Swiss 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.700
 Tor says Schulz I just want to stop listening 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.129
 As is profound 1 point ranges from the pharmacy to Mary Marquardt 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:11.599
 game 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:12.739
 go on 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:15.349
 I would be the whole with in the last room Aachen 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.519
 So first of all, of course, iTunes presentation and our envy 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:20.880
 that would come 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.499
 Connect USB cable 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.419
 around that recognizes that also immediately 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.839
 and percent of PC as well 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:33.570
 that means close the window on a dry window 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.940
 and then claim that iTunes recognizes the whole thing 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.490
 So only and has now recognized my iPod 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.930
 Here it looks compensated 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.730
 it just seems like 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.950
 opposite on him 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.440
 and Turmeric David has power checked so 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.500
 now we have to restore to the three points 1 2 3 of that 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.670
 To do that click on the big city then what to restore 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.550
 then this window gives up 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.550
 where I just go to desktop Klika 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.650
 then the three points 1 points three companies of the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.700
 and just click here on public 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.320
 I click on Restore 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.230
 he extra here animal the software 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.590
 So my everyday life has been restored 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.900
 Easy to the oriental swim messages like I just go way 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.870
 Mackensen iPod lure 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.010
 and Bernd Kriegesmann consumption and 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.800
 here I ask him if I ask him 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.630
 want to configure as a new iPod or backup 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.290
 want to restore 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.469
 It is very important that you do not first 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:47.490
 make a new iPod the couple 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.260
 and now 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.060
 all check marks Bergwacht 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.930
 further falsified 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.000
 Merkel's inconsistency course 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.710
 and now I can lure him again very important to billable me Minix 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.620
 Sync clearance 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.500
 it comes to the tiebreak 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.899
 to close something like iTunes 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.279
 around states opening 0 2 and 4 

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:14.209
 because you are here 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.950
 in Alcatraz city second generation have click on shower 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:21.999
 from the verb 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:23.829
 which we need 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.449
 and I do not have a gas mat 

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:29.739
 saturated says Next Sulzer votes selection 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.419
 Moto says 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.419
 I would like to install a bus murder by foot 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.489
 and you here 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.949
 Gates grows up 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:43.159
 I have to stay now 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.489
 Preetz 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.979
 turn off 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:48.729
 if I did that, I can smack on Mac's 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:50.339
 and now i can do it here 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:51.769
 Switch m on 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.939
 both bath must be in time 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:58.150
 for about ten seconds so just go into the deep mode 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:02.359
 and now I leave the whole village 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.069
 among the top ten 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.339
 Holm Bathen 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:07.479
 it is quite recognized 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.779
 I want for about 30 seconds 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:11.289
 as has recognized that 

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:13.459
 but it can be left 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.459
 and now the whole thing is moving a lot 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:22.609
 Winterkorn he sees so was the whole lot what that does 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:27.279
 and this is Albert's possibilities there's hardly anything I changed a little more 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:28.069
 space 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.069
 You can also have a very little bit and a son 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.659
 a computer stands Daum 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:38.889
 Duncan with it 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.969
 the marriage divorced here on the iPod 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:44.569
 and that means I can click here 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.719
 and the rest is happening here on the iPod 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:50.719
 we are here then yes this would bring the garden 

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:53.309
 and 

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:55.389
 and that can be the iPod alone 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.399
 So then they test us Red 

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:00.669
 that means she is just waiting 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:03.539
 wait until it's done 

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:04.979
 which are now 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:07.099
 the top team a little moment 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.089
 but opened again 

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:13.259
 you see, what makes it a success as a Souffleur schegen-room 

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:17.819
 and as of now has the error message 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:20.889
 nightingale 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.460
 that her death is not quite that long 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.389
 until the device starts again 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.819
 It looks like I'm almost half in the numbers 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:32.819
 Andrews 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:41.180
 and now 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.180
 Zenke celebrated topics and trulli bleeding 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.360
 so you punish just times and the US was good at exactly 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:57.960
 The device is now how it brings you see 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.620
 I have her here 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.620
 and that's what I'm going to do now 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:06.959
 stupid is said I should connect to a w-lan network and I do 

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:09.959
 Cigarini now, of course, and one is himself 

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:14.870
 We already know that from Peter Biel Briggs that's what she's up to 

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:15.589
 facts Â» 

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:20.039
 and then he sees that the iPod Aires is jumping so the gate goes off 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:20.860
 not so long 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.419
 because I can unlock 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:27.180
 and she rather hesitantly dares, however, is quite a while I do 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.300
 now the developer report without filters would like to have the whole thing 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.529
 and how it works 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:33.819
 it's really fast dusting it 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:37.030
 and download all the important patches 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.550
 and after that a few package needs updating 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.360
 SOB I'm only on 3 2 1 1 from 3 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.210
 with Sissi but that is too 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.249
 wonderfully I have worked 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:49.580
 all had actions done 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.529
 Updated to be in francs now 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:57.469
 and then that means I'm now in the video as punk 3 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:01.629
 and always can change something and that's nothing in the confession 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:05.520
 Krad clear text but I want that because they have their programs 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.099
 install so 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:10.099
 these include, for example, SP Settings 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:12.889
 Honduras is one of them 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:15.460
 for example, a plunder was 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.770
 and then all the cities 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.319
 So I failed this via 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:23.779
 but I had helped if so then just leave five stars 

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:26.210
 or a like 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.110
 at and maybe a comment I thank you for watching
