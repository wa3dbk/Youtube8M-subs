00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hello to all anglers, there are many 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.400
 bottom gear on peaceful fish eat 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.690
 a lot of homemade products is one of them 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:17.100
 popular homemade is fishing in the peaceful 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.140
 fish on cork means how we mount 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.720
 already prepared a little bit to not 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.000
 tighten the video we will need here 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.430
 such a lead we put it to the bottom 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.519
 traffic jams 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:33.649
 I will say right here need a little more 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:37.800
 use lead by weight i did 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.450
 hastily squeezed and I sewed it 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.399
 Here is such a screw on metal 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.980
 literally make a screwdriver family with 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.110
 a little bit of effort 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.329
 had to attach you can 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.809
 screwdriver wrap if not you 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.960
 opportunities can take leaf lead 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.910
 punch there tie a wire 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.539
 the main thing is that the essence remains 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.300
 cast 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.949
 our cork will be all the time we need 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.150
 the position that is here such 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:09.720
 the position here made a hole glowing 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.350
 nail and swam holes why disappeared 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.049
 because if you knit a cap 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.590
 can deform 5 its position and 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:24.020
 snack will be our wire 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:27.270
 there are covers to eat jams do 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.220
 sensitive that is how i do that 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.979
 i will have these leashes at 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.280
 poklevke play on the bottom gear 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.790
 on the feeder there are these leashes fishermen 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.490
 binds just here on the sides do 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.759
 hole or lead out with a wire or 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.490
 straight cover on the sides tied such 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.520
 here are my snoods but my version of this 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.000
 let's and we also mount until the end 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:58.020
 have we take our main fishing line 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.490
 let's sell a fishing line through the hole so as not to 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.460
 broken knot use bead with then 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.440
 Silicon Do Not Use Threshold 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.830
 get stuck with you 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.830
 the hole that is and bite can not 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.740
 see or do not enter in time therefore 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.700
 use bead 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:26.260
 tie our main fishing line than good 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:29.650
 cork I think that this is exactly catching on 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.730
 the nipple that is when the fish suck our 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:40.030
 prikormku she swallows 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:40.750
 our foam our bait and we see 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.610
 bite 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:49.270
 when tightening we cut the cork good 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.380
 what is used under any conditions 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.520
 catching 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:57.180
 well, almost any if there is 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:01.350
 average flow which washes out 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.290
 bait there is already loose bait 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.459
 not convenient to use 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.049
 you will need to use clay 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:17.670
 here is our bait in the lid securely and 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:20.530
 and does not wash away that is she we her 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.549
 stuffed there and she is on us 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:30.070
 location and so here is in principle our gear 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:32.350
 I am ready for transportation 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.360
 cut for example show here such 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:39.420
 here 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:43.260
 sponge you can here 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:46.660
 hook the hooks 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.209
 Now I will show how this is done because 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:53.650
 what if you have a separate 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:56.140
 these plugs are mounted in one package 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.360
 or boxes so there is nothing 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:03.549
 messed up like this you can 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.110
 transport your tackle shove in 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.760
 cork all 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.470
 between traffic jams if you have such 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.060
 Something is not confused 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:17.350
 came fishing quickly got 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:22.770
 and all the gear is ready for use I'm 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:26.710
 as bait took the bread replaced 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:31.419
 I will show you how to catch it 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:34.480
 we hide our snoods inside i 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.940
 used the cord here to me more 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.090
 like it is not so deformed not 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.990
 springs like a fishing line 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.479
 so I used the string so 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:49.290
 here is power pro 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.290
 special driving material 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:58.740
 that is, we fill in this way 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.740
 our prikormku 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.280
 Nabil u prikormku cover now do 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.280
 such nipples are small 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:28.740
 if we use as a donkey 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.550
 springs then the fish may come to the spring 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.560
 and side 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:38.190
 and here is our bait fish 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:42.420
 no way will get around 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:46.260
 so the gear is not only very simple and 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:48.540
 very catchy for example use 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:52.400
 this foam seems to me a little bit he 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:56.430
 will be small but as an example and 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:01.880
 insert our board like this 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.880
 so we put on all the hooks 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.110
 everyone I know I can remember watching 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.040
 video 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:13.500
 novice fishermen sting hook 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:19.050
 of the foam must necessarily come out 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:23.550
 because when cutting fish sting can 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:28.230
 do not break through the foam and you will be left without 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:33.870
 catch so here so should 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:36.440
 look hook do not insert our 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.440
 pacifier 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:48.330
 a little stick there sting all our tackle 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:54.350
 Ready I wish you all a successful fishing on 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:57.920
 to catch a crucian still all peace fish 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:59.550
 which you come across neither tail nor scales 

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.990
 subscribe to the channel write 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.990
 good luck everyone
