00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 I'm here in front of a tablet 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.210
 model genesis 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.559
 You can see and gt 7230 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.530
 after ten months of use 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.870
 looks at the size of the dead pixel spot 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.779
 famous from pixel that appear on screen 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.910
 It looks like a flower there anyway I've never seen 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.800
 something like this on the vertical line and 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.800
 that stain on the top pulls black 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.260
 I bought this tablet already delivered a 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.590
 which in a few days presented the same 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.239
 defect in a line forming in the case 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.510
 it's horizontal 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.390
 I sent it back and they sent it after 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.530
 ten months, then 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.579
 see yourself 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.579
 the lack of quality 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:45.530
 at that time the then that is a point very 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.530
 more than that 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:02:01.250
 selecting the brands you do not deserve 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:02:01.250
 stolen pen
