it so what you want to do is rub a real

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:47.750 
it so what you want to do is rub a real
thin<00:00:36.930> layer<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.320> wax<00:00:38.390> all<00:00:39.390> around<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.079> dog

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.920 

it's<00:00:48.180> kind<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.390> like<00:00:48.540> waxing<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.530> skateboard<00:00:50.340> or

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
it's kind of like waxing a skateboard or

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.790 
it's kind of like waxing a skateboard or
your<00:00:51.930> surfboard

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
your surfboard

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.979 
your surfboard
I<00:00:53.300> think<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:54.420> surfboards<00:00:54.899> more<00:00:56.870> similar<00:00:59.989> so

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
I think it's surfboards more similar so

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.080 
I think it's surfboards more similar so
I'm<00:01:01.079> only<00:01:01.199> going<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.470> do<00:01:01.559> half<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.760> can<00:01:02.940> see

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
I'm only going to do half so you can see

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.020 
I'm only going to do half so you can see
what<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.329> looks<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:03.629> before<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.470> after<00:01:05.040> so

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
what it looks like before and after so

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.800 
what it looks like before and after so
once<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.270> get<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.960> nice<00:01:07.950> layer<00:01:08.340> over<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.940> you'll

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
once you get a nice layer over it you'll

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:18.740 
once you get a nice layer over it you'll
feel<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.259> it'll<00:01:11.009> be<00:01:11.070> nice<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.310> tacky<00:01:17.540> you<00:01:18.540> want

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
feel it it'll be nice and tacky you want

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:33.820 
feel it it'll be nice and tacky you want
Heat

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:42.890 

you<00:01:34.400> can<00:01:34.550> see<00:01:34.850> it<00:01:34.970> already<00:01:35.540> changing<00:01:36.080> color

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.600 

so<00:01:43.900> this<00:01:44.200> is<00:01:45.360> application<00:01:46.360> number<00:01:46.630> one<00:01:47.369> on<00:01:48.369> the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
so this is application number one on the

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.240 
so this is application number one on the
second<00:01:49.030> application<00:01:49.649> you're<00:01:50.649> going<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.860> feel

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
second application you're going to feel

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.539 
second application you're going to feel
that<00:01:51.280> it's<00:01:51.670> a<00:01:51.790> lot<00:01:52.149> easier<00:01:52.479> to<00:01:52.930> apply<00:01:53.549> because

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
that it's a lot easier to apply because

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.999 
that it's a lot easier to apply because
there's<00:01:54.880> already<00:01:55.090> wax<00:01:55.479> on<00:01:55.720> there<00:01:55.930> and<00:01:56.110> it's<00:01:56.920> a

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
there's already wax on there and it's a

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.240 
there's already wax on there and it's a
warmer<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:58.539> that<00:01:59.080> wax<00:01:59.350> will<00:01:59.560> actually<00:02:00.100> be

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
warmer and that wax will actually be

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:08.430 
warmer and that wax will actually be
easier<00:02:00.539> to<00:02:01.539> apply<00:02:01.840> on<00:02:06.330> so<00:02:07.330> get<00:02:07.600> that<00:02:07.780> second

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
easier to apply on so get that second

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:19.760 
easier to apply on so get that second
coat<00:02:08.739> in

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:31.089 

and<00:02:20.770> more<00:02:21.130> heat

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.069 

you<00:02:32.099> should<00:02:32.400> see<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.939> significant<00:02:33.659> difference

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
you should see a significant difference

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:40.309 
you should see a significant difference
on<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.829> grain<00:02:36.319> for<00:02:37.319> a<00:02:37.379> nap<00:02:38.540> now<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:40.079> more

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
on the grain for a nap now the more

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.209 
on the grain for a nap now the more
layers<00:02:40.799> you<00:02:40.950> apply<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:42.150> darker<00:02:43.219> obviously

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:44.219 
layers you apply the darker obviously

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:46.910 
layers you apply the darker obviously
it's<00:02:44.519> going<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.730> get<00:02:44.939> so<00:02:45.780> once<00:02:46.560> you<00:02:46.680> start

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
it's going to get so once you start

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.259 
it's going to get so once you start
feeling<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.400> it's<00:02:47.549> like<00:02:47.730> starts<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.120> get

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
feeling that it's like starts to get

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.660 
feeling that it's like starts to get
runny<00:02:48.739> that's<00:02:49.739> where<00:02:49.920> your<00:02:50.040> paper<00:02:50.250> towel

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
runny that's where your paper towel

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.520 
runny that's where your paper towel
comes<00:02:50.849> into<00:02:51.090> place<00:02:51.299> and<00:02:51.599> just<00:02:52.079> wipe<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.409> off

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
comes into place and just wipe it off

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.580 
comes into place and just wipe it off
you<00:02:52.739> don't<00:02:52.829> want<00:02:52.920> dripping<00:02:53.489> anywhere<00:02:53.819> so<00:02:54.810> I'll

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
you don't want dripping anywhere so I'll

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.890

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
do a couple more layers on this and I'll

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.240 
do a couple more layers on this and I'll
be<00:02:58.469> right<00:02:58.650> back

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.240 

four<00:03:02.250> layers<00:03:02.489> of<00:03:02.909> beeswax<00:03:04.700> heated<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:07.129> can<00:03:08.129> go
