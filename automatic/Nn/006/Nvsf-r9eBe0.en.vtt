00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.869
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.520
 harm today is January 25th Saturday 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:18.500
 the fact is that yesterday I had a day 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.509
 birth so record a video to 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.150
 Unfortunately it did not work there was no 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:25.369
 time therefore today in principle i 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.380
 I plan to release two but again conduct 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.660
 the second is likely to be released late at night 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.360
 and so friends map we have fjords you 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.720
 see that I am again not in a platoon 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.809
 I decided to continue the line of solo in general 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.690
 the reviews were good enough therefore 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.449
 I hope you enjoy this fight too. 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.110
 to position her very she is successful and 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.180
 it is on this card that works well 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.979
 see our main actions all 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.710
 equals happening on the mainland yes here 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:56.989
 here well and therefore we get up in the center and 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.699
 we heat in general all necessary 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.070
 points that is exactly harry here 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.799
 we get a balcony is quite obvious 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.689
 here lies the whole glade plus 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.850
 central passage and bring here we too 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.760
 we can work that is in all directions 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.950
 it works perfectly well and 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.020
 In general, this fight is proof of that. 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.630
 that is, we will watch quietly hour 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.490
 let's deal with all this question and so 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.670
 on the balcony as usual 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.219
 first light somewhere in that area t-34 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.659
 one on top you see on the mini-card rushing 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:33.679
 upward and accordingly illuminate e25 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.600
 trying to transfer to it 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.939
 neatly but I understand that I have a guide 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.009
 Not enough, but below it is lit T25 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.590
 in half and of course he should soon 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.259
 go to the safe right here that's why me and 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.259
 it is logical of course now it is 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.840
 the opportunity of punaki to give him 103 damage 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.670
 It went great well and T25 in half 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.460
 I think I think he is fine and 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.909
 Remco juzat not sure why it is necessary to 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:03.049
 to punish him a little more 172 flies 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.880
 very nice however unfortunately finish 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.660
 it does not work because at this 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.000
 moment north yes and shines through 1 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.880
 I transfer to the center we work 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.320
 next wake from here 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.710
 we have a very good classic here 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.510
 backwards 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:22.040
 got up getting 132 damage that's great 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.460
 here is our way. 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.230
 Well, of course, in general, in principle bt 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.750
 first of all 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.630
 the main goals of art are really very homely 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.220
 guns must punish them 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.220
 because we can do it 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.010
 impunity so that our comrades do not 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.770
 died for nothing was not lit up so I 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.780
 twitched a little bit on the class here not 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.520
 I rush to shoot when she gets up to 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.190
 make a shot well in general 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.810
 standard actions of artovod with 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.610
 breaking 423 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.280
 and, accordingly, immediately finish sous 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:59.420
 122 44 good very lucky and it turned out 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.700
 let's see what's up here at 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.870
 balcony guys here in tsiv by the way 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.570
 get a little away then 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.390
 accordingly you can throw 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.480
 closer sorrow but I usually get up exactly in 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.370
 this position is comfortable to get here 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.780
 to all the sites that is for example here 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.570
 here here is de collision now 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.380
 happening too basically could 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.810
 work but I took it during the fight 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:30.500
 another solution is generally what you 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.550
 watch on t-150 recline gets 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.550
 he has 192 damage 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.500
 or charge here need to calculate 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.750
 movement I think well, here he is handing back and 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.940
 Well, I ka him on the course but at this moment 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.220
 of course it stops and it turns out 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.180
 completely reckless and some 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.910
 shot but what to do now let's 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.560
 let's see how it works here 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.410
 down and you see that perfectly 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.750
 wonderful here everything is shot 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.150
 t25 in half in a very good position 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.730
 are in the sides and at that angle 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.069
 shell you go then you can wait for good 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.799
 shots and look like this 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:15.220
 flies remarkably t25 in half in 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:17.100
 hangar immediately finish off the m6 and everything in general 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:22.389
 then we also disassembled 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:26.110
 translated back to t-150 disappears 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:29.580
 the light but in general the t-34 is still alive 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.580
 and surely must devote 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.210
 show holy nir unfortunately 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.490
 the guys here with the whole crowd are moving 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.870
 on the bottom to the bottom of the road 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.290
 accordingly, we can now assume 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.480
 that will soon begin to capture some there 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.790
 movement and then everything will be highlighted but 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.340
 it is important for me to work out the colors of the t-34 one 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.560
 because when he dies then in general 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.550
 everything will be quite sad though rides 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.620
 su 122 44 and the burner comes back guys 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.710
 Well done actually that is looked 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.550
 that there are enemies and attacking forces still 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:13.700
 and it would be logical to return otherwise 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:16.130
 make your base firing by t25 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:19.160
 in half and the most necessary moment he 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.380
 naturally drives back to such 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.090
 moments of course better aim in the back 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.890
 part of the tank well, then there will be more chances 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:30.940
 get there so the t-150 glows while i'm 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:34.730
 I sit it already we have t-34 alone in the hangar 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:37.820
 I throw here and so remains 63 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:40.460
 insa strength kind of like vanshot but here 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.990
 safe and in general I'm still in recharge 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:46.550
 the light disappears but the benefit goes overall to 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.460
 so I am waiting for the light from him to serve 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:52.000
 again under the t-150, it must be his 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.000
 to get 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.740
 let's add speed a little bit 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:02.340
 soo shines 122 44 she quickly 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.840
 nimble ran away and here is t-150 I know what 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.020
 he is slow he doesn't care around here 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.540
 so I don't translate very well 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.840
 it is important to finish off the t-150 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.400
 here he goes we throw on the course turns 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.010
 get in but unfortunately too little 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.920
 damage and finishes him 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:22.890
 a l k yu that in general is also not bad 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.950
 so you see that there is already absolute 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:28.880
 a victory of 11 8 will have very little chance of 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:31.290
 the enemy to drag though they are 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.050
 rushing at full speed to shoot 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:38.130
 according to art 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:40.410
 add up on the far su-14 one begin 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:42.810
 move to drown apparently here I 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.720
 I throw finds it so a little bit just 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:48.530
 hooked up splash of up for itar tass 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:51.650
 sites of course funny but still have 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.770
 managed using this splash hook 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.270
 vrazhin 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:58.350
 Well, in general, he eventually 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.980
 still drowned or dark remaining 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.590
 the enemy 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:04.490
 it remains vanity thick of course like 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:07.380
 for randomness but generally vanshot 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:09.660
 flying and then friends this trick was 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:12.750
 done by professionals please do not 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:15.990
 perform it at home 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:21.110
 he is really very cocky 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:24.720
 It turned out a shot but that's something like this 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:27.240
 in fact , the battle was not so 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.870
 it is very beautiful wonderful yes but 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:32.640
 It distributes quite a number of medium damage 

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.880
 position is disclosed in general friends 

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.900
 mix notice play health 

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:41.060
 bend over on arte 

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.060
 Good luck to you all!
