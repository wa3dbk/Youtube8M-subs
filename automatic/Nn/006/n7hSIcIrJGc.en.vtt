yeah interior is build and you could see

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.499 
yeah interior is build and you could see
the<00:01:16.680> front<00:01:16.979> part<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.430> kind<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.700> lazy<00:01:17.939> they

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
the front part is kind of lazy they

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.030

said<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.689> but<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.990> do<00:01:43.049> however<00:01:43.380> like<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.890> trees

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
said and but I do however like the trees

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.859 
said and but I do however like the trees
even<00:01:44.759> though<00:01:44.850> they're<00:01:45.000> both<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.360> same<00:01:45.390> tree

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
even though they're both the same tree

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.569 
even though they're both the same tree
structure<00:01:46.290> except<00:01:46.590> with<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.220> different

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
structure except with a different

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.429 
structure except with a different
position<00:01:47.700> for<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.240> tree<00:01:48.600> for<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:49.290> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
position for the tree for it like the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.440 
position for the tree for it like the
leaves<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.549> wheelbarrow<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.149> actually

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
leaves and the wheelbarrow is actually

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.080 
leaves and the wheelbarrow is actually
pretty<00:01:51.600> cool<00:01:51.780> piece<00:01:52.020> it's<00:01:52.799> not<00:01:53.100> like<00:01:53.340> uncommon

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
pretty cool piece it's not like uncommon

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.910 
pretty cool piece it's not like uncommon
because<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.479> did<00:01:54.600> come<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.110> think<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.649> believe

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
because it did come in I think I believe

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.310 
because it did come in I think I believe
a<00:01:55.950> six<00:01:56.250> dollar<00:01:56.430> set<00:01:56.700> for<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.090> police<00:01:57.360> line

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
a six dollar set for the police line

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.429 
a six dollar set for the police line
this<00:01:58.560> year<00:01:58.619> which<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.040> do<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.960> yeah<00:02:00.960> so

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
this year which I do have and yeah so

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.280 
this year which I do have and yeah so
much<00:02:01.649> peace<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.369> or<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:03.540> three<00:02:03.810> pieces<00:02:04.049> all

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
much peace and or it's three pieces all

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.380 
much peace and or it's three pieces all
together<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:05.219> then<00:02:05.340> for<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.729> two<00:02:05.909> trees<00:02:06.210> you

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
together and then for the two trees you

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.999 
together and then for the two trees you
do<00:02:06.540> get<00:02:06.719> three<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.320> these<00:02:07.469> really<00:02:07.740> cool

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
do get three of these really cool

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.089 
do get three of these really cool
which<00:02:08.459> are<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.819> most<00:02:08.970> common<00:02:09.390> pieces<00:02:09.569> and

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
which are the most common pieces and

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.380 
which are the most common pieces and
like<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.189> said<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.489> nice<00:02:11.610> trees<00:02:11.970> which<00:02:12.180> are<00:02:12.329> the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
like I said the nice trees which are the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.470 
like I said the nice trees which are the
same<00:02:12.599> builds<00:02:12.930> on<00:02:13.079> both<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.439> these<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.790> it's

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
same builds on both of these and so it's

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.089 
same builds on both of these and so it's
still<00:02:15.569> pretty<00:02:15.780> cool<00:02:16.079> different<00:02:16.680> position<00:02:17.040> on

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
still pretty cool different position on

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.089 
still pretty cool different position on
the<00:02:17.159> leaves<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:19.470> can<00:02:19.530> see<00:02:19.739> that's<00:02:19.860> right

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
the leaves and you can see that's right

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.949 
the leaves and you can see that's right
there<00:02:20.280> any<00:02:20.519> fence<00:02:20.909> pieces<00:02:21.090> which<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.569> was<00:02:21.780> doing

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
there any fence pieces which I was doing

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.970 
there any fence pieces which I was doing
and<00:02:23.329> on<00:02:24.329> next<00:02:24.750> treaty<00:02:25.049> it's<00:02:25.349> just<00:02:25.650> kind<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:25.920> the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
and on next treaty it's just kind of the

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.399 
and on next treaty it's just kind of the
same<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:26.940> that's<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.569> for<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.780> review<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.319> now

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
same so that's it for the review and now

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.289 
same so that's it for the review and now
it's<00:02:28.560> founder<00:02:28.980> dirt<00:02:29.159> overall<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.209> actually

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
it's founder dirt overall I actually

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.479 
it's founder dirt overall I actually
think<00:02:30.569> this<00:02:30.690> is<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.900> really<00:02:31.200> cool<00:02:31.379> set<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.920> mean

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
think this is a really cool set I mean

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.490 
think this is a really cool set I mean
the<00:02:33.060> three<00:02:33.299> minifigures<00:02:33.690> for<00:02:34.049> that<00:02:34.319> eight

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
the three minifigures for that eight

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.080 
the three minifigures for that eight
dollars<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.099> actually<00:02:35.400> really<00:02:35.730> good<00:02:35.879> deal

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
dollars is actually really good deal

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.319 
dollars is actually really good deal
because<00:02:36.269> even<00:02:37.170> some<00:02:37.379> 11<00:02:37.829> or<00:02:38.099> 12<00:02:38.340> or<00:02:38.489> $13<00:02:39.030> many

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
because even some 11 or 12 or $13 many

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.500 
because even some 11 or 12 or $13 many
sets<00:02:40.109> don't<00:02:40.560> have<00:02:40.769> three<00:02:41.220> minifigures<00:02:41.670> that's

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
sets don't have three minifigures that's

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.619 
sets don't have three minifigures that's
crazy<00:02:42.900> good<00:02:43.049> and<00:02:43.730> it's<00:02:44.730> rare<00:02:45.090> for<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.359> probably

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
crazy good and it's rare for a probably

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.530 
crazy good and it's rare for a probably
bags<00:02:45.750> have<00:02:45.989> two<00:02:46.739> minifigures<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.790> latinum<00:02:48.180> to

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
bags have two minifigures of latinum to

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.020 
bags have two minifigures of latinum to
me<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:49.500> think<00:02:49.739> it's<00:02:50.010> really<00:02:50.220> cool<00:02:50.519> that<00:02:50.579> we

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
me so I think it's really cool that we

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.449 
me so I think it's really cool that we
got<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.269> polybag<00:02:51.959> with<00:02:52.200> three<00:02:52.379> minifigures<00:02:52.799> the

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
got a polybag with three minifigures the

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.039 
got a polybag with three minifigures the
minifigures<00:02:53.940> aren't<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.239> most<00:02:54.420> exciting<00:02:54.870> but

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
minifigures aren't the most exciting but

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.050 
minifigures aren't the most exciting but
it<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.290> nice<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.889> think<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.549> price<00:02:56.730> repeat

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
it is nice I think the price repeat

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.599 
it is nice I think the price repeat
ratio<00:02:57.389> is<00:02:57.510> pretty<00:02:57.720> good<00:02:58.019> but<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:58.950> don't<00:02:59.280> know<00:02:59.430> I

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
ratio is pretty good but I don't know I

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.369 
ratio is pretty good but I don't know I
have<00:02:59.909> a<00:02:59.940> feeling<00:03:00.239> that<00:03:00.329> this<00:03:00.480> set<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:00.870> just

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
have a feeling that this set is just

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.800 
have a feeling that this set is just
boring<00:03:01.799> I<00:03:02.069> mean<00:03:02.250> as<00:03:02.430> much<00:03:03.000> as<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.269> love<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.569> fall

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
boring I mean as much as I love the fall

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.610 
boring I mean as much as I love the fall
hauls<00:03:04.139> my<00:03:04.319> favorite<00:03:04.879> season<00:03:05.909> I<00:03:06.409> just<00:03:07.409> think

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
hauls my favorite season I just think

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.229 
hauls my favorite season I just think
it's<00:03:07.799> a<00:03:07.889> little<00:03:07.980> bit<00:03:08.159> too<00:03:08.370> bland<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:09.060> lazy

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
it's a little bit too bland and lazy

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.210 
it's a little bit too bland and lazy
like<00:03:09.629> they<00:03:10.139> make<00:03:10.319> you<00:03:10.440> build<00:03:10.650> this<00:03:10.859> spacing

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
like they make you build this spacing

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.979 
like they make you build this spacing
twice<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:11.909> then<00:03:12.000> put<00:03:12.299> mushroom<00:03:12.690> here<00:03:12.840> and

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
twice and then put mushroom here and

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.720 
twice and then put mushroom here and
mushroom<00:03:13.230> there<00:03:13.379> and<00:03:13.590> then<00:03:14.099> they<00:03:14.220> just<00:03:14.400> play

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
mushroom there and then they just play

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.059 
mushroom there and then they just play
the<00:03:15.180> leaves<00:03:15.389> right<00:03:15.569> here<00:03:15.660> so<00:03:16.019> I<00:03:16.290> wish<00:03:16.980> only

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
the leaves right here so I wish only

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.740 
the leaves right here so I wish only
been<00:03:17.370> maybe<00:03:17.699> a<00:03:17.819> little<00:03:18.030> bit<00:03:18.209> of<00:03:18.359> a<00:03:18.480> more

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
been maybe a little bit of a more

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.559 
been maybe a little bit of a more
variety<00:03:19.319> of<00:03:19.500> pieces<00:03:20.160> so<00:03:21.030> I<00:03:21.060> will<00:03:21.269> give<00:03:21.419> this

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
variety of pieces so I will give this

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.599
