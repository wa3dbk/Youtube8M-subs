00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.600 

how<00:00:01.110> everyone<00:00:01.560> I'd<00:00:01.770> like<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.949> present<00:00:02.220> use<00:00:02.580> a

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
how everyone I'd like to present use a

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.240 
how everyone I'd like to present use a
new<00:00:03.000> symmetry<00:00:03.810> feature<00:00:04.500> that<00:00:04.710> I<00:00:04.920> added<00:00:05.100> to

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
new symmetry feature that I added to

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.120 
new symmetry feature that I added to
GIMP<00:00:05.609> so<00:00:06.210> it<00:00:06.359> was<00:00:06.660> on<00:00:06.839> any<00:00:07.109> painting<00:00:07.589> tools<00:00:07.830> or

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
GIMP so it was on any painting tools or

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.860 
GIMP so it was on any painting tools or
when<00:00:08.250> I<00:00:08.370> say<00:00:08.519> panic<00:00:08.700> blaming<00:00:09.179> from<00:00:09.450> here<00:00:09.690> from

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
when I say panic blaming from here from

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.220 
when I say panic blaming from here from
the<00:00:10.050> pencil<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.340> Dodge<00:00:11.580> bone<00:00:11.880> tool<00:00:12.230> and

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
the pencil to the Dodge bone tool and

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.499 
the pencil to the Dodge bone tool and
you'll<00:00:13.769> see<00:00:14.070> here<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.309> new<00:00:14.549> option<00:00:15.059> while<00:00:15.389> you

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
you'll see here a new option while you

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.060 
you'll see here a new option while you
can<00:00:15.690> choose<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:15.990> list<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.350> symmetry<00:00:16.800> so<00:00:16.859> let's

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
can choose a list of symmetry so let's

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.609 
can choose a list of symmetry so let's
try<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.430> mirror<00:00:17.789> one<00:00:18.380> right<00:00:19.380> it's<00:00:19.470> an

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
try the mirror one right it's an

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.830 
try the mirror one right it's an
original<00:00:19.890> mirror<00:00:20.400> for<00:00:20.730> instance<00:00:23.600> so<00:00:24.600> they'll

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
original mirror for instance so they'll

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.519 
original mirror for instance so they'll
also<00:00:24.990> like<00:00:25.230> vertical<00:00:25.980> mirror<00:00:28.400> point<00:00:29.400> symmetry

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
also like vertical mirror point symmetry

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.860 
also like vertical mirror point symmetry
and<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.920> can<00:00:32.099> have<00:00:32.579> them<00:00:32.820> all<00:00:33.000> together

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
and so you can have them all together

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.069 
and so you can have them all together
all<00:00:34.880> just<00:00:35.880> two<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.180> them<00:00:36.450> or<00:00:36.750> tell<00:00:38.540> so<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.660> works

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
all just two of them or tell so it works

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.200 
all just two of them or tell so it works
with<00:00:40.440> all<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.980> other<00:00:41.100> tools<00:00:41.460> banking<00:00:41.969> tools

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
with all the other tools banking tools

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.529 
with all the other tools banking tools
or<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.540> pencils<00:00:43.410> eraser<00:00:44.780> to<00:00:45.780> enter<00:00:47.539> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
or the pencils eraser to enter the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:01:07.560 
or the pencils eraser to enter the
airbrush

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:18.480 

even<00:01:08.350> blur<00:01:14.550> smudge

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.660 

well<00:01:19.060> even<00:01:19.510> even<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.080> source<00:01:20.470> tool<00:01:20.770> works

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
well even even the source tool works

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.149 
well even even the source tool works
often<00:01:22.090> in<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.330> clone<00:01:22.600> so<00:01:23.530> I'll<00:01:23.799> use<00:01:23.979> this

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
often in the clone so I'll use this

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.830 
often in the clone so I'll use this
image<00:01:24.790> which<00:01:25.000> is<00:01:25.030> a<00:01:25.150> project<00:01:25.450> they're<00:01:25.810> working

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
image which is a project they're working

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.920 
image which is a project they're working
on<00:01:27.300> and<00:01:28.300> I<00:01:29.080> would<00:01:29.440> just<00:01:29.909> clone<00:01:30.909> it<00:01:31.060> here<00:01:31.420> and

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
on and I would just clone it here and

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:41.679 
on and I would just clone it here and
you<00:01:32.470> see<00:01:32.680> just<00:01:32.860> clone<00:01:33.430> it<00:01:33.610> in<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.509> mirror

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.940 

and<00:01:42.170> let's<00:01:42.979> rave<00:01:43.249> is<00:01:43.399> a<00:01:43.429> healing<00:01:43.819> tool<00:01:44.950> to

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
and let's rave is a healing tool to

00:01:45.950 --> 00:02:04.270 
and let's rave is a healing tool to
Sammy<00:01:46.249> just<00:01:46.549> walks

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.030 

so<00:02:04.760> of<00:02:04.880> course<00:02:05.180> you<00:02:05.360> don't<00:02:05.540> have<00:02:05.690> to<00:02:05.930> keep<00:02:06.200> the

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
so of course you don't have to keep the

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.100 
so of course you don't have to keep the
guides<00:02:07.310> at<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.670> center<00:02:08.149> you<00:02:08.360> can<00:02:08.509> just<00:02:08.810> move

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
guides at the center you can just move

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.730 
guides at the center you can just move
your<00:02:09.399> neural<00:02:10.399> axis<00:02:10.580> and<00:02:11.120> that's<00:02:11.990> it<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.590> just

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
your neural axis and that's it it just

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:21.400 
your neural axis and that's it it just
it<00:02:13.040> works<00:02:13.310> always<00:02:14.030> any<00:02:14.900> places<00:02:20.080> so<00:02:21.080> now<00:02:21.230> for

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
it works always any places so now for

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.650 
it works always any places so now for
the<00:02:21.620> timing<00:02:22.070> feature<00:02:22.310> it's<00:02:22.790> basically<00:02:23.450> the

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
the timing feature it's basically the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.170 
the timing feature it's basically the
symmetry<00:02:24.320> feature<00:02:24.680> that<00:02:24.800> I<00:02:24.950> added<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.550> very

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
symmetry feature that I added is very

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.670 
symmetry feature that I added is very
generic<00:02:26.420> so<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:27.400> added<00:02:28.400> a<00:02:28.640> few<00:02:28.940> other<00:02:29.680> bonuses

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
generic so I added a few other bonuses

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.670 
generic so I added a few other bonuses
like<00:02:31.610> this<00:02:31.880> tiny<00:02:32.150> feature<00:02:32.570> so<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:32.960> choose<00:02:33.230> how

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
like this tiny feature so you choose how

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.390 
like this tiny feature so you choose how
many<00:02:33.740> pixel<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.960> if<00:02:35.960> you<00:02:36.380> want<00:02:36.560> infinite<00:02:37.160> or

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
many pixel and if you want infinite or

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.340 
many pixel and if you want infinite or
just<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.959> certain<00:02:38.959> number<00:02:39.500> of<00:02:39.530> images<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:41.350> so

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
just a certain number of images and so

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.920 
just a certain number of images and so
that<00:02:42.620> you<00:02:42.860> can<00:02:43.040> just<00:02:43.250> draw<00:02:44.060> anything<00:02:44.450> you<00:02:44.690> want

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
that you can just draw anything you want

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:53.770 
that you can just draw anything you want
and<00:02:45.200> it<00:02:45.410> will<00:02:45.590> tell<00:02:45.920> them<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:52.330> if<00:02:53.330> you<00:02:53.540> use

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
and it will tell them and if you use

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.449 
and it will tell them and if you use
very<00:02:54.730> exact<00:02:55.900> division<00:02:56.900> of<00:02:57.170> your<00:02:57.650> image<00:02:58.220> size

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
very exact division of your image size

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.630 
very exact division of your image size
can<00:02:59.240> have<00:02:59.870> perfect<00:03:00.140> patterns<00:03:00.740> or<00:03:01.130> where<00:03:01.430> the

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
can have perfect patterns or where the

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.930 
can have perfect patterns or where the
right<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.500> left<00:03:03.740> and<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.370> top<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:04.790> the

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
right and the left and the top and the

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.790 
right and the left and the top and the
bottom<00:03:05.090> will<00:03:05.720> just<00:03:06.550> be<00:03:07.550> perfect<00:03:08.000> matches<00:03:08.800> so

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
bottom will just be perfect matches so

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.500 
bottom will just be perfect matches so
that<00:03:09.980> you<00:03:10.160> can<00:03:10.370> use<00:03:10.519> them<00:03:10.670> as<00:03:10.790> buttons<00:03:11.209> it's

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
that you can use them as buttons it's

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.910 
that you can use them as buttons it's
very<00:03:11.750> easy<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.080> make<00:03:12.290> button<00:03:12.680> with<00:03:12.890> your

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
very easy to make button with your

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.380 
very easy to make button with your
system<00:03:14.920> so<00:03:15.920> know<00:03:16.100> what<00:03:16.400> I<00:03:16.519> call<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.910> mandala

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
system so know what I call the mandala

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.110 
system so know what I call the mandala
which<00:03:17.570> is<00:03:17.720> basically<00:03:18.140> a<00:03:18.340> rotational<00:03:19.340> symmetry

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
which is basically a rotational symmetry

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.410 
which is basically a rotational symmetry
so<00:03:21.080> you<00:03:21.140> choose<00:03:21.590> how<00:03:21.920> many<00:03:21.980> how<00:03:22.850> many<00:03:22.880> strokes

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
so you choose how many how many strokes

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.920 
so you choose how many how many strokes
you<00:03:23.630> want

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
you want

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.160 
you want
so<00:03:24.530> here<00:03:24.800> six<00:03:25.280> and<00:03:25.580> then<00:03:25.820> twelve<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:26.870> whatever

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
so here six and then twelve and whatever

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.740 
so here six and then twelve and whatever
of<00:03:27.500> course<00:03:27.550> you<00:03:28.550> are<00:03:28.670> only<00:03:28.760> limited<00:03:29.000> by<00:03:29.239> your

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
of course you are only limited by your

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.350 
of course you are only limited by your
processing<00:03:30.350> power<00:03:30.620> so<00:03:30.769> if<00:03:31.010> you<00:03:31.160> do<00:03:31.850> 100

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
processing power so if you do 100

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.620 
processing power so if you do 100
strokes<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:32.959> will<00:03:33.170> just<00:03:33.440> like<00:03:34.239> to<00:03:35.239> be<00:03:35.420> very

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
strokes it will just like to be very

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.259 
strokes it will just like to be very
expressive<00:03:35.989> also<00:03:36.560> just<00:03:36.860> just<00:03:37.220> don't<00:03:37.400> don't<00:03:37.880> go

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
expressive also just just don't don't go

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.699 
expressive also just just don't don't go
for<00:03:38.989> the<00:03:39.230> other<00:03:39.470> edge<00:03:40.130> and<00:03:40.810> then<00:03:41.810> you<00:03:42.170> can<00:03:42.380> move

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
for the other edge and then you can move

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.410 
for the other edge and then you can move
always<00:03:43.570> those<00:03:44.570> guides<00:03:45.340> so<00:03:46.340> which<00:03:46.489> is<00:03:46.700> a<00:03:46.940> center

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
always those guides so which is a center

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.390 
always those guides so which is a center
inside<00:03:48.350> a<00:03:48.380> what<00:03:48.709> a<00:03:48.739> center<00:03:49.190> of<00:03:49.250> your

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
inside a what a center of your

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.660 
inside a what a center of your
rotational<00:03:49.670> symmetry<00:03:50.360> and<00:03:50.720> so<00:03:51.670> basically

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
rotational symmetry and so basically

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.699 
rotational symmetry and so basically
that's<00:03:52.850> it<00:03:53.060> for<00:03:53.330> this<00:03:53.540> new<00:03:53.840> symmetry<00:03:54.200> future

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
that's it for this new symmetry future

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.090 
that's it for this new symmetry future
we<00:03:55.340> hope<00:03:55.700> you<00:03:55.940> like<00:03:56.120> it<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:56.630> the<00:03:57.350> image<00:03:57.680> is<00:03:57.709> so

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
we hope you like it and the image is so

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.880 
we hope you like it and the image is so
leah<00:03:58.340> is<00:03:58.489> our<00:03:58.790> next<00:03:59.239> project<00:04:00.080> an<00:04:00.230> animation

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
leah is our next project an animation

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.920 
leah is our next project an animation
film<00:04:01.340> in<00:04:01.790> 2d<00:04:02.360> so<00:04:03.200> if<00:04:03.739> you<00:04:03.890> want<00:04:04.070> modules<00:04:04.519> just

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
film in 2d so if you want modules just

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.750 
film in 2d so if you want modules just
go<00:04:05.930> on<00:04:05.989> the<00:04:06.170> website<00:04:06.380> film<00:04:07.040> dot<00:04:07.250> some<00:04:07.489> are<00:04:07.610> not

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
go on the website film dot some are not

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.820 
go on the website film dot some are not
dotnet<00:04:08.239> thank<00:04:09.170> you<00:04:09.320> very<00:04:09.440> much<00:04:09.680> and<00:04:10.010> goodbye
