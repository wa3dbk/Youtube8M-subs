sure I continue to curl and pull all the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.720 
sure I continue to curl and pull all the
way<00:02:39.120> until<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:42.540> heat<00:02:43.280> stimulates<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.459> curl

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
way until the heat stimulates the curl

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.699 
way until the heat stimulates the curl
and<00:02:45.000> then<00:02:45.120> allows<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.660> just<00:02:46.079> release<00:02:46.410> on

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
and then allows it to just release on

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.910 
and then allows it to just release on
its<00:02:46.859> own<00:02:47.040> from<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.400> flat<00:02:47.609> iron<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:49.560> here's<00:02:49.829> a

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
so I have a section this is about three

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.210 
so I have a section this is about three
tracks<00:03:37.799> going<00:03:38.799> down<00:03:39.959> again<00:03:40.980> I'm<00:03:41.980> going<00:03:42.129> to

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
tracks going down again I'm going to

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.000 
tracks going down again I'm going to
straighten<00:03:43.170> wrap<00:03:45.599> turn<00:03:46.599> and<00:03:46.989> pull

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
straighten wrap turn and pull

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.819 
straighten wrap turn and pull
wrap<00:03:48.720> turn<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:50.110> pull<00:03:52.079> and<00:03:53.079> you<00:03:53.230> see<00:03:53.440> my<00:03:53.590> tail

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
wrap turn and pull and you see my tail

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.130 
wrap turn and pull and you see my tail
gets<00:03:54.129> shorter<00:03:54.610> and<00:03:54.819> shorter<00:03:55.019> from<00:03:56.019> the

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
gets shorter and shorter from the

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.380 
gets shorter and shorter from the
straight<00:03:56.440> piece<00:03:56.620> of<00:03:56.829> hanging<00:03:57.190> out<00:03:57.310> if<00:03:57.700> you

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
straight piece of hanging out if you

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.000 
straight piece of hanging out if you
don't<00:03:58.660> pull<00:03:58.989> while<00:03:59.319> you're<00:03:59.500> curling<00:03:59.950> your

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
flat iron will get stuck and then you'll

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.140 
flat iron will get stuck and then you'll
have<00:04:03.100> the<00:04:03.310> indentations<00:04:04.180> that<00:04:04.530> you<00:04:05.530> can<00:04:05.709> see

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
where it got stuck at you'll have

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.120 
where it got stuck at you'll have
creases<00:04:09.250> lines<00:04:09.790> going<00:04:10.239> through<00:04:10.859> so<00:04:11.859> we'll<00:04:12.010> be

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
creases lines going through so we'll be

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.240 
creases lines going through so we'll be
back<00:04:12.340> at<00:04:12.579> the<00:04:12.849> very<00:04:13.060> end<00:04:13.299> to<00:04:13.480> show<00:04:13.660> you<00:04:14.250> for
