 very good as every Monday we bring you new games and applications 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.020
 for iphone and there are peace applications that we have tried the selected this 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.150
 week like very useful dispensable tim 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.780
 if something bad has the statue and point is that apple does not allow to reproduce nor 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.710
 vices or flash animations this is a problem because when we go into 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.119
 some websites that use said technology 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.039
 not only we lose user experience but also that we are 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:38.039
 limited when viewing content 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.300
 there yes you are the application that we were all waiting for, thanks 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.850
 we can now access tiber without problems pages with flash content 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.850
 whether videos - john and motions 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.760
 although they exist also makes use of their technology to be able to launch games 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.299
 flash 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:04.090
 what is really important is a browser from which the 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.339
 model nation flash 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.250
 it is possible we have already said and the good but we will also talk about the bad 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.340
 One of the things I like least about the CST browser is the absence of 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.080
 A search engine 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.180
 we must know the web is full of fence that you ask from safari 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.710
 in addition to the system that uses this application to watch videos and 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.940
 Flash animations on the iPad makes the medication slower than normal 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.979
 but believe me if I tell them 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:30.799
 and even so 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.310
 It is worth its use at times where we need to make certain content 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.230
 apple has already launched the first adaptation last week in prague 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.340
 an application to create music designed for users who hang up 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.430

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:39.669
 three minutes
