00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.319
 hi everyone so today 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.879
 chouinard point of view of redemptions 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:08.809
 I hope fast frame because I have not 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:10.820
 too many things 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.379
 in any case then there that things start 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.270
 come from the internet and I started 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.730
 right now I started with a 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.189
 partnership that I have with water and sap 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.760
 I took two articles the first I 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.770
 door 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.560
 it's a sellers in a lace pit 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.330
 half transparent it actually and I 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.460
 put a tank top underneath he finds 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.590
 Too cute and it's a size 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.719
 riquet it's going almost every 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.280

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.350

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.909
 article prices is not very original 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.449
 in fact it's the same but in sleeves 

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:41.059

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.170

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.630
 as usual I want to say so 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.810
 here I am really trying to take care 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.920
 of my very dry dry hair to do 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.110
 treatments and so on 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.640
 so that's why I bought what 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.190
 I will show you right away 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.190
 buy a mask at monoprix garnier 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.080
 fructis nutr fathers I bought 2 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.000
 Pascal Monoprix bought himself 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.220
 not long ago so he without 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.959
 Too much I do not do that without it 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.930
 but it smelled boast to me are the 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.360
 faulty they are always always good 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.170
 and that one I already tested in fact I 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.820
 beg them for my shower 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.410
 it really works really well 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.450
 when you come out of the shower your 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.130
 hair so really very much doubt 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.590
 so I am very happy with my purchase 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.769
 he listened to me in the 5.5 in units 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.030
 but the other were offered so 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.620
 then we will go to makeup 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.430
 I ordered on the site 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:03.300

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.980
 hard tooth essence and full technics 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.370
 brands not found in France in 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.680
 done and it's really very cheap 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.959
 so what I took first is the 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.610
 strengths that at cos I was paul s 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.860
 it's really what I like about 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.410
 them because they are very very good of 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.329
 very good quality and I wanted to test 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.829
 the last time I learned that a 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.380
 real peace recovery is so here I have 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.690
 taken full at last I have nearly 5 loses and 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.160
 we had what is somewhere because 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.209
 that I already used in fact and I 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:38.880
 adore in short I talk too much so there the 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:44.329
 mark these taunts and gt4 father the 113 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:46.590
 the a43 the 523 alas 747 she 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.180
 I know that I say numbers like that 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.980
 but hey, I'll do some or very 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.530
 happy with these people fossils but 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.079
 quite often, even though my eyelashes 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.079
 are super raid and then to here 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:00.600
 chemiotechnic I took a brush that 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.489
 is already great room because I already have 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.690
 used it is a beveled brush in 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:08.670
 fibers I made my first point on 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.290
 their techniques better technique this 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.850
 it's my first serious step 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.050
 yes a techno 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.050
 how does it say it's good for the 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.060
 brush from home what is it super 

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.060
 well it's not dense enough I think in 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.870
 done but good for the foundation 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.350
 I wish they were a bit more 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.560
 dense the country it does not matter the quality 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:32.460
 superb quality super good home 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:35.070
 essence I took a loose azim volume 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.410
 speakers do that when you put 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.700
 your mascara is the powder actually 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.400
 like push in quotation marks 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.160
 rebuild and you put that you put that 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.020
 then you add mascara and that 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.320
 gives volume in fact I do not have 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.780
 still tested it is to test so here it is 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.250
 it looks like their the one of too faced the 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.380
 mascara that sell as a kit 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.350
 except that it's about twenty euros and 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.240
 this one he must be at 2 3 euros 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.590

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.870
 glitter it does not care everywhere on the 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.210
 face and I do not like at all actually 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:34.470
