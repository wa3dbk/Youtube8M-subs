00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 is attributed further his statement of 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.339
 that it's useless to try to make a man 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.810
 abandon reasoning something that 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.639
 he did not acquire by reason one of the 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.840
 silly things in an attempt to get 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.910
 people out of the movement 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.370
 neopentecostal is to try to argue with 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.109
 doctrinal and practical failures 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.940
 of the neo-Pentecostal movement itself 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.470
 I know a lot of people who tried to 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.630
 convince that my practices do not 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.430
 found support in the structure and not 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.689
 heard none of them, the reason is 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.160
 simple no one becomes 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.500
 Pentecostal because of allergies and 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.420
 and you will not like this after a 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.489
 thorough epidemiological 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.960
 I did not even bump into tapping. 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.300
 during dawns for having read the work 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.920
 colossal about new solutions are 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.420
 these people do not embrace 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.090
 pentecostals through a study of the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.620
 structure seems rushed to change 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.180
 of opinion through against ordering 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.129
 chronological is as if you try to 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.989
 to cure the flu from someone who likes to swim 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.649
 naked during the winter is getting more 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.510
 Vitamin C 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.070
 I'll try to cure a boy's blindness. 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.660
 who likes to use lemon as eye drops 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.430
 prescribing better glasses 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.199
 nobody starts to fall backward during 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.149
 the prayers were enough because he learned 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.920
 this in the deed and not just apologia 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.359
 Bible that will solve the problem yet 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.280
 God has used this kind of thing. 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.200
 Well, only a number of brothers are 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.760
 short and direct was not more powerful 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.350
 to shake the group of choristers who 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.880
 kicked biblical doctrines about 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.830
 salvation and helping the transit of 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.630
 total approval they unconditionally grace 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.280
 irresistible is so limited and 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.750
 persevering holy the famous five 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.460
 points of Calvinism, that's when I 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.860
 I realized that dominates my salvation was 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.500
 totally incoherent with the deed of 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.119
 a form so absurd that the whole idea 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.400
 that I had that god is notified of this 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.110
 was soon led to think if everything 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.829
 that I believed about salvation was 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.820
 wrong 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.560
 How can I be so sure? 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.720
 that my ideas about all others 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.159
 matters are correct and that is where 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.439
 boat started to sink 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.670
 I use this analogy of the boat for example 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.140
 get something I always did 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.939
 ministry of preaching in schools 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.710
 I explain our whole account a vision. 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.290
 our understanding of life and the world 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.450
 ourselves is like a boat and we keep 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.310
 seconds on the strong currents in the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.500
 Our reality head makes all sense 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.090
 all blocks of information have the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.430
 about the various parts of life 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.420
 fit in pretty live until someone gives 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.829
 a shot in the boat 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.329
 this shot can be anything to 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.460
 perception that salvation occurs from 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.350
 so we give a reading that we 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.030
 convinces practices that we always defend 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.009
 with technology are not sinful 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.510
 practical experience 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.709
 reveals the real impossibility give 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.110
 certain creed and various other things 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.299
 when the boat pierces not only the part 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.459
 damaged it will sink but all 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.689
 park will pull some having just for the 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.310
 future with all their might. 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.110
 consultant of the type to use of patch 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.730
 but some holes are deep 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.950
 sufficient to require 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.970
 entirely new in this case or century 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.099
 for the boat 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.659
 The wreck with the boat I 've tried 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.370
 this kind of thing in practice infinity 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.930
 of times when training some boy to 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.819
 evangelize the school or something like me 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.739
 perceive certain problems in the way 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.930
 they come into the world including writing 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.730
 many were overly mystical 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.829
 seeing performances from the moment of his return 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.970
 others have silly interpretations 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.430
 Word of God believing in a number 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.019
 so low of popular beliefs that 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.090
 dealing with each of them would require a 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.099
 time and patience that I lacked 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.019
 would do to help young people to 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.670
 improve and grow in their visions of 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.370
 world in its interpretations of 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.530
 simple structure simply 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.389
 questioned a doctrinal conversation in the 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.889
 more subtle possible and show the 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.239
 common interpretation in that doctrine 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.129
 I was absolutely wrong 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.260
 all the favorites the christian can drink 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.250
 beer if the mature customer could hear 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.440
 secular music 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.239
 the suicide was already faith or present a 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.650
 failsafe defense is one of those 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.669
 things in the minds of many entered 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.230
 screw 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:24.389
 the authority of the pastor who was once a 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.949
 empty man of errors diminish since it was 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.870
 that the structure stands for something that 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:29.669
 he criticized sovereignty and some 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.349
 Prophets was declining since many times 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.180
 were seen proclaiming curses 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.829
 when that mickey way 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.480
 beyond all systematization 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.060
 doctrine that made sense in the head 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.250
 these young people played leading use 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.680
 rethinking various other topics 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.650
 before they were safe it 's crack in the 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.419
 dam is the bottom boat the they jump the 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.489
 castaway that most jumped for a 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:52.319
 different neighborhood many times to class 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.540
 seminars get postcards or preach 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.370
 churches and denominations of this type 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.019
 rather than criticize directly what 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.579
 It was wrong, I 'd rather deal with it. 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.269
 peripheral issues that were more 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.769
 obvious 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.480
 the ordinary public and what would be the 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.699
 enough to work the whole structure 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.859
 small shop that involved so the 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:09.060
 preach against witches demonstrations 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.810
 are erroneously called languages 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.489
 Weird 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.870
 I showed paulo key in useful 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.090
 speak the language while it does not exist 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.459
 approval and speaks in this way during 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.200
 the sermon during the public prayer or even 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.720
 even loudly the banks during 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.640
 they are not things I praise God and what 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.860
 comes from our meat based on the 1st 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.630
 corinthians 14 verse 9 19 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.370
 by agreeing to this point on those 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.260
 who already speak languages ​​in their own minds 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.460
 begins to question the origin of the 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.810
 that made him scream and 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.430
 incomprehensibly those moments 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.380
 inappropriate 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.180
 with this they thought to realize that this 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.860
 was the same impulse that led them to 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.660
 speak in tongues at all times and 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.910
 ended up confused about the nature of the gift 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.280
 if you want your friends to know 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.230
 of neo-Pentecostalism begins by guiding 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.300
 your criticisms for yourself to question 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.560
 practices will take him away from you 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.120
 The reason is simple, you're not. 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.680
 simply will change the way 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.900
 they have manifestations of the holy spirit 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.790
 but he's asking him to throw it away 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.130
 a life the experience with God is like 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.960
 ask a Muslim devout Catholic then 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.520
 You do not have to attack the city by 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.320
 main doors feel no more 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.200
 protected by most of the party 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.060
 national subject goes through the windows 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.320
 lower parts of the hills by 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.240
 bottom doors 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.830
 It's important though that you be fast. 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.360
 offered an alternative neighborhood for those 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.740
 You go to the area and there are many brothers. 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.780
 they do not know how to swim and it ended up dying 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.250
 drowned and left to drift if you are 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.810
 willing to avoid with questions 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.470
 doctrinal other than losing 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.090
 optimism 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.860
 or close to offering a place in your 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.320
 vessel when the shipwreck was 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.520
 France impending said chief spoke 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.830
 respect of the need to provide a 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.350
 immediate critical view after a 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.600
 same process project and lose only go 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.800
 paying in order to prevent that vacuum 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.550
 understanding of the world and seeks 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.380
 suicide 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.840
 the ceará counts in all the boxes that 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.940
 has dried and responsibly the goal is 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.440
 provide larger vessels and not 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.980
 delete those who use boats 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.980
 defective 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.400
 ah
