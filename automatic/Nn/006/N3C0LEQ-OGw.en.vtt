00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
could pour that in there you go and then

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.800

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
we'll lower down on machine and turn it

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.360 
we'll lower down on machine and turn it
on<00:01:55.159> so<00:01:56.159> we'll<00:01:56.369> let<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.549> mix<00:01:56.909> in

that you want to actually cut down your
flour<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.920> little<00:03:19.950> bit<00:03:20.370> less<00:03:20.640> say<00:03:21.450> about<00:03:21.750> by<00:03:22.049> a

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
flour a little bit less say about by a

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.400 
flour a little bit less say about by a
quarter<00:03:23.519> of<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.790> recipe<00:03:24.209> because<00:03:24.840> again<00:03:25.260> it

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
quarter of the recipe because again it

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.860 
quarter of the recipe because again it
up<00:03:25.560> otherwise<00:03:26.069> it<00:03:26.220> gets<00:03:26.310> too<00:03:26.580> stiff<00:03:26.940> the

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
up otherwise it gets too stiff the

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.350 
up otherwise it gets too stiff the
patient<00:03:28.440> flowers<00:03:28.769> more<00:03:29.010> tender<00:03:29.400> more<00:03:29.970> tender

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
patient flowers more tender more tender

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.330 
patient flowers more tender more tender
because<00:03:30.660> there's<00:03:30.870> less<00:03:31.049> gluten<00:03:31.410> in<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:31.709> with

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
because there's less gluten in it with

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.240 
because there's less gluten in it with
less<00:03:32.549> gluten<00:03:32.880> in<00:03:33.150> it<00:03:33.180> you'll<00:03:33.420> get<00:03:33.569> a<00:03:33.599> softer

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
less gluten in it you'll get a softer

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.509 
less gluten in it you'll get a softer
cake<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.489> softer<00:03:35.970> cookie<00:03:36.450> whatever<00:03:37.200> have<00:03:37.440> you

batter<00:03:56.430> into<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.599> bag<00:03:57.780> into<00:03:58.349> the<00:03:58.500> molds<00:03:58.920> all

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
batter into the bag into the molds all

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.190 
batter into the bag into the molds all
the<00:03:59.610> way<00:03:59.730> around<00:03:59.849> all<00:04:00.630> right<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:00.989> I<00:04:01.049> would

the way around all right and I would

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.170 
the way around all right and I would
just<00:04:01.290> pipe<00:04:01.560> these<00:04:01.799> in<00:04:02.069> get<00:04:02.609> them<00:04:02.730> all<00:04:02.910> filled

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180

oven great we've let them bake in 375 of
them<00:04:07.200> for<00:04:07.350> about<00:04:07.440> 25<00:04:08.040> minutes<00:04:08.069> this<00:04:08.609> is<00:04:08.819> the

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
them for about 25 minutes this is the

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.550 
them for about 25 minutes this is the

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
tricky part you have to look at the

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.809 
tricky part you have to look at the
Rings<00:04:10.889> and<00:04:11.010> you<00:04:11.130> have<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.340> figure<00:04:11.489> out<00:04:11.609> which

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
Rings and you have to figure out which

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.610 
Rings and you have to figure out which
is<00:04:11.849> the<00:04:12.030> largest<00:04:12.269> one<00:04:12.720> because<00:04:13.380> we're<00:04:13.530> gonna

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
is the largest one because we're gonna

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.379 
is the largest one because we're gonna
start<00:04:13.980> at<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.160> base<00:04:14.340> with<00:04:14.579> our<00:04:14.730> largest<00:04:15.090> ring

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
start at the base with our largest ring

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.089 
start at the base with our largest ring
and<00:04:15.599> move<00:04:15.930> our<00:04:16.109> way<00:04:16.139> tree<00:04:16.650> that<00:04:16.829> goes<00:04:16.950> like

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
and move our way tree that goes like

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:18.379 
and move our way tree that goes like
this<00:04:17.489> well<00:04:17.700> you<00:04:17.789> could<00:04:17.910> sort<00:04:18.120> of<00:04:18.269> make

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
this well you could sort of make
