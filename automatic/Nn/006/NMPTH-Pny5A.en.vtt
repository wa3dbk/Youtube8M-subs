00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 buongiorno do you love dreamworks personally i 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.680
 very much they come up with really 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.929
 interesting stories original setting 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.960
 do everything at a very high level 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.580
 however, a very good sequel came out 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.150
 how to train your dragon 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.410
 feel the catch sequel therefore arises 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.199
 natural question 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.570
 go to this animated cartoon or 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.449
 No, could he reach the level 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.390
 original to these questions i actually 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.769
 saying now and answer this movie gong and 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.860
 it's time to start 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.170
 let's go you know despite the abundance 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.270
 sequel dreamworks implemented 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.850
 quite a lot of different from the harvest in their 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.070
 works how to tame the dragon perhaps 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.680
 most realistic believable cartoon 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.719
 regarding the history of the Vikings fighting 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.000
 against the dragons was taken pretty 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.730
 warmth by both viewers and critics 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.370
 and so why not make a sequel and 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.320
 they made the action happen through 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.480
 five years after our brave 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.329
 the main characters of the company with a toothless 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.640
 killed a huge best and founded the world between 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.360
 humans and dragons and king should 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.610
 adjacent areas on your live 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.070
 other transport and finds all new and 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.710
 new islands and one day they 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.530
 stumbled upon dragon catchers who 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.920
 catching a flying serpent and to itself in 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.890
 army in order to destroy the dragons chapter is 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.900
 army brutal experienced viking dredge 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.150
 which besides being suggestive 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.909
 It looks like that also got the handle 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.909
 dragons and here at ikkinga and company 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.150
 there is a new enemy with which it is necessary 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.640
 figure out cheer sequel 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.759
 in fact this is the main 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.159
 the problem of this cartoon is a sequel but 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.200
 and this will return later today and the most 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.149
 noticeable somewhere in the middle 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.140
 pretty slack and almost nothing 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.750
 not happening 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.649
 the story is certainly interesting but small 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.810
 predictably 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.579
 that is, a few main plot 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.700
 twists can be predicted 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.490
 But it is interesting to look further characters 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.619
 main feature dreamworks charismatic 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.690
 and original characters that 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.010
 meet in memory for long 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.900
 here, too, a little while lollys 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.390
 as a natural development of characters 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.159
 the main characters did not happen and the new 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.959
 we almost did not provide 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.750
 No, of course, the main one is remembered 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:26.349
 antagonist dredge and a couple more of this 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.629
 few would like more I understand that 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.819
 serious development of characters gently 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.040
 saying no attribute animated 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.920
 cartoons but they could come up 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.260
 more charismatic heroes but he doesn't 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.079
 It happened not so long ago I was talking about 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.319
 that this cartoon led food in some 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.930
 sort of it is not quite good first 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.090
 the part was impressive that she was 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.760
 brighter original as it was 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.909
 new and a sequel turned out a few 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.010
 paler than the original but it is quite expected 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:03:00.549
 Finally, we need to talk about good 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.139
 there is praise for the quality of the pancake 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.150
 it's just not to describe 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:06.819
 although you yourself have probably seen the trailer and 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.700
 level when drawing animations is not that 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.739
 superb wasp extremely transcendental 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.859
 especially dragon scales 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.769
 you are characters especially at close-ups 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:20.139
 during dialogue , every fold is visible 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.840
 on leather armor every wrinkle 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:25.480
 and other small details and even images 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.579
 the main characters remain the same they all 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.040
 just charismatic and great 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.989
 Worked clothes armor fit 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.919
 perfect for everyone to find fault 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.310
 by oil 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:37.660
 another significant plus music is she like 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.030
 always on the top 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.000
 the main theme remains the same but was 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.269
 slightly modified music 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.299
 displays the mood of the story so 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.250
 what we have in the end is beautiful 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.829
 animated cartoon on which you can 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.400
 go at least go with friends from all over 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:59.079
 family yes with anyone and even a little 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.349
 inferior to the original but cartoons 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:04.299
 similar quality and level of performance 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.579
 rarely produced so that if you 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.859
 love animated cartoons and you 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:12.579
 I liked the first part how to tame 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:14.919
 the dragon then boldly go to this cartoon 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.260
 don't forget everything about me 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:18.609
 like and subscribe to the channel 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.819
 if you liked 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:25.169
 and remember if you want to tame the dragon 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:28.169
 you'll need a lot of fish 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.169
 adios
