00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.210
 thank you it has been great to travel giving boats inside the trunk I love 

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:12.399
 last December what is happening 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.480
 we forgot for a week's ration 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.350
 I imagine 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.339
 We need your help 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:22.199
 for another treasure hunt over time 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.150
 castedo to replace his event's fruit 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.939
 this is what the map that you found reveals 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.499
 the other murderers 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:32.499
 that will not be left in what they can and where they can hit 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.560
 we are losing this war 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.640
 the Templars are very powerful 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.739
 and every day dies 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.210
 more of us still do not see with July 20 in all this 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.680
 let's train 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.680
 to become one of us 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.050
 the hole you've seen me in action 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.840
 I'm not good at these things, it would also take months today, even years 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.580
 thanks cheers and to the effect bleed 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.300
 it does not have to be this way 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.600
 but I'm just a normal guy 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.900
 sometimes you do not need more press 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.210
 that's why it seeks to express my ancestor 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.230
 what was it called china 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.250
 if you can follow his steps you will learn total 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.570
 despite them several years of training in a matter of days 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.360
 has taken me out of the pilgrims brought here just to become a 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.140
 assassin 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.140
 there's more but now I do not have time to explain that she 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.690
 trust me 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.380
 it's okay 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.740
 tell me what I have to do 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.570
 she is safe 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.590
 I thought you would be happier 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.140
 and I feel that I am somewhat surprised 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.159
 while we were coming, he has not stopped thinking about how he was going to fix them 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.250
 to convince you 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.250
 after what those damned templars have put me through 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.970
 more than willing 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.960
 Thank you

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.109
 this slight slip subjects 17 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:21.979
 it's normal I do not know if 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:23.240
 who was doing 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.700
 or where this one badly burned me its management if she is a cardigan believes 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:31.779
 delighted to finally be started promises moody's montisonense to put 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:32.769
 to work 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.589
 time is money and these days or more 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:37.729
 we have everything ready in Mexico 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:40.389
 when you have it, we will put it into operation 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:45.199
 I brought you a retroactive adjustment farewell present to obama today does not have 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:46.129
 memory 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.059
 and always and 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:49.299
 with this data 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.389
 everything will go much faster 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.389
 right now I'm going to combine the code 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:01.789
 at the same time more 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:04.189
 I was wondering what is your role in all this 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:05.649
 I'll take care 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:08.599
 my job is to keep working well 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.469
 Everyday of the year 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:14.909
 that is encourage two points but because this baby these times more amazing 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:16.979
 that the one in contrast napster 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:20.289
 pita the templars have more money than us but they lack ambition 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:23.249
 passion and competitive spirit 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:25.239
 for many the things that I have 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.999
 I can overcome anything they do 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:29.879
 and in less time 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.309
 when you're ready, sit down and we can start 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:36.309
 If I have to make some small adjustments 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:43.779
 the kiosks 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:46.779
 I wanted to tell you thank you 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:50.979
 that you feel it from before you know what happened hours fenced 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.079
 I was not ready 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.970
 but go through all that know that the Templars still exist knowing what 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:02.469
 what you have done is done 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:05.469
 now you are here and that is what impacts 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.090
 what are these junk 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.169
 these junk desmond these disorders are nothing special 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.000
 they are a machinery that prevents our entire operation from jumping through the air 

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:28.249
 it takes a lot of concentration to keep going so I apologize 

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:30.389
 If I do not have a lot of time to entertain 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.449
 his sense of maintaining our artists is like a digital library 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.849
 while you are in the mood headquarters will remain cloudy 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:40.979
 if you find things that strike you people places 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:42.510
 events 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.300

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.870

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.020

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.000
 from assad stern those who are and force doing the job really 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 risking his life those things 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.259
 How does this work 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:19.389

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.330
