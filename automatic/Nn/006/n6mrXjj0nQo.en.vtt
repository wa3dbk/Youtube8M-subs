okay guys just a very quick one today I

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.600 
okay guys just a very quick one today I
was<00:00:09.870> clearing<00:00:10.170> up<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.410> shop<00:00:10.679> after<00:00:11.340> doing

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
was clearing up the shop after doing

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.589 
was clearing up the shop after doing
that<00:00:11.790> big<00:00:12.780> knife<00:00:12.990> The<00:00:13.440> Legend<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.240> I<00:00:15.240> found<00:00:15.540> a

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
that big knife The Legend and I found a

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.660 
that big knife The Legend and I found a
few<00:00:15.750> scraps<00:00:16.049> lying<00:00:16.350> about<00:00:16.560> like<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:17.039> these

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
few scraps lying about like this these

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.590 
few scraps lying about like this these
were<00:00:18.119> cut<00:00:18.570> off<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:19.410> make<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.680> Tang<00:00:19.949> on<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.420> big

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
were cut off to make the Tang on the big

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.960 
were cut off to make the Tang on the big
knife<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.189> thought<00:00:23.400> well<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.580> seems<00:00:23.850> a

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
knife and so I thought well it seems a

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.380 
knife and so I thought well it seems a
shame<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.210> waste<00:00:24.510> them<00:00:24.920> so<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.400> made<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.090> nice

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
shame to waste them so I made a nice

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.999 
shame to waste them so I made a nice
little<00:00:27.750> knife<00:00:28.019> all<00:00:28.920> I've<00:00:29.099> done<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:31.009> squish

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
little knife all I've done is squish

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.120 
little knife all I've done is squish
down<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.430> end<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.390> make<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.600> small<00:00:34.469> tank<00:00:34.829> and

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
down this end to make a small tank and

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.030 
down this end to make a small tank and
then<00:00:36.030> flattened<00:00:36.899> out<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.140> other<00:00:37.260> end<00:00:37.500> and

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
then flattened out the other end and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.490 
then flattened out the other end and
made<00:00:38.370> quite<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> sort<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.000> big<00:00:39.239> bulbous<00:00:39.570> blade

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
made quite a sort of a big bulbous blade

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.180 
made quite a sort of a big bulbous blade
and<00:00:41.149> then<00:00:42.149> also<00:00:42.719> what<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.020> found<00:00:43.290> was<00:00:43.649> one<00:00:44.100> of

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
and then also what I found was one of

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.010 
and then also what I found was one of
these<00:00:44.340> nibbles<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.480> don't<00:00:45.600> know<00:00:45.660> what<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.809> call

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
these nibbles I don't know what you call

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.950 
these nibbles I don't know what you call
them<00:00:46.200> all<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.039> bit<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.940> I'd<00:00:48.059> cut<00:00:48.300> off<00:00:48.510> from

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
them all and bit that I'd cut off from

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.670 
them all and bit that I'd cut off from
the<00:00:49.170> handle<00:00:49.860> again<00:00:50.399> from<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> big<00:00:51.360> knife<00:00:51.680> and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
the handle again from the big knife and

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.619 
the handle again from the big knife and
that<00:00:52.829> was<00:00:52.920> just<00:00:53.070> kicking<00:00:53.280> about<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.940> I

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
that was just kicking about and I

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.560 
that was just kicking about and I
married<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.140> two<00:00:55.170> together<00:00:55.940> and<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.390> is

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
married the two together and this is

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.500 
married the two together and this is
what<00:00:57.920> resulted<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.969> think<00:01:00.239> it's<00:01:00.359> rather

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
what resulted and I think it's rather

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.429 
what resulted and I think it's rather
cute<00:01:00.899> nice<00:01:01.530> little<00:01:01.920> thing<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:03.110> love<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.140> way

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
cute nice little thing I love the way

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.590 
cute nice little thing I love the way
that<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.890> sort<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.030> shape<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.450> blade

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
that the sort of the shape of the blade

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.120 
that the sort of the shape of the blade
in<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.930> shape<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.409> handle<00:01:07.830> sort<00:01:08.040> of

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
in the shape of the handle sort of

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.780 
in the shape of the handle sort of
complement<00:01:08.850> each<00:01:09.000> other<00:01:09.330> they<00:01:10.320> sort<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.790> flow

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
complement each other they sort of flow

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.789 
complement each other they sort of flow
from<00:01:12.180> one<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.439> the<00:01:13.439> other

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
from one to the other

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.730 
from one to the other
on<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.159> bottom<00:01:14.340> here<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:15.380> really<00:01:16.380> look<00:01:16.500> rather

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
on the bottom here I really look rather

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.230 
on the bottom here I really look rather
like<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:18.140> anyway<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.950> also<00:01:20.549> tried<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.000> do<00:01:21.210> a

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
like that anyway I also tried to do a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.609 
like that anyway I also tried to do a
bit<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.420> acid<00:01:21.750> etching<00:01:21.900> which<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.439> can

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
bit of acid etching which you can

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.700 
bit of acid etching which you can
probably<00:01:22.860> just<00:01:23.009> see<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> blade<00:01:23.960> which<00:01:24.960> was

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
probably just see on the blade which was

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.450 
probably just see on the blade which was
a<00:01:25.770> bit<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.070> fail<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:27.080> used<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.350> nail<00:01:29.040> polish

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
a bit of a fail I used the nail polish

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.660 
a bit of a fail I used the nail polish
and<00:01:30.270> hydrochloric<00:01:30.990> acid<00:01:31.470> but<00:01:32.369> for<00:01:32.520> some

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
and hydrochloric acid but for some

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.440 
and hydrochloric acid but for some
reason<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> nail<00:01:33.360> polish<00:01:33.810> actually<00:01:34.650> came<00:01:34.979> off

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
reason the nail polish actually came off

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.899 
reason the nail polish actually came off
at<00:01:36.450> some<00:01:36.750> stage<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.380> whole<00:01:37.590> sheet<00:01:38.009> which<00:01:38.700> I

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
at some stage in a whole sheet which I

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.640 
at some stage in a whole sheet which I
didn't<00:01:39.210> know<00:01:39.390> until<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.900> pulled<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> knife<00:01:40.439> out

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
didn't know until I pulled the knife out

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.960 
didn't know until I pulled the knife out
after<00:01:41.040> about<00:01:41.100> an<00:01:41.340> hour<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> half<00:01:43.970> anyway

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
after about an hour and a half anyway

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.649 
after about an hour and a half anyway
I'll<00:01:45.270> try<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.750> zoom<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.560> show<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:47.159> what

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
I'll try and zoom in and show you what

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.399 
I'll try and zoom in and show you what
the<00:01:48.659> effect<00:01:48.689> was<00:01:50.210> and<00:01:51.210> if<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.420> can<00:01:51.540> see<00:01:51.840> it

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
the effect was and if you can see it

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.429 
the effect was and if you can see it
obviously<00:01:52.680> stayed<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.130> long<00:01:53.369> enough<00:01:53.399> to

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
obviously stayed on long enough to

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.480 
obviously stayed on long enough to
define<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.680> stripes<00:01:56.009> because<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.340> can

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
define the stripes because you can

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.969 
define the stripes because you can
actually<00:01:56.640> see<00:01:57.000> them<00:01:57.270> but<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.229> wanted<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.649> really

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
actually see them but I wanted a really

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.280 
actually see them but I wanted a really
deep<00:01:59.219> etch<00:01:59.520> next<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.210> them<00:02:00.360> but<00:02:00.930> what<00:02:01.140> it's

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
deep etch next to them but what it's

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.709 
deep etch next to them but what it's
done<00:02:01.530> obviously<00:02:02.250> when<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.700> whole<00:02:02.880> lot<00:02:03.090> the

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
done obviously when the whole lot the

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.770 
done obviously when the whole lot the
acid<00:02:04.200> must<00:02:04.380> have<00:02:04.530> seeped<00:02:04.740> under<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:06.240> Polish<00:02:06.659> I

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
acid must have seeped under the Polish I

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.779 
acid must have seeped under the Polish I
know<00:02:06.869> if<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.110> because<00:02:07.229> I'd<00:02:07.500> actually<00:02:08.190> shine

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
know if it's because I'd actually shine

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.369 
know if it's because I'd actually shine
the<00:02:09.030> knife<00:02:09.179> up<00:02:09.420> too<00:02:09.629> much<00:02:09.869> or<00:02:10.080> whether<00:02:10.200> it's

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
the knife up too much or whether it's

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:10.990 
the knife up too much or whether it's
something<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.679> do<00:02:10.800> with

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
something to do with

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.110 
something to do with
steal<00:02:11.330> but<00:02:12.140> anyway<00:02:12.440> and<00:02:13.220> it's<00:02:13.460> given<00:02:13.820> almost

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
steal but anyway and it's given almost

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.810 
steal but anyway and it's given almost
like<00:02:14.300> a<00:02:14.330> Damascus<00:02:14.900> effect<00:02:15.400> it's<00:02:16.400> really

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
like a Damascus effect it's really

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.360 
like a Damascus effect it's really
really<00:02:17.120> weird<00:02:17.440> when<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.560> was<00:02:18.650> dirty<00:02:18.890> before

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
really weird when it was dirty before

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.160 
really weird when it was dirty before
I've<00:02:19.490> sort<00:02:20.090> of<00:02:20.150> polished<00:02:20.630> this<00:02:20.780> up<00:02:20.900> again

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
I've sort of polished this up again

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.280 
I've sort of polished this up again
before<00:02:21.800> I<00:02:22.040> polished<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:22.520> up<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:23.540> dirt<00:02:23.870> was<00:02:24.140> in

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
before I polished it up the dirt was in

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.710 
before I polished it up the dirt was in
the<00:02:24.380> grain<00:02:24.710> in<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.730> bits<00:02:25.940> in<00:02:26.120> between<00:02:26.150> the

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
the grain in the bits in between the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.210 
the grain in the bits in between the
stripes<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.350> it<00:02:27.440> actually<00:02:27.650> looked<00:02:27.980> rather

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
stripes and it actually looked rather

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.480 
stripes and it actually looked rather
rather<00:02:29.120> nice

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
rather nice

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.760 
rather nice
it's<00:02:31.490> weird<00:02:31.700> but<00:02:32.300> I<00:02:32.510> still<00:02:32.840> can't<00:02:33.440> figure<00:02:33.680> out

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
it's weird but I still can't figure out

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.930 
it's weird but I still can't figure out
why<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.310> polish<00:02:34.670> came<00:02:34.910> off<00:02:35.680> anyway<00:02:36.730> whilst<00:02:37.730> I

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
why that polish came off anyway whilst I

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.470 
why that polish came off anyway whilst I
was<00:02:37.970> doing<00:02:38.870> some<00:02:39.080> forging<00:02:39.470> of<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.650> scraps<00:02:39.980> I

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
was doing some forging of the scraps I

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.010 
was doing some forging of the scraps I
made<00:02:41.480> this<00:02:41.630> one<00:02:41.810> as<00:02:41.959> well<00:02:43.570> this<00:02:44.570> is<00:02:44.750> in<00:02:44.870> its

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
made this one as well this is in its

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.990 
made this one as well this is in its
very<00:02:45.140> early<00:02:45.470> stages<00:02:45.770> same<00:02:46.280> sort<00:02:46.520> of<00:02:46.550> Tang<00:02:46.760> as<00:02:46.910> I

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
very early stages same sort of Tang as I

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.420 
very early stages same sort of Tang as I
put<00:02:47.209> on<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:47.420> small<00:02:47.959> one<00:02:48.170> but<00:02:48.770> I<00:02:48.830> made<00:02:49.040> this<00:02:49.190> one

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
put on the small one but I made this one

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.360 
put on the small one but I made this one
long<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:49.760> thin<00:02:50.060> instead<00:02:50.540> of<00:02:50.690> short<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:51.739> fat

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
long and thin instead of short and fat

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.560 
long and thin instead of short and fat
and<00:02:53.030> all<00:02:53.120> I've<00:02:53.300> done<00:02:53.510> so<00:02:53.810> far<00:02:54.080> to<00:02:54.260> this<00:02:54.350> one<00:02:54.650> is

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
and all I've done so far to this one is

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.830 
and all I've done so far to this one is
forged<00:02:56.570> it<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.930> little<00:02:57.560> bit<00:02:57.739> of<00:02:57.830> flat<00:02:58.040> disc<00:02:58.840> and

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
forged it a little bit of flat disc and

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.170 
forged it a little bit of flat disc and
some<00:03:00.590> hand<00:03:00.800> filing<00:03:01.340> that's<00:03:01.610> all<00:03:01.730> I've<00:03:01.880> done<00:03:02.030> on

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
some hand filing that's all I've done on

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.320 
some hand filing that's all I've done on
here<00:03:02.330> so<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:03.290> shall<00:03:03.470> do<00:03:03.620> a<00:03:03.890> bit<00:03:04.670> more<00:03:04.820> filing

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
here so I shall do a bit more filing

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.620 
here so I shall do a bit more filing
then<00:03:05.720> probably<00:03:06.650> some<00:03:06.920> sandpaper<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:07.700> then

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
then probably some sandpaper and then

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.570 
then probably some sandpaper and then
I'm<00:03:08.810> not<00:03:08.930> sure<00:03:08.989> what<00:03:09.440> sort<00:03:09.650> of<00:03:09.680> handle<00:03:10.100> to<00:03:10.250> to

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
I'm not sure what sort of handle to to

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.690 
I'm not sure what sort of handle to to
put<00:03:10.760> on<00:03:10.880> it<00:03:11.800> obviously<00:03:12.800> gonna<00:03:13.160> heat<00:03:13.310> treat<00:03:13.550> it

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
put on it obviously gonna heat treat it

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.199 
put on it obviously gonna heat treat it
first<00:03:14.290> I've<00:03:15.290> got<00:03:15.440> some<00:03:15.650> one<00:03:15.860> but<00:03:16.310> not<00:03:16.820> a<00:03:16.850> lot

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
first I've got some one but not a lot

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.410 
first I've got some one but not a lot
and<00:03:17.450> it's<00:03:17.570> this<00:03:17.750> one's<00:03:17.989> far<00:03:18.620> too<00:03:18.860> big<00:03:19.269> so<00:03:20.269> much

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
and it's this one's far too big so much

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.440 
and it's this one's far too big so much
in<00:03:20.660> searching<00:03:21.230> but<00:03:21.380> I've<00:03:21.500> got<00:03:21.680> a<00:03:21.709> bit<00:03:21.860> of<00:03:21.890> oak

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
in searching but I've got a bit of oak
