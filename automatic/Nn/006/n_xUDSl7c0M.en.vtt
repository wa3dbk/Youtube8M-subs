00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
recommend a marine story which I think

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.449 
recommend a marine story which I think
is<00:02:25.750> one<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.019> most<00:02:26.590> brilliant<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.250> brave

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
is one of the most brilliant and brave

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.030 
is one of the most brilliant and brave
films<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.090> have<00:02:28.209> seen<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:29.230> last<00:02:29.470> year

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
films I have seen this last year

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.729 
films I have seen this last year
drea<00:02:30.580> Weber<00:02:30.849> and<00:02:31.150> then<00:02:31.300> far<00:02:31.739> completely

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
drea Weber and then far completely

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.710 
drea Weber and then far completely
rocked<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:33.130> with<00:02:33.160> that<00:02:33.400> film<00:02:33.700> it<00:02:33.970> should<00:02:34.150> be<00:02:34.299> it

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
rocked it with that film it should be it

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.870 
rocked it with that film it should be it
should<00:02:34.780> actually<00:02:35.049> be<00:02:35.290> required<00:02:36.220> viewing<00:02:36.489> I

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
should actually be required viewing I

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.410 
should actually be required viewing I
think<00:02:37.090> in<00:02:37.180> schools<00:02:37.540> we<00:02:38.500> are<00:02:38.620> huge<00:02:38.860> fans<00:02:38.890> of

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
think in schools we are huge fans of

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.000 
think in schools we are huge fans of
drea<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:40.510> Ned<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.080> that<00:02:41.260> is<00:02:41.380> one<00:02:41.500> of<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.769> most

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
drea and Ned and that is one of the most

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.350 
drea and Ned and that is one of the most
critical<00:02:42.310> films<00:02:42.519> I<00:02:42.610> think<00:02:42.640> everybody<00:02:43.150> should

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
critical films I think everybody should

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.870 
critical films I think everybody should
see<00:02:43.569> and<00:02:44.200> of<00:02:44.380> course<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:44.860> know<00:02:44.980> I<00:02:45.220> just<00:02:45.730> love

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
see and of course you know I just love

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.940 
see and of course you know I just love
any<00:02:46.209> of<00:02:46.299> the<00:02:46.480> other<00:02:46.660> films<00:02:47.019> that<00:02:47.079> the<00:02:47.769> gay<00:02:47.890> and

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
any of the other films that the gay and

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.650 
any of the other films that the gay and
lesbian<00:02:48.040> filmmaking<00:02:48.640> community<00:02:49.150> puts<00:02:49.450> out

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
lesbian filmmaking community puts out

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.250 
lesbian filmmaking community puts out
there<00:02:49.900> watch<00:02:50.470> our<00:02:50.650> stories<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.459> again<00:02:52.030> I<00:02:52.299> say

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
there watch our stories and again I say

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.600 
there watch our stories and again I say
that<00:02:53.470> there<00:02:53.650> is<00:02:53.739> so<00:02:53.860> much<00:02:53.890> more<00:02:54.130> that<00:02:54.190> connects

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
that there is so much more that connects

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.030 
that there is so much more that connects
us<00:02:54.790> then<00:02:55.209> separates<00:02:55.750> us<00:02:55.959> and<00:02:56.319> I<00:02:56.650> think<00:02:56.860> that<00:02:56.950> if

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
us then separates us and I think that if

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.259 
us then separates us and I think that if
people<00:02:57.280> just<00:02:57.459> saw<00:02:57.640> that<00:02:57.849> they<00:02:58.150> would

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
people just saw that they would

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.220 
people just saw that they would
completely<00:02:58.840> get<00:02:59.739> that<00:02:59.769> we<00:03:00.069> are<00:03:00.220> you<00:03:01.230> yes

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
completely get that we are you yes

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.120 
completely get that we are you yes
probably<00:03:03.209> some<00:03:04.209> Eastern<00:03:04.569> Europe<00:03:05.130> Asian

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
probably some Eastern Europe Asian

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.979 
probably some Eastern Europe Asian
countries<00:03:06.790> we<00:03:07.480> don't<00:03:07.510> even<00:03:07.810> have<00:03:07.959> a

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
countries we don't even have a

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.199 
countries we don't even have a
distributor<00:03:08.470> in<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.620> Asian<00:03:09.209> communities

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.629 
distributor in the Asian communities
however<00:03:10.720> there's<00:03:11.049> very<00:03:11.500> huge<00:03:11.950> game<00:03:12.310> lesbian

places<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:14.859> you<00:03:14.980> don't<00:03:15.130> even<00:03:15.280> sell<00:03:15.609> to<00:03:15.790> in

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
places that you don't even sell to in

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.599 
places that you don't even sell to in
territories<00:03:16.930> because<00:03:17.290> it's<00:03:17.859> just<00:03:18.130> it's<00:03:18.430> an

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
territories because it's just it's an

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.110 
territories because it's just it's an
it's<00:03:18.940> not<00:03:19.030> an<00:03:19.299> option<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:20.350> so<00:03:20.709> however<00:03:21.160> in

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
it's not an option and so however in

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.000 
it's not an option and so however in
every<00:03:22.329> other<00:03:22.420> part<00:03:22.690> of<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.810> world<00:03:23.010> people

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
every other part of the world people

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.400 
every other part of the world people
have<00:03:24.190> our<00:03:24.370> films<00:03:24.780> whether<00:03:25.780> their<00:03:26.019> mind<00:03:26.200> or

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
soul kiss films one of the things I

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.530 
soul kiss films one of the things I
think<00:03:28.989> that<00:03:29.410> perhaps<00:03:30.010> might<00:03:30.519> actually<00:03:31.060> help

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
think that perhaps might actually help

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.819 
think that perhaps might actually help
us<00:03:31.600> in<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.810> doors<00:03:31.989> if<00:03:32.170> dome-like<00:03:32.319> little<00:03:32.680> man
