thought he was a teammate so I'm not

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.830

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.559 
know exactly what he was trying to do
maybe<00:03:12.709> he<00:03:12.860> got<00:03:13.010> frustrated<00:03:13.220> point<00:03:14.209> is<00:03:14.330> he<00:03:14.480> was

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
maybe he got frustrated point is he was

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.089 
maybe he got frustrated point is he was
getting<00:03:14.810> shot<00:03:15.080> at<00:03:15.260> and<00:03:15.290> he<00:03:15.500> continued<00:03:15.950> to

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
getting shot at and he continued to

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.490 
getting shot at and he continued to
shoot<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.489> wall<00:03:16.700> so<00:03:17.090> who<00:03:17.690> knows<00:03:17.840> what<00:03:18.080> exactly

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
shoot the wall so who knows what exactly

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.110 
shoot the wall so who knows what exactly
was<00:03:18.650> trying<00:03:18.890> to<00:03:18.950> do<00:03:19.069> but<00:03:19.220> anyway<00:03:19.580> so<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:19.940> next

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
was trying to do but anyway so the next

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.270 
was trying to do but anyway so the next
situation<00:03:20.379> he<00:03:21.379> actually<00:03:21.530> ends<00:03:21.950> up<00:03:22.010> switching

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
situation he actually ends up switching

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.130 
situation he actually ends up switching
over<00:03:22.489> to<00:03:22.640> his<00:03:23.030> sniper<00:03:23.330> rifle<00:03:23.720> I<00:03:23.780> guess<00:03:23.959> he

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
over to his sniper rifle I guess he

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.809 
over to his sniper rifle I guess he
thought<00:03:24.319> the<00:03:24.500> lmg<00:03:24.890> wasn't<00:03:25.220> doing<00:03:25.400> enough<00:03:25.459> work

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
thought the lmg wasn't doing enough work

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.580 
thought the lmg wasn't doing enough work
for<00:03:25.849> him<00:03:26.299> but<00:03:26.780> I<00:03:26.810> think<00:03:26.959> I<00:03:27.019> can<00:03:27.049> tell<00:03:27.379> he's

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590
