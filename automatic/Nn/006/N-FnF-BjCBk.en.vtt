00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
holding my skin as they use the PMD I'm

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.160 
holding my skin as they use the PMD I'm
going<00:03:11.370> over<00:03:11.640> sections<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.240> my<00:03:12.360> face<00:03:12.630> try<00:03:12.990> not

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
going over sections of my face try not

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.960 
going over sections of my face try not
to<00:03:13.260> go<00:03:13.380> over<00:03:13.590> any<00:03:13.800> surface<00:03:14.100> of<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.520> skin<00:03:14.760> more

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
to go over any surface of the skin more

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.550 
to go over any surface of the skin more
than<00:03:15.000> twice<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.660> this<00:03:15.750> is<00:03:15.900> pretty<00:03:16.140> much<00:03:16.260> how<00:03:16.530> I

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
than twice and this is pretty much how I

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.420 
than twice and this is pretty much how I
use<00:03:16.800> it<00:03:16.830> it's<00:03:17.130> really<00:03:17.460> really<00:03:17.580> easy<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:18.210> use<00:03:18.450> so

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
use it it's really really easy to use so

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.890 
use it it's really really easy to use so
basically<00:03:20.430> what<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.790> PMD<00:03:21.210> is<00:03:21.390> doing<00:03:21.720> its

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
basically what the PMD is doing its

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.230 
basically what the PMD is doing its
removing<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.500> layer<00:03:22.770> of<00:03:23.040> dead<00:03:23.370> skin<00:03:23.580> cells<00:03:24.030> on

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
removing the layer of dead skin cells on

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.060 
removing the layer of dead skin cells on
the<00:03:24.270> surface<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:25.110> this<00:03:25.320> is<00:03:25.380> going<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.740> allow

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
the surface and this is going to allow

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.810 
the surface and this is going to allow
healthier<00:03:26.640> skin<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.090> take<00:03:27.300> its<00:03:27.510> place<00:03:28.670> so<00:03:29.670> this

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
healthier skin to take its place so this

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.640 
healthier skin to take its place so this
is<00:03:30.000> actually<00:03:30.390> a<00:03:30.420> similar<00:03:31.050> treatment<00:03:31.260> that<00:03:31.560> you
