00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:12.949 

I<00:00:10.940> think<00:00:11.940> there<00:00:12.030> was<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.179> lot<00:00:12.299> of<00:00:12.330> limitations

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:12.959 
I think there was a lot of limitations

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:14.509 
I think there was a lot of limitations
in<00:00:13.110> our<00:00:13.200> old<00:00:13.410> collision<00:00:13.830> system<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.280> was<00:00:14.339> very

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
in our old collision system it was very

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.129 
in our old collision system it was very
good<00:00:14.789> but<00:00:14.999> it<00:00:15.209> didn't<00:00:15.389> allow<00:00:15.570> us<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.780> do<00:00:15.929> some

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
good but it didn't allow us to do some

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.200 
good but it didn't allow us to do some
things<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.590> were<00:00:17.070> quite<00:00:17.400> difficult<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:18.180> a

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
things that were quite difficult so a

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.790 
things that were quite difficult so a
lot<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.420> times<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:18.810> fifa<00:00:19.110> 11<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.590> get<00:00:19.769> a

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
lot of times in fifa 11 you get a

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.620 
lot of times in fifa 11 you get a
situation<00:00:20.460> where<00:00:20.609> maybe<00:00:20.820> two<00:00:21.090> players<00:00:21.390> are

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
situation where maybe two players are

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.830 
situation where maybe two players are
running<00:00:21.960> into<00:00:22.439> one<00:00:22.980> another<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.840> because

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
running into one another and because

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.810 
running into one another and because
there's<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.590> lot<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.830> contacts<00:00:26.369> between<00:00:26.580> those

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
there's a lot of contacts between those

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.820 
there's a lot of contacts between those
two<00:00:27.000> players<00:00:27.240> with<00:00:27.929> the<00:00:28.019> old<00:00:28.170> system<00:00:28.380> we<00:00:28.679> had

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
two players with the old system we had

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.099 
two players with the old system we had
to<00:00:28.949> pick<00:00:29.160> one<00:00:29.369> contact<00:00:30.240> which<00:00:30.869> meant<00:00:31.080> that

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
to pick one contact which meant that

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.840 
to pick one contact which meant that
we'd<00:00:31.289> get<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.589> a<00:00:31.710> collision<00:00:32.250> animation<00:00:32.700> that

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
we'd get it a collision animation that

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.130 
we'd get it a collision animation that
did<00:00:32.970> a<00:00:33.030> great<00:00:33.240> job<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.510> showing<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.020> that

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
did a great job of showing you that

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.540 
did a great job of showing you that
there<00:00:34.290> was<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> collision<00:00:34.740> something<00:00:35.190> happened

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
there was a collision something happened

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.069 
there was a collision something happened
but<00:00:35.670> maybe<00:00:35.850> didn't<00:00:36.180> take<00:00:36.329> into<00:00:36.450> account<00:00:36.719> every

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
but maybe didn't take into account every

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.900 
but maybe didn't take into account every
little<00:00:37.289> detail<00:00:37.440> with<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.309> year's<00:00:38.550> engine

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
little detail with this year's engine

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.340 
little detail with this year's engine
what<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.149> see<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.600> when<00:00:39.780> those<00:00:39.930> two<00:00:40.110> players

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
what you see is when those two players

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.080 
what you see is when those two players
come<00:00:40.620> together<00:00:40.890> we're<00:00:41.129> resolving<00:00:41.670> for<00:00:41.879> every

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
come together we're resolving for every

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.750 
come together we're resolving for every
single<00:00:42.390> collision<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.870> happens<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:44.190> we're

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
single collision that happens and we're

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.420 
single collision that happens and we're
really<00:00:45.420> able<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.870> preserve<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.410> momentum<00:00:46.920> a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
really able to preserve the momentum a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.040 
really able to preserve the momentum a
lot<00:00:47.940> better<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.480> interactions<00:00:48.989> between

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
lot better in the interactions between

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.889 
lot better in the interactions between
players<00:00:49.699> this<00:00:50.699> looks<00:00:50.940> fantastic<00:00:51.420> when<00:00:51.809> you

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
players this looks fantastic when you

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.840 
players this looks fantastic when you
get<00:00:52.050> into<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.350> replay<00:00:52.710> camera<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.579> see

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
get into the replay camera and you see

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.630 
get into the replay camera and you see
all<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.530> limbs<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> parts<00:00:56.129> bending

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
all of the limbs and the parts bending

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.189 
all of the limbs and the parts bending
and<00:00:56.789> contorting<00:00:57.269> as<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.539> would<00:00:57.660> expect<00:00:57.780> them

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
and contorting as you would expect them

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.139 
and contorting as you would expect them
to<00:00:58.379> like<00:00:58.769> you<00:00:58.920> would<00:00:59.039> see<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.250> real-world<00:00:59.609> TV

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
to like you would see on real-world TV

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.479 
to like you would see on real-world TV
but<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.690> also<00:01:00.870> translates<00:01:01.379> into<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.010> telecom

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
but it also translates into the telecom

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.729 
but it also translates into the telecom
where<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.420> really<00:01:03.690> feel<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.170> difference<00:01:04.559> of

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
where you really feel the difference of

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.870 
where you really feel the difference of
the<00:01:04.920> game<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.340> really<00:01:05.640> feel<00:01:05.850> about

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the game and you really feel about

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.780 
the game and you really feel about
preservation<00:01:06.300> of<00:01:06.720> momentum<00:01:07.369> another<00:01:08.369> benefit

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
preservation of momentum another benefit

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.760 
preservation of momentum another benefit
that<00:01:08.820> we<00:01:08.939> get<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.479> we<00:01:10.140> resolve<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.560> lot<00:01:10.680> about

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
that we get is we resolve a lot about

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.340 
that we get is we resolve a lot about
clipping<00:01:11.369> issues<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.000> game<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.360> year<00:01:12.420> in

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
clipping issues in the game this year in

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.870 
clipping issues in the game this year in
last<00:01:13.890> year<00:01:14.100> system<00:01:14.460> we<00:01:14.549> didn't<00:01:14.759> actually

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
last year system we didn't actually

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.520 
last year system we didn't actually
account<00:01:15.240> for<00:01:15.360> arm<00:01:15.600> collisions<00:01:16.020> at<00:01:16.140> all<00:01:16.290> and

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
account for arm collisions at all and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.830 
account for arm collisions at all and
you<00:01:16.860> couldn't<00:01:17.070> really<00:01:17.400> tell<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.330> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
you couldn't really tell in in the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.749 
you couldn't really tell in in the
telecom<00:01:19.259> but<00:01:19.439> if<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.619> wanted<00:01:19.829> to<00:01:19.920> replay<00:01:20.310> you

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
telecom but if you wanted to replay you

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.480 
telecom but if you wanted to replay you
would<00:01:20.970> notice<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:22.259> arms<00:01:22.890> could<00:01:23.070> sometimes

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
would notice that arms could sometimes

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.010 
would notice that arms could sometimes
clip<00:01:23.759> through<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> shoulder<00:01:24.479> or<00:01:24.509> click<00:01:24.840> through

shielding you get more of a tussle

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.819 
shielding you get more of a tussle
between<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.899> players<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.409> fight<00:01:46.619> for

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.550 
possession that feels more realistic
feels<00:01:48.540> like<00:01:48.750> things<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.170> might<00:01:49.290> see<00:01:49.530> on

TV to illustrate the point about the
variety<00:01:52.439> we<00:01:52.920> get<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.250> want<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.490> talk<00:01:53.610> about

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
variety we get I want to talk about

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.730 
variety we get I want to talk about
contextual<00:01:54.329> dribble<00:01:54.750> terms<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.200> what<00:01:55.619> this

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
contextual dribble terms and what this

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.160 
contextual dribble terms and what this
is<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:55.979> using<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.850> left<00:01:57.060> stick<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.990> could

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
is is using the left stick you could

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.810 
is is using the left stick you could
beat<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> player<00:01:58.619> last<00:01:58.890> year<00:01:59.040> by<00:01:59.250> maybe<00:01:59.460> taking

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
beat a player last year by maybe taking

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.350 
beat a player last year by maybe taking
just<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.090> 45-degree<00:02:00.750> dribble<00:02:01.079> turn<00:02:01.259> but

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
just a 45-degree dribble turn but

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.340 
just a 45-degree dribble turn but
sometimes<00:02:03.360> when<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.570> do<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.960> maybe<00:02:04.140> you'd

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
sometimes when you do that maybe you'd

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.630 
sometimes when you do that maybe you'd
knock<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.619> ball<00:02:04.770> by<00:02:04.979> him<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.399> player

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
knock the ball by him and that player

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.190 
knock the ball by him and that player
would<00:02:05.850> stick<00:02:06.060> out<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.210> leg<00:02:06.450> trying<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.960> tackle

he sticks out a leg to tackle and the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.590 
he sticks out a leg to tackle and the
dribble<00:02:26.670> tries<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:26.970> jump<00:02:27.210> out<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.450> way<00:02:27.540> but

dribble tries to jump out of the way but

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.170 
dribble tries to jump out of the way but

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
tackle and the way that his legs bend

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.150 
tackle and the way that his legs bend
because<00:02:33.780> he's<00:02:33.900> been<00:02:34.050> caught<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.590> creates

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
because he's been caught it creates

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.650 
because he's been caught it creates
another<00:02:35.430> level<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:35.820> variety<00:02:36.240> that<00:02:36.360> we<00:02:36.420> just

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
another level of variety that we just

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.110 
another level of variety that we just
wouldn't<00:02:36.870> have<00:02:36.959> had<00:02:37.050> in<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.260> game<00:02:37.470> last<00:02:37.680> year

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
wouldn't have had in the game last year

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.330 
wouldn't have had in the game last year
further<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.330> that<00:02:39.530> what<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:40.620> can<00:02:40.740> see<00:02:40.770> sup<00:02:41.130> now

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
further to that what you can see sup now

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.820 
further to that what you can see sup now
is<00:02:41.580> sometimes<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.180> dribbler<00:02:42.450> will<00:02:42.840> knock<00:02:43.680> the

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
is sometimes a dribbler will knock the

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.140 
is sometimes a dribbler will knock the
ball<00:02:43.950> by<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.160> defender<00:02:44.490> using<00:02:44.880> one<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.030> these

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
dribble turns jump out of the way and

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.560 
dribble turns jump out of the way and
gets<00:02:46.890> caught<00:02:47.100> but<00:02:47.490> just<00:02:47.700> slightly<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.480> he

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
gets caught but just slightly so he

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.390 
gets caught but just slightly so he
takes<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.840> small<00:02:48.989> knock<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.650> what<00:02:50.070> you<00:02:50.160> get<00:02:50.340> is

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
takes a small knock and what you get is

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.070 
takes a small knock and what you get is
a<00:02:50.550> little<00:02:50.790> bit<00:02:50.910> more<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.150> resilience<00:02:51.810> from<00:02:51.989> the

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
a little bit more of resilience from the

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.540 
a little bit more of resilience from the
player<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.440> take<00:02:52.590> those<00:02:52.800> small<00:02:53.100> knocks<00:02:53.370> and

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
player to take those small knocks and

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.520 
player to take those small knocks and
able<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.120> continue<00:02:54.570> on<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:54.959> go<00:02:55.080> after<00:02:55.260> the

able to continue on and go after the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.860 
able to continue on and go after the
ball<00:02:55.709> now<00:02:56.310> players<00:02:56.640> like<00:02:56.850> Messi<00:02:57.209> can<00:02:57.450> skip

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
ball now players like Messi can skip

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.180 
ball now players like Messi can skip
through<00:02:58.080> those<00:02:58.230> challenge<00:02:58.650> take<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:58.890> knock

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
through those challenge take a knock

and continue the flow of the game and it

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.570
