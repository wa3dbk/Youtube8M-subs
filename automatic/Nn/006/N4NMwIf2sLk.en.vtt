 finally making started nice and good 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.240
 from the start, but it does 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.890

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.750
 something about heckers but I myself about it 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.940
 to tell 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.319
 I just wanted to talk about the 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.510
 last 8 days again 

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:37.179
 yes the last few days I have a lot 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.710
 after a bit of football i got a whole sunday 

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:41.140
 built football day so I have 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.460
 little time stage worked at noon 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.129
 I do notice that I have less and less time 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.260
 have to play and make videos 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.789
 everything at least 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.979
 red the master is fun to do but 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.809
 I take it as you know sometimes 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:53.620
 like on two at the same time to so or three 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.030
 at the same time 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.769
 that saves time for me because I have 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.940
 usually tuesday i have time to get up 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.129

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.259
 Monday afternoon it is all possible then 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.829
 I only just have half an hour or so 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.240
 so 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:08.799

 all must be done on everything 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.369
 so I have a lot of reports to make 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:17.409
 might be that i 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.450

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:37.299

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.320
 that's going to be 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.030
 but that is all good 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.320
 command it operates and I am still 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.359
 not because it just comes after all 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.359

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:50.469
