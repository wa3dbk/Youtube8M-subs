00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 show you how to knit cruciform 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:08.490
 columns to get started doing the first 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.769
 loop loop I type 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:19.770
 air loops and dial 10 air 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:23.130
 loops 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.840
 this chain with 10 air loops 3 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.630
 lifting loops and I will knit 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.180
 in the second loop of the dial chain i.e. 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.700
 does not count 3 loops of lifting then the first 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.380
 the chain is the first loop of the dial chain and 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.309
 the second loop here in it I will 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.730
 knit 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.879
 doing two nakida go to this loop in 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.969
 which I am now capturing 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.760
 working thread that way on my 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.489
 the hook turns 4 loops grab 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.870
 working thread and knit the first 2 loops 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:02.520
 I have three loops on the hook 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:05.580
 next I do a cape and and we do not go to 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.750
 the next loop here is not the next but through 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.750
 1 loop we are from here 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.040
 I grabbed a working thread on my hook 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.380
 5 loops are obtained 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.100
 grabbing a working thread and tying 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.299
 first 2 loops 4 loops left 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.280
 I grab a working thread 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.970
 the next two loops on my hook 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.890
 three loops remain once more working thread 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.210
 I knit 2 loops and once again work 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:39.060
 thread and knit the last two loops 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.460
 air loop and now do a cape and 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.520
 paying attention instead of connecting these 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.590
 halves about the bottom of the bars i 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.590
 Now insert the hook in this way 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:56.100
 I grabbed a working thread on my hook 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.399
 it turns out 3 loops captured workers 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.259
 thread and knit 2 loops and 2 loops it 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.100
 I got one cruciform 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:09.319
 column further do two nakida in 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.629
 next loop of the dial-up row I'm going 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.100
 grabbing a working thread pull the loop 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.290
 on 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.630
 I handle four loops grab 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.450
 I knit the working thread 1 2 loops 3 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.400
 loop left doing a cape and not 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.220
 next loop and after 1 loop 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.930
 the grounds 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.570
 grabbing a working thread and pulling 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.180
 I grab the noose working thread 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.550
 the first 2 loops then working again 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.130
 thread the next 2 loops once again working 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.280
 thread two more peaks and workers 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.820
 I knit the last two loops of the air 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.870
 a loop 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:49.630
 do a cape and instead of connecting two but 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:52.550
 columns I knit another loop 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:56.600
 then I knit the working thread two loops 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:00.470
 and 2 loops it is 2 and the cross-shaped column 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:04.820
 Now make two more and next sc 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:08.270
 loop food typesetting series provyazyvayu 2 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:11.720
 loop 3 loop on the hook remains do 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:17.120
 cover up and not following loop but in one 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:20.060
 loop I go again grab the worker thread 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.710
 and pull and like a loop on the hook 5 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.000
 loops and grab the worker thread and 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.060
 I knit 2 loops 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.580
 Once again, I knit 2 loops with a working thread 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.850
 one more working thread two loops and 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.420
 the remaining two such further air 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.270
 a loop 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:39.140
 do a cape and instead of connecting two 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.630
 I enter the crochet hooks and fasten 2 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.750
 loops and 2 loops is another 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:48.200
 cruciform column further do two 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.090
 nakida and put it in the last loop 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.080
 will be edge me 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:58.880
 column with two naquids 2 loops 2 loops 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:04.090
 and 2 loops this is the first row 2 from doing 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:08.240
 four lifting loops unfolding work 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.830
 I do two nakida and further into the next 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.230
 loop previous row 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.710
 I insert the hook grab the working thread 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.299
 pull the loop on the hook 4 loops 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.910
 grabbing a working thread I knit two 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.610
 loop on the hook left 3 loops again 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.660
 grabbing a working thread and enter the hook 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:30.629
 not the next loop but one 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:34.139
 I knit 2 loops from five then two more 

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:38.220
 loops two more loops and two more loops 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:40.440
 then I do an air loop nape instead 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.680
 connect two columns 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.590
 grabbing a working thread on hooks 3 peak 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:50.300
 I knit 2 loops and 2 loops this one 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.789
 cross-shaped column 2 row 2 nakida 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.919
 I go on to the next loop 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:58.530
 working thread and pull the loop on 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:01.830
 hook 4 loops grab working thread 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.630
 of them I knit 1 2 3 loops on the hook 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.210
 remain doing a cape 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.680
 I again pass one loop through one 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.440
 loop I'm coming 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.050
 Well, as if in this loop I capture the worker 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.569
 thread pull loop on the hook 5 loops 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:19.409
 workers thread and knit 2 loops 2 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:22.830
 loops 2 loops and 2 loops do air 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:25.440
 nakid loop instead of connecting two 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.229
 columns grabbing the working thread 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.389
 I pull the loop further on the hook 3 loops 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.990
 knit a working thread two loops and 2 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:36.210
 loops 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:40.020
 this is the second column cruciform with 3 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:44.370
 column do two nakida and spirit loop 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.360
 I seize the working thread 2 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.889
 first loops 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.240
 I do a nakid through 1 basis loop 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:55.080
 I knit another loop 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.419
 further knit 2 loops 2 loops 2 loops 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.000
 and 2 loops 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:02.819
 air loop do a cape again instead 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.919
 connections of two columns I capture 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:08.430
 hook thread 3 loops 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:11.759
 I get 2 loops and 2 loops 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:15.900
 Further I do two nakida and edge 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:20.360
 double crochet 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:23.729
 fourth of aerial lift loops 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:27.360
 in the usual way further knit 4 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:30.139
 lifting loops unfolding work and all 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.139
 repeat
