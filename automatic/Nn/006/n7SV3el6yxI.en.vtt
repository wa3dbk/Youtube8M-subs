00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.600 
laminated it's time to make the handles
so<00:02:32.700> it's<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.820> fabric<00:02:34.239> that<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.840> handles<00:02:35.290> is

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
so it's the fabric that the handles is

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.750 
so it's the fabric that the handles is
being<00:02:36.610> made<00:02:36.850> up<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.890> cutsies<00:02:39.280> in<00:02:39.459> two<00:02:39.610> and

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
being made up and the cutsies in two and

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.080 
being made up and the cutsies in two and
a<00:02:39.790> half<00:02:39.970> inch<00:02:40.239> strips<00:02:40.739> with<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:42.010> fabrics<00:02:42.430> and

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
a half inch strips with the fabrics and

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.930 
a half inch strips with the fabrics and
has<00:02:43.690> it<00:02:43.840> well<00:02:44.230> that<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.250> bought<00:02:45.520> when<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:45.730> bought

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
has it well that I bought when I bought

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.570 
has it well that I bought when I bought
the<00:02:46.090> vinyl<00:02:46.480> that<00:02:46.770> has<00:02:47.770> enough<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.190> do<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:48.430> to

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
the vinyl that has enough to do this to

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.220 
the vinyl that has enough to do this to
handle<00:02:49.090> so<00:02:49.300> it<00:02:49.450> was<00:02:49.600> just<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:49.870> matter<00:02:50.050> of

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
handle so it was just a matter of

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.280 
handle so it was just a matter of
pressing<00:02:50.860> in<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.250> quarter<00:02:51.550> inch<00:02:51.700> on<00:02:51.850> each<00:02:51.970> side

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
pressing in a quarter inch on each side

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.040 
pressing in a quarter inch on each side
and<00:02:53.290> then<00:02:53.380> solving<00:02:53.890> this<00:02:54.010> over<00:02:54.570> I'll<00:02:55.570> be<00:02:55.840> top

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
and then solving this over I'll be top

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.380 
and then solving this over I'll be top
stitching<00:02:56.530> this<00:02:58.739> this<00:02:59.739> handle<00:03:00.190> is<00:03:00.640> pressed

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
stitching this this handle is pressed

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.030 
stitching this this handle is pressed
and<00:03:01.780> ready<00:03:02.080> to<00:03:02.350> sew<00:03:02.730> so<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:04.060> sewing<00:03:04.390> along

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
and ready to sew so the sewing along

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.650 
and ready to sew so the sewing along
that<00:03:06.040> edge<00:03:06.250> with<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.700> two<00:03:06.850> folded<00:03:07.209> edges<00:03:07.360> are

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
that edge with the two folded edges are

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.240 
that edge with the two folded edges are
probably<00:03:08.110> assumed<00:03:08.380> in<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.590> middle<00:03:08.860> of<00:03:09.160> the

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
probably assumed in the middle of the

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.160 
probably assumed in the middle of the
scene<00:03:09.489> over<00:03:10.000> here<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:11.530> this<00:03:12.100> is<00:03:12.489> done<00:03:13.360> anybody

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
scene over here and this is done anybody

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.340 
scene over here and this is done anybody
put<00:03:14.799> on<00:03:14.950> when<00:03:15.130> I<00:03:15.220> get<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.459> that<00:03:15.610> step<00:03:16.350> first

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
put on when I get to that step first

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.940 
put on when I get to that step first
craft<00:03:17.590> is<00:03:17.769> done<00:03:18.480> I<00:03:19.480> did<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.230> little<00:03:20.650> stretching

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
craft is done I did a little stretching

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.830 
craft is done I did a little stretching
on<00:03:21.160> each<00:03:21.340> edge<00:03:21.580> and<00:03:21.910> one<00:03:22.239> down<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.570> middle

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
on each edge and one down the middle

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.830 
on each edge and one down the middle
I<00:03:23.400> think<00:03:24.400> that'll<00:03:24.670> help<00:03:24.970> me<00:03:25.150> reinforce<00:03:25.480> it

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
I think that'll help me reinforce it

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.750 
I think that'll help me reinforce it
enough<00:03:27.090> one<00:03:28.090> down<00:03:28.330> one<00:03:28.600> to<00:03:28.630> go
