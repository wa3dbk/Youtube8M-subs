00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.570
 asked myself means somehow once the goal 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:13.969
 make yourself 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:17.540
 124 mercedes to the new scale 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.540
 instead of the original 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:29.160
 make yourself glowing 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:35.570
 I mean, before he thought new 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:41.809
 everything turned out to be difficult not so refused 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:49.170
 for this paper was purchased light 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:52.260
 Well, I took a piece of A4 paper with 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:57.530
 contact strip touching the option there 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.530
 I chose a lot of white glow 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:10.369
 a film was purchased accordingly 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.590
 Transparent film for printing under 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:16.789
 Printer 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:22.939
 fill it up like this and there 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:26.770
 she transparently taught accordingly 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.770
 should show here 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:33.649
 special when printing for a printer 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:40.640
 I have a very handy thing in particular 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:43.460
 Here is such a general light that a lot 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:48.940
 good pretty universally apply 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.679
 I can go anywhere here 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.959
 blanks 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:58.009
 but it made no photoshop so I three 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:02:00.049
 hours not clear edges turned out there you can see 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.409
 that they are treads checks therefore it was 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.710
 decided to master the tool which 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:12.410
 called choir 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:15.560
 This is the next version of it 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.270
 performed on thin 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.420
 Well, as in advertising agencies 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:24.170
 use protective like that plexiglass 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.270
 Here on this basis pasted on plenochku 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.120
 sealed 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:33.739
 one to one template 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:36.459
 also absolutely transparent this one 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.769
 latest version 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.510
 Of course there are plans to remake under 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:45.130
 kuru 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.130
 normal quality this one 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.330
 Now I will show how it will look 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.580
 how will they look on the knoll 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.830
 show because it is not collected yet 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.510
 but I can show you how it will be 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.910
 look while on the desktop 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.519
 the form of the workpiece which I plan 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.860
 soon 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.569
 put on purpose instrument itself 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.650
 panel 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.310
 correspondingly low which showed 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:17.019
 filmed 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:20.959
 car looks like this 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:26.530
 power cam acquired through 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.530
 internet have light paper 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:38.540
 cut in the stomach of this paper 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:52.019
 they cut out just about the original 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:52.799
 the size of the original indicators like this 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.260
 they look like 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:59.010
 printed already the butt last which 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:03.230
 they seemed true pasted on 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:06.090
 I took the glass in this case 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.819
 scattering under the spoon here's the screen 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.530
 laptop from old it already sound on 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.110
 Russia weiss up and respectively 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.970
 amplify a little bit of light because 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.900
 that the goal is still not quite 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:21.389
 transparency and brightness falls plenochku fish 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.780
 a little bit compensates the whole bunch 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.810
 leaves the backlight on 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.810
 initial level 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:36.360
 Now I will demonstrate how it all 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:38.039
 lit is a threesome method done 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.880
 small for what could be 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:44.990
 connect all three at once now 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.990
 I suspect that I was centered 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.720
 leashes 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.400
 as we here 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.259
 it's everywhere 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.259
 this 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:12.110
 it's here 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:15.310
 in the general off state it will be 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.310
 look like this 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.850
 that's how it looks included 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.800
 that's how it will look without light 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:42.290
 accordingly you are turned on and 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.750
 still need to do either interest paint 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.500
 so that the arrows either glow in 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.780
 ultraviolet 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.780
 either respectively with such schools 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.790
 you can make quite glowing 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.460
 arrows and write off the back left 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.140
 bigger circles so they 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:00.950
 accordingly were like emitters under 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:02.210
 arrows due to the white glow can 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.170
 tint arrows 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.000
 neat in any color 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:08.140
 demonstrate cant go dreams and 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.140
 I did not deal with arrows yet 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.010
 Well, something like this 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.980
 generally happened 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:55.439
 as if the light made the movie it will be 

00:06:51.659 --> 00:07:00.000
 accordingly, when there is a scale I will 

00:06:55.439 --> 00:07:00.000
 put right here 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:12.240
 well, how about it will be 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.240
 look like this 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:25.050
 I thought it should turn out well thanks 

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:25.050
 for all the attention, wait for the new video
