here's<00:00:02.520> how<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.730> do<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:02.970> reversible<00:00:03.929> cable<00:00:05.060> you

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
here's how to do a reversible cable you

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.849 
here's how to do a reversible cable you
can<00:00:06.240> see<00:00:06.359> that<00:00:06.509> this<00:00:06.690> is<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:06.960> four<00:00:07.319> stitch<00:00:07.620> cable

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
can see that this is a four stitch cable

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.570 
can see that this is a four stitch cable
to<00:00:08.820> knit<00:00:09.030> stitches<00:00:09.240> twist<00:00:10.019> over<00:00:10.400> to<00:00:11.400> other

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
to knit stitches twist over to other

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.400 
to knit stitches twist over to other
knit<00:00:11.820> stitches<00:00:12.059> but<00:00:12.660> let's<00:00:12.809> look<00:00:12.929> at<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.139> back

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.560 

we've<00:00:16.410> got<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.650> same<00:00:16.770> thing<00:00:17.150> it's<00:00:18.150> completely

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
we've got the same thing it's completely

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.689 
we've got the same thing it's completely
reversible<00:00:18.990> oh<00:00:19.260> my<00:00:19.740> gosh<00:00:19.920> that's<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:20.189> cool<00:00:20.460> but

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
reversible oh my gosh that's so cool but

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.880 
reversible oh my gosh that's so cool but
it's<00:00:20.850> really<00:00:21.029> easy<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.439> so<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.650> trick<00:00:22.859> to

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
it's really easy to so the trick to

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.340 
it's really easy to so the trick to
doing<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.400> reversible<00:00:23.880> cable<00:00:24.330> which<00:00:24.869> whether

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
doing a reversible cable which whether

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.570 
doing a reversible cable which whether
it<00:00:25.529> looks<00:00:25.650> really<00:00:25.949> nice<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.340> could<00:00:26.460> do<00:00:26.550> a

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
it looks really nice you could do a

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.269 
it looks really nice you could do a
giant<00:00:27.090> one<00:00:27.240> as<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> scarf<00:00:27.840> or<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.650> do<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:29.160> can

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
giant one as a scarf or you do you can

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.490 
giant one as a scarf or you do you can
do<00:00:29.369> cables<00:00:29.730> like<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.179> scarf<00:00:30.599> the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
do cables like this on a scarf the

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.889 
do cables like this on a scarf the
secret<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.850> rib<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.600> swatch

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
secret is that this is rib this swatch

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.100 
secret is that this is rib this swatch
is<00:00:34.110> ripped<00:00:34.440> right<00:00:34.739> here<00:00:35.660> you<00:00:36.660> can<00:00:36.809> see<00:00:36.989> that

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
is ripped right here you can see that

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.510 
is ripped right here you can see that
I'm<00:00:37.200> alternating<00:00:37.559> here<00:00:37.890> between<00:00:38.010> knit<00:00:38.370> and

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
I'm alternating here between knit and

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.209 
I'm alternating here between knit and
purl<00:00:38.579> stitches<00:00:39.059> knit<00:00:39.870> purl<00:00:40.559> knit<00:00:40.680> purl<00:00:40.920> knit

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
purl stitches knit purl knit purl knit

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.880 
purl stitches knit purl knit purl knit
purl<00:00:41.480> all<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.719> way<00:00:42.780> down<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.230> swatch<00:00:43.530> and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
purl all the way down in this swatch and

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.459 
purl all the way down in this swatch and
ribbing<00:00:44.879> just<00:00:45.270> happens<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.780> sort<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.140> tighten

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
ribbing just happens to sort of tighten

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.680 
ribbing just happens to sort of tighten
up<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.770> only<00:00:46.980> display<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:48.149> knit<00:00:48.390> stitches

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
up and only display the knit stitches

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.369 
up and only display the knit stitches
and<00:00:49.399> so<00:00:50.399> because<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:51.110> there<00:00:52.110> are<00:00:52.140> knit

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
and so because of that there are knit

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.260 
and so because of that there are knit
stitches<00:00:52.590> on<00:00:52.800> both<00:00:52.949> sides<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.640> Pro<00:00:54.000> stitches

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
stitches on both sides and Pro stitches

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.310 
stitches on both sides and Pro stitches
know<00:00:54.360> there's<00:00:54.539> ribbing<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:54.870> both<00:00:55.050> sides

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
know there's ribbing on both sides

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.720 
know there's ribbing on both sides
basically<00:00:55.620> because<00:00:55.890> ribbing<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.250> reversible

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
basically because ribbing is reversible

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.770 
basically because ribbing is reversible
and<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.690> cable<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.170> reversible<00:00:58.739> as<00:00:58.980> well

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
and so the cable is reversible as well

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.180 
and so the cable is reversible as well
and<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:01.079> can<00:01:01.109> do<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.469> with<00:01:01.620> any<00:01:01.770> number<00:01:02.160> of

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
and you can do this with any number of

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.979 
and you can do this with any number of
stitches<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.730> decided<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.270> do<00:01:03.390> with<00:01:03.750> eight

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
stitches I decided to do with eight

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.929 
stitches I decided to do with eight
stitches<00:01:06.710> these<00:01:07.710> four<00:01:08.159> are<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.700> ones<00:01:08.850> that

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
stitches these four are the ones that

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.149 
stitches these four are the ones that
cross<00:01:09.180> over<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.869> these<00:01:10.619> four<00:01:10.860> are<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.979> ones

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
cross over and these four are the ones

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.270 
cross over and these four are the ones
that<00:01:11.310> go<00:01:11.430> behind<00:01:12.380> so<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.619> wider<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.070> do<00:01:14.189> it

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
that go behind so the wider you do it

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.460 
that go behind so the wider you do it
the<00:01:14.340> more<00:01:14.369> difficult<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:15.060> going<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.270> be<00:01:15.470> but

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
the more difficult it's going to be but

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.469 
the more difficult it's going to be but
um<00:01:16.680> let's<00:01:17.310> go<00:01:17.520> ahead<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.970> I'm<00:01:18.210> going<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.360> show

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
um let's go ahead and I'm going to show

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.050 
um let's go ahead and I'm going to show
you<00:01:18.509> how<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.689> do<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.400> cast<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.640> let's<00:01:20.939> see

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
you how to do it so cast on let's see

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.490 
you how to do it so cast on let's see
how<00:01:21.180> many<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.570> have<00:01:21.720> let's<00:01:21.900> count<00:01:22.110> by<00:01:22.259> five

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
how many do I have let's count by five

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.840 
how many do I have let's count by five
so<00:01:22.770> it's<00:01:22.920> fast<00:01:23.509> five<00:01:24.830> ten<00:01:25.830> fourteen<00:01:26.610> stitches

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
so it's fast five ten fourteen stitches

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.030 
so it's fast five ten fourteen stitches
right<00:01:29.030> I<00:01:30.030> have<00:01:30.780> fourteen<00:01:31.200> stitches<00:01:31.409> casted<00:01:31.920> on

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
right I have fourteen stitches casted on

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.920 
right I have fourteen stitches casted on
go<00:01:32.460> ahead<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.729> work<00:01:32.880> as<00:01:33.119> much<00:01:33.390> as<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.570> want<00:01:33.810> in

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
go ahead and work as much as you want in

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.319 
go ahead and work as much as you want in
ribbing<00:01:34.290> at<00:01:34.409> least<00:01:34.650> about<00:01:34.860> four<00:01:35.159> rows<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.640> knit

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
ribbing at least about four rows of knit

ribbing at least about four rows of knit
one<00:01:36.600> purl<00:01:37.259> one<00:01:37.290> ribbing<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.979> then<00:01:38.939> we're

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
one purl one ribbing and then we're

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.310 
one purl one ribbing and then we're
going<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.299> we're<00:01:39.689> going<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.869> cross<00:01:40.110> these

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
going to we're going to cross these

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.690 
going to we're going to cross these
stitches<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.220> going<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.400> lean<00:01:41.549> to

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
stitches like that it's going to lean to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.120 
stitches like that it's going to lean to
the<00:01:41.790> right<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.890> this<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.009> what

we're going to do we're going to work in
ribbing<00:01:46.409> up<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.770> cable<00:01:47.540> knit<00:01:48.540> one<00:01:49.399> purl

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
ribbing up to the cable knit one purl

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.770 
ribbing up to the cable knit one purl
one<00:01:50.509> like<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:52.130> alright<00:01:53.390> now<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:54.570> time<00:01:54.750> to

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.170 
what'd I tell you
let's<00:03:56.900> see<00:03:57.079> mmm<00:03:57.829> we<00:03:58.549> do<00:03:58.669> that<00:03:58.790> one<00:03:58.910> already

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
let's see mmm we do that one already

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.390 
let's see mmm we do that one already
yes<00:03:59.840> we<00:03:59.989> did<00:04:00.139> okay<00:04:00.790> saved<00:04:01.790> it<00:04:03.129> okay<00:04:04.129> that<00:04:04.280> was<00:04:04.370> a

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
yes we did okay saved it okay that was a

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.780 
yes we did okay saved it okay that was a
knit<00:04:04.609> stitch<00:04:04.870> right<00:04:05.870> there<00:04:06.280> how<00:04:07.280> as<00:04:07.489> I<00:04:07.609> was

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
knit stitch right there how as I was

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.150 
knit stitch right there how as I was
saying<00:04:08.090> this<00:04:09.049> is<00:04:09.200> going<00:04:09.470> to<00:04:09.590> be<00:04:09.709> a<00:04:09.739> little<00:04:10.040> bit

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
saying this is going to be a little bit

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.000 
saying this is going to be a little bit
tight<00:04:10.459> because<00:04:10.819> we<00:04:10.970> did<00:04:11.150> just<00:04:11.389> cross<00:04:12.169> four

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
tight because we did just cross four

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.309 
tight because we did just cross four
stitches<00:04:13.280> over<00:04:13.609> four<00:04:13.849> other<00:04:14.000> stitches<00:04:14.299> so<00:04:14.629> if

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
stitches over four other stitches so if

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.020 
stitches over four other stitches so if
you<00:04:15.440> think<00:04:15.620> about<00:04:15.799> in<00:04:15.949> regular<00:04:16.310> cabling<00:04:16.760> terms

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
you think about in regular cabling terms

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.479 
you think about in regular cabling terms
that's<00:04:17.239> like<00:04:17.359> an<00:04:17.479> eighth<00:04:17.690> stitch<00:04:17.989> cable<00:04:18.489> so

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
that's like an eighth stitch cable so

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.909 
that's like an eighth stitch cable so
it's<00:04:20.060> not<00:04:20.209> small<00:04:20.720> so<00:04:21.229> that<00:04:21.380> part<00:04:21.650> there<00:04:21.889> is

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
it's not small so that part there is

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.860 
it's not small so that part there is
going<00:04:22.130> to<00:04:22.190> be<00:04:22.250> a<00:04:22.280> little<00:04:22.460> bit<00:04:22.610> of<00:04:22.700> a<00:04:22.820> of<00:04:23.360> a<00:04:23.539> jam

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
going to be a little bit of a of a jam

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.490 
going to be a little bit of a of a jam
until<00:04:24.169> we<00:04:24.440> work<00:04:24.650> a<00:04:24.800> few<00:04:24.979> more<00:04:25.039> rows

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.970 

all<00:04:28.400> right<00:04:28.580> let's<00:04:28.850> now<00:04:29.600> work<00:04:29.930> about<00:04:30.260> four<00:04:30.740> more

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
all right let's now work about four more

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.310 
all right let's now work about four more
rows<00:04:31.190> in<00:04:31.460> ribbing<00:04:31.880> and<00:04:32.090> see<00:04:32.810> how<00:04:32.930> it<00:04:33.110> looks

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
rows in ribbing and see how it looks

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.890 
rows in ribbing and see how it looks
right

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
right

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.850 
right
there's<00:04:35.900> our<00:04:36.080> cross<00:04:36.350> that's<00:04:36.500> starting<00:04:36.770> to

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
there's our cross that's starting to

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.800 
there's our cross that's starting to
look<00:04:36.950> really<00:04:37.190> nice<00:04:37.340> but<00:04:37.670> the<00:04:38.210> more<00:04:38.390> we<00:04:38.510> work<00:04:38.660> in

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
look really nice but the more we work in

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.490 
look really nice but the more we work in
ribbing<00:04:39.050> the<00:04:39.080> better<00:04:39.290> it's<00:04:39.470> going<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:39.710> look<00:04:41.500> so

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
ribbing the better it's going to look so

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.690 
ribbing the better it's going to look so
work<00:04:42.740> some<00:04:42.920> more<00:04:43.070> rows<00:04:43.220> and<00:04:43.400> I'll<00:04:43.460> meet<00:04:43.580> you

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
work some more rows and I'll meet you

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.210 
work some more rows and I'll meet you
back<00:04:43.820> here<00:04:47.140> here's<00:04:48.140> how<00:04:48.290> our<00:04:48.320> swatch<00:04:48.770> looks

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
back here here's how our swatch looks

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.240 
back here here's how our swatch looks
with<00:04:50.030> four<00:04:50.480> more<00:04:50.750> rows<00:04:50.960> of<00:04:51.230> ribbing<00:04:51.590> you<00:04:52.100> can

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
with four more rows of ribbing you can

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.650 
with four more rows of ribbing you can
see<00:04:52.400> that<00:04:52.550> cable<00:04:52.940> is<00:04:53.030> really<00:04:53.240> starting<00:04:53.540> to

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
see that cable is really starting to

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.960 
see that cable is really starting to
stand<00:04:53.870> out<00:04:54.190> beautifully<00:04:55.190> and<00:04:56.890> reversibly

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
stand out beautifully and reversibly

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.340 
stand out beautifully and reversibly
completely<00:04:58.970> reversible<00:04:59.330> how<00:04:59.720> awesome<00:05:00.260> is

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
completely reversible how awesome is

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.200 
completely reversible how awesome is
that<00:05:02.230> so<00:05:03.230> just<00:05:03.260> keep<00:05:03.560> going<00:05:03.770> this<00:05:04.070> sum<00:05:04.370> this

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
that so just keep going this sum this

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.600 
that so just keep going this sum this
eight<00:05:06.200> stitch<00:05:06.620> cable<00:05:06.950> I<00:05:07.400> like<00:05:07.940> to<00:05:08.180> do<00:05:08.410> six

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
eight stitch cable I like to do six

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.820 
eight stitch cable I like to do six
plain<00:05:10.610> rows<00:05:10.880> three<00:05:11.840> knit<00:05:12.080> rows<00:05:12.260> and<00:05:12.470> three<00:05:12.620> Pro

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
plain rows three knit rows and three Pro

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.180 
plain rows three knit rows and three Pro
rows<00:05:13.010> before<00:05:13.220> I<00:05:13.460> cable<00:05:13.970> again<00:05:14.470> so<00:05:15.470> let's<00:05:16.010> see

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
rows before I cable again so let's see

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.390 
rows before I cable again so let's see
if<00:05:16.280> where<00:05:16.640> was<00:05:16.760> the<00:05:16.850> cable<00:05:17.180> row<00:05:17.270> I<00:05:17.330> bet<00:05:17.630> it<00:05:17.750> is

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
if where was the cable row I bet it is

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.350 
if where was the cable row I bet it is
right<00:05:19.400> here<00:05:20.140> right<00:05:21.140> there<00:05:22.070> is<00:05:22.220> right<00:05:22.370> there<00:05:22.580> so

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
right here right there is right there so

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.060 
right here right there is right there so
let's<00:05:23.419> see<00:05:23.740> one<00:05:24.740> two<00:05:25.150> three<00:05:26.150> four<00:05:26.510> five<00:05:26.810> I<00:05:27.110> did

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
let's see one two three four five I did

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.240 
let's see one two three four five I did
a<00:05:28.100> pro<00:05:28.430> row<00:05:28.610> and<00:05:29.210> knit<00:05:30.020> row<00:05:30.230> a<00:05:30.500> pro<00:05:30.770> row<00:05:30.980> and

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
a pro row and knit row a pro row and

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.550 
a pro row and knit row a pro row and
knit<00:05:31.520> row<00:05:31.700> and<00:05:31.940> a<00:05:32.000> pro<00:05:32.210> grow<00:05:32.419> and<00:05:32.690> I'm<00:05:33.320> back<00:05:33.530> to

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
knit row and a pro grow and I'm back to

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.330 
knit row and a pro grow and I'm back to
knitting<00:05:33.860> so<00:05:35.140> let's<00:05:36.140> see<00:05:36.320> do<00:05:36.560> we<00:05:36.620> have<00:05:36.710> okay<00:05:37.310> so

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
knitting so let's see do we have okay so

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.480 
knitting so let's see do we have okay so
we<00:05:38.240> do<00:05:38.450> if<00:05:38.930> the<00:05:39.410> purl<00:05:39.680> row<00:05:39.830> right<00:05:40.070> after<00:05:40.400> the

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
we do if the purl row right after the

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.310 
we do if the purl row right after the
cable<00:05:40.820> counts<00:05:41.210> as<00:05:41.330> part<00:05:41.540> of<00:05:41.660> the<00:05:41.780> cable<00:05:42.169> and

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
cable counts as part of the cable and

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.280 
cable counts as part of the cable and
then<00:05:42.650> we<00:05:42.860> do<00:05:42.979> six<00:05:43.250> plain<00:05:43.520> rows<00:05:43.870> so<00:05:44.870> we've<00:05:45.080> got

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
then we do six plain rows so we've got

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.659 
then we do six plain rows so we've got
that's<00:05:45.410> part<00:05:45.710> of<00:05:45.770> the<00:05:45.860> cable<00:05:46.190> then<00:05:46.370> we<00:05:46.520> go

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
that's part of the cable then we go

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.780 
that's part of the cable then we go
we've<00:05:47.210> got<00:05:47.240> one<00:05:48.080> two<00:05:48.470> three<00:05:48.500> four<00:05:48.890> we<00:05:49.580> need<00:05:49.729> to

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
we've got one two three four we need to

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.909 
we've got one two three four we need to
do<00:05:49.850> another<00:05:49.970> two<00:05:50.450> and<00:05:50.690> then<00:05:51.470> it<00:05:51.560> would<00:05:51.680> be<00:05:51.710> time

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
do another two and then it would be time

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:53.950 
do another two and then it would be time
to<00:05:52.070> do<00:05:52.190> the<00:05:52.310> cable<00:05:52.610> again<00:05:52.729> and<00:05:53.300> also<00:05:53.690> you<00:05:53.750> can

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
to do the cable again and also you can

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.360 
to do the cable again and also you can
notice<00:05:54.169> that<00:05:54.290> it<00:05:54.380> really<00:05:54.530> does<00:05:54.710> pull<00:05:55.040> in<00:05:55.250> the

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
notice that it really does pull in the

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.130 
notice that it really does pull in the
fabric<00:05:55.760> quite<00:05:55.970> a<00:05:56.000> bit<00:05:56.240> ribbing<00:05:56.540> already<00:05:56.840> pulls

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
fabric quite a bit ribbing already pulls

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.960 
fabric quite a bit ribbing already pulls
