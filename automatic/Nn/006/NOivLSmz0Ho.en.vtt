did mention in my previous video that i

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.350 
did mention in my previous video that i
was<00:05:52.230> going<00:05:52.590> to<00:05:52.650> be<00:05:52.800> putting<00:05:53.580> a<00:05:53.730> video<00:05:53.940> of<00:05:54.180> me<00:05:54.330> on

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
was going to be putting a video of me on

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.420 
was going to be putting a video of me on
the<00:05:54.720> motorbike<00:05:54.960> talking<00:05:55.620> that<00:05:56.190> turned<00:05:56.370> out

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
the motorbike talking that turned out

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.170 
the motorbike talking that turned out
quite<00:05:56.610> nice<00:05:57.240> and<00:05:57.690> bad<00:05:58.080> at<00:05:58.320> the<00:05:58.350> same<00:05:58.410> time

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
quite nice and bad at the same time

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.330 
quite nice and bad at the same time
because<00:06:00.180> of<00:06:00.210> the<00:06:00.540> fact<00:06:00.810> that<00:06:00.960> i<00:06:01.320> was<00:06:01.350> talking

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
because of the fact that i was talking

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.940 
because of the fact that i was talking
and<00:06:02.820> it<00:06:02.940> was<00:06:03.060> nighttime<00:06:03.240> so<00:06:03.780> the<00:06:03.960> camera<00:06:04.380> did

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
and it was nighttime so the camera did

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.680 
and it was nighttime so the camera did
not<00:06:05.070> pick<00:06:05.280> up<00:06:05.430> the<00:06:05.550> amount<00:06:05.730> of<00:06:05.820> speed<00:06:06.120> I<00:06:06.360> was

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
not pick up the amount of speed I was

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.600 
not pick up the amount of speed I was
actually<00:06:06.840> doing<00:06:07.169> and<00:06:07.500> it<00:06:08.040> looks<00:06:08.250> like<00:06:08.340> I<00:06:08.460> just

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
actually doing and it looks like I just

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.400 
actually doing and it looks like I just
riding<00:06:08.940> a<00:06:09.000> bicycle<00:06:09.210> instead<00:06:09.690> of<00:06:09.780> motorbike<00:06:10.169> so

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
riding a bicycle instead of motorbike so

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.400 
riding a bicycle instead of motorbike so
the<00:06:10.500> speed<00:06:10.740> wasn't<00:06:11.130> at<00:06:11.250> his<00:06:11.430> father<00:06:12.260> it<00:06:13.260> was

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
the speed wasn't at his father it was

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.890 
the speed wasn't at his father it was
fast<00:06:13.680> but<00:06:13.919> i<00:06:13.980> don't<00:06:14.190> think<00:06:14.400> the<00:06:14.640> the<00:06:15.180> via

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
fast but i don't think the the via

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.570 
fast but i don't think the the via
camera<00:06:16.350> just<00:06:16.470> picked<00:06:16.680> up<00:06:16.800> that's<00:06:17.340> okay

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
camera just picked up that's okay

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.520
