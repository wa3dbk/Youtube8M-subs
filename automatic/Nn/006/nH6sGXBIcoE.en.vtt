00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
the front of their chest all the time

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.250 
the front of their chest all the time
and<00:00:56.560> they<00:00:56.620> can't<00:00:56.800> believe<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.160> sort<00:00:57.400> of<00:00:57.520> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
and they can't believe the sort of the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260 
and they can't believe the sort of the
increased<00:00:59.260> movement<00:00:59.770> and<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.270> improvement

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
increased movement and the improvement

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.720 
increased movement and the improvement
in<00:01:01.360> posture<00:01:01.750> following<00:01:02.290> the<00:01:02.350> operation<00:01:02.700> okay

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
in posture following the operation okay

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.780 
in posture following the operation okay
so<00:01:04.210> breast<00:01:05.009> reduction<00:01:06.009> surgery<00:01:06.040> very

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
so breast reduction surgery very

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.149 
so breast reduction surgery very
satisfying<00:01:07.680> there<00:01:08.680> are<00:01:08.860> different

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
satisfying there are different

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.450 
satisfying there are different
approaches<00:01:09.700> to<00:01:10.330> it<00:01:11.340> basically<00:01:12.340> the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
approaches to it basically the

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.360 
approaches to it basically the
approaches<00:01:12.970> are<00:01:13.360> to<00:01:14.140> do<00:01:14.290> with<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:14.590> pattern<00:01:15.280> of

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
approaches are to do with the pattern of

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.120 
approaches are to do with the pattern of
skin<00:01:15.640> excision<00:01:16.000> and<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.810> way<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.200> nipple<00:01:17.620> is

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
skin excision and the way the nipple is

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.110 
skin excision and the way the nipple is
kept

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
kept

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.870 
kept
connected<00:01:19.630> so<00:01:20.080> the<00:01:20.229> old<00:01:20.500> fashioned<00:01:21.310> way<00:01:21.520> of

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
connected so the old fashioned way of

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.230 
connected so the old fashioned way of
maintaining<00:01:23.610> blood<00:01:24.610> supply<00:01:24.970> to<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.210> nipple

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
maintaining blood supply to the nipple

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.740 
maintaining blood supply to the nipple
was<00:01:25.900> practically<00:01:26.470> to<00:01:26.680> remove<00:01:27.190> the<00:01:27.909> nipple<00:01:28.030> and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
was practically to remove the nipple and

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.810 
was practically to remove the nipple and
replace<00:01:29.080> it<00:01:29.290> as<00:01:29.380> a<00:01:29.409> skin<00:01:29.770> graft<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.490> that's<00:01:30.729> a

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
replace it as a skin graft and that's a

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.730 
replace it as a skin graft and that's a
technique<00:01:31.210> known<00:01:31.299> as<00:01:31.450> free<00:01:31.869> nipple<00:01:32.080> grafting

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
technique known as free nipple grafting

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.780 
technique known as free nipple grafting
now<00:01:33.340> that<00:01:34.299> isn't<00:01:34.600> very<00:01:35.280> done<00:01:36.280> very<00:01:36.520> often

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
now that isn't very done very often

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.810 
now that isn't very done very often
nowadays<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.140> reason<00:01:38.560> for<00:01:38.710> that<00:01:38.770> is<00:01:39.310> that

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
nowadays and the reason for that is that

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.550 
nowadays and the reason for that is that
the<00:01:40.240> nipple<00:01:40.360> doesn't<00:01:40.600> look<00:01:40.900> very<00:01:40.930> aesthetic

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
the nipple doesn't look very aesthetic

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.590 
the nipple doesn't look very aesthetic
afterwards<00:01:42.040> and<00:01:42.220> you<00:01:42.460> lose<00:01:42.640> sensation<00:01:42.909> and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
afterwards and you lose sensation and

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.510 
afterwards and you lose sensation and
the<00:01:43.780> ability<00:01:44.110> to<00:01:44.140> breastfeed<00:01:44.680> following<00:01:45.400> the

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
the ability to breastfeed following the

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.450 
the ability to breastfeed following the
operation<00:01:46.030> so<00:01:46.479> free<00:01:46.780> nipple<00:01:46.960> grafting<00:01:47.650> now<00:01:48.010> is

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
operation so free nipple grafting now is

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.630 
operation so free nipple grafting now is
an<00:01:48.909> older<00:01:49.409> historical<00:01:50.409> technique<00:01:50.920> and

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
an older historical technique and

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.520 
an older historical technique and
nowadays<00:01:52.090> is<00:01:52.240> only<00:01:52.510> really<00:01:52.960> used<00:01:53.170> for<00:01:53.290> people

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
nowadays is only really used for people

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.340 
nowadays is only really used for people
with<00:01:53.770> very

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
with very

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.380 
with very
big<00:01:54.530> breasts<00:01:54.980> a<00:01:55.130> a<00:01:55.159> reduction<00:01:55.730> of<00:01:55.880> you<00:01:56.270> know

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
big breasts a a reduction of you know

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.270 
big breasts a a reduction of you know
over<00:01:56.659> two<00:01:56.780> kilograms<00:01:57.409> per<00:01:57.500> side

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
over two kilograms per side

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.210 
over two kilograms per side
so<00:01:58.790> nowadays<00:01:59.570> we<00:01:59.990> tend<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.229> preserve<00:02:00.590> nipple

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
so nowadays we tend to preserve nipple

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.700 
so nowadays we tend to preserve nipple
nipple<00:02:02.090> blood<00:02:02.479> supply<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:03.140> where<00:02:03.350> we<00:02:03.500> can

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
nipple blood supply and where we can

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
can a lot of different patterns that is

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.560 
can a lot of different patterns that is
usually<00:02:18.620> are<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.980> inferior<00:02:19.730> base<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.360> means

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
usually are the inferior base that means

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.330 
usually are the inferior base that means
it's<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.870> bridge<00:02:21.110> running<00:02:21.590> from<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.920> bottom

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340

all<00:02:23.060> my<00:02:23.810> preferred<00:02:24.140> technique<00:02:24.470> is<00:02:24.860> a<00:02:25.220> superior

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
all my preferred technique is a superior

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.550 
all my preferred technique is a superior
medial<00:02:27.140> pedicle<00:02:28.130> which<00:02:28.580> is<00:02:28.790> based<00:02:29.560> despite

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
medial pedicle which is based despite

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.590 
medial pedicle which is based despite
facing<00:02:30.860> inwards<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.970> reason<00:02:32.390> for<00:02:32.540> that

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
facing inwards and the reason for that

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.040 
facing inwards and the reason for that
is<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:34.459> maintain<00:02:35.030> volume<00:02:35.390> in<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.720> outer<00:02:35.810> part

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
is you maintain volume in the outer part

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.600 
is you maintain volume in the outer part
of<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.230> breast<00:02:36.440> give<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.709> better<00:02:36.890> shape<00:02:37.250> and

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
of the breast give a better shape and

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.160 
of the breast give a better shape and
also<00:02:37.870> preserve<00:02:40.330> sensation<00:02:41.330> better<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:42.080> the

also preserve sensation better to the

over the age of 50 because this will

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.469 
over the age of 50 because this will
show<00:04:37.039> any<00:04:37.310> of<00:04:37.460> analyses<00:04:37.910> that<00:04:37.970> which<00:04:38.240> can<00:04:38.419> be

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
show any of analyses that which can be

show any of analyses that which can be
dealt<00:04:38.690> with<00:04:38.780> at<00:04:38.990> the<00:04:39.110> time<00:04:39.320> of<00:04:39.560> that<00:04:39.650> surgery
