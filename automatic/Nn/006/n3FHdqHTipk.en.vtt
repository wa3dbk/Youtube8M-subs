00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
Barcelona B team and I end up having

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.260 
Barcelona B team and I end up having
four<00:02:27.950> stars<00:02:28.250> skill<00:02:28.430> moves<00:02:28.490> I'm<00:02:28.820> loving<00:02:29.150> the

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
four stars skill moves I'm loving the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.670 
four stars skill moves I'm loving the
four<00:02:29.450> star<00:02:29.630> skill<00:02:29.900> is<00:02:29.990> a<00:02:30.020> lot<00:02:30.260> more<00:02:30.440> than<00:02:30.590> the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
four star skill is a lot more than the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.870 
four star skill is a lot more than the
five<00:02:30.830> star<00:02:31.100> skills<00:02:31.340> at<00:02:31.490> the<00:02:31.550> moment<00:02:31.820> I<00:02:31.850> just

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
five star skills at the moment I just

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.310 
five star skills at the moment I just
find<00:02:32.180> it<00:02:32.270> easier<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.570> do<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.840> Berber<00:02:33.140> spin

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
find it easier to do the Berber spin

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.080 
find it easier to do the Berber spin
obviously<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:34.310> then<00:02:34.430> there's<00:02:34.610> a<00:02:34.670> scoop<00:02:34.910> turn

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
obviously and then there's a scoop turn

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.650 
obviously and then there's a scoop turn
as<00:02:35.209> well<00:02:35.330> but<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:36.490> pretty<00:02:37.490> much<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:38.300> Ronaldo

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
as well but and pretty much the Ronaldo

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.120 
as well but and pretty much the Ronaldo
chop<00:02:38.690> which<00:02:39.140> is<00:02:39.260> so<00:02:39.440> good<00:02:39.680> this<00:02:39.830> year

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
chop which is so good this year

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.850 
chop which is so good this year
especially<00:02:41.090> because<00:02:41.720> it's<00:02:41.930> been<00:02:42.050> like<00:02:42.080> added

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
especially because it's been like added

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.280 
especially because it's been like added
on<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.130> as<00:02:43.490> a<00:02:43.520> four<00:02:43.760> star<00:02:43.970> skill<00:02:44.270> move<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:44.930> a

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
on to as a four star skill move and a

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.410 
on to as a four star skill move and a
obviously<00:02:45.980> you<00:02:46.550> know<00:02:46.640> if<00:02:46.730> you<00:02:46.820> don't<00:02:47.209> want<00:02:47.330> it

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
obviously you know if you don't want it

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.490 
obviously you know if you don't want it
to<00:02:47.510> be<00:02:47.600> called<00:02:47.750> there<00:02:47.870> another<00:02:48.050> chop<00:02:48.320> I<00:02:48.350> think

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
to be called there another chop I think

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.110 
to be called there another chop I think
it's<00:02:48.590> called<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.770> hill<00:02:48.950> chop<00:02:49.190> as<00:02:49.310> well<00:02:49.459> then

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
it's called the hill chop as well then

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.370 
it's called the hill chop as well then
we<00:02:50.180> got<00:02:50.300> another<00:02:50.420> goal<00:02:50.660> they're<00:02:50.840> very<00:02:51.110> lucky

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
we got another goal they're very lucky

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.650 
we got another goal they're very lucky
with<00:02:51.500> one<00:02:51.650> Dominguez<00:02:52.160> and<00:02:52.430> that<00:02:53.180> made<00:02:53.330> it<00:02:53.450> free

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
with one Dominguez and that made it free

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.090 
with one Dominguez and that made it free
no<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.050> then<00:02:54.140> here<00:02:54.350> we<00:02:54.470> got<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.650> best<00:02:54.800> goal<00:02:55.010> of

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.310 
pretty glad that I went with your you
guys<00:03:57.910> on<00:03:58.910> this<00:03:59.150> one<00:03:59.329> because<00:03:59.480> a<00:03:59.720> confirm<00:04:00.079> was

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
guys on this one because a confirm was

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.830 
guys on this one because a confirm was
strength<00:04:00.950> I<00:04:01.070> think<00:04:01.280> it's<00:04:01.400> somewhere<00:04:01.640> between

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
strength I think it's somewhere between

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.170 
strength I think it's somewhere between
97<00:04:02.840> or<00:04:02.930> 98<00:04:03.380> and<00:04:03.560> obviously<00:04:04.340> when<00:04:04.670> you<00:04:04.850> plane

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
97 or 98 and obviously when you plane
