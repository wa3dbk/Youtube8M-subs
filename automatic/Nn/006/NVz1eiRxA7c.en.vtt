00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:09.469 
hi it's Ryan from my online guitar calm

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:11.799 
hi it's Ryan from my online guitar calm
I<00:00:09.830> have<00:00:10.309> a<00:00:10.340> lesson<00:00:10.549> here<00:00:10.879> about<00:00:11.120> rhythm<00:00:11.330> guitar

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
I have a lesson here about rhythm guitar

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:13.780 
I have a lesson here about rhythm guitar
the<00:00:12.200> technique<00:00:12.590> I'll<00:00:12.950> show<00:00:13.129> you<00:00:13.190> that<00:00:13.459> can<00:00:13.639> add

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790 
the technique I'll show you that can add

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.090 
the technique I'll show you that can add
some<00:00:14.030> interest<00:00:14.360> to<00:00:14.510> rhythm<00:00:14.840> playing<00:00:15.170> it's

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
some interest to rhythm playing it's

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.950 
some interest to rhythm playing it's
sort<00:00:16.369> of<00:00:16.430> a<00:00:16.580> percussive<00:00:16.970> technique<00:00:17.600> where<00:00:17.869> you

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
sort of a percussive technique where you

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.910 
sort of a percussive technique where you
use<00:00:18.020> your<00:00:18.320> right<00:00:18.529> hand<00:00:19.390> to<00:00:20.390> add<00:00:20.930> a<00:00:21.380> percussion

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
use your right hand to add a percussion

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.410 
use your right hand to add a percussion
sound<00:00:22.279> like<00:00:22.400> that<00:00:22.520> drum<00:00:22.700> sound<00:00:23.000> to<00:00:23.270> your

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
sound like that drum sound to your

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.120 
sound like that drum sound to your
rhythm<00:00:23.690> playing<00:00:23.930> let<00:00:24.620> me<00:00:24.770> play<00:00:25.040> a<00:00:25.070> little

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
rhythm playing let me play a little

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:48.669 
rhythm playing let me play a little
example<00:00:25.520> and<00:00:25.760> I'll<00:00:25.850> show<00:00:25.970> you<00:00:26.000> what<00:00:26.150> I<00:00:26.180> mean<00:00:47.679> so

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:48.679 
example and I'll show you what I mean so

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:49.840 
example and I'll show you what I mean so
you<00:00:48.769> can<00:00:48.890> see<00:00:49.010> how<00:00:49.100> this<00:00:49.159> lot<00:00:49.429> differently

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
you can see how this lot differently

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.520 
you can see how this lot differently
destroying<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:50.479> course

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.830 

and<00:00:57.400> it's<00:00:57.550> a<00:00:57.640> little<00:00:57.820> bit<00:00:57.910> more<00:00:58.060> Drive<00:00:58.390> and<00:00:58.780> a

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
and it's a little bit more Drive and a

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.590 
and it's a little bit more Drive and a
little<00:00:59.080> bit<00:00:59.200> more<00:00:59.470> energy<00:00:59.920> to<00:01:00.070> it<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:01.390> what<00:01:01.480> I'm

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
little bit more energy to it so what I'm

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.420 
little bit more energy to it so what I'm
doing<00:01:01.630> is<00:01:01.900> actually<00:01:02.250> muting<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:03.280> strings

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
doing is actually muting the strings

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.800 
doing is actually muting the strings
with<00:01:03.910> my<00:01:03.940> picking<00:01:04.480> hand<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:07.330> that<00:01:07.360> and

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
with my picking hand like that and

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.720 
with my picking hand like that and
throwing<00:01:08.380> it<00:01:08.530> in<00:01:08.650> on<00:01:08.800> certain<00:01:09.070> beats<00:01:09.460> in<00:01:09.640> the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
throwing it in on certain beats in the

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.600 
throwing it in on certain beats in the
rhythm<00:01:10.060> I'm<00:01:10.900> gonna<00:01:11.110> zoom<00:01:11.260> in<00:01:11.470> onto<00:01:11.710> my<00:01:11.920> hand<00:01:12.190> so

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
rhythm I'm gonna zoom in onto my hand so

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.280 
rhythm I'm gonna zoom in onto my hand so
you<00:01:12.700> can<00:01:12.730> see<00:01:12.880> what<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.720> right<00:01:13.900> hand<00:01:14.110> the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
you can see what the right hand the

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.670 
you can see what the right hand the
picking<00:01:14.560> hand<00:01:14.680> is<00:01:14.920> doing<00:01:15.250> now<00:01:16.440> all<00:01:17.440> right<00:01:17.560> the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
picking hand is doing now all right the

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.870 
picking hand is doing now all right the
first<00:01:17.800> thing<00:01:17.950> you<00:01:18.130> want<00:01:18.280> to<00:01:18.310> do<00:01:18.460> is<00:01:18.670> practice

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
first thing you want to do is practice

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.700 
first thing you want to do is practice
just<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.480> percussive<00:01:19.780> right<00:01:20.290> hand<00:01:20.500> technique

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
just the percussive right hand technique

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.240 
just the percussive right hand technique
on<00:01:21.400> its<00:01:21.730> own<00:01:21.910> and<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:23.110> way<00:01:23.230> that<00:01:23.410> works<00:01:23.620> is<00:01:23.860> you

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
on its own and the way that works is you

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.890 
on its own and the way that works is you
take<00:01:24.820> your<00:01:24.970> picking<00:01:25.360> hand<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:27.750> find<00:01:28.750> this

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
take your picking hand and find this

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.500 
take your picking hand and find this
fleshy<00:01:29.350> area<00:01:29.770> under<00:01:30.010> your<00:01:30.070> thumb<00:01:30.400> and<00:01:30.850> under

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
fleshy area under your thumb and under

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.140 
fleshy area under your thumb and under
your<00:01:31.630> pinky<00:01:32.170> here<00:01:32.530> this<00:01:33.520> is<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.790> area<00:01:34.030> that's

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
your pinky here this is the area that's

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.410 
your pinky here this is the area that's
gonna<00:01:34.270> be<00:01:34.510> muting<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:34.930> strings<00:01:35.050> for<00:01:35.680> you<00:01:36.420> so

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
gonna be muting the strings for you so

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.120 
gonna be muting the strings for you so
the<00:01:37.540> motion<00:01:37.720> is<00:01:37.960> limited<00:01:38.170> if<00:01:38.650> I<00:01:38.740> do<00:01:38.800> this<00:01:39.010> in

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
the motion is limited if I do this in

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.490 
the motion is limited if I do this in
slow<00:01:39.250> motion<00:01:39.520> it<00:01:39.729> looks<00:01:39.850> like<00:01:40.030> this<00:01:40.290> my<00:01:41.290> hand

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
slow motion it looks like this my hand

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.810 
slow motion it looks like this my hand
comes<00:01:41.680> down<00:01:41.770> I'm<00:01:42.009> ready<00:01:42.160> to<00:01:42.340> strike<00:01:42.580> the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
comes down I'm ready to strike the

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.170 
comes down I'm ready to strike the
guitar<00:01:43.180> strings<00:01:44.250> then<00:01:45.250> those<00:01:45.460> fleshy<00:01:45.759> parts

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
guitar strings then those fleshy parts

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.030 
guitar strings then those fleshy parts
of<00:01:46.330> my<00:01:46.479> hand<00:01:46.720> now<00:01:46.869> are<00:01:47.110> touching<00:01:47.350> all<00:01:47.680> six

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
of my hand now are touching all six

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.070 
of my hand now are touching all six
strings<00:01:48.400> every<00:01:49.180> string<00:01:49.420> is<00:01:49.509> being<00:01:49.720> touched<00:01:49.869> by

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
strings every string is being touched by

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.320 
strings every string is being touched by
one<00:01:50.229> of<00:01:50.290> these<00:01:50.380> areas<00:01:50.770> so<00:01:51.040> if<00:01:51.880> I<00:01:51.970> was<00:01:52.090> to<00:01:52.180> pick

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
one of these areas so if I was to pick

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.800 
one of these areas so if I was to pick
each<00:01:52.630> string<00:01:53.020> now<00:01:54.780> none<00:01:55.780> of<00:01:55.900> them<00:01:56.080> should<00:01:56.290> ring

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
each string now none of them should ring

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.880 
each string now none of them should ring
so<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:58.930> hands<00:01:59.080> coming<00:01:59.320> down<00:01:59.440> for<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.619> chord

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
so the hands coming down for the chord

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.610 
so the hands coming down for the chord
motion<00:02:00.310> rests<00:02:01.150> on<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.330> strings<00:02:01.630> then<00:02:02.530> the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
motion rests on the strings then the

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.010 
motion rests on the strings then the
core<00:02:02.800> emotion<00:02:03.220> completes<00:02:03.880> I'll<00:02:04.750> show<00:02:04.930> you

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
core emotion completes I'll show you

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:13.580 
core emotion completes I'll show you
that<00:02:05.200> up<00:02:05.440> to<00:02:05.560> speed<00:02:10.230> and<00:02:11.230> that's<00:02:12.190> about<00:02:12.400> it

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
that up to speed and that's about it

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.720 
that up to speed and that's about it
easier<00:02:14.590> said<00:02:14.650> than<00:02:14.980> done<00:02:15.040> though<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.430> first

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
easier said than done though the first

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.040 
easier said than done though the first
few<00:02:15.910> times<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.239> do<00:02:16.360> this<00:02:16.480> is<00:02:16.660> going<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.900> be<00:02:17.019> a

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
few times to do this is going to be a

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.020 
few times to do this is going to be a
little<00:02:17.290> bit<00:02:17.440> more<00:02:17.650> difficult<00:02:18.160> that's<00:02:18.820> about

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
little bit more difficult that's about

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.600 
little bit more difficult that's about
it<00:02:19.209> from<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.480> right<00:02:19.660> hand<00:02:19.840> technique<00:02:20.489> that<00:02:21.489> is

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
it from the right hand technique that is

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.310 
it from the right hand technique that is
easier<00:02:21.940> said<00:02:22.180> than<00:02:22.360> done<00:02:22.420> though<00:02:22.660> that<00:02:23.110> when

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
easier said than done though that when

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.050 
easier said than done though that when
you<00:02:23.410> first<00:02:23.620> try<00:02:23.860> this<00:02:24.070> is<00:02:24.220> probably<00:02:24.820> going<00:02:25.000> to

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
you first try this is probably going to

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.490 
you first try this is probably going to
be<00:02:25.180> difficult<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:25.989> you're<00:02:26.170> gonna<00:02:26.290> need<00:02:26.380> to

be difficult so you're gonna need to

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.220 
be difficult so you're gonna need to
spend<00:02:26.680> some<00:02:26.830> time<00:02:26.890> practicing<00:02:27.930> making<00:02:28.930> sure

spend some time practicing making sure
all<00:02:29.350> those<00:02:29.500> terms<00:02:29.739> are<00:02:29.860> meeting<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.220> lot<00:02:30.310> of

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
all those terms are meeting a lot of

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.820 
all those terms are meeting a lot of
times<00:02:30.640> when<00:02:30.820> we<00:02:30.910> start<00:02:31.239> you'll<00:02:32.019> be<00:02:32.230> you'll

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
times when we start you'll be you'll
