00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.480 

you

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:40.490 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.510 

I<00:00:41.170> think<00:00:42.170> you're<00:00:42.290> only<00:00:42.500> a<00:00:42.650> game<00:00:43.160> away

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
I think you're only a game away

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.340 
I think you're only a game away
sometimes<00:00:44.060> a<00:00:44.180> possession<00:00:44.720> away<00:00:44.990> and<00:00:45.230> there

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
sometimes a possession away and there

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.460 
sometimes a possession away and there
was<00:00:45.470> a<00:00:45.520> five<00:00:46.520> way<00:00:46.700> tie<00:00:46.730> basically<00:00:47.690> for<00:00:47.900> second

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
was a five way tie basically for second

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.440 
was a five way tie basically for second
place<00:00:48.620> in<00:00:48.980> the<00:00:49.070> Big<00:00:49.250> Ten<00:00:49.280> and<00:00:49.790> just<00:00:50.030> how<00:00:50.180> close

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
place in the Big Ten and just how close

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.930 
place in the Big Ten and just how close
you<00:00:50.630> are<00:00:51.040> you<00:00:52.040> know<00:00:52.100> we<00:00:52.220> beat<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:52.490> Champion

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
you are you know we beat the Champion

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.270 
you are you know we beat the Champion
twice<00:00:53.150> and<00:00:53.720> I<00:00:54.350> think<00:00:54.560> when<00:00:54.680> you<00:00:54.770> look<00:00:54.800> at<00:00:55.100> that

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
twice and I think when you look at that

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.230 
twice and I think when you look at that
you<00:00:55.730> see<00:00:56.090> a<00:00:56.300> team<00:00:56.630> that<00:00:56.960> was<00:00:56.990> very<00:00:57.380> close<00:00:57.770> and

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.240 
you see a team that was very close and

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.910 
you see a team that was very close and
it<00:00:59.240> does<00:00:59.510> come<00:00:59.720> down<00:00:59.750> to<00:00:59.930> a<00:01:00.050> possession<00:01:00.620> here

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
it does come down to a possession here

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.980 
it does come down to a possession here
or<00:01:01.160> a<00:01:01.190> little<00:01:01.520> bit<00:01:01.610> of<00:01:01.700> a<00:01:01.850> of<00:01:02.570> a<00:01:02.720> push

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:02.990 
or a little bit of a of a push

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.590 
or a little bit of a of a push
defensively<00:01:03.620> there<00:01:03.980> one<00:01:04.670> more<00:01:04.880> stop<00:01:05.150> and<00:01:05.180> so<00:01:05.570> I

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
defensively there one more stop and so I

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.760 
defensively there one more stop and so I
think<00:01:05.780> if<00:01:05.990> you<00:01:06.080> can<00:01:06.170> learn<00:01:06.320> anything<00:01:06.620> from

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
think if you can learn anything from

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.310 
think if you can learn anything from
last<00:01:07.190> year<00:01:07.460> it's<00:01:07.640> just<00:01:07.940> how<00:01:08.060> close<00:01:08.360> everybody

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
last year it's just how close everybody

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.800 
last year it's just how close everybody
is<00:01:09.560> in<00:01:09.830> an<00:01:10.760> opportunity<00:01:11.300> to<00:01:11.390> win<00:01:11.600> a

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
championship I mean for us I think as a

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.150 
championship I mean for us I think as a
goal<00:01:14.720> no<00:01:14.930> there's<00:01:15.170> no<00:01:15.320> question<00:01:15.740> that<00:01:15.770> you

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
goals and those don't change from year

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.320 
goals and those don't change from year
to<00:01:30.590> year<00:01:30.710> you<00:01:31.490> know<00:01:31.520> now<00:01:31.760> it's<00:01:31.940> about<00:01:32.000> building

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
to year you know now it's about building

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.450 
to year you know now it's about building
an<00:01:32.660> identity<00:01:33.229> as<00:01:33.410> a<00:01:33.530> coach<00:01:33.800> we<00:01:34.040> have<00:01:34.160> certain

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
an identity as a coach we have certain

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.280 
an identity as a coach we have certain
standards<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:35.180> things<00:01:35.750> that<00:01:35.930> we<00:01:36.020> want<00:01:36.229> to

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
standards and things that we want to

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.469 
standards and things that we want to
accomplish<00:01:36.590> in<00:01:37.010> a<00:01:37.130> game<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:37.640> that<00:01:38.060> helps<00:01:38.360> us

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
accomplish in a game and that helps us

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.719 
accomplish in a game and that helps us
build<00:01:38.720> that<00:01:38.930> identity<00:01:39.410> but<00:01:40.070> ultimately<00:01:40.580> i

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
build that identity but ultimately i

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.880 
build that identity but ultimately i
think<00:01:40.850> you<00:01:41.420> know<00:01:41.450> when<00:01:41.660> teams<00:01:41.930> go<00:01:42.440> from<00:01:42.680> good

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
think you know when teams go from good

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.980 
think you know when teams go from good
to<00:01:42.950> great<00:01:43.220> and<00:01:43.580> from<00:01:44.090> great<00:01:44.330> to<00:01:44.570> something

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
to great and from great to something

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.440 
to great and from great to something
really<00:01:45.320> special<00:01:45.619> is<00:01:45.950> when<00:01:46.490> kids<00:01:46.820> take<00:01:47.060> it<00:01:47.210> upon

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
really special is when kids take it upon

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.120 
really special is when kids take it upon

key injuries and some other things so
you<00:02:30.010> know<00:02:30.550> we<00:02:30.640> have<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.820> rely<00:02:31.030> on<00:02:31.060> some<00:02:31.360> kids

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
you know we have to rely on some kids

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.090 
you know we have to rely on some kids
right<00:02:31.870> now<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:32.320> see<00:02:32.530> what<00:02:32.650> they<00:02:32.800> can<00:02:32.860> do<00:02:33.070> and

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
right now and see what they can do and

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.070 
right now and see what they can do and
give<00:02:33.310> them<00:02:33.430> an<00:02:33.519> opportunity<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.930> then

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
give them an opportunity and then

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.540 
give them an opportunity and then
evaluate<00:02:35.530> from<00:02:35.620> there<00:02:35.890> you<00:02:36.160> know<00:02:36.250> what<00:02:36.400> are<00:02:36.459> we

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
evaluate from there you know what are we

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.190 
evaluate from there you know what are we
doing<00:02:36.850> how<00:02:37.060> we<00:02:37.090> doing<00:02:37.269> it<00:02:37.660> what<00:02:37.810> could<00:02:37.959> we<00:02:38.019> do

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
doing how we doing it what could we do

00:02:38.200 --> 00:03:07.600 
doing how we doing it what could we do
better

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:38.570 

style<00:03:10.430> football<00:03:11.430> game<00:03:11.640> tomorrow<00:03:12.060> are<00:03:12.540> you

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.300 

this<00:03:39.580> part<00:03:39.879> madness<00:03:40.360> is<00:03:40.510> unique<00:03:41.230> I<00:03:41.620> think

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
this part madness is unique I think

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.649 
this part madness is unique I think
that's<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.549> best<00:03:42.760> word<00:03:43.000> for<00:03:43.060> it<00:03:43.390> I<00:03:43.599> think

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
that's the best word for it I think

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.330 
that's the best word for it I think
there's<00:03:44.019> a<00:03:44.110> lot<00:03:44.260> of<00:03:44.290> dynamics<00:03:44.860> that<00:03:44.950> go<00:03:45.159> into

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
there's a lot of dynamics that go into

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.220 
there's a lot of dynamics that go into
them<00:03:45.579> but<00:03:45.730> I<00:03:45.790> think<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.810> best<00:03:47.019> way<00:03:47.110> to

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
them but I think the best way to

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.350 
them but I think the best way to
describe<00:03:47.590> it<00:03:47.829> is<00:03:48.040> it's<00:03:48.340> a<00:03:48.489> unique<00:03:48.730> event<00:03:49.090> and

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
describe it is it's a unique event and

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.850 
describe it is it's a unique event and
it's<00:03:49.689> unique<00:03:49.989> because<00:03:50.019> of<00:03:50.409> the<00:03:50.500> fans<00:03:50.680> that

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
it's unique because of the fans that

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.830 
it's unique because of the fans that
come<00:03:51.129> out<00:03:51.340> it's<00:03:51.610> unique<00:03:52.000> because<00:03:52.030> of<00:03:52.659> the

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
come out it's unique because of the

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.630 
come out it's unique because of the
things<00:03:53.079> they<00:03:53.260> do<00:03:53.470> to<00:03:53.500> coach<00:03:53.799> izzo<00:03:54.159> and<00:03:54.340> I<00:03:54.430> in

things they do to coach izzo and I in

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
interesting will just be the

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.060 
interesting will just be the
combinations<00:04:53.020> that<00:04:53.110> we<00:04:53.320> have<00:04:53.470> to<00:04:53.650> play<00:04:53.830> for<00:04:53.890> a

combinations that we have to play for a
period<00:04:54.340> of<00:04:54.550> time<00:04:54.760> but<00:04:55.090> you<00:04:55.660> know<00:04:55.750> like<00:04:55.900> i<00:04:55.990> said

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
period of time but you know like i said

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.930 
period of time but you know like i said
i<00:04:56.230> mean<00:04:56.500> with<00:04:56.620> it<00:04:56.770> with<00:04:57.100> everything<00:04:57.520> there's<00:04:57.850> a

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
i mean with it with everything there's a

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.550 
i mean with it with everything there's a
silver<00:04:58.150> lining<00:04:58.300> and<00:04:58.780> it<00:04:58.870> gives<00:04:59.050> other<00:04:59.230> people

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
silver lining and it gives other people

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.680 
silver lining and it gives other people
opportunity<00:05:00.130> to<00:05:00.220> really<00:05:00.430> step<00:05:00.760> up<00:05:00.970> for<00:05:01.480> me<00:05:01.510> I

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
opportunity to really step up for me I

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.450 
opportunity to really step up for me I
think<00:05:01.930> what<00:05:02.230> I've<00:05:02.380> learned<00:05:02.680> is<00:05:02.980> just<00:05:03.010> to

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
think what I've learned is just to

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.060 
think what I've learned is just to
always<00:05:04.000> roll<00:05:04.300> up<00:05:04.420> your<00:05:04.540> sleeves<00:05:04.900> go<00:05:05.710> to<00:05:05.770> work

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
find a way cuz there's a way there is a

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.900 
find a way cuz there's a way there is a
way<00:05:08.980> it<00:05:09.190> might<00:05:09.310> not<00:05:09.460> be<00:05:09.520> the<00:05:09.760> way<00:05:09.880> you

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
way it might not be the way you

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.540 
way it might not be the way you
originally<00:05:10.900> planned<00:05:11.260> for<00:05:11.560> it<00:05:11.590> to<00:05:11.680> be<00:05:11.860> it<00:05:12.100> might

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
originally planned for it to be it might

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.030 
originally planned for it to be it might
not<00:05:12.670> be<00:05:12.730> the<00:05:13.090> style<00:05:13.420> you<00:05:13.630> want<00:05:13.810> to<00:05:13.960> play<00:05:14.200> but<00:05:14.890> it
