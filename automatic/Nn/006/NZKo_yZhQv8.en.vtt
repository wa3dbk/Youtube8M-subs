00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.680 
power goes out to a socket or an entire
wall<00:02:07.710> it's<00:02:08.220> usually<00:02:08.490> just<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:09.000> temporary<00:02:09.360> power

surge<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.319> causes<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.800> breaker<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.130> trip

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
surge that causes the breaker to trip

resetting a circuit breaker is simple
just<00:02:14.760> find<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.090> breaker<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.540> turn<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:15.960> back

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
just find the breaker and turn it back
