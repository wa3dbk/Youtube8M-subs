 texture here vocal I want to tell you 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.880
 about the career project of 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.779
 architecture that we are putting together aquino 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.189
 such as a proposal totally 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.980
 different from the proposal that normally 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.680
 they have been occurring in universities 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.230
 at the national level a proposal that is 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.269
 at the level of universities the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.610
 most important faculties of 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:37.559
 World Architecture Architects 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.540
 that we are going to form in a call are going to be 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.000
 specialists in the field of design 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.360
 strategic architectural we are going to 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.710
 look for the graduates of the faculty 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.530
 dominate all fields of design 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.230
 architectural scale of the city 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.660
 the territory the landscape the buildings 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.270
 the big buildings and of course 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.910
 let's say the smallest buildings up 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.579
 the scale of the architectural object 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.399
 we need an architect who understands 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.350
 how those ideas are going to become 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:10.160
 constructive solutions and how the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.110
 technology will allow you to achieve 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.720
 most risky solutions 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.480
 and of course unique as everything 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.090
 we do here in mouth we are 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.190
 looking for ucal architects 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.320
 are in the capacity to transform the 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.010
 city ​​and make these cities 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.420
 smart we are in need today 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.240
 we are going to have a workshop 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.700
 design of 99 hours a week but of 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.090
 15 hours a week with which 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.440
 evidence somehow that the focus 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.800
 clearly will be geared to that 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.229
 our students are the best 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.810
 designers that exist university 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.150
 Peruvian can generate 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.240
 we believe in creativity as the 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.310
 the most important source from the 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.670
 which our architects are going to be able to 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.100
 conceive these these projects that 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.970
 satisfy dreams expectations 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.980
 of people 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.620
 we believe that architecture does not have 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.679
 what to be boring monotonous 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.020
 repetitive but we 're going to bet on 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.730
 a differential architecture a 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.520
 architecture that meets the need 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.210
 specific to each of the users 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.590
 the architect is finally a 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.560
 society problem solver 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.510
 and it is within this perspective our 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.280
 graduates are going to be actors 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.090
 fundamentals in the change of the city 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.709
 and therefore of the citizens 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.290
 we believe that many things have changed 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.500
 will continue to change in the coming years 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.750
 however the world of architecture 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.840
 You also need that important change 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.080
 that refreshes the thinking of the city 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.849
 of the thought of citizenship and 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.739
 we think that the moment is now you 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.870
 we invite you to be part of this change that 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.640
 We invite you to be part of this process and 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.500
 that you become that architect who 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.970
 be able to transport dreams in 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.970
 reality welcome
