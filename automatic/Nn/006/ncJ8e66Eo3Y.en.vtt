00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Ben 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.330
 who today i can give you the third episode of we build a pc 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:20.300
 welcome 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.930
 In today's episode, we look closely at the case I want 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:28.109
 So look very carefully where the individual Werner zones within the housing 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.029
 Sense I want to look very carefully 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.660
 as we dissipate the heat inside the case we look at the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.380
 Water cooling on 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.950
 to see exactly how we on the one hand has the process lead the wave disk 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.380
 also cool 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.130
 and then to look was just times the case is ever constructed 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.460
 where the individual areas are and which one might be even more future 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.190
 A bit of optimizing can be done but we have many of the areas around there 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.770
 then exactly after the assembly or with pleasure together 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.520
 take a closer look 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.110
 and because certain things become relevant for the time being when the device is complete 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.110
 Assembled and we may also take one according to embratur 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.980
 can and see 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.800
 the hot the memory the hot the processor like it looks like 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.000
 Hard drives off 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.050
 and that they always tell everything that the topics are complete 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.380
 is assembled 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.960
 yes I would like to start with the water cooling 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.670
 namely, a package from the company Innovate was available here 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.580
 placed on the one hand for cooling 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.330
 TuS processors and we still have a lot of a cooling tower your sons for one 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.560
 Hard disk with it 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.730
 and there look at residence 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.490
 yes, the starter package of innovative areas basically took all that 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.390
 you need 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.820
 with a water cooling to start on the one hand has the radiator then the 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.380
 Pump Meter Barrier has the fans to choose the radiator 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.340
 we have a heat sink for the processor with it and tubes around 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.420
 to wire the whole course 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.110
 this is the radiators with the input and output for the water above it 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.950
 The water then chosen then come the appropriate Höfter abendrauf 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.979
 to make the water nice and bold, the pump supplied the Panama 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.670
 who pump her home 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.610
 which can then be mounted in the housing also with input and output and a 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.950
 Reservoir and that is the other to eater cool body 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.429
 with input and output 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:22.279
 I'll go into the Dynamo components for a detailed installation 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:23.449
 on 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:27.349
 a hard drive we will cool with water the others we become passive 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.759
 cool and nothing happens to students with his 1 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:42.120
 So when it comes to its own system, the area of ​​water cooling is quite something 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:44.629
 new for me, of course, with others already the water cooling 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:45.929
 partially installed 

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:50.009
 but I do not have my own system so far Water Water cooling uses it 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:53.379
 There are many who say that by now and smoke does not exist anymore 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.939
 good cooler among other possibilities systems correspond 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:00.829
 really cool with water cooling really only for the and 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.959
 looks easy and extreme gamer makes sense 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.389
 It just always fascinated me and that's why I did that 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.849
 Now in the system just want to block times 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.849
 Let's take another look at the case so that the ideas 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.110
 Presentation gets where the individual heat zones within the system 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.639
 lie 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:23.639
 whose first one is the upper section of the case we use is a PC vs 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.359
 21 10 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.959
 and in the upper part we have 120 millimeter fan who the hot air 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.239
 wears outwards 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.719
 in the lower part we have 140 mm Intel CULV that the cool 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.819
 Air transported from outside to inside here we also had a bit of space 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.959
 for the radiator make name a lot expanded also located here 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.049
 below the power supply 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.199
 of course, if you are planning a complete system you have to see that I get it 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.659
 hot air out of the system 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.540
 and that's why you have to know exactly how the air actually flows 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.229
 within the system 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:04:00.529
 Percent, there are any 2 cards that there because the back air and back 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:04.059
 two memory for example overheated or my percent hard drives 

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:05.089
 overheated 

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:08.829
 and that's why you have to look after and assemble exactly that 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.869
 the cables are hidden and tied together accordingly 

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:13.320
 the 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.990
 ++ is not disturbed 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.959
 in the water cooling this is a bit easier just if you too 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.210
 really that the system cools completely over water because basically 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.980
 Everything about this water cooling take place you just have to 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.720
 Thought because my big radiator like Kylie I have this air 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.400
 how does the hot air crawl out of the system? 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.900
 or you have external solution that is so the water hoses after 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.740
 led outside 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.820
 they really do not need to worry about systems anymore 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:42.680
 because everything is internal 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.960
 to be cooled over water there is water cooling for the storage bars 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.830
 there are 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.780
 to the water cooling for the graphics card we actually for 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.819
 wanted to build 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.830
 So percent in the area of ​​water cooling there's still plenty of options 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.070
 also the rest of the system 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.970
 complete 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.219
 to keep cool 

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:03.120
 yes that should continue to be a PC today to build the third episode of greed 

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:07.589
 The next time we start to assemble the system I always look 

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:10.309
 if I get it all together in a row 

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:12.819
 Let's see what else is there with additional information 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:14.059
 would like to accommodate 

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:18.099
 Otherwise I think it will take two more episodes to get everything ready 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:20.330
 put 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.720
 no matter where we daily hope that we had no case bonuses »SPD and and man 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.720
 can keep developing accordingly 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.919
 on 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:39.969
 on 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.909
 DAPD 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:50.929
 there
