00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.319 
thing that could happen in the FIFA 16
imagine<00:03:02.799> I<00:03:02.890> could<00:03:02.950> make<00:03:03.220> it<00:03:03.340> even<00:03:03.850> if<00:03:04.060> he<00:03:04.180> was

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
imagine I could make it even if he was

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.390 
imagine I could make it even if he was
just<00:03:04.540> pro<00:03:05.230> clubs<00:03:05.500> you<00:03:05.709> could<00:03:05.859> do<00:03:05.980> make<00:03:06.250> your

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
just pro clubs you could do make your

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.280 
just pro clubs you could do make your
own<00:03:06.489> kicking<00:03:06.850> it<00:03:07.000> that<00:03:07.600> would<00:03:07.750> be<00:03:07.870> good<00:03:08.019> but<00:03:08.230> I

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
own kicking it that would be good but I

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.930 
own kicking it that would be good but I
think<00:03:08.500> it<00:03:08.590> would<00:03:08.680> be<00:03:08.799> hard<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.130> put<00:03:09.340> McCain<00:03:09.640> but

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
think it would be hard to put McCain but

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.870 
think it would be hard to put McCain but
that's<00:03:10.660> I<00:03:10.930> just<00:03:11.500> add<00:03:11.590> pokes<00:03:11.890> his<00:03:12.100> head<00:03:12.130> nickel
