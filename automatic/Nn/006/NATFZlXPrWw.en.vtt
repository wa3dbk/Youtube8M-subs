percent remaining and there are 1000 56
photos<00:03:41.410> taken<00:03:42.959> it's<00:03:43.959> always<00:03:44.140> going<00:03:44.350> to<00:03:45.180> start

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
photos taken it's always going to start

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.620 
photos taken it's always going to start
using<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:47.440> right<00:03:47.620> slot<00:03:47.890> first<00:03:48.280> and<00:03:48.640> once<00:03:49.450> it's

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
using the right slot first and once it's

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.690 
using the right slot first and once it's
done<00:03:49.989> using<00:03:50.230> right<00:03:50.650> slot<00:03:50.920> it<00:03:51.100> starts<00:03:51.400> going<00:03:51.519> to

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
done using right slot it starts going to

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.479 
done using right slot it starts going to
left<00:03:51.910> slot<00:03:52.060> but<00:03:52.600> however<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:53.350> can<00:03:53.830> shoot<00:03:54.220> with

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
left slot but however you can shoot with

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.310 
left slot but however you can shoot with
just<00:03:54.700> one<00:03:54.940> if<00:03:55.060> you<00:03:55.150> were<00:03:55.239> to<00:03:55.330> take<00:03:55.480> out<00:03:55.660> one

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
just one if you were to take out one

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.960 
just one if you were to take out one
battery<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:57.130> can<00:03:57.280> still<00:03:57.489> shoot<00:03:57.640> with<00:03:57.820> one

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
battery you can still shoot with one

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.090 
battery you can still shoot with one
battery<00:03:58.269> so<00:03:58.570> if<00:03:59.410> you<00:03:59.530> do<00:03:59.650> get<00:03:59.769> this<00:03:59.890> option

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
battery so if you do get this option

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.750 
battery so if you do get this option
it's<00:04:00.970> okay<00:04:01.239> to<00:04:01.300> have<00:04:01.510> just<00:04:01.690> one<00:04:01.750> battery<00:04:02.200> and

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
it's okay to have just one battery and

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.250 
it's okay to have just one battery and
get<00:04:03.760> an<00:04:03.880> another<00:04:04.330> battery<00:04:04.660> at<00:04:04.840> a<00:04:05.019> later<00:04:05.170> time

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
get an another battery at a later time

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.970 
get an another battery at a later time
and<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:07.690> system<00:04:07.930> is<00:04:08.230> smart<00:04:08.440> enough<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.739> know

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
and the system is smart enough to know

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.130 
and the system is smart enough to know
which<00:04:09.310> you<00:04:09.970> switched<00:04:10.360> the<00:04:10.510> batteries<00:04:10.840> on<00:04:10.989> it

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
which you switched the batteries on it

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:19.380 
which you switched the batteries on it
it<00:04:12.010> will<00:04:12.220> know<00:04:14.970> what<00:04:16.049> which<00:04:17.049> battery<00:04:17.470> had<00:04:18.390> on

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
it will know what which battery had on

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.449 
it will know what which battery had on
the<00:04:19.479> battery<00:04:19.690> information<00:04:19.810> screen<00:04:20.470> so<00:04:20.950> now<00:04:21.100> it

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
the battery information screen so now it

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.090 
the battery information screen so now it
shows<00:04:21.820> right<00:04:22.600> slot<00:04:22.930> ninety-five<00:04:23.410> percent<00:04:23.680> two

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
shows right slot ninety-five percent two

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.190 
shows right slot ninety-five percent two
pictures<00:04:24.460> and<00:04:24.760> you'll<00:04:25.180> notice<00:04:25.539> it's<00:04:25.750> reversed

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
pictures and you'll notice it's reversed

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.710 
pictures and you'll notice it's reversed
these<00:04:26.410> two<00:04:26.620> now<00:04:26.770> because<00:04:27.039> I've<00:04:27.190> reversed

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
these two now because I've reversed

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.750 
these two now because I've reversed
batteries<00:04:30.290> so<00:04:31.290> that<00:04:31.590> is<00:04:31.920> pretty<00:04:32.250> much<00:04:32.400> it<00:04:32.730> for

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
batteries so that is pretty much it for

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:40.190 
batteries so that is pretty much it for
the<00:04:33.000> grip<00:04:33.800> and<00:04:34.800> that<00:04:35.750> is<00:04:36.750> it<00:04:36.900> for<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:38.480> MB<00:04:39.480> dat

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
the grip and that is it for the MB dat

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.560 
the grip and that is it for the MB dat
grip
