actually<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.100> well<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:57.420> could<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.840> could<00:02:58.020> be

actually the well you could it could be

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.480 
actually the well you could it could be
large<00:02:58.350> if<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.740> take<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:58.980> null<00:02:59.130> point<00:02:59.310> seven

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490

meters<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.820> mean<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.240> actual<00:03:00.510> height<00:03:00.660> of

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
meters that mean the actual height of

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.720 
meters that mean the actual height of
the<00:03:00.990> image<00:03:01.290> however<00:03:01.980> it's<00:03:02.220> sort<00:03:02.610> of<00:03:02.640> the

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
the image however it's sort of the

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.640 
the image however it's sort of the
length<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:03.210> tattoo<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:03.900> not<00:03:03.960> its<00:03:04.140> height<00:03:04.350> so

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
length of tattoo and not its height so

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.980 
length of tattoo and not its height so
that's<00:03:04.830> why<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.100> doesn't<00:03:05.910> look<00:03:06.030> quite<00:03:06.180> as<00:03:06.300> tall

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
that's why it doesn't look quite as tall

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.870 
that's why it doesn't look quite as tall
as<00:03:07.290> you'd<00:03:07.440> expect<00:03:07.800> it<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:07.920> be<00:03:07.980> in<00:03:08.010> 0.7<00:03:08.610> meters

as you'd expect it to be in 0.7 meters

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.800 
as you'd expect it to be in 0.7 meters
it's<00:03:09.450> just<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.810> length<00:03:10.020> really<00:03:11.540> then<00:03:12.540> if<00:03:12.690> we

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
it's just a length really then if we

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.380 
it's just a length really then if we

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.700 
if we look at Kara Costas sprite in
generation<00:05:50.910> 5<00:05:51.120> we<00:05:51.570> consider<00:05:51.930> the<00:05:52.050> very<00:05:52.290> simple

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
generation 5 we consider the very simple

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.590 
generation 5 we consider the very simple
sprite<00:05:52.950> he<00:05:53.100> simply<00:05:53.430> just<00:05:53.610> stood<00:05:53.820> there<00:05:53.850> his

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
sprite he simply just stood there his

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.510 
sprite he simply just stood there his
arms<00:05:54.780> sort<00:05:55.140> of<00:05:55.200> laying<00:05:55.560> down<00:05:55.680> and<00:05:56.250> obviously

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
arms sort of laying down and obviously

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.770 
arms sort of laying down and obviously
he<00:05:56.640> moves<00:05:56.820> them<00:05:56.940> about<00:05:57.150> bit<00:05:57.360> because<00:05:57.540> the

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
he moves them about bit because the

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.630 
he moves them about bit because the
animation<00:05:58.050> there's<00:05:58.710> not<00:05:58.860> a<00:05:58.890> whole<00:05:59.100> lot<00:05:59.130> the

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
animation there's not a whole lot the

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.040 
animation there's not a whole lot the
back<00:05:59.820> sprite<00:06:00.120> in<00:06:00.210> this<00:06:00.330> case<00:06:00.570> is<00:06:00.720> as<00:06:00.870> you'd

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
back sprite in this case is as you'd

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.450 
back sprite in this case is as you'd
expect<00:06:01.380> the<00:06:01.620> shell<00:06:01.860> takes<00:06:02.160> up<00:06:02.280> the<00:06:02.340> majority

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
expect the shell takes up the majority

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.910 
expect the shell takes up the majority
of<00:06:02.970> the<00:06:03.390> backs<00:06:03.990> right<00:06:04.230> there<00:06:04.530> but<00:06:04.710> you<00:06:04.740> can

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:04.920 
of the backs right there but you can

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.560 
of the backs right there but you can
still<00:06:05.100> see<00:06:05.280> its<00:06:05.400> head<00:06:05.430> in<00:06:05.730> his<00:06:05.820> arms<00:06:06.210> and<00:06:06.390> even

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
still see its head in his arms and even

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.470 
still see its head in his arms and even
its<00:06:06.780> little<00:06:07.050> tail<00:06:07.080> the<00:06:07.350> points<00:06:07.590> at<00:06:07.680> the<00:06:07.740> Mac

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:08.480 
its little tail the points at the Mac

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.940 
its little tail the points at the Mac
finally<00:06:09.480> they're<00:06:09.690> looking<00:06:09.930> at<00:06:10.050> size<00:06:10.290> Kara

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
finally they're looking at size Kara

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.740 
finally they're looking at size Kara
Koster<00:06:11.280> is<00:06:11.370> actually<00:06:11.850> much<00:06:12.090> smaller<00:06:12.330> than<00:06:12.720> I

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
Koster is actually much smaller than I

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.390 
Koster is actually much smaller than I
imagined<00:06:13.260> standing<00:06:13.620> at<00:06:13.710> only<00:06:13.830> one<00:06:14.040> point<00:06:14.220> two

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
imagined standing at only one point two

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.100 
imagined standing at only one point two
meters<00:06:14.640> or<00:06:14.760> three<00:06:15.000> foot<00:06:15.150> 11<00:06:15.420> inches<00:06:15.480> which

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
meters or three foot 11 inches which

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.330 
meters or three foot 11 inches which
means<00:06:16.380> it's<00:06:16.470> not<00:06:16.530> even<00:06:16.740> as<00:06:16.830> tourists<00:06:17.130> Ashe

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
means it's not even as tourists Ashe

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.920 
means it's not even as tourists Ashe
really<00:06:17.730> which<00:06:18.120> is<00:06:18.240> really<00:06:18.450> cry<00:06:18.570> strained

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
really which is really cry strained

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.560 
really which is really cry strained
because<00:06:19.260> it<00:06:19.470> does<00:06:19.680> look<00:06:19.950> very<00:06:20.270> small<00:06:21.270> on<00:06:21.480> the

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 
because it does look very small on the

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.480 
because it does look very small on the
comparison<00:06:21.960> I<00:06:22.290> imagined<00:06:22.950> it'd<00:06:23.010> be<00:06:23.130> a<00:06:23.160> bit<00:06:23.370> be

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
comparison I imagined it'd be a bit be

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.490 
comparison I imagined it'd be a bit be
at<00:06:24.090> least<00:06:24.180> the<00:06:24.390> size<00:06:24.750> of<00:06:24.840> Astra<00:06:25.080> with<00:06:25.170> a<00:06:25.290> guest

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
at least the size of Astra with a guest

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.380 
at least the size of Astra with a guest
but<00:06:25.770> it's<00:06:26.220> actually<00:06:26.520> quite<00:06:26.640> small<00:06:26.760> Pokemon<00:06:27.210> if

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:27.390 
but it's actually quite small Pokemon if

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.890 
but it's actually quite small Pokemon if
you<00:06:27.510> look<00:06:27.630> at<00:06:27.750> it<00:06:27.840> right<00:06:29.000> so<00:06:30.000> guys<00:06:30.180> that's<00:06:30.660> it
