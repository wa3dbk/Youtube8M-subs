so<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:35.670> don't<00:03:36.120> have<00:03:36.600> a<00:03:37.050> cable<00:03:37.830> running<00:03:38.520> right

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
so you don't have a cable running right

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.780 
so you don't have a cable running right
from<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.810> fan<00:03:40.080> into<00:03:40.740> the<00:03:40.830> power<00:03:41.040> supply<00:03:41.430> but

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
rather through this connection and then

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.780 
rather through this connection and then
you<00:03:45.420> would<00:03:45.570> make<00:03:45.840> a<00:03:46.020> connection<00:03:46.470> here<00:03:46.800> on<00:03:47.400> the

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
you would make a connection here on the
