that you are generating you're

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.560 
that you are generating you're
generating<00:06:33.850> a<00:06:34.270> total<00:06:34.840> of

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570 
generating a total of

patron by making these potions so you

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.780 
patron by making these potions so you
can<00:06:44.110> see<00:06:44.260> that's<00:06:44.470> why<00:06:44.710> apex<00:06:45.220> prices<00:06:45.640> are

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:45.790 
can see that's why apex prices are

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.450 
can see that's why apex prices are
rising<00:06:46.030> because<00:06:46.870> just<00:06:47.860> by<00:06:47.980> making<00:06:48.190> these

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:48.460 
rising because just by making these

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.880 
rising because just by making these

points<00:06:58.150> but<00:06:58.660> just<00:06:58.960> with<00:06:59.140> the<00:06:59.170> offline<00:06:59.830> labor

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 
points but just with the offline labor

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.150 
points but just with the offline labor
points<00:07:00.580> you<00:07:00.940> can<00:07:01.060> make<00:07:01.240> four<00:07:01.690> thousand<00:07:02.590> gold<00:07:02.920> a

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.260 
month and that's not even factoring in

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.980 
month and that's not even factoring in
the<00:07:05.880> loyalty<00:07:06.880> tokens<00:07:07.270> that<00:07:07.330> you<00:07:07.570> get<00:07:07.810> as<00:07:07.960> well

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 
very valuable and apex prices will

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.840 
very valuable and apex prices will
definitely<00:07:18.670> be<00:07:18.820> going<00:07:19.210> up<00:07:19.420> further
