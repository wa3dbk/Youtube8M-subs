00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.810 

we'll<00:04:53.590> add<00:04:53.800> a<00:04:54.240> pinch<00:04:55.240> of<00:04:55.390> turmeric<00:04:56.820> generous

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.100 

and<00:05:01.410> now<00:05:02.190> we'll<00:05:02.340> just<00:05:02.520> turn<00:05:03.030> up<00:05:03.270> the<00:05:03.450> heat<00:05:03.690> and

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
and now we'll just turn up the heat and

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:12.850 
and now we'll just turn up the heat and
just<00:05:04.560> give<00:05:04.740> it<00:05:04.860> one<00:05:04.890> shot

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.670 

usually<00:05:13.850> if<00:05:13.910> you're<00:05:14.060> making<00:05:14.270> a<00:05:14.660> sambar<00:05:15.200> using

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
usually if you're making a sambar using

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.950 
usually if you're making a sambar using
your<00:05:15.830> sambar<00:05:16.310> powder<00:05:16.540> then<00:05:17.540> you<00:05:17.720> would<00:05:17.840> be

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
your sambar powder then you would be

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.180 
your sambar powder then you would be
adding<00:05:18.110> the<00:05:18.380> powder<00:05:18.590> at<00:05:18.860> this<00:05:19.070> stage<00:05:19.420> but

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
adding the powder at this stage but

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.500 
adding the powder at this stage but
because<00:05:22.190> we<00:05:22.310> are<00:05:22.340> making<00:05:22.550> it<00:05:22.730> with<00:05:22.820> the<00:05:22.940> face

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
because we are making it with the face

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.170 
because we are making it with the face
the<00:05:23.690> face<00:05:23.900> is<00:05:24.080> kind<00:05:24.380> of<00:05:24.410> going<00:05:24.590> to<00:05:24.710> go<00:05:24.830> last

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
the face is kind of going to go last

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.960 
the face is kind of going to go last
because<00:05:26.180> it's<00:05:26.330> already<00:05:26.480> half<00:05:26.870> cooked<00:05:27.580> so<00:05:28.580> now

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
because it's already half cooked so now

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.690 
because it's already half cooked so now
that<00:05:29.030> this<00:05:29.840> is<00:05:30.020> sorted<00:05:30.530> as<00:05:31.010> you<00:05:31.100> can<00:05:31.280> see<00:05:31.520> the

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
that this is sorted as you can see the

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:37.060 
that this is sorted as you can see the
Huggies<00:05:32.590> coated<00:05:34.780> what<00:05:35.780> we<00:05:35.960> will<00:05:36.170> do<00:05:36.320> is<00:05:36.530> now<00:05:37.010> we

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.170 
away so at this point what we will do is

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.510 
away so at this point what we will do is
we<00:06:00.320> will<00:06:00.350> also<00:06:00.560> add<00:06:00.890> a<00:06:01.780> little<00:06:02.780> bit<00:06:03.050> of<00:06:03.520> hing

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
we will also add a little bit of hing

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:11.250 
we will also add a little bit of hing
water<00:06:06.130> and<00:06:07.130> just<00:06:07.910> give<00:06:08.090> this<00:06:08.240> a<00:06:08.450> quick<00:06:08.840> stir

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.020 

and<00:06:12.260> now<00:06:12.830> we<00:06:12.890> will<00:06:13.040> allow<00:06:13.340> this<00:06:13.520> to<00:06:13.670> come<00:06:13.820> to<00:06:14.000> a

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
and now we will allow this to come to a

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.010 
and now we will allow this to come to a
boil<00:06:14.270> so<00:06:15.700> at<00:06:16.700> this<00:06:17.000> stage<00:06:17.210> what<00:06:17.420> we<00:06:17.570> will<00:06:17.720> do<00:06:17.840> is

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
boil so at this stage what we will do is

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:26.740 
boil so at this stage what we will do is
we'll<00:06:18.230> add<00:06:18.380> the<00:06:18.590> dal

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.290 

a<00:06:26.840> word<00:06:27.530> the<00:06:27.710> doll<00:06:27.890> is<00:06:28.100> going<00:06:28.340> to<00:06:28.460> do<00:06:28.580> is<00:06:28.760> going

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
a word the doll is going to do is going

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.720 
a word the doll is going to do is going

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:31.730 
to give it a nice body and also it's

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.820 
to give it a nice body and also it's
going<00:06:31.880> to<00:06:31.970> tone<00:06:32.210> down<00:06:32.240> the<00:06:33.140> flavor<00:06:33.560> of<00:06:33.620> the

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
going to tone down the flavor of the

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.580 
going to tone down the flavor of the
tamarind<00:06:34.510> as<00:06:35.510> you<00:06:35.660> can<00:06:35.840> see<00:06:35.990> this<00:06:36.170> is<00:06:36.320> boiling

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.590 
tamarind as you can see this is boiling

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:43.000 
tamarind as you can see this is boiling
so<00:06:37.420> now<00:06:38.420> we<00:06:38.480> will<00:06:38.780> just<00:06:39.140> reduce<00:06:39.770> the<00:06:40.130> flame<00:06:42.010> we

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.010 
so now we will just reduce the flame we

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:47.170 
so now we will just reduce the flame we
will<00:06:43.190> add<00:06:43.310> the<00:06:43.490> paste<00:06:45.580> now<00:06:46.580> what<00:06:46.850> is<00:06:46.970> going<00:06:47.090> to

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180 
will add the paste now what is going to

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.130 
will add the paste now what is going to
happen<00:06:47.510> is<00:06:47.630> this<00:06:47.720> is<00:06:47.780> going<00:06:47.930> to<00:06:48.020> thicken

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:48.140 
happen is this is going to thicken

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.400 
happen is this is going to thicken
further<00:06:49.240> as<00:06:50.240> you<00:06:50.390> can<00:06:50.540> see<00:06:50.720> this<00:06:50.870> is<00:06:51.020> nice<00:06:51.350> and

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:51.410 
further as you can see this is nice and

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.890 
further as you can see this is nice and
thick<00:06:51.830> I<00:06:52.400> think<00:06:53.090> I'll<00:06:53.180> add<00:06:53.270> a<00:06:53.330> little<00:06:53.570> bit<00:06:53.780> of

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 
thick I think I'll add a little bit of

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.960 
thick I think I'll add a little bit of
water<00:06:54.080> is<00:06:54.920> the<00:06:55.070> same<00:06:55.280> water<00:06:55.520> with<00:06:55.790> the<00:06:55.880> masala

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:57.970 
water is the same water with the masala

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.110 
water is the same water with the masala
you<00:06:58.970> see<00:06:59.180> nothing<00:06:59.720> gets<00:07:00.380> wasted<00:07:00.500> and<00:07:01.250> you<00:07:01.970> also

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 
you see nothing gets wasted and you also

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:07.930 
you see nothing gets wasted and you also
add<00:07:02.360> the<00:07:02.510> salt<00:07:02.750> to<00:07:02.930> taste<00:07:06.460> it's<00:07:07.460> always<00:07:07.760> better
