looked after and it's okay to just rush

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.330 
looked after and it's okay to just rush
into<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:22.079> situations<00:03:22.709> that<00:03:22.769> are<00:03:22.950> coming<00:03:23.220> up

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
into the situations that are coming up

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.729 
into the situations that are coming up
that<00:03:24.060> may<00:03:24.209> seem<00:03:24.269> like<00:03:24.630> really<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.959> responsible

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
that may seem like really a responsible

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.830 
that may seem like really a responsible
advice<00:03:26.070> but<00:03:26.370> I<00:03:26.549> really<00:03:27.239> don't<00:03:27.420> think<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.720> is

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
advice but I really don't think it is

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.050 
advice but I really don't think it is
because<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.290> outcome<00:03:28.680> is<00:03:28.709> positive<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.549> also

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
because the outcome is positive and also

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.059 
because the outcome is positive and also
sometimes<00:03:30.450> we<00:03:30.600> have<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:30.840> we<00:03:31.620> have<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.829> act

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
sometimes we have to we have to act

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.280 
sometimes we have to we have to act
quickly<00:03:32.459> we<00:03:33.299> have<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.600> make<00:03:33.780> quick<00:03:34.260> decisions

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
quickly we have to make quick decisions

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.110 
quickly we have to make quick decisions
sometimes<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.370> get<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:35.640> best<00:03:35.760> out<00:03:35.970> of<00:03:36.000> life

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
sometimes to get the best out of life

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.710 
sometimes to get the best out of life
and<00:03:36.480> that's<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.870> case<00:03:37.049> today<00:03:37.700> 12<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:39.810> 8<00:03:40.620> is<00:03:41.720> 10

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
and that's the case today 12 and 8 is 10

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.800 
and that's the case today 12 and 8 is 10
and<00:03:42.930> 10<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:43.950> reduces<00:03:44.579> to<00:03:44.790> number<00:03:45.120> one<00:03:45.329> and<00:03:45.630> one

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
and 10 it reduces to number one and one

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.289 
and 10 it reduces to number one and one
is<00:03:45.840> about<00:03:46.459> creation<00:03:47.459> it's<00:03:47.609> the<00:03:47.760> magician<00:03:48.180> is

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
is about creation it's the magician is

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.379 
is about creation it's the magician is
new<00:03:48.510> beginnings<00:03:49.019> its<00:03:49.609> leadership<00:03:50.609> it's

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389
