this series of lessons that I called
stretch<00:00:15.850> into<00:00:16.029> blues<00:00:16.360> where<00:00:17.230> we<00:00:17.320> take<00:00:17.500> two

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
stretch into blues where we take two

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.860 
stretch into blues where we take two
minor<00:00:17.980> pentatonic<00:00:18.370> scale<00:00:18.880> and<00:00:19.060> add<00:00:19.480> something

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:19.870 
minor pentatonic scale and add something

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.250 
minor pentatonic scale and add something
new<00:00:20.050> to<00:00:20.470> it<00:00:20.500> for<00:00:20.890> each<00:00:21.040> of<00:00:21.340> these<00:00:21.460> lessons<00:00:22.260> so

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 
new to it for each of these lessons so

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.170 
new to it for each of these lessons so
we're<00:00:23.410> working<00:00:23.560> with<00:00:23.890> a<00:00:24.190> minor<00:00:24.760> pentatonic

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
we're working with a minor pentatonic

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.890 
we're working with a minor pentatonic
scale<00:00:25.810> and<00:00:29.310> we<00:00:30.310> have<00:00:30.460> so<00:00:30.610> far<00:00:30.789> added<00:00:31.300> the<00:00:31.570> major

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
scale and we have so far added the major

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:42.800 
scale and we have so far added the major
third<00:00:32.289> to<00:00:32.500> it<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:37.570> then<00:00:37.840> the<00:00:37.989> major<00:00:38.140> six

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:42.810 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:54.230 

and<00:00:43.810> the<00:00:44.530> flat<00:00:44.740> five<00:00:52.410> yes<00:00:53.410> to<00:00:53.530> show<00:00:53.590> you<00:00:53.770> what

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.240 
and the flat five yes to show you what

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.000 
and the flat five yes to show you what
more<00:00:55.240> options<00:00:55.810> you<00:00:55.960> come<00:00:56.260> up<00:00:56.380> you<00:00:56.680> can<00:00:56.860> come<00:00:56.980> up

more options you come up you can come up

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.970 
more options you come up you can come up
with<00:00:57.310> when<00:00:57.550> you<00:00:57.640> add<00:00:57.760> those<00:00:57.940> notes<00:00:58.270> so<00:00:59.080> this

week<00:01:00.340> I<00:01:00.700> have<00:01:01.030> another<00:01:01.690> note<00:01:01.930> so<00:01:02.260> if<00:01:02.470> we<00:01:02.650> look

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
week I have another note so if we look

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.890 
week I have another note so if we look
at<00:01:03.100> what<00:01:03.580> we<00:01:03.760> have<00:01:03.880> so<00:01:04.059> far<00:01:04.089> we<00:01:04.270> have<00:01:04.479> actually

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
at what we have so far we have actually

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.640 
at what we have so far we have actually
eight<00:01:05.110> notes

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
eight notes

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.080 
eight notes
one<00:01:06.490> two<00:01:07.300> three<00:01:08.080> four<00:01:08.890> five<00:01:09.850> six<00:01:10.690> seven<00:01:11.530> eight

one two three four five six seven eight

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.420 
one two three four five six seven eight
and<00:01:13.090> then<00:01:13.869> it<00:01:13.990> starts<00:01:14.259> over<00:01:14.380> with<00:01:14.800> one<00:01:15.040> and

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
and then it starts over with one and

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.999 
and then it starts over with one and
today<00:01:16.090> we're<00:01:16.270> gonna<00:01:16.330> add<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:17.200> second<00:01:17.770> the

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
today we're gonna add the second the

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.550 
today we're gonna add the second the
major<00:01:18.280> second<00:01:18.850> which<00:01:18.970> is<00:01:19.000> the<00:01:19.180> note<00:01:19.509> B<00:01:19.780> here<00:01:22.560> so

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
major second which is the note B here so

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.710 
major second which is the note B here so
now<00:01:23.680> we<00:01:23.710> have<00:01:23.979> nine<00:01:24.369> notes<00:01:24.820> to<00:01:25.090> work<00:01:25.240> with<00:01:25.479> so

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
now we have nine notes to work with so

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.400 
now we have nine notes to work with so
this<00:01:25.900> is<00:01:26.050> a<00:01:26.259> formal<00:01:27.220> hybrid<00:01:27.790> scale<00:01:28.200> we<00:01:29.200> take

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
this is a formal hybrid scale we take

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.190 
this is a formal hybrid scale we take
the<00:01:29.530> minor<00:01:29.740> pentatonic<00:01:29.860> scale<00:01:30.430> we<00:01:30.610> add<00:01:31.200> scale

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
the minor pentatonic scale we add scale

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.320 
the minor pentatonic scale we add scale
degrees<00:01:32.530> to<00:01:32.770> it<00:01:32.920> just<00:01:33.130> to<00:01:33.280> come<00:01:33.430> up<00:01:33.580> with<00:01:33.729> more

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
degrees to it just to come up with more

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.310 
degrees to it just to come up with more
choices<00:01:35.290> when<00:01:35.950> we<00:01:36.100> improvise<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.750> now<00:01:38.050> when<00:01:38.290> we

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
choices when we improvise so now when we

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.620 
choices when we improvise so now when we
have<00:01:38.649> the<00:01:39.220> major<00:01:39.520> second<00:01:40.119> there's<00:01:40.270> a<00:01:40.330> couple

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
have the major second there's a couple

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.350 
have the major second there's a couple
of<00:01:40.780> things<00:01:40.960> to<00:01:41.320> note<00:01:41.560> one<00:01:42.520> obvious<00:01:43.000> thing<00:01:43.030> what

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
of things to note one obvious thing what

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.780 
of things to note one obvious thing what
we<00:01:43.450> could<00:01:43.630> do<00:01:43.750> is<00:01:43.899> to<00:01:44.080> go<00:01:44.259> from<00:01:44.560> we<00:01:45.490> have<00:01:45.670> it

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
we could do is to go from we have it

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.850 
we could do is to go from we have it
here<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:47.680> also<00:01:47.830> have<00:01:47.920> it<00:01:48.100> here<00:01:48.960> B<00:01:49.960> you<00:01:50.590> could

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
here you also have it here B you could

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.340 
here you also have it here B you could
go<00:01:51.130> from<00:01:51.370> the<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:52.360> second<00:01:52.750> all<00:01:52.900> the<00:01:53.020> way<00:01:53.050> up<00:01:53.200> to

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
go from the the second all the way up to

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.460 
go from the the second all the way up to
the<00:01:53.440> five<00:01:53.680> chromatically<00:01:54.400> from<00:01:55.030> B<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:55.600> e<00:01:55.630> that

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
the five chromatically from B to e that

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:03.240 
the five chromatically from B to e that
would<00:01:56.560> be<00:01:56.650> like<00:01:56.799> this<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:02.560> create<00:02:02.860> ideas

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
would be like this and create ideas

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:22.589 
would be like this and create ideas
based<00:02:03.580> on<00:02:03.729> that

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.360

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
show you how we can use triads over this

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.270 
show you how we can use triads over this
progression<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:35.470> even<00:02:36.470> just<00:02:36.890> over<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.130> one

four<00:02:53.510> chord<00:02:53.840> when<00:02:54.650> you're<00:02:54.799> on<00:02:55.069> your<00:02:55.370> way<00:02:55.400> back

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
four chord when you're on your way back

four chord when you're on your way back
to<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.569> one<00:02:56.780> chord<00:02:57.110> so<00:02:57.650> I'll<00:02:58.430> do<00:02:58.700> both

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
to the one chord so I'll do both

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.030 
to the one chord so I'll do both
in<00:02:59.180> this<00:02:59.690> demonstration<00:03:00.290> here<00:03:00.829> and<00:03:00.950> you'll

in this demonstration here and you'll

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:24.940 
in this demonstration here and you'll
see<00:03:01.280> what<00:03:01.400> I<00:03:01.430> mean

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.070 

see<00:03:25.950> how<00:03:26.099> that<00:03:26.160> that<00:03:27.060> song<00:03:27.330> had<00:03:27.480> like<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.780> nice

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
see how that that song had like a nice

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.670 
see how that that song had like a nice
move<00:03:28.470> from<00:03:28.970> from<00:03:29.970> these<00:03:30.900> different<00:03:31.319> triads

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
move from from these different triads

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.089 
move from from these different triads
back<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.510> one<00:03:33.690> chord<00:03:34.020> so<00:03:34.709> what's

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
back to the to the one chord so what's

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.770 
back to the to the one chord so what's
been<00:03:35.220> doing<00:03:35.459> here<00:03:35.580> I'm<00:03:35.670> playing<00:03:35.910> E<00:03:36.120> minor

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
been doing here I'm playing E minor

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.990 
been doing here I'm playing E minor
triad<00:03:37.319> so<00:03:37.560> I'm<00:03:37.680> on<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:37.950> on<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.430> ninth<00:03:38.760> fret<00:03:38.910> on

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
triad so I'm on the on the ninth fret on

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.130 
triad so I'm on the on the ninth fret on
the<00:03:39.150> g<00:03:39.360> string<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:40.700> just<00:03:41.700> plain<00:03:41.910> ninth<00:03:42.900> fret

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
the g string and just plain ninth fret

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.009 
the g string and just plain ninth fret
on<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:44.010> g<00:03:44.340> string<00:03:44.370> 8th<00:03:45.330> fret<00:03:45.510> on<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.840> B<00:03:45.900> string

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
on the g string 8th fret on the B string

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.430 
on the g string 8th fret on the B string
and<00:03:46.849> 7th<00:03:47.849> fret<00:03:48.030> on<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.330> E<00:03:48.450> string<00:03:48.959> so<00:03:48.989> that<00:03:49.290> is

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
and 7th fret on the E string so that is

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.670 
and 7th fret on the E string so that is
a<00:03:49.470> minor<00:03:49.830> triad<00:03:50.220> a<00:03:50.989> minor<00:03:51.989> so<00:03:52.260> it's<00:03:52.290> part<00:03:52.650> of

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
a minor triad a minor so it's part of

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.120 
a minor triad a minor so it's part of
that<00:03:52.739> chord<00:03:53.130> that<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:53.370> probably<00:03:53.519> know

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
that chord that you probably know

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.340 
that chord that you probably know
and<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.910> way<00:03:56.060> I'm<00:03:56.210> playing<00:03:56.450> it<00:03:56.660> I'm<00:03:56.900> starting

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
and the way I'm playing it I'm starting

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.120 
and the way I'm playing it I'm starting
on<00:03:57.380> the<00:03:57.500> lowest<00:03:57.770> note<00:03:58.040> for<00:03:58.280> this<00:03:58.370> triad<00:03:59.980> up<00:04:00.980> to

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
on the lowest note for this triad up to

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.420 
on the lowest note for this triad up to
the<00:04:01.220> highest<00:04:01.400> then<00:04:02.000> I<00:04:02.030> go<00:04:02.270> down<00:04:02.300> to<00:04:02.860> this<00:04:03.860> fifth

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
the highest then I go down to this fifth

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.800 
the highest then I go down to this fifth
fret<00:04:04.670> on<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.880> e-string

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
fret on the e-string

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.890 
fret on the e-string
and<00:04:06.020> play<00:04:06.260> D<00:04:06.620> major<00:04:06.890> triad<00:04:07.690> backwards<00:04:08.690> so<00:04:08.840> to

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
and play D major triad backwards so to

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.330 
and play D major triad backwards so to
speak<00:04:09.170> from<00:04:09.380> the<00:04:09.470> highest<00:04:09.620> note<00:04:10.010> to<00:04:10.250> the

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
speak from the highest note to the

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.190 
speak from the highest note to the
lowest<00:04:10.640> so<00:04:10.850> that's<00:04:12.880> 5th<00:04:13.880> fret<00:04:14.120> E<00:04:14.300> string<00:04:14.330> and

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
lowest so that's 5th fret E string and

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.010 
lowest so that's 5th fret E string and
then<00:04:15.650> 7th<00:04:16.130> fret<00:04:16.370> on<00:04:16.640> the<00:04:17.150> B<00:04:17.239> string<00:04:17.420> and<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:17.989> g

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.020 
then 7th fret on the B string and the g

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.340 
then 7th fret on the B string and the g
string

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
string

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.750 
string
so<00:04:21.350> those<00:04:21.500> are<00:04:21.650> two<00:04:21.680> tries<00:04:22.130> to<00:04:22.370> work<00:04:22.550> well

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
so those are two tries to work well

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:29.340 
so those are two tries to work well
together<00:04:22.940> you<00:04:23.270> can<00:04:23.420> play<00:04:23.600> these<00:04:23.960> any<00:04:24.350> time

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.680 

over<00:04:30.350> the<00:04:30.530> one<00:04:30.650> chord<00:04:30.920> pretty<00:04:31.160> much<00:04:31.690> in

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
over the one chord pretty much in

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.210 
over the one chord pretty much in
addition<00:04:33.080> to<00:04:33.200> your<00:04:33.380> minor<00:04:33.800> pentatonic<00:04:34.070> stuff

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
addition to your minor pentatonic stuff

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.380 
addition to your minor pentatonic stuff
after<00:04:37.220> that<00:04:37.280> then<00:04:37.580> I<00:04:37.730> came<00:04:37.790> back<00:04:38.030> in<00:04:38.420> on<00:04:40.390> that's

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
after that then I came back in on that's

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.790 
after that then I came back in on that's
a<00:04:41.450> cool<00:04:41.660> move<00:04:41.810> because<00:04:42.110> I'm<00:04:42.260> playing<00:04:42.680> the

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
a cool move because I'm playing the

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.080 
a cool move because I'm playing the
minor<00:04:43.100> third<00:04:43.490> here<00:04:43.940> the<00:04:44.630> note<00:04:44.810> C<00:04:45.080> of<00:04:45.290> a<00:04:45.760> up<00:04:46.760> to

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
minor third here the note C of a up to

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.590 
minor third here the note C of a up to
the<00:04:47.180> major<00:04:47.330> third<00:04:47.660> and<00:04:49.360> then<00:04:50.360> I'll<00:04:50.450> play<00:04:50.570> a

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
the major third and then I'll play a

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.110 
the major third and then I'll play a
root<00:04:50.810> note<00:04:51.050> on<00:04:51.320> the<00:04:51.410> D<00:04:51.560> string<00:04:51.670> on<00:04:52.670> the<00:04:52.820> seventh

root note on the D string on the seventh

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.800 
root note on the D string on the seventh
fret<00:04:53.270> and<00:04:54.010> then<00:04:55.010> the<00:04:55.670> fifth<00:04:56.000> on<00:04:56.240> the<00:04:56.300> a<00:04:56.450> string

minor<00:05:03.260> 7th<00:05:03.860> interval<00:05:05.440> so<00:05:06.440> here<00:05:06.650> is<00:05:06.800> a<00:05:06.830> whole

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
minor 7th interval so here is a whole

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:19.150 
minor 7th interval so here is a whole
lick<00:05:07.340> played<00:05:07.730> slowly

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.440 

and<00:05:20.160> you<00:05:20.250> can<00:05:20.400> add<00:05:20.550> stuff<00:05:20.820> at<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:21.060> end

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:34.500 

think<00:05:26.200> like<00:05:26.320> that<00:05:32.250> so<00:05:33.250> with<00:05:33.970> let's<00:05:34.180> play<00:05:34.300> it

think like that so with let's play it

00:05:34.510 --> 00:06:08.019 
think like that so with let's play it
together<00:05:34.750> with<00:05:35.050> the<00:05:35.530> track<00:05:35.770> again

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:08.029 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:10.850

and so on so I hope you can see the

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.239 
and so on so I hope you can see the
power<00:06:11.159> of<00:06:11.279> triads<00:06:11.939> how<00:06:12.899> triose<00:06:13.409> can<00:06:13.710> make<00:06:13.889> your

00:06:14.239 --> 00:06:14.249 
power of triads how triose can make your

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:17.570 
power of triads how triose can make your
planes<00:06:14.580> sound<00:06:15.029> more<00:06:15.389> melodic<00:06:15.749> and<00:06:16.199> less<00:06:16.919> scale

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
planes sound more melodic and less scale

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:26.540 
planes sound more melodic and less scale
oriented<00:06:24.469> and<00:06:25.469> I<00:06:25.529> use<00:06:25.649> tried<00:06:25.919> a<00:06:25.949> lot<00:06:26.159> in<00:06:26.399> my

oriented and I use tried a lot in my
plane<00:06:26.789> because<00:06:27.149> I<00:06:27.270> think<00:06:27.330> it<00:06:27.629> really<00:06:27.869> is<00:06:28.050> a

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
plane because I think it really is a

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.559 
plane because I think it really is a
good<00:06:28.289> addition<00:06:28.619> to<00:06:28.979> the<00:06:29.639> pentatonic<00:06:29.969> scale

and the blue scale and so on but a

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.600 
and the blue scale and so on but a
little<00:06:32.909> piece<00:06:33.029> of<00:06:33.059> advice<00:06:33.389> and<00:06:34.050> when<00:06:34.169> you<00:06:34.289> use

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610
