00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
tip of that so I couldn't see it

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.470 
tip of that so I couldn't see it
especially<00:03:16.320> at<00:03:16.800> night<00:03:17.040> but<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:18.090> get<00:03:18.270> your

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
so yeah there it is in a nutshell that's

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.190 
so yeah there it is in a nutshell that's
a<00:03:36.219> nice<00:03:36.400> gun<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.969> carry<00:03:37.269> it's<00:03:37.599> a<00:03:37.659> nice<00:03:37.810> gun<00:03:38.079> in

the<00:03:38.260> home<00:03:39.750> if<00:03:40.750> you<00:03:40.989> can<00:03:41.079> deal<00:03:41.230> with<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.469> white

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
the home if you can deal with the white

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.990 
the home if you can deal with the white
it's<00:03:42.280> worth<00:03:42.489> it

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
it's worth it

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.899 
it's worth it
the<00:03:43.900> one<00:03:44.140> other<00:03:44.680> drawback<00:03:45.189> I<00:03:45.340> found<00:03:45.639> to<00:03:45.790> this

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:45.909 
the one other drawback I found to this

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.809 
the one other drawback I found to this
gun<00:03:46.180> besides<00:03:46.540> more<00:03:47.200> safety<00:03:47.650> than<00:03:48.099> Fort<00:03:48.760> Knox

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
gun besides more safety than Fort Knox

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.190 
gun besides more safety than Fort Knox
with<00:03:49.299> the<00:03:50.290> breakdown<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:52.750> I'm<00:03:52.810> pretty<00:03:53.019> sure

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
with the breakdown and I'm pretty sure

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.860 
with the breakdown and I'm pretty sure
it's<00:03:53.379> because<00:03:53.739> it's<00:03:54.519> fairly<00:03:54.700> new<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:55.599> it<00:03:55.719> has

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
it's because it's fairly new and it has

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.670 
it's because it's fairly new and it has
been<00:03:56.049> so<00:03:56.290> light<00:03:57.030> basically<00:03:58.030> you<00:03:58.510> have<00:03:58.750> to<00:03:59.019> get

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
been so light basically you have to get

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.869 
been so light basically you have to get
to<00:03:59.889> get<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.549> did<00:04:01.419> lock<00:04:01.659> back<00:04:02.430> this<00:04:03.430> is<00:04:03.639> how<00:04:03.819> you

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
to get the did lock back this is how you

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.369 
to get the did lock back this is how you
break<00:04:04.120> it<00:04:04.269> down<00:04:04.389> but<00:04:04.689> pushing<00:04:04.900> this<00:04:05.049> forward

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
break it down but pushing this forward

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.309 
break it down but pushing this forward
and<00:04:05.500> this<00:04:05.590> thing<00:04:05.859> is<00:04:06.069> extremely<00:04:06.280> stiff<00:04:09.299> so

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
and this thing is extremely stiff so

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.539 
and this thing is extremely stiff so
working<00:04:11.319> on<00:04:11.500> that<00:04:11.560> training<00:04:12.280> it<00:04:12.370> down<00:04:12.519> a

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
working on that training it down a

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.259 
working on that training it down a
little<00:04:12.669> smoother<00:04:13.709> I<00:04:14.709> did<00:04:15.099> polish<00:04:15.459> the<00:04:15.609> rim<00:04:15.849> on

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
little smoother I did polish the rim on

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.460 
little smoother I did polish the rim on
the<00:04:17.019> inside<00:04:17.560> can<00:04:18.370> I<00:04:18.430> tell<00:04:18.820> you<00:04:18.910> one<00:04:19.060> handed<00:04:19.470> but

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
the inside can I tell you one handed but

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.890 
the inside can I tell you one handed but
did<00:04:20.650> polish<00:04:20.979> the<00:04:21.130> ramp<00:04:21.340> on<00:04:21.519> the<00:04:21.549> inside<00:04:22.000> so

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
did polish the ramp on the inside so

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.689 
did polish the ramp on the inside so
definitely<00:04:23.680> not<00:04:23.770> have<00:04:24.130> to<00:04:24.250> worry<00:04:24.400> about

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
definitely not have to worry about

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.990 
definitely not have to worry about
misfeeds<00:04:25.539> because<00:04:25.990> of<00:04:26.110> that<00:04:26.289> I<00:04:26.669> do<00:04:27.669> that<00:04:27.910> on

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
misfeeds because of that I do that on

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.700 
misfeeds because of that I do that on
all<00:04:28.090> my<00:04:28.270> guns<00:04:28.479> except<00:04:28.870> for<00:04:28.990> my<00:04:29.080> Glocks<00:04:29.349> I
