to the kiddie Tovar session on fight

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.610 
to the kiddie Tovar session on fight
really<00:02:46.849> fast<00:02:47.180> it's<00:02:47.720> like<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:48.019> anime<00:02:48.290> was<00:02:48.440> just

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
really fast it's like the anime was just

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.140 
really fast it's like the anime was just
building<00:02:48.980> up<00:02:49.099> to<00:02:49.310> this<00:02:49.430> so<00:02:49.610> I<00:02:49.640> thought<00:02:49.970> we'd

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
building up to this so I thought we'd

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.210 
building up to this so I thought we'd
see<00:02:50.329> this<00:02:50.480> on<00:02:50.660> a<00:02:50.690> much<00:02:50.959> later<00:02:51.140> episode<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:52.160> I

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
see this on a much later episode and I

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.710 
see this on a much later episode and I
still<00:02:52.489> think<00:02:52.670> we<00:02:52.760> will<00:02:52.880> see<00:02:53.090> them<00:02:53.239> fight<00:02:53.450> again

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
still think we will see them fight again

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.660 
still think we will see them fight again
and<00:02:53.900> it<00:02:54.049> will<00:02:54.170> be<00:02:54.319> much<00:02:54.650> more<00:02:54.890> epic<00:02:55.220> because

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
and it will be much more epic because

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.460 
and it will be much more epic because
this<00:02:55.970> was<00:02:56.120> more<00:02:56.329> of<00:02:56.360> Kitty<00:02:56.660> tone<00:02:56.900> not<00:02:57.079> caring

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
this was more of Kitty tone not caring

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.770 
this was more of Kitty tone not caring
if<00:02:57.530> he<00:02:57.680> dies<00:02:57.829> and<00:02:58.489> chanel<00:02:58.790> just<00:02:58.819> panicking<00:02:59.599> and

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
if he dies and chanel just panicking and

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.600 
if he dies and chanel just panicking and
then<00:03:00.260> it's<00:03:00.410> just<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.739> scene<00:03:00.980> that<00:03:01.160> I<00:03:01.340> don't

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
then it's just the scene that I don't

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:02.589 
then it's just the scene that I don't
understand<00:03:02.060> at<00:03:02.180> all

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
understand at all

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.360 
understand at all
like<00:03:02.870> I<00:03:02.959> get<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.260> Kitty<00:03:03.470> toe<00:03:03.680> just<00:03:03.920> slices<00:03:04.250> her

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
like I get the Kitty toe just slices her

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.699 
like I get the Kitty toe just slices her
bullet<00:03:04.700> in<00:03:04.790> half<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:05.299> grabs<00:03:05.959> shit<00:03:06.230> on<00:03:06.349> so<00:03:06.620> she

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
bullet in half and grabs shit on so she

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.949 
bullet in half and grabs shit on so she
can't<00:03:07.099> shoot<00:03:07.549> him<00:03:07.819> because<00:03:08.690> he<00:03:08.840> is<00:03:08.870> the

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
can't shoot him because he is the

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.420 
can't shoot him because he is the
ultimate<00:03:09.140> game<00:03:09.590> room<00:03:09.860> but<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.130> don't
