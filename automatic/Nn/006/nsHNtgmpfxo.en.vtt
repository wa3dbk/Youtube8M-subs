00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
to do it and then what you want to work

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.359 
to do it and then what you want to work
on<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.689> know<00:01:33.780> go<00:01:33.990> back<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.409> forth<00:01:34.650> with<00:01:34.740> with

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
on you know go back and forth with with

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.370 
on you know go back and forth with with
with<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> partner<00:01:36.060> or<00:01:36.299> with<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.780> teammate<00:01:37.229> or

with a partner or with a teammate or
something<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:37.950> then<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.520> want<00:01:38.670> to

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
something like that but then you want to

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.690 
something like that but then you want to
start<00:01:38.939> working<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.799> chopping<00:01:40.799> into<00:01:41.070> space

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
start working on chopping into space

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.039 
start working on chopping into space
chopping<00:01:42.150> where<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.329> want<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.570> go<00:01:42.689> because<00:01:42.899> a

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
chopping where you want to go because a

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.389 
chopping where you want to go because a
lot<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.259> times<00:01:43.530> if<00:01:43.710> there's<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.979> defender

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
lot of times if there's a defender

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.340 
lot of times if there's a defender
coming<00:01:44.640> straight<00:01:45.090> at<00:01:45.149> me<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:46.079> know<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.200> don't

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
coming straight at me you know I don't

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
should see them coming and then you know

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.800 
should see them coming and then you know
if<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.100> need<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.280> chest<00:01:50.549> wrap<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.880> away<00:01:51.090> you

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
if you need to chest wrap it away you

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.660 
if you need to chest wrap it away you
know<00:01:51.899> just<00:01:51.930> wrap<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.590> away<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.070> get<00:01:53.460> away<00:01:53.549> from

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
know just wrap it away and get away from

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.630 
know just wrap it away and get away from
and<00:01:54.119> go<00:01:54.240> into<00:01:54.390> space<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:56.100> those<00:01:56.280> are<00:01:56.399> some

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
and go into space so so those are some

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.859 
and go into space so so those are some
of<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.790> things<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.060> need<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.240> be<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.750> be

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
of the things you need to be to be

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.109 
of the things you need to be to be
concerned<00:01:58.530> with<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.100> really<00:01:59.549> practice

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
concerned with and really practice

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.880 
concerned with and really practice
because<00:02:00.479> that's<00:02:01.110> what's<00:02:01.320> going<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.469> enable

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
because that's what's going to enable

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.580 
because that's what's going to enable
you<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.759> kind<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.090> have<00:02:03.780> what<00:02:04.290> they<00:02:04.409> call

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
you to to kind of have what they call

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.109 
you to to kind of have what they call
like<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.799> sticky<00:02:05.159> foot<00:02:05.460> on<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.670> ball<00:02:05.850> but

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
like a sticky foot on the ball but

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.240 
like a sticky foot on the ball but
obviously<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.110> case<00:02:07.320> what<00:02:08.099> that

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
obviously on this in this case what that

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.729 
obviously on this in this case what that
means<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.759> you're<00:02:09.119> keeping<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.509> ball

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
means is is you're keeping the ball

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.290 
means is is you're keeping the ball
collectively<00:02:10.739> right<00:02:11.099> near<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.550> it's<00:02:12.000> always

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
collectively right near you it's always

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.300 
collectively right near you it's always
within<00:02:12.480> you

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
within you

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.860 
within you
a<00:02:13.340> yard<00:02:13.700> radius<00:02:13.940> where<00:02:14.300> you<00:02:14.360> always<00:02:14.569> have

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
a yard radius where you always have

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.300 
a yard radius where you always have
control<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.380> ball<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.739> that's<00:02:15.830> what<00:02:16.220> you

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
control the ball and that's what you

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.160 
control the ball and that's what you
want<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:16.520> do<00:02:16.580> with<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.760> chest<00:02:17.000> trap<00:02:17.180> so<00:02:17.420> remember

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
want to do with a chest trap so remember

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.500 
want to do with a chest trap so remember
that<00:02:18.319> you<00:02:18.410> actually<00:02:18.770> you<00:02:19.220> know<00:02:19.340> let<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.300> ball

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
that you actually you know let the ball

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.970 
that you actually you know let the ball
do<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.780> work<00:02:21.050> you<00:02:21.530> don't<00:02:21.709> need<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:21.920> always

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
do the work you don't need to always

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.500 
do the work you don't need to always
just<00:02:22.370> go<00:02:22.580> after<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:23.030> or<00:02:23.090> anything<00:02:23.239> like<00:02:23.450> that

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
right down or if you need to go into

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.930 
right down or if you need to go into
space<00:02:26.569> turn<00:02:27.170> hit<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:27.709> go<00:02:27.800> into<00:02:27.950> space<00:02:28.130> you

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
space turn hit and go into space you

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.190 
space turn hit and go into space you
know<00:02:29.030> just<00:02:29.209> think<00:02:29.360> of<00:02:29.480> in<00:02:29.569> terms<00:02:29.780> of<00:02:29.930> kind<00:02:30.140> of

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
know just think of in terms of kind of

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.630 
know just think of in terms of kind of
like<00:02:30.349> angles<00:02:30.709> where<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:30.980> want<00:02:31.130> to<00:02:31.190> go<00:02:31.310> with<00:02:31.459> it

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
like angles where you want to go with it

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.180 
like angles where you want to go with it
so<00:02:31.760> again<00:02:32.510> that's<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:33.140> that's<00:02:33.739> how<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:33.950> do<00:02:34.160> a

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
so again that's a that's how to do a
