00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
end of the stock you do get a nice

rubberized<00:01:53.180> shoulder<00:01:53.869> pad<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:55.610> rifle<00:01:56.030> I

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
rubberized shoulder pad the rifle I

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.429 
rubberized shoulder pad the rifle I
would<00:01:56.420> say<00:01:56.630> is<00:01:56.899> 90%<00:01:58.719> ambidextrous<00:01:59.719> and<00:01:59.960> why<00:02:00.380> do

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
would say is 90% ambidextrous and why do

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.920 
would say is 90% ambidextrous and why do
I<00:02:00.560> say<00:02:00.829> that<00:02:00.860> because<00:02:01.549> the<00:02:01.909> stock<00:02:02.299> at<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:02.750> end

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
I say that because the stock at the end

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.830 
I say that because the stock at the end
is<00:02:03.259> slightly<00:02:03.950> more<00:02:04.280> curved<00:02:04.719> towards<00:02:05.719> a
