00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.580 
well the gears are good I've replaced
these<00:00:17.660> new<00:00:18.660> synchro<00:00:19.170> rings<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:20.220> I've<00:00:20.480> bought

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
these new synchro rings that I've bought

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.929 
these new synchro rings that I've bought
to<00:00:22.590> replace<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.160> old<00:00:23.310> ones<00:00:23.550> which<00:00:23.730> were<00:00:23.910> a

little bit worn so it's got all new

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.460 
little bit worn so it's got all new
synchros<00:00:25.800> in<00:00:26.010> there<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.300> third<00:00:28.230> year

synchros in there this is the third year
sink<00:00:29.429> right<00:00:29.519> hub<00:00:31.009> now<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.070> syncro<00:00:32.610> ring

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
sink right hub now the syncro ring

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.889 
sink right hub now the syncro ring
they're<00:00:33.780> all<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.860> very<00:00:35.280> good<00:00:35.520> condition<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.300> am

I've<00:00:39.899> also<00:00:40.110> been<00:00:40.730> rebuilding<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.820> overdrive

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
I've also been rebuilding the overdrive

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.630 
I've also been rebuilding the overdrive
and<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.530> meant<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.829> take<00:00:43.980> some<00:00:44.160> film<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.520> that

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
and I meant to take some film of that

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.970 
and I meant to take some film of that
while<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.879> was<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.000> bits<00:00:45.300> but<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.899> forgot<00:00:46.230> but<00:00:46.860> I

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
while it was in bits but I forgot but I

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.810 
while it was in bits but I forgot but I
all<00:00:47.039> them<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.520> will<00:00:48.270> take<00:00:48.510> something<00:00:48.930> with<00:00:49.110> that

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
all them I will take something with that

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.900 
all them I will take something with that
is<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.180> lay<00:00:51.360> shaft<00:00:51.860> which<00:00:52.860> again<00:00:53.129> isn't<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.730> in

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
is the lay shaft which again isn't is in

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.939 
is the lay shaft which again isn't is in
very<00:00:54.059> good<00:00:54.300> condition<00:00:54.360> there's<00:00:54.989> no<00:00:55.050> real

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
very good condition there's no real

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.860 
very good condition there's no real
noticeable<00:00:56.789> wear<00:00:57.210> other<00:00:57.480> than<00:00:57.719> what<00:00:57.840> you

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
noticeable wear other than what you

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.270 
noticeable wear other than what you
would<00:00:58.050> expect<00:01:00.260> sorry<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.680> yeah<00:01:01.949> I'm

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
would expect sorry the like yeah I'm

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.320 
would expect sorry the like yeah I'm
gonna<00:01:02.640> replace<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.329> lay<00:01:03.510> shaft<00:01:03.539> though<00:01:05.330> it's

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
gonna replace the lay shaft though it's

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.880 
gonna replace the lay shaft though it's
actually<00:01:06.510> pretty<00:01:06.900> good<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.409> initially<00:01:07.860> I

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
actually pretty good and initially I

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.560 
actually pretty good and initially I
thought<00:01:08.220> I'd<00:01:08.340> keep<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.850> but<00:01:09.060> there<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.360> a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
thought I'd keep it but there is a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.530 
thought I'd keep it but there is a
little<00:01:10.500> bit<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.830> wear<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.330> end<00:01:14.119> on<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.330> end

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
little bit of wear in the end on the end

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.560 
little bit of wear in the end on the end
sections<00:01:16.350> there<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:18.180> such<00:01:18.540> a

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
sections there and it's just such a

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.359 
sections there and it's just such a
terrible<00:01:19.020> job<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.320> get<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.530> gearbox<00:01:19.890> out<00:01:20.070> that

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
terrible job to get the gearbox out that

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.960 
terrible job to get the gearbox out that
I<00:01:20.549> think<00:01:22.009> it<00:01:23.009> would<00:01:23.130> be<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> bit<00:01:23.460> silly<00:01:23.700> not<00:01:23.939> to

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
I think it would be a bit silly not to

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.850 
I think it would be a bit silly not to
replace<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.659> at<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:24.990> point<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.530> that's<00:01:25.590> got

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
replace it at this point and that's got

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.950 
replace it at this point and that's got
new<00:01:26.189> bearings<00:01:27.000> I've<00:01:27.180> bought<00:01:27.390> for<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.659> as<00:01:27.780> well

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
new bearings I've bought for it as well

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.850 
new bearings I've bought for it as well
so<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:29.729> next<00:01:29.880> step<00:01:30.060> really<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.140> wait

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
so the next step really is to just wait

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.100 
so the next step really is to just wait
for<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.130> lay<00:01:32.280> shaft<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.820> arrive<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:36.110> continue

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
for the lay shaft to arrive and continue

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.060 
for the lay shaft to arrive and continue
with<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:39.020> overdrive<00:01:41.479> and<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:43.070> second

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
with the overdrive and it's the second

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.929 
with the overdrive and it's the second
of<00:01:44.130> November<00:01:45.290> 2013<00:01:46.290> well<00:01:47.100> here's<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.490> innards

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
of November 2013 well here's the innards

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.999 
of November 2013 well here's the innards
of<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:49.170> overdrive<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.890> again<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.490> meant<00:01:51.090> to

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
of the overdrive and again I meant to

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.170 
of the overdrive and again I meant to
take<00:01:53.009> film<00:01:53.310> with<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.549> before<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.880> put<00:01:54.060> this

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
take film with this before I put this

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.590 
take film with this before I put this
back<00:01:54.360> together<00:01:54.540> but<00:01:54.930> I've<00:01:55.110> I've<00:01:56.450> put<00:01:57.450> some

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
back together but I've I've put some

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.380 
back together but I've I've put some
gaskets<00:01:57.990> here<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.700> brake<00:01:59.700> ring<00:01:59.969> here<00:02:00.180> and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
gaskets here on this brake ring here and

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.760 
gaskets here on this brake ring here and
that's<00:02:00.540> set<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.020> every<00:02:01.200> one<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.350> pull<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.680> apart

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
that's set and every one I pull it apart

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.429 
that's set and every one I pull it apart
again<00:02:02.159> now<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:03.390> was<00:02:03.509> all<00:02:03.719> in<00:02:03.750> very<00:02:04.170> good

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
again now but it was all in very good

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.310 
again now but it was all in very good
condition<00:02:04.920> really<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:06.119> couldn't<00:02:06.990> see<00:02:07.079> any

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
condition really and I couldn't see any

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.180 
condition really and I couldn't see any
issues<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.979> in<00:02:08.190> float<00:02:08.580> with<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.879> Sun<00:02:09.149> wheel

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
issues the in float with the Sun wheel

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.760 
issues the in float with the Sun wheel
here<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.849> Sun<00:02:12.120> gear<00:02:12.390> rather<00:02:12.840> appeared<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.620> be

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
here the Sun gear rather appeared to be

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.160 
here the Sun gear rather appeared to be
really

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
really

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:21.210 
really
good<00:02:14.260> I've<00:02:14.709> replaced<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:20.130> couple<00:02:21.130> of

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.000 
good I've replaced the this couple of
these<00:02:21.340> little<00:02:21.700> washers<00:02:22.090> here<00:02:22.500> which<00:02:23.500> at<00:02:23.860> the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
these little washers here which at the

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.850 
these little washers here which at the
end<00:02:24.130> float<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:25.630> I<00:02:26.110> think<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.500> end<00:02:26.620> float

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
end float and I think the end float

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.280 
end float and I think the end float
isn't<00:02:27.069> within<00:02:27.640> specs<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.300> tried<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.930> measure<00:02:29.140> it

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
isn't within specs I tried to measure it

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.900 
isn't within specs I tried to measure it
in<00:02:29.380> my<00:02:29.470> dial<00:02:29.739> gauge<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.459> seems<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.880> work

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
in my dial gauge and that seems to work

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.380 
in my dial gauge and that seems to work
alright<00:02:32.010> I've<00:02:33.010> got<00:02:33.069> a<00:02:33.250> new<00:02:33.430> set<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:33.730> clutch

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
alright I've got a new set of clutch

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.360 
alright I've got a new set of clutch
springs<00:02:34.840> here<00:02:35.760> which<00:02:36.760> go<00:02:37.360> on<00:02:37.390> these<00:02:38.370> little

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
springs here which go on these little

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.290 
springs here which go on these little
Dover's<00:02:39.850> here<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:42.400> old<00:02:42.550> ones<00:02:42.760> were<00:02:43.000> sort<00:02:43.239> of

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
Dover's here the old ones were sort of

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.620 
Dover's here the old ones were sort of
varying<00:02:43.750> lengths<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:48.030> accumulator<00:02:49.030> piston

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
varying lengths the accumulator piston

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.520 
varying lengths the accumulator piston
and<00:02:50.410> housing<00:02:51.130> which<00:02:51.819> is<00:02:52.000> down<00:02:52.450> inside<00:02:53.019> there<00:02:53.290> I

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
and housing which is down inside there I

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.550 
and housing which is down inside there I
am<00:02:54.459> took<00:02:54.850> that<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:55.870> replaced<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.380> rubber

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
am took that and I replaced the rubber

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.830 
am took that and I replaced the rubber
bushings<00:02:57.010> on<00:02:57.190> that<00:02:57.430> rubber<00:02:57.610> seals<00:02:58.450> on<00:02:58.720> the

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
bushings on that rubber seals on the

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.640 
bushings on that rubber seals on the
housing<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.950> piston<00:03:00.340> was<00:03:00.549> good<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:02.440> rings

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
housing the piston was good the rings

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.309 
housing the piston was good the rings
were<00:03:02.799> all<00:03:02.890> good<00:03:03.190> a<00:03:03.370> little<00:03:04.090> bit<00:03:04.239> of<00:03:04.360> cut<00:03:04.810> bit<00:03:05.200> of

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
were all good a little bit of cut bit of

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.130 
were all good a little bit of cut bit of
slide<00:03:05.709> scoring<00:03:06.489> inside<00:03:06.670> that<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.569> bore<00:03:07.780> but<00:03:08.049> I

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
slide scoring inside that the bore but I

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.990 
slide scoring inside that the bore but I
cleaned<00:03:08.440> that<00:03:08.590> up<00:03:08.650> with<00:03:08.860> some<00:03:09.010> very<00:03:09.220> fine<00:03:09.549> and

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
cleaned that up with some very fine and

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.479 
cleaned that up with some very fine and
emery<00:03:10.930> paper<00:03:10.959> and<00:03:11.380> I<00:03:11.440> think<00:03:11.650> that'll<00:03:11.860> be<00:03:11.890> okay

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
emery paper and I think that'll be okay

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.039 
emery paper and I think that'll be okay
time<00:03:12.850> will<00:03:13.030> tell<00:03:13.209> I<00:03:13.510> suppose<00:03:14.019> when<00:03:14.260> I<00:03:14.640> go<00:03:15.640> to

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
time will tell I suppose when I go to

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.280 
time will tell I suppose when I go to
push<00:03:17.049> that<00:03:17.200> up<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.530> see<00:03:17.680> if<00:03:17.799> it<00:03:17.920> works<00:03:19.140> it's<00:03:20.140> a

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
push that up and see if it works it's a

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.729 
push that up and see if it works it's a
fascinating<00:03:20.530> piece<00:03:21.190> of<00:03:22.170> equipment<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.530> over

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
fascinating piece of equipment the over

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.620 
fascinating piece of equipment the over
driver<00:03:24.010> that<00:03:24.310> was<00:03:24.489> just<00:03:24.730> really<00:03:25.390> quite

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
driver that was just really quite

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.720 
driver that was just really quite
beautiful<00:03:25.900> little<00:03:26.709> rubber<00:03:26.950> seals<00:03:27.340> in<00:03:27.549> there

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
beautiful little rubber seals in there

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.640 
beautiful little rubber seals in there
have<00:03:27.910> been<00:03:28.030> placed<00:03:28.390> this<00:03:28.630> is<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:28.900> oil<00:03:29.079> pump<00:03:29.350> I

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
have been placed this is the oil pump I

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.740 
have been placed this is the oil pump I
didn't<00:03:30.160> remove<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.700> oil<00:03:30.940> pump<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.269> think<00:03:31.690> I

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
didn't remove the oil pump and think I

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.710 
didn't remove the oil pump and think I
really<00:03:31.780> needed<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:33.640> was<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:33.850> bit<00:03:33.970> tricky<00:03:34.150> to

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
really needed to it was a bit tricky to

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.289 
really needed to it was a bit tricky to
get<00:03:34.870> out<00:03:36.390> but<00:03:37.440> his<00:03:39.030> here's<00:03:40.030> one<00:03:40.180> of<00:03:40.239> the

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
get out but his here's one of the

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.759 
get out but his here's one of the
operating<00:03:40.720> Pistons<00:03:41.579> which<00:03:42.579> goes<00:03:42.880> into<00:03:43.209> this

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
operating Pistons which goes into this

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.490 
operating Pistons which goes into this
here<00:03:44.769> there<00:03:45.160> are<00:03:45.220> two<00:03:45.400> of<00:03:45.519> those<00:03:45.640> of<00:03:45.940> course

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
here there are two of those of course

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.229 
here there are two of those of course
and<00:03:47.500> those<00:03:47.769> are<00:03:48.670> in<00:03:48.820> pretty<00:03:49.030> good<00:03:49.120> condition

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
and those are in pretty good condition

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.789 
and those are in pretty good condition
and<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.900> Rings<00:03:50.079> are<00:03:50.320> all<00:03:50.440> good<00:03:50.620> and

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
and the Rings are all good and

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.460 
and the Rings are all good and
everything<00:03:50.890> so<00:03:51.630> I'll<00:03:52.630> be<00:03:52.810> just<00:03:52.989> putting<00:03:53.200> those

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
everything so I'll be just putting those

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.780 
everything so I'll be just putting those
back<00:03:53.530> in<00:03:53.950> and<00:03:54.130> using<00:03:54.459> those<00:03:54.640> so<00:03:54.940> really<00:03:56.730> all<00:03:57.730> I

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
back in and using those so really all I

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.099 
back in and using those so really all I
did<00:03:58.239> in<00:03:58.359> the<00:03:58.480> other<00:03:58.510> driver<00:03:58.959> surprise<00:03:59.560> seals<00:03:59.950> a

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
did in the other driver surprise seals a

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:07.770 
did in the other driver surprise seals a
couple<00:04:02.109> of<00:04:03.329> the<00:04:04.329> bushes<00:04:04.690> and<00:04:06.150> shims<00:04:07.150> rather

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
couple of the bushes and shims rather

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.440 
couple of the bushes and shims rather
just<00:04:08.109> to<00:04:08.260> get<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:08.500> float<00:04:08.709> right<00:04:09.329> and<00:04:11.430> Springs

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
just to get the float right and Springs

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.180 
just to get the float right and Springs
and<00:04:13.450> that's<00:04:13.660> about<00:04:13.810> it<00:04:13.959> I'm<00:04:14.620> not<00:04:14.920> replacing

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
and that's about it I'm not replacing

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.930 
and that's about it I'm not replacing
the<00:04:15.609> accumulator<00:04:16.239> spring<00:04:17.340> which<00:04:18.340> is<00:04:18.370> this<00:04:18.639> big

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
the accumulator spring which is this big

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.440 
the accumulator spring which is this big
one<00:04:19.150> here<00:04:19.620> I<00:04:20.620> was<00:04:21.100> going<00:04:21.400> to<00:04:21.579> but<00:04:21.789> it's<00:04:21.940> within

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
one here I was going to but it's within

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.879 
one here I was going to but it's within
it's<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.680> length<00:04:23.860> it's<00:04:24.070> supposed<00:04:24.400> to<00:04:24.490> be<00:04:24.700> so

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
it's the length it's supposed to be so

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.469 
it's the length it's supposed to be so
I<00:04:25.919> think<00:04:26.039> it's<00:04:26.189> that's<00:04:26.699> sort<00:04:27.030> of<00:04:27.120> pretty<00:04:27.270> good

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
I think it's that's sort of pretty good

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.659 
I think it's that's sort of pretty good
okay<00:04:28.139> we<00:04:28.229> don't<00:04:28.349> see<00:04:28.590> and<00:04:29.009> a<00:04:29.159> lot<00:04:29.310> of<00:04:29.340> the<00:04:29.430> stuff

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
okay we don't see and a lot of the stuff

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.689 
okay we don't see and a lot of the stuff
I<00:04:29.789> can<00:04:30.090> get<00:04:30.330> out<00:04:30.509> if<00:04:30.659> I<00:04:30.840> need<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:31.699> afterwards

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
I can get out if I need to afterwards

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.390 
I can get out if I need to afterwards
without<00:04:33.330> taking<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.900> gearbox<00:04:34.319> out<00:04:34.529> if<00:04:35.099> there

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
without taking the gearbox out if there

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.969 
without taking the gearbox out if there
are<00:04:35.490> any<00:04:35.580> problems<00:04:35.960> but<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.379> whole<00:04:37.560> overdrive

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
are any problems but the whole overdrive

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.010 
are any problems but the whole overdrive
rebuild<00:04:38.430> has<00:04:38.550> actually<00:04:38.819> been<00:04:39.389> quite<00:04:39.569> good<00:04:39.810> fun

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
rebuild has actually been quite good fun

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.129 
rebuild has actually been quite good fun
and<00:04:40.289> it's<00:04:40.409> not<00:04:40.469> as<00:04:40.860> tricky<00:04:41.249> as<00:04:41.990> it<00:04:42.990> might

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
and it's not as tricky as it might

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.739 
and it's not as tricky as it might
appear<00:04:43.169> to<00:04:43.469> be<00:04:44.150> you<00:04:45.150> know<00:04:45.270> it's<00:04:45.479> just<00:04:45.599> a

00:04:45.739 --> 00:04:45.749 
appear to be you know it's just a

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:48.019 
appear to be you know it's just a
beautiful<00:04:46.050> really<00:04:46.949> really<00:04:47.219> clever<00:04:47.490> piece<00:04:47.849> of

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:48.029 
beautiful really really clever piece of

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:51.260 
beautiful really really clever piece of
engineering<00:04:49.069> so<00:04:50.069> and<00:04:50.460> it<00:04:50.550> did<00:04:50.699> work<00:04:50.849> before<00:04:51.240> I

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
engineering so and it did work before I

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.779 
engineering so and it did work before I
took<00:04:51.360> it<00:04:51.509> off<00:04:51.749> the<00:04:51.930> car<00:04:52.189> which<00:04:53.189> is<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.370> good<00:04:53.550> time

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
took it off the car which is a good time

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.200 
took it off the car which is a good time
it<00:04:54.629> was<00:04:54.900> a<00:04:55.229> little<00:04:56.129> bit<00:04:56.249> dirty<00:04:56.400> inside<00:04:56.669> but<00:04:57.090> not

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
it was a little bit dirty inside but not

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.999 
it was a little bit dirty inside but not
incredibly<00:04:57.479> so<00:04:57.990> a<00:04:58.020> little<00:04:58.199> bit<00:04:58.319> of<00:04:58.439> sludge

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
incredibly so a little bit of sludge

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:04.990 
incredibly so a little bit of sludge
I<00:04:59.039> took<00:04:59.430> um<00:05:00.029> I<00:05:00.860> took<00:05:01.860> this<00:05:02.599> whereas<00:05:03.599> it<00:05:03.750> is

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
I took um I took this whereas it is

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.730 
I took um I took this whereas it is
washed<00:05:06.000> plug<00:05:06.210> out<00:05:06.360> here<00:05:06.599> and<00:05:07.020> replace<00:05:07.379> that<00:05:07.409> as

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
washed plug out here and replace that as

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.249 
washed plug out here and replace that as
well<00:05:07.889> and<00:05:08.099> clean<00:05:08.279> out<00:05:08.460> in<00:05:08.610> there<00:05:08.819> so<00:05:09.180> you<00:05:10.139> know

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 
well and clean out in there so you know

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.490 
well and clean out in there so you know
it's<00:05:10.379> pretty<00:05:11.389> well<00:05:12.389> I<00:05:12.599> think<00:05:12.930> it'll<00:05:13.229> be<00:05:13.349> pretty

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
it's pretty well I think it'll be pretty

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.800 
it's pretty well I think it'll be pretty
right<00:05:13.740> but<00:05:14.069> time<00:05:14.969> will<00:05:15.090> tell<00:05:15.330> we'll<00:05:15.539> see<00:05:15.689> what

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
right but time will tell we'll see what

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.800 
right but time will tell we'll see what
happens<00:05:16.110> when<00:05:16.229> I<00:05:16.289> put<00:05:16.860> it<00:05:16.979> back<00:05:17.099> in<00:05:17.689> it's<00:05:18.689> the

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
happens when I put it back in it's the

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.939 
happens when I put it back in it's the
second<00:05:19.080> of<00:05:19.139> November<00:05:20.089> 2013<00:05:21.560> well<00:05:22.560> here's<00:05:22.770> the

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
second of November 2013 well here's the

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.909 
second of November 2013 well here's the
inside<00:05:23.310> of<00:05:23.550> the<00:05:23.669> overdrive<00:05:24.150> and<00:05:24.560> the<00:05:25.560> reason

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
inside of the overdrive and the reason

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.700 
inside of the overdrive and the reason
we're<00:05:26.039> seeing<00:05:26.249> this<00:05:26.839> is<00:05:27.839> because<00:05:28.229> I<00:05:28.349> didn't

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
we're seeing this is because I didn't

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.559 
we're seeing this is because I didn't
line<00:05:28.889> these<00:05:29.189> little<00:05:29.550> louvers<00:05:30.060> up<00:05:30.210> properly

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:30.569 
line these little louvers up properly

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:32.899 
line these little louvers up properly
and<00:05:30.689> it<00:05:31.680> wasn't<00:05:31.889> fitting<00:05:32.310> so<00:05:32.460> I<00:05:32.490> had<00:05:32.610> to<00:05:32.699> pull

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:32.909 
and it wasn't fitting so I had to pull

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:35.929 
and it wasn't fitting so I had to pull
it<00:05:33.060> to<00:05:33.509> bits<00:05:33.689> again<00:05:34.020> and<00:05:34.589> I<00:05:35.129> did<00:05:35.310> know<00:05:35.490> that<00:05:35.759> I

00:05:35.929 --> 00:05:35.939 
it to bits again and I did know that I

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:37.309 
it to bits again and I did know that I
had<00:05:36.150> to<00:05:36.180> do<00:05:36.449> that<00:05:36.629> but<00:05:36.810> I<00:05:36.839> didn't<00:05:37.169> do<00:05:37.259> it

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:37.319 
had to do that but I didn't do it

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:39.110 
had to do that but I didn't do it
properly<00:05:37.439> so<00:05:37.770> anyway<00:05:38.099> that's<00:05:38.430> there<00:05:38.789> these

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
properly so anyway that's there these

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.899 
properly so anyway that's there these
are<00:05:39.180> the<00:05:40.250> pipe<00:05:41.250> wheels

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
are the pipe wheels

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.119 
are the pipe wheels
there's<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:42.960> clutch<00:05:43.169> inside<00:05:43.680> there<00:05:43.919> the

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:44.129 
there's the clutch inside there the

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:46.339 
there's the clutch inside there the
uni-directional<00:05:44.669> clutch<00:05:45.210> and<00:05:45.930> that's<00:05:46.139> the

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
uni-directional clutch and that's the

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:49.159 
uni-directional clutch and that's the
annulus<00:05:46.860> and<00:05:46.889> you<00:05:47.099> can<00:05:47.279> see<00:05:47.430> it<00:05:47.490> all<00:05:47.669> in<00:05:48.169> very

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
annulus and you can see it all in very

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:51.230 
annulus and you can see it all in very
good<00:05:49.289> condition<00:05:49.710> it's<00:05:50.550> very<00:05:50.819> important<00:05:51.149> to

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
good condition it's very important to

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.809 
good condition it's very important to
get<00:05:51.330> these<00:05:51.509> little<00:05:51.750> dots<00:05:52.020> lined<00:05:52.379> up<00:05:52.699> and<00:05:53.699> I

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:53.819 
get these little dots lined up and I

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:56.899 
get these little dots lined up and I
thought<00:05:53.969> I<00:05:54.029> had<00:05:54.300> but<00:05:55.229> clearly<00:05:56.189> I<00:05:56.310> hadn't<00:05:56.729> or

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:56.909 
thought I had but clearly I hadn't or

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:59.450 
thought I had but clearly I hadn't or
something<00:05:57.330> moved<00:05:57.569> so<00:05:58.129> they'll<00:05:59.129> start<00:05:59.339> all

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
something moved so they'll start all

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.730 
something moved so they'll start all
over<00:05:59.520> again<00:05:59.669> but<00:06:00.300> they<00:06:00.479> yeah<00:06:00.659> so<00:06:01.620> I've<00:06:01.680> just

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
over again but they yeah so I've just

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.589 
over again but they yeah so I've just
located<00:06:01.979> the<00:06:02.370> main<00:06:02.610> shaft<00:06:02.909> in<00:06:03.210> there<00:06:03.360> which<00:06:03.449> is

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
located the main shaft in there which is

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:06.019 
located the main shaft in there which is
quite<00:06:03.750> tricky<00:06:04.020> to<00:06:04.259> do<00:06:04.409> and<00:06:04.680> if<00:06:04.979> we<00:06:05.129> turn<00:06:05.399> that<00:06:05.430> I

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:06.029 
quite tricky to do and if we turn that I

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:09.469 
quite tricky to do and if we turn that I
can<00:06:06.360> see<00:06:06.539> how<00:06:06.719> all<00:06:07.399> operates<00:06:08.399> I<00:06:08.639> can't<00:06:09.089> go<00:06:09.300> back

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 
can see how all operates I can't go back

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:11.600 
can see how all operates I can't go back
in<00:06:09.509> that<00:06:09.750> way<00:06:09.990> which<00:06:10.409> is<00:06:10.439> probably<00:06:11.430> right

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
in that way which is probably right

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.550 
in that way which is probably right
because<00:06:12.029> the<00:06:12.180> unidirectional<00:06:12.479> clutch<00:06:13.080> stops

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
because the unidirectional clutch stops

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.899 
because the unidirectional clutch stops
it<00:06:13.740> from<00:06:13.770> moving<00:06:15.740> so<00:06:16.740> that's<00:06:17.189> that's<00:06:17.639> the

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:17.909 
it from moving so that's that's the

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:21.110 
it from moving so that's that's the
inner<00:06:18.180> workings<00:06:19.050> of<00:06:19.169> an<00:06:19.319> overdrive<00:06:20.120> beautiful

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
inner workings of an overdrive beautiful

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.510 
inner workings of an overdrive beautiful
piece<00:06:21.300> of<00:06:21.509> machinery<00:06:21.860> so<00:06:22.860> his<00:06:23.009> little<00:06:23.129> video

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
piece of machinery so his little video

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.700 
piece of machinery so his little video
just<00:06:23.819> to<00:06:24.300> finish<00:06:24.659> up<00:06:24.839> the<00:06:24.960> boxes<00:06:25.409> back

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
just to finish up the boxes back

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.139 
just to finish up the boxes back
together<00:06:26.039> I<00:06:26.520> think<00:06:26.939> it's<00:06:27.509> okay<00:06:27.839> and<00:06:28.939> this<00:06:29.939> I

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:30.149 
together I think it's okay and this I

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:32.350 
together I think it's okay and this I
just<00:06:30.210> figured<00:06:30.629> that<00:06:30.659> main<00:06:31.050> shaft<00:06:31.349> into<00:06:31.680> the

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
just figured that main shaft into the

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.100 
just figured that main shaft into the
splines<00:06:33.360> to<00:06:33.719> make<00:06:33.839> sure<00:06:33.990> they<00:06:34.110> fit<00:06:34.349> the

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
splines to make sure they fit the

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.900 
splines to make sure they fit the
can<00:06:35.470> that<00:06:35.680> operates<00:06:36.040> the<00:06:36.220> oil<00:06:36.430> pump<00:06:36.670> isn't

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
can that operates the oil pump isn't

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.190 
can that operates the oil pump isn't
fitted<00:06:37.390> of<00:06:37.510> the<00:06:37.600> motor<00:06:37.780> and<00:06:37.870> put<00:06:38.320> that<00:06:38.440> on<00:06:38.620> but

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
fitted of the motor and put that on but

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.760 
fitted of the motor and put that on but

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.130 
gearbox pushed into it and here is the

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.730 
gearbox pushed into it and here is the
other<00:06:51.250> half<00:06:51.550> from<00:06:51.940> there<00:06:52.240> that<00:06:53.140> goes<00:06:53.380> on<00:06:53.620> the

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:53.740

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:56.620 
top of the third gear I haven't put on

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.410 
top of the third gear I haven't put on
the<00:06:56.740> man<00:06:56.920> which<00:06:57.040> is<00:06:57.160> just<00:06:57.340> separate<00:06:57.640> cuz<00:06:58.300> that

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:58.420 
the man which is just separate cuz that

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.680 
the man which is just separate cuz that
just<00:06:58.630> comes<00:06:58.840> off<00:06:59.010> well<00:07:00.010> it's<00:07:00.100> the<00:07:00.220> 8th<00:07:00.340> of

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:00.690 
just comes off well it's the 8th of

overdrive<00:07:05.560> and<00:07:06.570> gearbox<00:07:07.570> and<00:07:07.750> overdrive

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:10.710 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.540 

struggled<00:07:11.710> a<00:07:11.740> little<00:07:11.830> bit<00:07:11.980> but<00:07:12.100> it's<00:07:12.400> all

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:12.550 
struggled a little bit but it's all

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.250 
struggled a little bit but it's all
together<00:07:12.700> I<00:07:13.030> think<00:07:13.090> it's<00:07:13.420> fine<00:07:13.660> we'll<00:07:14.080> see

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:14.260 
together I think it's fine we'll see

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.170 
together I think it's fine we'll see
what<00:07:14.410> happens<00:07:14.680> all<00:07:14.860> the<00:07:14.890> gears<00:07:15.160> work<00:07:15.460> the

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:16.180 
what happens all the gears work the

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.910 
what happens all the gears work the
lockout<00:07:16.510> switch<00:07:16.900> which<00:07:17.290> is<00:07:17.470> just<00:07:17.650> there<00:07:17.860> for

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:17.920 
lockout switch which is just there for

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.810 
lockout switch which is just there for
the<00:07:18.250> overdrive<00:07:18.700> works<00:07:19.680> I<00:07:20.680> didn't<00:07:21.640> have<00:07:21.730> too

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:21.820 
the overdrive works I didn't have too

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.820 
the overdrive works I didn't have too
much<00:07:21.940> trouble<00:07:22.060> giving<00:07:22.360> me<00:07:22.420> overdrive<00:07:22.780> on<00:07:22.990> but

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:23.830 
much trouble giving me overdrive on but

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.350 
much trouble giving me overdrive on but
I<00:07:23.860> did<00:07:24.100> have<00:07:24.220> been<00:07:24.340> trouble<00:07:24.640> delay<00:07:24.970> shaft

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 
I did have been trouble delay shaft

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.330 
I did have been trouble delay shaft
because<00:07:25.630> it<00:07:25.810> kept<00:07:26.020> slipping<00:07:26.260> out<00:07:26.530> of<00:07:26.590> place

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:27.340 
because it kept slipping out of place

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.220 
because it kept slipping out of place
and<00:07:27.640> I<00:07:27.700> was<00:07:28.060> a<00:07:28.090> bit<00:07:28.270> tricky<00:07:28.390> with<00:07:28.720> a<00:07:28.780> dummy<00:07:28.990> lash

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:29.230 
and I was a bit tricky with a dummy lash

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.100 
and I was a bit tricky with a dummy lash
