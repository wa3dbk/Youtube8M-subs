00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.100 

okay<00:03:58.400> now<00:03:58.880> back<00:03:59.210> to<00:03:59.390> what<00:03:59.540> we<00:03:59.690> were<00:03:59.720> trying<00:04:00.020> to

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
okay now back to what we were trying to

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.530 
okay now back to what we were trying to
do<00:04:00.260> in<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:00.380> first<00:04:00.530> place<00:04:00.790> just<00:04:01.790> go<00:04:02.150> down<00:04:02.330> this

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
do in the first place just go down this

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:09.370 
do in the first place just go down this
red<00:04:03.430> pipe<00:04:06.760> these<00:04:07.760> bricks<00:04:08.150> and<00:04:08.720> I<00:04:08.810> think<00:04:09.050> unless

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
red pipe these bricks and I think unless

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.370 
red pipe these bricks and I think unless
you<00:04:09.590> have<00:04:09.740> a<00:04:10.300> flower<00:04:11.300> and<00:04:11.570> then<00:04:11.630> you<00:04:11.780> can<00:04:11.960> fit

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
you have a flower and then you can fit

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.160 
you have a flower and then you can fit
on<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.650> points<00:04:13.040> I<00:04:13.250> was<00:04:14.150> like<00:04:14.300> at<00:04:14.420> a<00:04:14.450> Power<00:04:14.720> Ball

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
on the points I was like at a Power Ball

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:47.340 

little<00:04:31.250> time<00:04:31.460> I<00:04:31.490> guess<00:04:35.110> oops<00:04:37.090> getting<00:04:38.090> sloppy

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:53.110 

or<00:04:50.500> not<00:04:51.500> well<00:04:51.950> it<00:04:52.040> was<00:04:52.190> once<00:04:52.460> this<00:04:52.790> it's<00:04:52.940> not

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
or not well it was once this it's not

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:13.110 
or not well it was once this it's not
this<00:04:53.240> time<00:04:57.820> difficult<00:05:02.020> let's<00:05:03.020> shop

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.740 

try<00:05:14.120> this<00:05:14.180> again

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
try this again

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:21.580 
try this again
for<00:05:15.320> three<00:05:16.010> -<00:05:19.180> what<00:05:20.180> -<00:05:20.600> rainbow<00:05:21.080> unlocks

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
for three - what - rainbow unlocks

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
for three - what - rainbow unlocks
interview<00:05:22.690> it's<00:05:24.400> alright

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
interview it's alright

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.990 
interview it's alright
so<00:05:26.090> that<00:05:26.240> means<00:05:26.450> another<00:05:26.720> rainbow<00:05:27.490> stage<00:05:28.490> has

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
so that means another rainbow stage has

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.730 
so that means another rainbow stage has
been<00:05:29.270> unlocked<00:05:30.070> might<00:05:31.070> as<00:05:31.190> well<00:05:31.310> play<00:05:31.520> it<00:05:31.700> huh
