00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.550 
the way around after we mount the basket
we'll<00:01:20.030> go<00:01:20.150> back<00:01:20.330> and<00:01:20.360> torque<00:01:21.020> everything<00:01:21.140> down

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
we'll go back and torque everything down

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.290 
we'll go back and torque everything down
so<00:01:22.340> now<00:01:22.430> we're<00:01:22.520> going<00:01:22.640> to<00:01:22.700> install<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.000> second
