00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
that this one was very precise just like

that one pieces came together they

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.440 
that one pieces came together they
weren't<00:03:17.530> out<00:03:17.709> of<00:03:17.860> sync<00:03:18.190> this<00:03:18.459> far<00:03:18.760> at<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.240> top

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.220 
weren't out of sync this far at the top
I<00:03:19.780> mean<00:03:20.260> you're<00:03:20.380> up<00:03:20.580> 333<00:03:21.580> feet<00:03:21.820> and<00:03:22.030> there<00:03:22.630> the

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
I mean you're up 333 feet and there the

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.699 
I mean you're up 333 feet and there the
bolts<00:03:23.560> are<00:03:23.680> that<00:03:24.070> close<00:03:24.250> together<00:03:24.580> so<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:26.560> was

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
bolts are that close together so it was

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.620 
bolts are that close together so it was
an<00:03:26.860> exciting<00:03:27.310> time<00:03:27.490> a<00:03:27.730> difficult<00:03:28.420> time

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
an exciting time a difficult time

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.500 
an exciting time a difficult time
