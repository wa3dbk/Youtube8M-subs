00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.660
 let's talk about color laser printers once a privilege for a few today instead 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.549
 become accessible not only in the context of small and medium 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.830
 market firm in the field of consuming the model I want to present anyway 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.540
 aimed at business and in particular work groups because it can be 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.460
 shared on the net among the most powerful is the hp color laserjet 4700 of tn 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.660
 a color laser printer 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.010
 designed for 4 high performance and high volume printing capable 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.470
 to print up to 30 pages per minute in both black and white with 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.640
 quality up to 600 of real gravel is an even higher yield thanks 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.620
 Interpate and hp teen heart technology the first page you think 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.030
 it is printed in about 10 seconds 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.540
 and in just over 15 if the printer in power saving mode does not 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.270
 there is warm-up time with hp technology meanwhile performance 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:00:59.560
 excellent why 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.520
 behind them there is a fast a500 33 megahertz mips processor to manage the 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.740
 printing processes and then 288 megabytes of memory expandable to 544 megabytes 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.150
 personally you can also install a hard drive the duplex module will be 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.120
 present as standard on this model allows a front and back print 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.830
 automatic while the overall power supply edil 1600 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.350
 sheets thanks to the three low the additional 500 sheets each but 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.210
 if desired, two more trays can be installed, thus bringing the capacity to 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.979
 supply 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.640
 up to the threshold of 2600 accessibility sheets 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.450
 easy even for non-expert users another strength of the printers 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.830
 hp laserjet 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.650
 and this tn color laserjet 4700 is no exception to access cartridges 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.450
 toner in fact just open the front door to guide us the operation so 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.730
 as in normal maintenance procedures hiring of small 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.300
 problems such as paper jam thinks about it and LCD display placed on the 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.960
 front part the display allows a basic configuration of the printer 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.429
 and also provides status information during printing 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.390
 the original hp consumables have been designed to best integrate with the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.540
 printing system 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.339
 having this print so efficient and fully functional 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:19.279
 once the cartridges are installed 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:22.280
 no longer require any user intervention 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.120
 In fact, the design of the storage guarantees incomplete emptying of the toner 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.230
 in addition to a consistent print quality throughout the entire life cycle of the same 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.379
 that approximately 10 11,000 pages 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.400
 with the hp colors fiat technology the toner particles have dimensions 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.419
 uniform and therefore the positioning of the toner is even more precise and that 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:46.299
 guarantees the most brilliant color prints and kisses the technology of 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.660
 smart hp smart print 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.790
 through the interaction between cartridge for printer then allows to obtain 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.470
 real-time information 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.159
 if tonal usage levels 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.950
 even sending emails to specific users when consumables are used 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:01.339
 they are running out 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:04.729
 one of the important aspects to keep costs under control 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:08.689
 Color laser printer like this is about color access 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:12.219
 hp color laserjet 4700 from thiene 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:16.440
 it has technology to control the house you control 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.030
 a combination of hardware sign stop 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.350
 that allows you to decide 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.090
 which users of your network can use color and how 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.580
 the control can take place for example on single users a group of users 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.390
 or on the basis of specific applications to avoid that color goes 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.530
 from wasted on prints that would not benefit I still have 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.049
 for a number of prints made for example 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.719
 by limiting yourself to using the printer, you can also 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:42.510
 monitor in real time 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.169
 use of print resources and printer consumable status 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:50.110
 in this case, through the hp easy printer utility that it was or 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.080
 accessing the hpv utility via browser and throwing admin which actually allows 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.139
 configuration of remote printer management 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.769
 with hp easy printer cheats the network administrator once 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.059
 check the condition of the printer 

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:08.199
 order spare parts with a few clicks and through the internet 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:09.980
 hp original consumables 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.510
 if you are there, ensure maximum operational efficiency and above all the 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.039
 maximum reliability 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:18.869
 these effectively used tools make it possible to reduce them significantly 

00:04:18.869 --> 00:04:21.759
 total cost of printer ownership 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:25.740
 the advantages are greater productivity and less time spent 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.729
 to maintenance 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:30.289
 then, however, the possibility of foreseeing the planning of downtime 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:31.460
 of the printer 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.380
 moreover it is possible the evaluation of the print job establishing therefore in 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.449
 departure only flight of print can be completed or not avoiding 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.819
 so to waste paper for nothing I hate keeping faded prints at the end of 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:45.319
 tonal life cycle 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:50.550
 through the network connection and the hp jet darect integrated print server 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.750
 this printer can easily be shared on the network among multiple users 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.870
 hp color laserjet 4700 dtm 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.000
 comes with print driver for hp pcl5 htpc languages ​​at 6 ed 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.499
 emulation hp Italian posters hello 3 

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:08.949
 the drivers contain print optimization options for 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:13.009
 improve the yield depending on the type of image entered beyond the connection 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:17.270
 straight jet from straight to this printer has parallel joistick interfaces 

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:18.589
 for connection to a PC
