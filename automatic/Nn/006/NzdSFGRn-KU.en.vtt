episodes<00:01:09.840> but<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.860> important<00:01:11.430> to

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
episodes but it is important to

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.240 
episodes but it is important to
recognize<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.210> fact<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.380> Snoop<00:01:13.710> often

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
recognize the fact that this Snoop often

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.850 
recognize the fact that this Snoop often
confuses<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.939> black<00:01:15.119> opponent<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:16.380> common

closed system
against<00:02:14.170> this<00:02:14.320> move<00:02:14.700> let's<00:02:15.700> say<00:02:15.970> that<00:02:16.180> white

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
against this move let's say that white

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.570 
against this move let's say that white
prefer<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.050> closed<00:02:17.290> system<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.920> thus<00:02:18.370> he

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
prefer the closed system and thus he

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.450 
prefer the closed system and thus he
plays<00:02:18.790> G<00:02:19.270> 3<00:02:19.630> now<00:02:20.560> where<00:02:20.800> I've<00:02:20.890> come<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:21.340> the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
plays G 3 now where I've come to the

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.250 
plays G 3 now where I've come to the
position<00:02:21.610> from<00:02:22.120> which<00:02:22.240> black<00:02:22.660> can<00:02:22.930> begin

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
position from which black can begin

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.740 
position from which black can begin
making<00:02:23.530> serious<00:02:24.250> mistakes<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:25.000> now<00:02:25.450> comes

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
making serious mistakes and now comes

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.460 
making serious mistakes and now comes
the<00:02:25.930> first<00:02:26.140> one

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
the first one

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.360 
the first one
after<00:02:26.980> blacks<00:02:27.300> g6<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:29.440> can<00:02:29.860> be<00:02:30.070> hard<00:02:30.310> to

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
after blacks g6 it can be hard to

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.640 
after blacks g6 it can be hard to
understand<00:02:30.850> why<00:02:31.030> this<00:02:31.300> smoke<00:02:31.600> is<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:32.170> mistake

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
understand why this smoke is a mistake

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.640 
understand why this smoke is a mistake
in<00:02:32.950> this<00:02:33.490> position<00:02:34.060> so<00:02:34.450> let's<00:02:34.660> wait<00:02:35.050> with<00:02:35.500> the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
in this position so let's wait with the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.790 
in this position so let's wait with the
explanation<00:02:36.250> till<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:36.970> becomes<00:02:37.300> clear<00:02:37.800> here

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
explanation till it becomes clear here

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.010 
explanation till it becomes clear here
it's<00:02:39.010> very<00:02:39.310> important<00:02:39.820> that<00:02:39.880> white<00:02:40.270> plays<00:02:40.990> d4

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
it's very important that white plays d4

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.130 
it's very important that white plays d4
and<00:02:42.010> after<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.090> exchanges<00:02:43.570> on<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.900> same

and after the exchanges on the same
square<00:02:44.440> we<00:02:44.950> see<00:02:45.190> that<00:02:45.430> black<00:02:45.670> by<00:02:45.970> moving<00:02:46.209> his<00:02:46.510> c

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780

black squares all over the board which

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.790 
black squares all over the board which
can<00:02:53.230> easily<00:02:53.500> be<00:02:53.770> used<00:02:54.100> by<00:02:54.459> white<00:02:54.870> if<00:02:55.870> black<00:02:56.500> now

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
can easily be used by white if black now

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.250 
can easily be used by white if black now
would<00:02:57.340> play<00:02:57.550> correctly<00:02:57.910> he<00:02:58.720> can<00:02:58.900> escape

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
would play correctly he can escape

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.680 
would play correctly he can escape
without<00:02:59.560> material<00:02:59.950> loss<00:03:00.459> but<00:03:01.060> with<00:03:01.300> a<00:03:01.330> clearly

without material loss but with a clearly

without material loss but with a clearly
worse<00:03:02.050> position<00:03:02.650> but<00:03:03.430> that<00:03:03.670> is<00:03:03.820> of<00:03:03.970> course

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
worse position but that is of course

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.360 
worse position but that is of course
only<00:03:04.540> if<00:03:04.900> black<00:03:05.290> plays<00:03:05.560> correctly<00:03:05.920> and

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
only if black plays correctly and

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.090 
only if black plays correctly and
doesn't<00:03:07.090> play<00:03:07.270> a<00:03:07.300> move<00:03:07.570> such<00:03:07.900> as<00:03:08.170> Bishop<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.830> g7

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
doesn't play a move such as Bishop to g7

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.170 
doesn't play a move such as Bishop to g7
I<00:03:09.780> have<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:10.959> admit<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.500> this<00:03:11.860> move<00:03:12.490> seems<00:03:12.910> to

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
I have to admit that this move seems to

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.420 
I have to admit that this move seems to
be<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.450> most<00:03:13.660> natural<00:03:13.959> move<00:03:14.470> in<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:14.980> position

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
be the most natural move in the position

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.390 
be the most natural move in the position
but<00:03:16.090> it<00:03:16.270> is<00:03:16.390> still<00:03:16.660> a<00:03:16.900> mistake<00:03:17.350> because<00:03:18.040> now

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
but it is still a mistake because now

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.990 
but it is still a mistake because now
white<00:03:18.700> can<00:03:18.940> play<00:03:18.970> Knight<00:03:19.450> d2<00:03:19.780> b5<00:03:21.000> black
