00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.240
 also talking about the kit of 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.580
 big game we have a partner that is 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.010
 essential in this case we have a 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.379
 tec he is a trail dog are very 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.510
 faithful to their owners are great 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.490
 companions and as I said before are 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.410
 essential in the case of being a 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.840
 Wounded piece for us to search 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.000
 more we make a good company and 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.560
 they warn us of all the noises that both 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.180
 they are imperceptible but for that they are 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.420
 for their acoustic acuity they notice them 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.640
 all detect all the sounds are 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.780
 very loyal and large dogs 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.239
 channel partners 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.000
 a curiosity of this breed of dogs of 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:49.420
 the teques concretely is that they are 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.370
 quite pretty they are very very constant 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.110
 in the search the rats are for 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.559
 traces that evidently by their size 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.339
 they are very gross they are very sleepy and 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:02.530
 there have been a lot of cases in 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:05.770
 stalking if in monterÃ­as to leave a one 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.159
 referred the dog by blood trail 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.320
 maybe the network is down or thrown or 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.869
 surely she would be dead to 5 or 6 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.729
 kilometers in a closed mountain are 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.410
 they will throw the dog over night 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.690
 much that we call him is not going to come 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.100
 because the dog has to do his 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.110
 work and he understands what it is to look for that 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.479
 network for your companion for the hunter 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.640
 for its owner and that the disorder occurs 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.100
 the night over then let us 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.659
 I want more home even if they are at night 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.420
 very cold winter with snow 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.789
 including we leave a garment of the owner 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.700
 Leave a garment on the mountain the same 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:42.020
 jacket in the sweatshirt is enough in 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.689
 the place where we were 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.219
 in the bush located the dog a day 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.460
 next we have absolute security 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:50.929
 It has happened so many times 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.479
 that the dog has done his job 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.880
 has found the network and has also returned 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.289
 to the place where his owner was 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.780
 hunting partner and here stays 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.520

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.049
