and I have tired why not it's basically
I<00:03:39.840> have<00:03:42.260> one<00:03:43.260> row<00:03:44.540> completely<00:03:45.540> done

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:09.330 

this<00:04:00.000> is<00:04:00.230> starting<00:04:01.230> on<00:04:01.319> my<00:04:01.530> second<00:04:01.980> row<00:04:02.159> here

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.880 

I<00:04:09.450> have<00:04:10.450> gone<00:04:10.660> all<00:04:10.989> the<00:04:11.410> way<00:04:11.440> around<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:13.540> head

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
I have gone all the way around the head

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:24.150 
I have gone all the way around the head
for<00:04:14.890> one<00:04:15.099> row

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.640 

I'm<00:04:24.790> starting<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.300> to<00:04:25.840> brush<00:04:26.110> out<00:04:26.410> a<00:04:26.440> little

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
I'm starting to to brush out a little

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.680 
I'm starting to to brush out a little
bit<00:04:26.890> so<00:04:27.220> it<00:04:27.310> looks<00:04:27.370> more<00:04:27.730> like<00:04:27.970> hair<00:04:28.330> locks

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
bit so it looks more like hair locks

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.510 
bit so it looks more like hair locks
instead<00:04:29.410> of<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:29.800> yarn<00:04:30.270> is<00:04:31.270> that<00:04:31.450> this<00:04:32.520> brushy

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
instead of the yarn is that this brushy

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.820 
instead of the yarn is that this brushy
soft<00:04:34.090> feel<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:37.120> all<00:04:37.360> it's<00:04:37.690> not<00:04:37.960> styled<00:04:38.500> or

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
soft feel and all it's not styled or

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:51.680 
soft feel and all it's not styled or
anything<00:04:39.040> yet<00:04:39.400> but<00:04:40.120> I<00:04:40.830> will<00:04:41.830> be<00:04:45.750> adding<00:04:46.750> more

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.660 

so<00:04:52.690> basically<00:04:53.820> I'll<00:04:54.820> have<00:04:55.240> a<00:04:55.480> row<00:04:55.780> here<00:04:56.670> I'll

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
so basically I'll have a row here I'll

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.720 
so basically I'll have a row here I'll
have<00:04:57.820> a<00:04:57.850> row<00:04:58.150> here<00:04:58.710> and<00:04:59.710> I'll<00:04:59.860> have<00:05:00.070> a<00:05:00.100> row<00:05:00.400> come

have a row here and I'll have a row come

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.180 
have a row here and I'll have a row come
up<00:05:00.910> here<00:05:01.210> by<00:05:01.390> the<00:05:01.450> ear<00:05:01.750> where<00:05:02.140> the<00:05:02.800> hairline
