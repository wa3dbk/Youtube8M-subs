00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.879
 welcome also from 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:09.840
 commentators place the German 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:13.139
 championship of munich from the team 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.940
 by felix storm against andreas reimer and 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.320
 We chose this fight 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.150
 energetic and above all things 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.650
 expert assistance attended 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.630
 I warmly welcome him 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.080
 worries weber they actually had 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.100
 Boxing is supposed to be a part of this fight 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.300
 a bit of a pity for her now 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:34.379
 not with the wise probably 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.120
 keeping a professional athlete is a tough one 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.309
 sport and the seven sports I have 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.929
 last in training unfortunately still in the 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.609
 i hurt myself last jump 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:43.499
 Torn muscle 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.839
 once at the use of supersprinter 

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:49.050
 that's why I'm not the one today 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:51.780
 ring but comment absolutely us 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.019
 the first round is opened mykita 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.219
 certainly an adequate replacement because out 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.670
 the same stall are also 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.890
 befriended and he is similar to his 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.329
 brother johnny guitar extremely well in 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.190
 one has an athletic form 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.240
 fight a weight class above it 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.520
 boxed and today in the super welterweight 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.630
 in this German championship against 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.400
 andreas reimer where it maybe 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.490
 briefly describe what is Michael 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.869
 for giving a guy just how strong 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:33.009
 good that these words are told in the 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:33.009
 first round 66 and this round is 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.270
 happens 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.909
 seen that I've seen he's a 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.469
 I ran in against it now 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.950
 never expected I say 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:53.500
 Mike was a fantastic physical one 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.509
 been form 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.369
 that went as a favorite in this phone on 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.569
 age that is castle spurt that is 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.319
 Martial artists can use a dumbbell 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:04.250
 retire and be decisive 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.110
 but that needs a lot now 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.850
 Surprised that comes very surprising 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.239
 but how much have we seen very much 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.650
 unorthodox and therefore meter by meter 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.420
 he once put it far like him 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.299
 actually called the nickname 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.360
 unfortunately he can not do the here and now 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:23.030
 honor has been achieved so far 14 victories have been twelve 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.120
 got eleven by ko as though 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.010
 an office of the present here in the 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.540
 hall probably rather the other way round 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.269
 but he has a hook 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.489
 I think that was the child 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.739
 is that full meeting so that was 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.200
 a counterpart in the first round is it 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.730
 Normally, that's not how it is 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.730
 right in the fight in the fight 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.489
 a bit unlucky, and so to speak 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.700
 happy for andreas riemer i have 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.900
 Absolutely so and so everyone 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.090
 hours the whole team is there 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.920
 a bit surprised but that is boxing 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.480
 As I said, a hand can do so 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.950
 decide a whole fight and that has 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.530
 this hand is done here too 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.069
 we saw that today absolutely and 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.970
 the hall it started with wild call 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.209
 for mike peter and now it is here 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.459
 mucksmÃ¤uschenstill 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.720
 in Dusseldorf you will be looking for 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.459
 large part but rather stunned eyes 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.290
 You can actually train something like that 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.150
 andreas opponent bucket now he can 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.920
 you look so much out of him 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.180
 I know exactly at the beginning, however 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.849
 Maybe a bit more with Michael 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.319
 unfocused is no I think as 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.329
 boxer above all things as a professional athlete 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.400
 if you are there for a long time then you have one 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.590
 certain feeling when you have to beat 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.410
 should strike that apparently has 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.970
 Andreas Riemer 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:45.250
 pointed out and unfair for maik does 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.990
 I'm very sorry in hesse training buddy 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.430
 and I have the whole preparation 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.430
 we have done together 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:58.780
 in the month of new German masters in the 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:02.370
 super welterweight by the first 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:08.860
 Round after 55 seconds on trainer 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:13.660
 andreas maier andreas reimer is the 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:16.299
 new German master gets the belt 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:20.020
 already huge for presidents 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.070
 to bbb volk rat wants to have them like that 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:27.070
 We can value this belt 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:29.380
 hand over and maika he has to head now 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.940
 and take aim at the next fight 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.680
 this is something where you probably first 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.590
 to chew on it a little bit 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.330
 but really has it at this point 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.740
 congratulations to Andreas Reimer who would have 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.670
 that this fight is fast 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:53.530
 passing by, that's what happens in ours 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:54.790
 of course, that's why a blog before 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.760
 the winner on the loser 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.590
 For the early the feeling naturally increases 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.250
 That's why the new one was the first one 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:07.600
 followers of Chinese fans something 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:10.919
 it has been so sad andreas reimer 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.919
 Of course you can celebrate now
