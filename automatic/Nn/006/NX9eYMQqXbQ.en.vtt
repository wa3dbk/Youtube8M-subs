00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
always have that perfect shot

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.649 
always have that perfect shot
getting<00:02:12.829> the<00:02:12.920> right<00:02:13.040> exposure<00:02:13.519> is<00:02:14.000> up<00:02:14.299> to<00:02:14.450> you

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659 
getting the right exposure is up to you

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.059 
getting the right exposure is up to you
and<00:02:14.870> what<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:15.260> want<00:02:15.409> to<00:02:15.439> be<00:02:15.560> doing<00:02:15.709> with<00:02:15.890> your

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
and what you want to be doing with your

and what you want to be doing with your
exposures<00:02:16.849> creatively<00:02:17.920> here<00:02:18.920> I'm<00:02:19.159> going<00:02:19.310> to

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
exposures creatively here I'm going to

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.479 
exposures creatively here I'm going to
be<00:02:19.430> shooting<00:02:19.700> a<00:02:20.060> couple<00:02:20.390> of<00:02:20.569> different

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.410 
sunny day it's not the ideal situation
but<00:02:30.920> it's<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.340> common<00:02:31.609> event<00:02:31.700> for<00:02:32.000> most<00:02:32.120> of<00:02:32.299> us

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
but it's a common event for most of us

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.390 
but it's a common event for most of us
so<00:02:33.230> let's<00:02:33.439> look<00:02:33.560> at<00:02:33.709> some<00:02:33.859> ways<00:02:34.040> that<00:02:34.250> we<00:02:34.370> can

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
so let's look at some ways that we can

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.080 
so let's look at some ways that we can

composition looks better and you can

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.729 
composition looks better and you can
really<00:03:02.120> focus<00:03:02.599> in<00:03:02.780> on<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:03.139> expression<00:03:03.469> of<00:03:03.650> the

rules before taking it further you will

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.460 
rules before taking it further you will
see<00:03:20.030> a<00:03:20.060> massive<00:03:20.419> improvement<00:03:20.690> in<00:03:21.349> your

see a massive improvement in your

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.500 
see a massive improvement in your
photography<00:03:21.620> straightaway<00:03:22.489> if<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:23.180> know<00:03:23.299> how

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
photography straightaway if you know how

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.960 
photography straightaway if you know how
the<00:03:23.569> system<00:03:23.989> works<00:03:24.199> then<00:03:25.190> we<00:03:25.310> can<00:03:25.459> really<00:03:25.699> push

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
the system works then we can really push

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:36.580 
the system works then we can really push
it

I<00:03:38.220> like<00:03:38.550> your<00:03:38.730> gears<00:03:39.000> in<00:03:39.150> a<00:03:39.240> car<00:03:39.480> you<00:03:39.990> wouldn't

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
I like your gears in a car you wouldn't

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.570 
I like your gears in a car you wouldn't
know<00:03:40.290> how<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.470> drive<00:03:40.800> if<00:03:41.040> you<00:03:41.130> didn't<00:03:41.400> know<00:03:41.460> how

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
know how to drive if you didn't know how

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.550 
know how to drive if you didn't know how
to<00:03:41.610> shift<00:03:41.910> gears<00:03:42.240> so<00:03:42.900> let's<00:03:43.110> look<00:03:43.290> at<00:03:43.440> what

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
to shift gears so let's look at what

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.440 
to shift gears so let's look at what
each<00:03:43.590> different<00:03:44.100> mode<00:03:44.250> does<00:03:44.550> and<00:03:44.820> how<00:03:45.180> we<00:03:45.240> can

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
each different mode does and how we can

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.290 
each different mode does and how we can
use<00:03:45.660> it<00:03:46.040> once<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.160> had<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.430> perfect<00:03:48.060> photo

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
use it once you had that perfect photo

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.840 
use it once you had that perfect photo
then<00:03:48.990> you<00:03:49.110> need<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.380> story<00:03:49.740> there<00:03:50.520> are<00:03:50.610> three

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
then you need the story there are three

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.370 
then you need the story there are three
main<00:03:51.030> formats<00:03:51.560> JPEG<00:03:52.560> raw<00:03:52.800> and<00:03:53.490> TIFF<00:03:54.060> files<00:03:54.380> do

main formats JPEG raw and TIFF files do

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.930 
main formats JPEG raw and TIFF files do

you move you a gray card in front of the
camera<00:03:57.240> fill<00:03:57.930> out<00:03:58.020> the<00:03:58.140> frame<00:03:59.209> take<00:04:00.209> your<00:04:00.360> shot
