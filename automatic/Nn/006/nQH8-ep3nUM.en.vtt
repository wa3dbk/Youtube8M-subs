gorillas<00:01:15.060> are<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.360> danger<00:01:15.659> then<00:01:15.810> our<00:01:15.990> class<00:01:16.229> is

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
gorillas are in danger then our class is

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.050 
gorillas are in danger then our class is
critically<00:01:16.950> endangered<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:17.909> is

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
critically endangered and this is

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.880 
critically endangered and this is
because<00:01:18.420> there's<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.869> lot<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.200> deforestation

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
because there's a lot of deforestation

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.609 
because there's a lot of deforestation
which<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.549> habitat<00:01:21.000> loss<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> wild<00:01:21.930> also

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
which is habitat loss in the wild also

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.649

mining which is going on for a mineral
called<00:01:26.400> coltan<00:01:27.080> so<00:01:28.080> there's<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.680> lot<00:01:28.920> of
