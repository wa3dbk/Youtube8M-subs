00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.500
 we see from various mustard welcome in 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.629
 this new write 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.089
 today we talk about a mode allows a lot 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:14.849
 interesting for this 96 of minecraft 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:18.030
 I'm talking about castrol defense 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.700
 this mode is first all add gods 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.800
 castles in minecraft is inside 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.020
 also adds characters 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.940
 these characters are special because 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.680
 they protect the castle 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.780
 here we have several characters that 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:36.059
 spur them with eggs or as pauner 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.309
 who defend the castle and therefore 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.530
 defend us because these characters 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.420
 in addition to defending castle they can 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.730
 to defend ourselves, that is, we can 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.390
 take them to our home place them 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.980
 out and they help us kill randomly 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.530
 mob and so on 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.379
 we have different types or leave the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.800
 knight and mercenary and the magician e 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.019
 each has a different characteristic e 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.079
 we have both good and those 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.759
 bad here we have the castles 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.100
 contain good and bad characters 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.290
 so we have to be careful for example 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.600
 and let's take these away or those 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.549
 good they do nothing but if 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.149
 we attack the bad ones immediately and 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.899
 kill 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:22.020
 then we have the circle and it is still not 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:24.719
 moves or these that you see in this 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.030
 moment are the archers and as you see 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.460
 they do not move then of course 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.229
 I shoot the arrows because they are maples 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.170
 attack on monsters long range 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.509
 then the ideal and put them on castles 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.829
 precisely on or on walls as in 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.200
 this case because they are a lot 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:48.659
 lively of them attack all those 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.390
 that are in the distance 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.420
 while if we want to kill those who 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.249
 they are the mobs that are in 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.740
 a really small distance 

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:01.049
 we have the knights who are of 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.850
 sword and have a good amount of 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.340
 health and attack the monsters in 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.770
 we really were in a distance 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:15.200
 very small then we have mercenaries 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:17.350
 that we can't shoot him is there 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.950
 we find around the world and we must 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.010
 hire them 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:26.360
 if we do not assume these will disappear 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:28.190
 and therefore to assume we must give him a 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.980
 gold bar and he will fight for us 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.620
 so it will protect us and so on 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:37.160
 then we can click with the button 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:40.489
 right on him to tell him to wait 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.150
 so don't move then don't disappear 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:47.450
 so when we hire them they attack i 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:51.110
 show as soon as they see them then mercenaries 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.620
 they have two trams ie 1 when they say 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:58.459
 to wait is one when we say there 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.430
 then we have the magician or the 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:04.730
 magician can be generated if you have 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:09.459
 of a medallion or game of 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:13.940
 new and these can set the 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:16.820
 nimis cells on the fire and have one 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.739
 chance to hit them with lightning and between 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.760
 the other they also help us with the 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.630
 medallion to see where i 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.690
 castles the enemies 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.120
 therefore magicians are also very useful 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.090
 we have only these four we say that 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.320
 they are very useful as mentioned before 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.750
 archer example should not me 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.870
 attack because it is the good one 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.760
 but let's say as I said before there are 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.359
 the good ones the bad ones 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.239
 and this is one of those dark and nothing 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.780
 Today's video is over I hope there is 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.560
 liked 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.950
 I told you how fashions work and what 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.260
 naturally adds let me a 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.060

 eggs too, here they are

 these are the eggs of those 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.230
 the good ones when the bad ones 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:23.530
 bad and rewritten enemy and here instead 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.660

 these left on the ground and then shoot 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.730
