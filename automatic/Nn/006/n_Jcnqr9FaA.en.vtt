hello<00:00:07.350> today<00:00:07.830> I'm<00:00:07.920> going<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.100> talk<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.280> you

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
hello today I'm going to talk to you

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.230 
hello today I'm going to talk to you
about<00:00:08.430> the<00:00:08.610> backwards<00:00:08.820> loop<00:00:09.320> increase<00:00:11.240> this

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
about the backwards loop increase this

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.299 
about the backwards loop increase this
is<00:00:12.360> done<00:00:12.510> just<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.870> bit<00:00:13.170> different<00:00:13.559> than<00:00:13.769> you

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
is done just a bit different than you

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.510 
is done just a bit different than you
would<00:00:14.550> a<00:00:14.790> backwards<00:00:15.300> loop<00:00:15.509> cast<00:00:15.570> on<00:00:16.520> because

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
would a backwards loop cast on because

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.769 
would a backwards loop cast on because
you're<00:00:17.790> actually<00:00:18.180> knitting<00:00:18.950> as<00:00:20.419> you're<00:00:21.419> doing

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
you're actually knitting as you're doing

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.290 
you're actually knitting as you're doing
it<00:00:21.899> so<00:00:22.200> you<00:00:23.009> wouldn't<00:00:23.189> want<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.430> stop<00:00:23.700> your<00:00:23.970> and

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
it so you wouldn't want to stop your and

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.780 
it so you wouldn't want to stop your and
drop<00:00:24.509> everything<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.290> do<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.279> like<00:00:26.489> you<00:00:26.640> would

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:26.790 
drop everything and do it like you would

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.990 
drop everything and do it like you would
normally<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.869> can<00:00:28.079> but<00:00:28.770> I<00:00:29.040> don't<00:00:29.820> recommend

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
normally you can but I don't recommend

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.770 
normally you can but I don't recommend
it<00:00:30.950> so<00:00:31.950> anyway<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.250> has<00:00:32.369> done<00:00:32.669> as<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.600> come<00:00:33.750> up

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
it so anyway it has done as you come up

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.700 
it so anyway it has done as you come up
to<00:00:34.610> where<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.730> want<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.210> increase<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.590> am

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
to where you want to increase and I am

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.560 
to where you want to increase and I am
there<00:00:37.890> right<00:00:38.040> now<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:39.890> you<00:00:40.890> want<00:00:41.130> to<00:00:41.360> make<00:00:42.360> a

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
there right now and you want to make a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.160 
there right now and you want to make a
loop<00:00:42.810> with<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.800> knit<00:00:44.310> side<00:00:44.670> going<00:00:45.540> over<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
loop with the knit side going over the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.790 
loop with the knit side going over the
ball<00:00:46.380> side<00:00:49.190> so<00:00:50.190> something<00:00:50.490> like<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.720> and

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
ball side so something like that and

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.530 
ball side so something like that and
then<00:00:54.260> you<00:00:55.260> twist<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.650> again<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.370> put<00:00:57.060> it<00:00:57.360> on

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
then you twist it again and put it on

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:05.060 
then you twist it again and put it on
your<00:00:58.140> needle<00:00:58.440> so<00:01:01.520> you<00:01:02.520> have<00:01:03.799> something<00:01:04.799> looks

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
your needle so you have something looks

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.940 
your needle so you have something looks
like<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.610> can<00:01:06.540> see<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.170> balls<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
like that you can see that the balls the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.320 
like that you can see that the balls the
knit<00:01:08.159> side<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.759> over<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.690> ball<00:01:09.870> side<00:01:10.550> and<00:01:11.550> you

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
knit side is over the ball side and you

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.480 
knit side is over the ball side and you
just<00:01:12.510> want<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.840> take<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.909> and<00:01:14.909> pull<00:01:15.690> tight<00:01:15.900> and

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
just want to take it and pull tight and

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.300 
just want to take it and pull tight and
that's<00:01:17.490> all<00:01:17.670> there<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:19.130> but<00:01:20.130> you

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
that's all there is to that but you

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.560 
that's all there is to that but you
don't<00:01:20.370> want<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.610> do<00:01:20.670> all<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.330> want<00:01:21.360> to

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
don't want to do all that you want to

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.080 
don't want to do all that you want to
drop<00:01:21.720> all<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:21.960> just<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.500> do<00:01:22.820> an<00:01:23.820> increase

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
drop all that just to do an increase

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.890 
drop all that just to do an increase
right

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
right

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.950 
right
so<00:01:25.820> I'm<00:01:26.820> going<00:01:26.940> to<00:01:27.000> show<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.180> how<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.450> do<00:01:27.780> it

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
so I'm going to show you how to do it

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.840 
so I'm going to show you how to do it
while<00:01:28.110> you're<00:01:28.260> knitting<00:01:28.470> or<00:01:29.220> how<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.370> do<00:01:29.580> it

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
while you're knitting or how I do it

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.300 
while you're knitting or how I do it
while<00:01:30.030> I'm<00:01:30.150> knitting<00:01:30.330> and<00:01:31.159> that<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:34.100> take<00:01:35.100> your

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
while I'm knitting and that is take your

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.670 
while I'm knitting and that is take your
right<00:01:36.170> left<00:01:37.170> hand<00:01:37.409> needle<00:01:39.229> behind<00:01:40.229> both

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
right left hand needle behind both

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.830 
right left hand needle behind both
strands<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.400> yarn<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:42.119> you're<00:01:42.299> holding<00:01:42.570> in

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
strands of yarn that you're holding in

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.270 
strands of yarn that you're holding in
your<00:01:42.990> hand<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:45.030> working<00:01:45.360> yarn<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:46.159> pick<00:01:47.159> up

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
your hand the working yarn and pick up

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.410 
your hand the working yarn and pick up
the<00:01:47.400> back<00:01:47.549> one

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.970 

see<00:01:52.420> that<00:01:52.660> you<00:01:52.780> got<00:01:52.870> the<00:01:53.020> back<00:01:53.200> one<00:01:53.380> here<00:01:54.720> and

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
see that you got the back one here and

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.710 
see that you got the back one here and
drop<00:01:56.980> it<00:01:57.160> and<00:01:57.430> pull<00:01:58.420> tight<00:02:00.150> not<00:02:01.150> tight<00:02:01.390> but

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
drop it and pull tight not tight but

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.330 
drop it and pull tight not tight but
pull<00:02:01.990> where<00:02:02.890> it<00:02:02.980> won't<00:02:03.100> fall<00:02:03.250> off<00:02:05.220> then<00:02:06.220> you

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
pull where it won't fall off then you

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.370 
pull where it won't fall off then you
just<00:02:06.520> slip<00:02:06.760> it<00:02:07.000> knit<00:02:07.330> wise<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:10.170> take<00:02:11.170> it<00:02:11.290> off

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
just slip it knit wise and take it off

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.230 
just slip it knit wise and take it off
the<00:02:11.500> needle<00:02:13.140> now<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.200> pull<00:02:14.590> tight<00:02:14.860> and

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
the needle now you pull tight and

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:25.370 
the needle now you pull tight and
continue<00:02:16.240> knitting

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.640 

and<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.040> can<00:02:26.160> see<00:02:29.780> that<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.930> increase<00:02:31.110> is

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
and you can see that the increase is

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.160 
and you can see that the increase is
different<00:02:32.070> than<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.490> other<00:02:32.610> two<00:02:32.700> obviously

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.970 

we're<00:02:37.170> going<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.380> make<00:02:37.560> them<00:02:37.710> crit<00:02:42.710> and<00:02:43.710> now

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
we're going to make them crit and now

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.300 
we're going to make them crit and now
when<00:02:44.100> you<00:02:44.160> go<00:02:44.250> back<00:02:44.490> and<00:02:44.700> knit<00:02:44.880> it

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.370 

you<00:02:51.940> can<00:02:52.090> see<00:02:54.630> they're<00:02:55.630> just<00:02:55.660> twisted<00:02:56.230> like

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
you can see they're just twisted like

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.530 
you can see they're just twisted like
they<00:02:56.530> would<00:02:57.569> their<00:02:58.569> normal<00:02:59.430> and<00:03:00.430> so<00:03:01.150> you<00:03:01.209> would

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
they would their normal and so you would

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.309 
they would their normal and so you would
knit<00:03:01.780> into<00:03:04.500> from<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.770> left<00:03:06.250> to<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:06.819> right

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
knit into from the left to the right

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:20.650 
knit into from the left to the right
like<00:03:08.319> you<00:03:08.470> would<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.830> normal<00:03:08.860> knit<00:03:09.790> stitch

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.270 

there<00:03:21.260> you<00:03:21.320> have<00:03:21.470> it

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.320 

now<00:03:25.280> I'm<00:03:25.400> gonna<00:03:25.490> take<00:03:25.610> this<00:03:25.730> out<00:03:25.940> and<00:03:26.090> show<00:03:26.270> you

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
now I'm gonna take this out and show you
