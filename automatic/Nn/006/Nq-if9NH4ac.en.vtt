 psychotic to all those in need and 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.029
 this here is minecraft we meet 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.829
 another day of mods that you know that all 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.799
 the days of the year table a mod and the 

00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:12.059
 jolly is for version 1.7 point 10 in 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.589
 the information of that video you have a 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.910
 equal agreement download is not football 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.580
 on average by constituting right now 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.800
 they are it is one two three four types of 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.050
 different blocks I have not reviewed then 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.289
 so well not decoration maybe or 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.029
 they have something special about the blocks or not 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.369
 be an ingot to make our 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.340
 blocks hey well what do not you 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.620
 find out there too of no 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.990
 ministry but the guys is not this 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.100
 what the block adds is that is 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.540
 well because it's a block maybe for 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.250
 decorate but it's not mainly 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.050
 made to decorate in accordance is not a 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.060
 healing boat, let alone what 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.500
 adds is that the blocks just 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.260
 these four are going to have different 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.430
 obviously agree speeds 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.680
 this one that is the best of all is the most 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.000
 difficult to do the hardest is very 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.590
 easy to make 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 information worth detainees 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.370
 characters is very easy to make from 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.620
 fact is thrown away but it is the most expensive 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.810
 compared to this one here that is the most 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.909
 Trash is not good I'll show you 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.840
 I have them there and you are going to see them 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.259
 take why 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.859
 is exaggerated is worth to move the movement 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:17.200
 that I have, I 'm super fast compared to 

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:18.520
 the normal running on top of this wey more 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.170
 big that the ice itself much more 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.359
 quick that anything else you see that 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.689
 here it stops this would be the next 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:27.909
 speed you see they are different 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.640
 this is a more style like more ice and 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.780
 this is more more bench this is the 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.659
 next that also faster 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.229
 compared to normal running and 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:41.130
 then this one shows very little is worth it 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.130
 really little 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.869
 it's a tad faster it's worth it's like a 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.049
 little bit more this would be the second the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:53.280
 third and the fourth fact we can see it 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:56.250
 here look at the times I put here I'm going 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.560
 bit slower faster and literally 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.060
 Increase fast courageous look 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.329
 with ld efe 5 because you see a little 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.329
 best 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.730
 5 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.950
 5 double 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.109
 there we are and as you can see it is super fast 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.519
 yes if you jump is not increased 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:20.340
 speed is not like a cooking that you 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:23.370
 strips and jump you do it with speed 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.209
 not only is walking alone it 's the 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.560
 to walk not at no other time do you go 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.180
 to jump or anything like that 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.340
 and you will pick up speed with your own 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.689
 jump in agreement and that's it 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.430
 that adds this mode the truth that I 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.989
 like that because you can use the 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.519
 blocks to decorate are very cool 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.129
 you can do as crypts and so on 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.659
 can be very very opposite and then 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.280
 apart for very long distances like 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.959
 can be put inside the duty is going to 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.359
 go to a portal aol ride more this mod 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.379
 it comes from pearls of agreement that would be 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.450
 for a pack of motorcycles, very 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.250
 interesting in fact pick up speed 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.269
 even if you have once activated and with a 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.919
 little faster 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.099
 and make a reality very fast by 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:01.099
 I have there put it you see there I have the 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.450
 post or the block is good has 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.829
 benefits is if you guys have been 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.739
