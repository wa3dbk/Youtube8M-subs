 early access date and chu van zat one 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.370
 The game will be available on January 15th 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.080
 years just 19 dollars 99 cents in 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.549
 steam 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.780
 translation is made specifically for the group 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.449
 each one z won rush 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.460
 at the curry mic hi i dave carter 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.740
 lead artist capture leader 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.570
 motions for each one with you i work 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.119
 In sony four years and today we 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.250
 let's talk about animation as far as 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.070
 finished current animation system 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.750
 what plans for the future are we far from 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.050
 completing the animation work though 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.030
 have done quite a lot the other day we 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.070
 ended up capturing movements and now we 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.020
 We are engaged in replacing current animations with 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.030
 new system animating very complex 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.469
 There are still many tasks that need 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.850
 perform but the result will please you 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:02.430
 I really can't say for sure when we 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.920
 finish what the zombies can't 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.640
 scramble this decision designers or 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.909
 just such an animas is not ready now 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.100
 we don't have to clamber for zombies yet 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.380
 under question as it strongly influences 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.229
 on game design gameplay balance and on 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.549
 how the player feels I am not sure 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.770
 that we will give the opportunity to zombies 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.100
 climb the cars or the windows because 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.299
 that it will greatly change the balance of the game but we 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.979
 don't deny everything completely and 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.979
 the opportunity to realize this is 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.720
 Will there be animations of tricks of running and 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:43.590
 slip from the hills of parkour is what we 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.830
 discussing constantly it's hard for 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.420
 implementation can work in different ways 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.790
 I think we will try to implement it. 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.040
 later but definitely not for early access 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.570
 it will be awesome if we can 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.640
 do it right after all this too 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.560
 affects the balance and we do not want to spoil 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.520
 the game is important for us that everyone gets 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.520
 positive emotions 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.100
 Are you planning to animate interactions with 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.100
 backpacker 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.130
 we are now working on a backpack and this 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.860
 will appear in the future we already have 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.360
 captured animations for this but us 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.540
 it is necessary to carry out the preparatory work 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:26.220
 to make it function i 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.500
 sure we have exactly what you mean 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.390
 ask the idea is that player 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.100
 stops kneeling down and 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.989
 starts looking for something in a backpack 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.090
 it will be used when you are in 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.830
 inventory or craft and 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.489
 it may already be in early access 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.920
 but I do not promise we will see animation 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.190
 climbing a tree sitting there what 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.080
 about car climbing stairs 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.790
 on trees or big objects we 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.580
 captured a large number of excellent 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.410
 animations but still we have not introduced it 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.000
 tasks after early access and i 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.130
 I think it will be really great and 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.900
 seriously improve the gameplay but time is not 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.630
 endlessly and now we are preparing for 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.220
 early access 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.700
 With regards to machines, it is very difficult 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.530
 task 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.989
 we saw it in other games and hope 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.980
 add this to our game 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.750
 it takes time to enter all 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.380
 systems to work and it definitely won't be 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.380
 in early access 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.640
 how complex is the animation tree in the game 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.770
 we have a very complicated transition system 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.580
 animations they can smoothly flow from 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.530
 one to another 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.470
 for example and calm state to 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.270
 aiming nose and challenging tree 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.250
 animations allowing players and zombies 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:41.340
 smoothly bend around corners or peeking 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:43.440
 because of the angle the direction will be taken into account 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:50.760
 running this is where the mouse is directed and from 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:52.890
 this select the appropriate animation all 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.360
 it needs polishing this system 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.280
 will already be in early access 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:02.940
 but after it it will expand and 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:04.890
 finalized thanks to all that you were 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.540
 with us we take very seriously 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.830
 animation we are waiting for your questions and 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.790
 let's meet howl closet for two 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.790
 until
