00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.870
 to the girls how are I, I am nothing and 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.090
 today we are going to make a video that I know that 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.910
 we all love it and it's that 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.769
 are nail styles you always give us 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.740
 they ask us to do more and more and more 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.990
 that today I bring you two beautiful styles 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.970
 and too simple to do I'm going to 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.120
 start with the easiest of all for 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.880
 we're going to need a white color 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.860
 that serves us as a base and two others or 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.930
 three colors which you most 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.000
 like then I'm going to show you how to 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.000
 makes the first design step by step 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.460
 I'm going to start by opening all my 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.250
 glazes from it to make it more 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.649
 easy to use them here in my tampon holders 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.899
 I have saved some toothpicks 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:01:00.309
 and I'm going to take one and I'm going to start 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:02.140
 putting a layer of white not on all 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.699
 the nail but only in a corner not 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.649
 it matters if it gets dirty on the finger because 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.800
 after you clean it with more 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:09.780
 weather 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.450
 now they take another one of the colors that 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.270
 they chose and they spend it more or less over 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.880
 of the white but also in a part 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.740
 new I'm going to take the green no matter 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.740
 that cross each other because that's the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.630
 idea 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.170
 when I already have them so what I'm going to 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:33.210
 to do is put my stick and from one end 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.730
 from the other diagonally make lines and 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.520
 lace to a figure as well as iridescent 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.800
 like a little flower and they can alternate the 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.250
 order as of the dashes that are 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.250
 doing 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.330
 then our 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.160
 nails that I do not know the truth how to call them 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:58.140
 see how we put them as flowers male 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.820
 you will tell me how to choose in bonera 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.250
 design number one but me 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.010
 loved it is like all hippie like a 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.020
 super nice colorful thing and finally 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.910
 we will give a touch of 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.570
 transparent so that it lasts much longer 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.570
 and give them shine 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.349
 and nothing 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.249
 in second style I took as 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.499
 inspiration the logo of us that 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:28.989
 has a divine rosita as well as a 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:30.700
 green cited with fuchsia and with the background 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:35.400
 white and to start we're going to paint 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.400
 all our white nails as a base 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.739
 Now let's take a red color to 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:44.019
 that serves as the basis of our 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.450
 pink we're just going to put a 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.060
 poquitico in the brush and let's start 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.010
 to do as a circle but that is not 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.739
 very perfect but rather in a way that 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.959
 look like the petals of a flower what 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:00.090
 I'm going to do all the nails in some 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.090
 was to put just one bigger 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.870
 for capable terms what I'm going to do 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.090
 is to take a pink color with a brush 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.220
 of these that are like eyeliners what 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.140
 what I'm going to do is drink with a little 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.630
 of this color that is the fuchsia of 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.470
 us and I'm going to start doing as 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.879
 arabesques inside the red color 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.470
 just let yourself be carried away by the way 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.310
 of the base they have does not have to 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.310
 nothing perfect 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.070
 and now I'm going to take a green color 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.230
 just like the leaves of our 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.230
 logo of us and also with a brush 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:42.930
 so these thin ones I'm going to start 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.930
 draw the leaves of our rose 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.750
 so then will my nails roses 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.670
 Inspired by the logo of us now 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.890
 you have to tell me which design 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.900
 like number one or the 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.430
 number two I have here and they are not 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.920
 you can forget that you can find us 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.110

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.420
