00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.560
 rozetochki little out of soy sauce 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:32.729

 such spoons are three tablespoons with 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.930
 big big slide in general it will be 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.610
 60 grams of flour 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:47.369
 we also need 1 teaspoon 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:51.299

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:55.290

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.659
 ground pepper 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.110
 if you like to fry it all I'll 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.440
 traditions on the sunflower one 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.900
 oil with olive altera 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.360
 this is my favorite butter i am cooking 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.840
 only on it for many many years very 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:24.049
 I like it so I have already prepared 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.700
 zucchini if zucchini is big then 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:30.750
 potato peeler or knife remove from it 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:34.019
 skin and using let 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.269
 teaspoon remove the seeds if they 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.180
 large well me zucchini were young 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:42.930
 two little ones so i cleaned only 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:47.250
 Peel and almost no sunflower seeds 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.230
 rubbed zucchini on a coarse grater and y 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.370
 I got it in general 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.400
 bowl 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.620
 from fixed price who have such bowls 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.379
 and there many in general got me 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.040
 Here is the amount in general one 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:06.209
 big zucchini and the next step we 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:09.299
 must put in this zucchini salt for 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.930
 what do you need when we salted zucchini 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:15.090
 he will give us some juice 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.620
 when the maximum amount is allocated 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.750
 juice and 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.250
 let's squeeze all this mass using a sieve 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.250
 if you do not have a sip and then good 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:30.079
 wring out and generally us 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:34.650
 need dry zucchini flesh 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:36.840
 then we add flour to the eggs and 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.150
 baking powder dough everything is good 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.459
 mix and bake 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.519
 now I will cook this whole thing 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:50.310
 what will be the mass of the test should 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:53.099
 you will get so look what 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.919
 we should have consistency 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:58.709
 dough on pancakes so here I am using 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:01.229
 I like the forks very much 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.560
 conveniently, first mix the eggs with 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:07.949
 zucchini and then add gradually 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.870
 I introduce flour here and that's what we have 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:13.229
 It turns out you see this pretty 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:17.060
 thick dough that's great here 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:20.639
 keeps and does not break up here and in general 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.160
 The main secret of this recipe is that 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.760
 well we should on 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:30.320
 dry press grated zucchini salty 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:32.870
 so that all the liquid is gone and then immediately 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.720
 bake how do we make this dough 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.650
 so that she is not putting away cute in general immediately 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.440
 we will bake at me already heats up 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:46.970
 frying pan and will fry on average 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.750
 fire in enough oil here 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.490
 I will impose such a spoon 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.350
 so that the pancakes were not very large not 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.560
 very small well cooked 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.390
 fry until golden brown you need here 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.350
 just to your liking you can 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:05.570
 add you up squeeze out the garlic here or 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:10.700
 like i said cheese greens all that 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:13.580
 like butter on the pan warmed up 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:19.700
 I take here is the number of spoon with 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:23.600
 Slide the dough and spread it like this 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:30.280
 way a little flatten turns 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:35.930
 we have such a nice pancake 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:38.570
 we will fry until golden brown here 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.790
 so here we lay out our pancakes and 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.520
 me out of so much dough 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:46.070
 get about two pans 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.130
 large ie about 12 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:52.190
 stuff here you can serve pancakes 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:55.610
 either traditionally with sour cream or you can 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:59.710
 also make sauce let's mix 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:02.240
 sour cream, too, with garlic dill from there 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.870
 crumble will also be very tasty but I 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.760
 just prefer 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:13.120
 zucchini without any additives just 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.120
 zucchini and salt I like it more 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.349
 I roasted for about three minutes on one 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.630
 to the side 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:24.849
 turned over and that's such a beauty 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.099
 we get here are such a lush 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:29.770
 pancakes due to baking powder 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:32.620
 they are well so compact not 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:36.039
 fall apart in general for such a recipe 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:39.130
 can't cook i don't know in general 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:40.810
 everyone can even be able to do it for him 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.660
 cook in my opinion it's just 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:48.360
 perfect cooking recipe 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:53.080
 squash fritters and also do not feel sorry 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:55.270
 oils are pretty decent 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.509
 the amount can be poured too so that they 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:03.030
 not burnt and well prepared but 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:03.030
 now on 2 countries we fry until ready 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:11.740
