00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
field and I just want to make sure I'm

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.859 
field and I just want to make sure I'm
to<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.070> room<00:01:59.280> real<00:01:59.490> quick<00:01:59.520> yeah<00:01:59.909> because

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
up here to make sure it's the same so

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.490 
up here to make sure it's the same so
we're<00:02:09.810> going<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:09.989> type<00:02:10.170> in<00:02:10.319> tag<00:02:11.780> like<00:02:12.780> that

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
we're going to type in tag like that

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.430 
we're going to type in tag like that
and<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.740> seem<00:02:13.920> down<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.190> has<00:02:14.400> attack<00:02:15.440> and

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
and you seem down this has attack and

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.780 
and you seem down this has attack and
then<00:02:16.650> we're<00:02:16.830> going<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:16.980> put<00:02:17.190> one<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.700> these

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
then we're going to put one of these

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.130 
then we're going to put one of these
under<00:02:18.150> here<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:18.510> you're<00:02:18.630> going<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.810> click<00:02:18.900> this

compound again because you're going to

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.230 
compound again because you're going to
have<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.840> compound<00:02:25.290> under<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.940> this<00:02:26.940> and

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
have a compound under the this and

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.440 
have a compound under the this and
you're<00:02:27.390> going<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.570> put<00:02:27.750> inch<00:02:28.610> with<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.640> with<00:02:30.420> a

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
you're going to put inch with a with a

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.590 
you're going to put inch with a with a
knee<00:02:31.160> alright<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.580> so<00:02:32.610> now<00:02:33.240> we're<00:02:33.390> going<00:02:33.480> to

knee alright and so now we're going to
put<00:02:33.690> another<00:02:33.810> compound<00:02:34.530> under<00:02:34.860> this<00:02:36.440> all

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
put another compound under this all

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.290 
put another compound under this all
right<00:02:37.860> so<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:38.190> follow<00:02:38.400> me<00:02:38.550> so<00:02:38.730> far<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:39.090> just

Hannah type in ID click on this again
make<00:02:50.190> another<00:02:50.430> one<00:02:51.800> level<00:02:52.800> and<00:02:52.980> then<00:02:53.850> you<00:02:53.970> can

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.610 
make another one level and then you can
just<00:02:54.300> change<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.959> whatever<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:55.380> want

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
whatever enchantment I'll put the values

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.830 
whatever enchantment I'll put the values
from<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.489> enchantments<00:03:00.090> in<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.300> description

from the enchantments in the description

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:09.000 
from the enchantments in the description
below<00:03:00.989> so<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:01.560> can<00:03:01.620> go<00:03:01.830> look<00:03:01.980> at<00:03:02.070> that

touch<00:03:21.140> on<00:03:21.379> the<00:03:21.470> pickaxe<00:03:21.829> so<00:03:22.129> it<00:03:22.340> obviously

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
touch on the pickaxe so it obviously

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.920 
touch on the pickaxe so it obviously
worked<00:03:23.620> I'll<00:03:24.620> show<00:03:25.040> you<00:03:25.099> by<00:03:25.629> mining<00:03:26.629> up<00:03:26.750> some

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
worked I'll show you by mining up some

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.710 
worked I'll show you by mining up some
ice<00:03:27.340> with<00:03:28.340> us<00:03:28.519> I<00:03:31.150> can't<00:03:32.150> actually<00:03:32.329> get<00:03:32.659> the

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
ice with us I can't actually get the

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.819 
ice with us I can't actually get the
block<00:03:34.540> did<00:03:35.540> I<00:03:35.659> change<00:03:35.900> that<00:03:36.170> where<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.590> can't

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
block did I change that where you can't

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:43.089 
block did I change that where you can't
mine<00:03:37.099> up<00:03:37.250> ice<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:38.530> maybe<00:03:39.530> then<00:03:39.739> in<00:03:39.920> huh<00:03:42.099> hot

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
mine up ice and maybe then in huh hot

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:50.080 
mine up ice and maybe then in huh hot
soap<00:03:43.400> types<00:03:43.700> let<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:44.060> mind<00:03:44.269> up<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:49.090> alright

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
soap types let you mind up the alright

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.729 
soap types let you mind up the alright
well<00:03:50.269> it<00:03:50.720> obviously<00:03:50.870> does<00:03:51.409> have<00:03:51.650> an

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
well it obviously does have an

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.500 
well it obviously does have an
enchantment<00:03:52.099> on<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:52.489> so<00:03:52.879> like<00:03:53.030> if<00:03:53.150> i<00:03:53.239> were<00:03:53.389> to

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
enchantment on it so like if i were to

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:00.420 
enchantment on it so like if i were to
dig<00:03:53.930> down<00:03:55.870> with<00:03:56.870> my<00:03:57.049> guest<00:03:57.290> here<00:03:57.909> get<00:03:58.909> in<00:03:59.120> there

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
dig down with my guest here get in there

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.210 
dig down with my guest here get in there
but<00:04:01.430> we<00:04:01.519> could<00:04:01.670> find<00:04:02.349> yeah<00:04:03.349> there<00:04:03.590> we<00:04:03.650> go<00:04:03.680> so<00:04:04.040> we

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
but we could find yeah there we go so we

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.530 
but we could find yeah there we go so we
got<00:04:04.370> stone<00:04:04.849> instead<00:04:05.209> of<00:04:07.030> whatever<00:04:08.030> we<00:04:08.359> would

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
got stone instead of whatever we would

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.960 
got stone instead of whatever we would
normally<00:04:08.659> get<00:04:09.079> which<00:04:09.980> the<00:04:10.220> recon<00:04:10.609> will<00:04:10.760> stone

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
normally get which the recon will stone

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.670 
normally get which the recon will stone
because<00:04:11.299> i<00:04:11.420> can't<00:04:11.659> think<00:04:11.840> right<00:04:11.959> now<00:04:12.109> for<00:04:12.650> some

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
because i can't think right now for some
