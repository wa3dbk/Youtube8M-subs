00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.410 
yeah i mean it's gonna hurt him but at
the<00:01:32.100> same<00:01:32.280> time<00:01:32.430> even<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.790> him<00:01:33.000> with<00:01:33.119> empower

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
the same time even a him with empower

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.380 
the same time even a him with empower
it's<00:01:34.200> gonna<00:01:34.409> hurt<00:01:34.710> but<00:01:34.970> he's<00:01:35.970> gonna<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.299> able

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
it's gonna hurt but he's gonna be able

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.450 
it's gonna hurt but he's gonna be able
to<00:01:36.540> clear<00:01:36.689> creek<00:01:36.990> waves<00:01:37.259> ridiculously<00:01:38.220> fast

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
to clear creek waves ridiculously fast

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.170 
to clear creek waves ridiculously fast
anyway<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.380> dignitas<00:01:40.610> this<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.850> still

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
anyway and dignitas this is still

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.539 
anyway and dignitas this is still
incredibly<00:01:42.600> risky<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.409> them<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:44.280> going<00:01:44.520> to

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
incredibly risky of them it's going to

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.630 
incredibly risky of them it's going to
take<00:01:44.790> one<00:01:45.659> bad<00:01:46.020> team<00:01:46.320> fight<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.860> that's<00:01:47.579> just

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
take one bad team fight and that's just

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.370 
take one bad team fight and that's just
going<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.909> be<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.090> end<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.390> game<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:49.079> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
going to be the end of the game so the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.870 
going to be the end of the game so the
rapier<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> certain<00:01:50.220> extent<00:01:50.430> has<00:01:50.579> worked

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
rapier to a certain extent has worked

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.700 
rapier to a certain extent has worked
thus<00:01:51.090> far<00:01:51.119> they<00:01:51.780> managed<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.259> push<00:01:52.439> fast

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
thus far they managed to push fast

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.550 
thus far they managed to push fast
enough<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.270> Lhota<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.930> he<00:01:55.140> felt<00:01:55.350> like<00:01:55.409> he

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
enough that Lhota just he felt like he

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.719 
enough that Lhota just he felt like he
couldn't<00:01:55.799> counter<00:01:56.159> push<00:01:56.340> which<00:01:56.579> is

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
couldn't counter push which is

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.980 
couldn't counter push which is
definitely<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.090> right<00:01:57.180> call<00:01:57.390> like<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.659> can't

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
definitely the right call like you can't

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.480 
definitely the right call like you can't
counter<00:01:58.439> push<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.770> but<00:01:58.979> at<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.100> same<00:01:59.280> time

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
counter push that but at the same time

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.300 
counter push that but at the same time
his<00:02:00.149> reaction<00:02:00.659> didn't<00:02:00.990> come<00:02:01.170> fast<00:02:01.409> enough<00:02:01.560> so

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
his reaction didn't come fast enough so

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.859 
his reaction didn't come fast enough so
wouldn't<00:02:02.729> have<00:02:02.820> just<00:02:02.939> been<00:02:03.119> better<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.630> sit

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
wouldn't have just been better to sit

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.749 
wouldn't have just been better to sit
there<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.380> just<00:02:04.740> attack<00:02:05.040> their<00:02:05.280> base<00:02:05.460> and

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
there and just attack their base and

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.910 
there and just attack their base and
maybe<00:02:06.420> get<00:02:06.659> something<00:02:07.020> out<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.469> as<00:02:07.619> opposed

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
maybe get something out of it as opposed

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.410 
maybe get something out of it as opposed
to<00:02:08.009> just<00:02:08.039> teleporting<00:02:08.580> back<00:02:08.759> not<00:02:09.030> getting<00:02:09.270> any

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
to just teleporting back not getting any

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.230 
to just teleporting back not getting any
farm<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:09.959> saying<00:02:10.470> oops<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.920> didn't<00:02:11.160> have<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.310> TV
