direct the piping bag and the hands at

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.459 
direct the piping bag and the hands at
the<00:00:41.440> top<00:00:41.800> is<00:00:42.100> doing<00:00:42.940> the<00:00:43.030> pressure<00:00:43.329> to<00:00:44.140> squeeze

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
the top is doing the pressure to squeeze

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.340 
the top is doing the pressure to squeeze
the<00:00:44.649> icing<00:00:45.129> out<00:00:45.309> of<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:45.640> bag<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.960> you<00:00:46.989> want<00:00:47.229> to

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
the icing out of the bag so you want to

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
make sure the icing goes right up to the

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.180 
make sure the icing goes right up to the
edge<00:00:50.949> of<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.519> case<00:00:51.789> and<00:00:52.260> make<00:00:53.260> sure<00:00:53.530> as<00:00:53.889> much

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
edge of the case and make sure as much

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.750 
edge of the case and make sure as much
as<00:00:54.339> possible<00:00:54.549> but<00:00:55.359> the<00:00:55.600> icing<00:00:55.780> bag<00:00:56.229> is

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
as possible but the icing bag is

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.660 
as possible but the icing bag is
vertical<00:00:58.319> so<00:00:59.319> with<00:00:59.559> even<00:00:59.920> pressure<00:01:00.749> slowly

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
vertical so with even pressure slowly

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.069 
vertical so with even pressure slowly
just<00:01:03.670> move<00:01:03.969> the<00:01:04.390> icing<00:01:04.960> bag<00:01:05.250> around<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:06.610> edge

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:07.079 
just move the icing bag around the edge

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:09.450 
just move the icing bag around the edge
you've<00:01:08.079> got<00:01:08.200> plenty<00:01:08.380> of<00:01:08.619> time<00:01:08.890> so<00:01:08.920> don't<00:01:09.310> rush

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
you've got plenty of time so don't rush

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.289 
you've got plenty of time so don't rush
it<00:01:09.700> and<00:01:09.939> then<00:01:10.920> go<00:01:11.920> over<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.250> top<00:01:12.670> half<00:01:12.969> and

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
it and then go over the top half and

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.480 
it and then go over the top half and
then<00:01:14.140> when<00:01:14.229> you<00:01:14.320> finish<00:01:14.560> ease<00:01:15.039> off<00:01:15.310> on<00:01:15.340> the

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
then when you finish ease off on the

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.840 
then when you finish ease off on the
pressure<00:01:15.820> and<00:01:16.180> just<00:01:16.780> pull<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.500> bag<00:01:17.710> up<00:01:18.100> and

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
pressure and just pull the bag up and

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.670 
pressure and just pull the bag up and
you<00:01:19.000> should<00:01:19.149> get<00:01:19.359> a<00:01:19.420> lovely<00:01:19.750> little<00:01:20.170> peak<00:01:20.380> like

rather than moving the piping bag and
then<00:02:08.530> pull<00:02:08.800> away<00:02:08.920> as<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:10.030> do<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.240> and<00:02:10.509> get<00:02:10.630> more

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
then pull away as you do it and get more

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.270 
then pull away as you do it and get more
practice<00:02:11.230> it<00:02:11.410> becomes<00:02:11.650> easier<00:02:12.070> and<00:02:12.160> easier

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
practice it becomes easier and easier

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.080 
practice it becomes easier and easier
and<00:02:13.350> again<00:02:14.350> just<00:02:14.620> keep<00:02:14.800> rotating<00:02:14.980> around

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
and again just keep rotating around

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.880 
and again just keep rotating around
now<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:16.390> can<00:02:16.569> do<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.900> double<00:02:17.110> layer<00:02:17.590> if<00:02:17.739> you

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
now you can do a double layer if you

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.479 
now you can do a double layer if you
wanted<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:19.440> but<00:02:20.440> I<00:02:20.500> am<00:02:20.920> just<00:02:21.130> going<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.370> do<00:02:21.459> a

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
wanted to but I am just going to do a

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.490 
wanted to but I am just going to do a
single<00:02:21.760> layer<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.270> what<00:02:23.110> going<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.290> do<00:02:23.380> to

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
single layer and what going to do to

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.710 
single layer and what going to do to
finish<00:02:23.770> off<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:23.980> middle<00:02:24.250> bit<00:02:24.400> it's<00:02:25.390> just<00:02:25.630> a

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
finish off the middle bit it's just a

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.839 
finish off the middle bit it's just a
big<00:02:26.140> rosette<00:02:26.830> in<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.099> middle<00:02:27.340> so<00:02:27.550> squeeze<00:02:27.819> a

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
big rosette in the middle so squeeze a

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.540 
big rosette in the middle so squeeze a
bit<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.150> harder<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.660> then<00:02:29.110> pull<00:02:29.380> away<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:30.430> you

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
bit of harder and then pull away and you

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.920 
bit of harder and then pull away and you
end<00:02:30.730> up<00:02:30.880> with<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.060> really<00:02:31.390> little<00:02:31.540> cute

actual<00:02:54.910> icing<00:02:55.269> itself<00:02:55.660> so<00:02:56.650> you<00:02:56.739> just<00:02:56.980> move

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
actual icing itself so you just move

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.559 
actual icing itself so you just move
that<00:02:57.430> around<00:02:57.489> I<00:02:57.970> might<00:02:58.090> put<00:02:58.269> a<00:02:58.299> little<00:02:58.450> bit

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
that around I might put a little bit

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:59.820 
that around I might put a little bit
more<00:02:58.750> on<00:02:58.840> there<00:02:58.989> good<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.380> be<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.500> little<00:02:59.709> bit

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
more on there good to be a little bit

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.660 
more on there good to be a little bit
generous<00:03:00.069> and<00:03:01.049> again<00:03:02.049> move<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.470> case<00:03:03.250> around

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
generous and again move the case around

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.259 
generous and again move the case around
not<00:03:04.390> your<00:03:04.660> palette<00:03:05.019> knife<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:06.760> you<00:03:06.819> do<00:03:07.030> that

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
not your palette knife so you do that

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.990 
not your palette knife so you do that
this<00:03:08.200> is<00:03:08.380> when<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.680> rotate<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.489> case<00:03:09.700> in<00:03:09.880> your

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
this is when you rotate the case in your

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.440 
this is when you rotate the case in your
hand<00:03:10.239> and<00:03:10.720> then<00:03:11.410> use<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:11.950> palette<00:03:12.370> knife<00:03:12.450> just

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
hand and then use the palette knife just

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.740 
hand and then use the palette knife just
to<00:03:13.660> smooth<00:03:13.959> it<00:03:14.080> off<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:14.880> little<00:03:15.880> bit<00:03:16.090> like<00:03:16.420> so

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
to smooth it off a little bit like so

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.849 
to smooth it off a little bit like so
and<00:03:17.819> to<00:03:18.819> cover<00:03:19.060> it<00:03:19.239> all<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:19.660> then<00:03:20.500> at<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.829> end

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
and to cover it all and then at the end

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.729 
and to cover it all and then at the end
you<00:03:21.489> can<00:03:21.609> just<00:03:21.880> go<00:03:22.000> back<00:03:22.239> over<00:03:22.660> it<00:03:22.720> until<00:03:23.620> you

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
you can just go back over it until you

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.460 
you can just go back over it until you
are<00:03:23.890> happy<00:03:24.570> so<00:03:25.570> there<00:03:25.720> we<00:03:25.810> go<00:03:25.840> that's<00:03:26.140> three

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
are happy so there we go that's three

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.810 
are happy so there we go that's three
different<00:03:26.799> ideas<00:03:27.190> using<00:03:27.880> buttercream<00:03:28.239> icing

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
different ideas using buttercream icing

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.220 
different ideas using buttercream icing
the<00:03:30.820> fourth<00:03:31.090> technique<00:03:31.299> is<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:32.200> use

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
the fourth technique is to use

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.770 
the fourth technique is to use
ready-made<00:03:32.739> icing<00:03:33.519> you<00:03:34.120> just<00:03:34.480> roll<00:03:34.750> out

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
ready-made icing you just roll out

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.740 
ready-made icing you just roll out
between<00:03:35.620> two<00:03:35.920> pieces<00:03:36.160> of<00:03:36.370> cling<00:03:36.670> wrap<00:03:36.850> like

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
between two pieces of cling wrap like

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.440 
between two pieces of cling wrap like
I've<00:03:37.930> done<00:03:38.049> here<00:03:38.220> put<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.310> icing<00:03:39.640> on<00:03:39.730> top<00:03:40.060> then

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
I've done here put the icing on top then

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.210 
I've done here put the icing on top then
put<00:03:40.480> another<00:03:40.870> piece<00:03:41.109> of<00:03:41.170> cling<00:03:41.440> wrap<00:03:41.590> on<00:03:41.890> top

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
put another piece of cling wrap on top

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.580 
put another piece of cling wrap on top
of<00:03:42.340> that<00:03:42.489> and<00:03:42.940> then<00:03:43.630> what<00:03:43.750> you<00:03:43.840> do<00:03:44.019> is<00:03:44.230> you<00:03:44.410> roll

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
of that and then what you do is you roll

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.349 
of that and then what you do is you roll
it<00:03:44.709> out<00:03:44.889> to<00:03:45.040> your<00:03:45.160> desired<00:03:45.549> thickness<00:03:45.639> and

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
it out to your desired thickness and

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.240 
it out to your desired thickness and
then<00:03:46.930> it<00:03:47.049> saves<00:03:47.260> on<00:03:47.440> any<00:03:47.590> mess<00:03:47.829> on<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.100> work

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
then it saves on any mess on the work

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.729 
then it saves on any mess on the work
surface<00:03:48.549> so<00:03:49.510> I've<00:03:49.630> chosen<00:03:49.870> to<00:03:50.139> do<00:03:50.290> black<00:03:50.680> and

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
surface so I've chosen to do black and

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.420 
surface so I've chosen to do black and
