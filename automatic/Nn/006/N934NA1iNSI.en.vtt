you've<00:01:02.809> been<00:01:02.989> involved<00:01:03.410> in<00:01:03.470> the<00:01:03.559> development

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
you've been involved in the development

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.250 
you've been involved in the development
of<00:01:04.159> the<00:01:04.280> new<00:01:04.400> single<00:01:04.879> thruster<00:01:05.239> lines<00:01:05.420> how<00:01:06.110> did

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
of the new single thruster lines how did

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.320 
of the new single thruster lines how did
that<00:01:06.380> turn<00:01:06.560> out<00:01:06.790> and<00:01:07.790> turned<00:01:07.970> out<00:01:08.090> really<00:01:08.210> well

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
that turn out and turned out really well

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.050 
that turn out and turned out really well
it's<00:01:08.750> a<00:01:08.869> great<00:01:09.229> all-round<00:01:09.500> board<00:01:10.040> and<00:01:10.340> gives

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
it's a great all-round board and gives

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.430 
it's a great all-round board and gives
you<00:01:11.119> a<00:01:11.180> lot<00:01:11.300> of<00:01:11.390> versatility<00:01:11.750> because<00:01:12.200> you<00:01:12.290> can

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
you a lot of versatility because you can

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.680 
you a lot of versatility because you can
use<00:01:12.619> it<00:01:12.770> as<00:01:12.890> a<00:01:12.920> single<00:01:13.190> fin<00:01:13.550> for<00:01:14.210> on<00:01:14.390> shore

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
use it as a single fin for on shore

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.270 
use it as a single fin for on shore
conditions<00:01:15.110> or<00:01:15.260> bump<00:01:15.470> and<00:01:15.619> jump<00:01:15.800> conditions

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
conditions or bump and jump conditions

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.130 
conditions or bump and jump conditions
when<00:01:16.550> you<00:01:16.640> don't<00:01:16.820> really<00:01:16.940> leave<00:01:17.180> that<00:01:17.390> multi

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
when you don't really leave that multi

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.170 
when you don't really leave that multi
fin<00:01:18.460> maneuverability<00:01:19.460> but<00:01:19.640> then<00:01:19.790> when<00:01:20.119> you

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
fin maneuverability but then when you

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.940 
fin maneuverability but then when you
get<00:01:20.300> to<00:01:20.360> better<00:01:20.690> wave<00:01:20.900> riding<00:01:21.259> conditions

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
get to better wave riding conditions

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.010 
get to better wave riding conditions
you<00:01:22.400> put<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:22.729> thruster<00:01:23.330> fins<00:01:23.540> in<00:01:23.690> the<00:01:23.780> sides

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
you put the thruster fins in the sides

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.660 
you put the thruster fins in the sides
and<00:01:24.229> it<00:01:24.350> loosens<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:24.770> board<00:01:24.950> up<00:01:25.040> a<00:01:25.160> lot<00:01:25.310> and<00:01:25.550> it

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
and it loosens the board up a lot and it

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.760 
and it loosens the board up a lot and it
moves<00:01:26.000> much<00:01:26.660> closer<00:01:26.990> towards<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.470> feeling<00:01:27.710> of

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
moves much closer towards the feeling of

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.950 
moves much closer towards the feeling of
a<00:01:27.860> club<00:01:28.100> fin<00:01:28.340> with<00:01:28.550> with<00:01:28.880> with<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.690> tight

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
a club fin with with with the tight

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.540 
a club fin with with with the tight
turns<00:01:30.290> and<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:30.770> under<00:01:31.100> grip<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:31.490> the

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
turns and the under grip and the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.570 
turns and the under grip and the
maneuverability<00:01:32.150> on<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.330> way<00:01:33.130> so<00:01:34.130> Ricardo

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
maneuverability on the way so Ricardo

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.980 
maneuverability on the way so Ricardo
what<00:01:34.880> about<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.180> shape<00:01:35.420> of<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.690> single

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
what about the shape of the single

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.249 
what about the shape of the single
thrusters<00:01:36.640> well<00:01:37.640> last<00:01:37.910> year<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.390> wave<00:01:38.869> boards

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
thrusters well last year the wave boards

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.529 
thrusters well last year the wave boards
worked<00:01:39.500> really<00:01:39.950> well<00:01:40.070> it<00:01:40.880> was<00:01:41.090> really<00:01:41.300> popular

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
worked really well it was really popular

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:44.590 
worked really well it was really popular
people<00:01:42.170> really<00:01:42.560> liked<00:01:42.740> it<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.190> this<00:01:43.970> year<00:01:44.210> for

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
people really liked it and this year for

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.529 
people really liked it and this year for
the<00:01:44.690> 2011<00:01:45.649> line<00:01:45.860> we<00:01:46.250> tested<00:01:47.090> it<00:01:47.210> with<00:01:47.330> the

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
the 2011 line we tested it with the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.359 
the 2011 line we tested it with the
addition<00:01:47.930> of<00:01:47.990> side<00:01:48.229> fins<00:01:48.530> in<00:01:48.680> it<00:01:48.830> and<00:01:49.009> it

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
addition of side fins in it and it

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.969 
addition of side fins in it and it
worked<00:01:49.580> great<00:01:49.940> so<00:01:50.180> we<00:01:50.570> didn't<00:01:50.780> need<00:01:50.899> to<00:01:51.140> change

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
worked great so we didn't need to change

00:01:51.979 --> 00:02:13.890 
worked great so we didn't need to change
the<00:01:52.160> anything<00:01:52.520> on<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.729> shape<00:01:52.940> of<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.210> board

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.990 

you're<00:02:14.900> one<00:02:15.020> of<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.200> few<00:02:15.379> guys<00:02:15.560> on<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.550> PWA

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
you're one of the few guys on the PWA

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.540 
you're one of the few guys on the PWA
tour<00:02:17.209> actually<00:02:17.870> uses<00:02:18.650> production<00:02:19.160> boards<00:02:19.430> in

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
tour actually uses production boards in

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.940 
tour actually uses production boards in
the<00:02:19.640> competitions<00:02:20.209> right<00:02:20.420> yeah<00:02:21.410> last<00:02:21.650> year<00:02:21.830> I

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
the competitions right yeah last year I

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.070 
the competitions right yeah last year I
used<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.790> production<00:02:23.239> way<00:02:23.390> forward<00:02:23.810> in<00:02:23.900> Gran

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
used the production way forward in Gran

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.900 
used the production way forward in Gran
Canaria<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.739> manzil<00:02:25.069> and<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.640> really

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
Canaria and the manzil and I really

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.910 
Canaria and the manzil and I really
liked<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.150> board<00:02:26.360> had<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.170> good<00:02:27.349> year<00:02:27.560> so<00:02:27.590> I

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
liked the board had a good year so I

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.040 
liked the board had a good year so I
think<00:02:28.129> the<00:02:28.340> board<00:02:28.519> was<00:02:28.640> working<00:02:28.970> well<00:02:29.150> but<00:02:30.019> I

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
think the board was working well but I

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.089 
think the board was working well but I
don't<00:02:30.230> really<00:02:30.410> have<00:02:30.530> as<00:02:30.709> much<00:02:30.830> time

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
don't really have as much time

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.220 
don't really have as much time
developing<00:02:31.610> boards<00:02:32.239> as<00:02:32.360> people<00:02:32.930> like<00:02:33.019> Jason

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
developing boards as people like Jason

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.199 
developing boards as people like Jason
and<00:02:33.560> Kelly<00:02:33.890> because<00:02:34.280> I<00:02:34.310> do<00:02:34.370> slalom<00:02:34.849> am<00:02:34.970> waves

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
and Kelly because I do slalom am waves

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.750 
and Kelly because I do slalom am waves
so<00:02:35.599> when<00:02:36.349> I<00:02:36.380> got<00:02:36.590> these<00:02:36.709> new<00:02:36.920> single<00:02:37.280> thrusters

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
so when I got these new single thrusters

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.490 
so when I got these new single thrusters
I<00:02:37.790> was<00:02:38.120> pleasantly<00:02:38.630> surprised<00:02:39.019> with<00:02:39.140> how<00:02:39.290> well

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
I was pleasantly surprised with how well

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.199 
I was pleasantly surprised with how well
they<00:02:39.680> turned<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.220> since<00:02:40.849> it<00:02:40.910> was<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.030> board

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
they turned and since it was a board

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.640 
they turned and since it was a board
that<00:02:41.330> I<00:02:41.390> already<00:02:41.540> loved<00:02:41.810> last<00:02:42.110> year<00:02:42.379> I<00:02:42.410> think

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
that I already loved last year I think

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.809 
that I already loved last year I think
it's<00:02:42.769> gonna<00:02:42.890> make<00:02:42.980> it<00:02:43.099> even<00:02:43.370> easier<00:02:43.459> this<00:02:43.760> year

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
it's gonna make it even easier this year

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.000 
it's gonna make it even easier this year
because<00:02:44.120> it's<00:02:45.110> still<00:02:45.319> a<00:02:45.349> great<00:02:45.530> board<00:02:45.860> in

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
because it's still a great board in

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.770 
because it's still a great board in
onshore<00:02:46.489> conditions<00:02:46.880> but<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.150> just<00:02:47.299> turns<00:02:47.599> so

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
onshore conditions but it just turns so

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.930 
onshore conditions but it just turns so
much<00:02:47.930> tighter<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:49.190> feels<00:02:49.519> more<00:02:49.730> like<00:02:49.880> a

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
much tighter and and feels more like a

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.009 
much tighter and and feels more like a
quadroon<00:02:50.360> which<00:02:50.510> is<00:02:50.630> something<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:50.900> would<00:02:50.959> have

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
quadroon which is something I would have

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.199 
quadroon which is something I would have
liked<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.260> have<00:02:51.440> used<00:02:51.769> but<00:02:52.579> the<00:02:52.730> single<00:02:53.060> thing

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
liked to have used but the single thing

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.699 
liked to have used but the single thing
just<00:02:53.390> gave<00:02:53.540> me<00:02:53.750> more<00:02:53.900> power<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.470> get<00:02:54.590> out

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
just gave me more power to get out

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.979 
just gave me more power to get out
through<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.069> waves<00:02:55.280> and<00:02:55.579> and<00:02:55.880> you<00:02:56.150> know<00:02:56.299> to<00:02:56.360> to

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
through the waves and and you know to to

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.490 
through the waves and and you know to to
be<00:02:57.170> doing<00:02:57.380> a<00:02:57.440> lot<00:02:57.500> of<00:02:57.560> stuff<00:02:57.829> during<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.190> heats

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
be doing a lot of stuff during the heats

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.960 
be doing a lot of stuff during the heats
and<00:03:00.500> Ricardo<00:03:01.010> how<00:03:01.190> did<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.400> boards<00:03:01.670> work<00:03:01.790> in

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
and Ricardo how did the boards work in

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.270 
and Ricardo how did the boards work in
the<00:03:02.030> bigger<00:03:02.209> waves<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:02.829> think<00:03:03.829> their<00:03:03.980> boards

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
the bigger waves I think their boards

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.880 
the bigger waves I think their boards
were<00:03:04.430> great<00:03:04.730> you<00:03:05.660> you<00:03:05.959> in<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.410> bigger<00:03:06.620> way<00:03:06.709> if

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
were great you you in a bigger way if

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.789 
were great you you in a bigger way if
you<00:03:07.069> have<00:03:07.220> a<00:03:07.250> lot<00:03:07.519> of<00:03:07.610> speed<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.150> this<00:03:09.079> with

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
you have a lot of speed and this with

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.500 
you have a lot of speed and this with
the<00:03:09.920> side<00:03:10.130> fins<00:03:10.400> in<00:03:10.579> it<00:03:10.700> you<00:03:11.000> have<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.269> lot<00:03:11.480> of

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
the side fins in it you have a lot of

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.500 
the side fins in it you have a lot of
control<00:03:12.049> so<00:03:13.010> when<00:03:13.250> you<00:03:13.370> do<00:03:13.579> a<00:03:13.610> bottom<00:03:14.180> turn<00:03:14.360> or

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
control so when you do a bottom turn or

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.920 
control so when you do a bottom turn or
a<00:03:14.569> top<00:03:14.810> turn<00:03:15.489> you<00:03:16.489> can<00:03:16.670> push<00:03:16.910> harder<00:03:17.299> and<00:03:17.480> you

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
a top turn you can push harder and you

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.840 
a top turn you can push harder and you
don't<00:03:18.109> have<00:03:18.200> this<00:03:18.470> typical<00:03:18.889> tail<00:03:19.370> slide<00:03:19.670> that

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
don't have this typical tail slide that

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.789 
don't have this typical tail slide that
you<00:03:19.940> can<00:03:20.120> regularly<00:03:20.540> have<00:03:20.870> when<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.590> wave<00:03:21.769> is

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
you can regularly have when the wave is

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.199 
you can regularly have when the wave is
big<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:22.340> you<00:03:22.430> have<00:03:22.459> a<00:03:22.579> lot<00:03:22.819> of<00:03:22.850> wind<00:03:23.090> in<00:03:23.180> your

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
big and you have a lot of wind in your

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.020 
big and you have a lot of wind in your
sails<00:03:24.069> so<00:03:25.069> Robbie<00:03:25.340> could<00:03:25.519> you<00:03:25.609> sum<00:03:25.760> it<00:03:25.880> up<00:03:25.940> for

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
sails so Robbie could you sum it up for

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.970 
sails so Robbie could you sum it up for
us<00:03:26.209> please<00:03:26.319> yeah<00:03:27.319> I<00:03:27.350> think<00:03:27.470> that<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:27.829> new

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
us please yeah I think that the new

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.309 
us please yeah I think that the new
single<00:03:28.340> thrusters<00:03:28.819> are<00:03:29.000> extremely<00:03:29.870> versatile

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
single thrusters are extremely versatile

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.250 
single thrusters are extremely versatile
board<00:03:30.590> it's<00:03:30.829> an<00:03:31.040> it's<00:03:31.489> an<00:03:31.609> amazing<00:03:32.060> board<00:03:32.359> in

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
board it's an it's an amazing board in

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.110 
board it's an it's an amazing board in
bump<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:33.829> jump<00:03:33.980> conditions<00:03:34.459> and<00:03:34.760> it<00:03:34.940> also

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
bump and jump conditions and it also

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.059 
bump and jump conditions and it also
works<00:03:35.480> incredibly<00:03:36.049> well<00:03:36.139> when<00:03:36.590> it<00:03:36.709> when<00:03:36.980> the

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
works incredibly well when it when the

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.199 
works incredibly well when it when the
conditions<00:03:37.430> start<00:03:37.639> getting<00:03:37.880> good<00:03:38.000> and<00:03:38.150> you

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
conditions start getting good and you

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.479 
conditions start getting good and you
start<00:03:38.450> going<00:03:38.660> down<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.840> line<00:03:39.109> and<00:03:39.370> adding<00:03:40.370> the

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
start going down the line and adding the

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.610 
start going down the line and adding the
new<00:03:40.609> fins<00:03:40.910> have<00:03:41.209> given<00:03:41.810> us<00:03:41.900> great<00:03:42.139> versatility

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
new fins have given us great versatility

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.520 
new fins have given us great versatility
and<00:03:43.040> we've<00:03:43.850> even<00:03:44.090> added<00:03:44.150> a<00:03:44.359> 99<00:03:44.900> liter<00:03:45.230> board<00:03:45.440> in

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
and we've even added a 99 liter board in

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.870 
and we've even added a 99 liter board in
the<00:03:45.590> range<00:03:45.769> this<00:03:45.980> year<00:03:46.190> as<00:03:46.280> well<00:03:46.459> which<00:03:46.639> mike

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
the range this year as well which mike

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.150 
the range this year as well which mike
and<00:03:47.090> antoine<00:03:47.389> have<00:03:47.540> been<00:03:47.660> testing<00:03:48.109> and<00:03:48.290> I'm

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
and antoine have been testing and I'm

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.410 
and antoine have been testing and I'm
thinking<00:03:49.430> about<00:03:49.459> using<00:03:49.700> it<00:03:49.940> for<00:03:50.060> zeal<00:03:50.209> too

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
thinking about using it for zeal too

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.670 
thinking about using it for zeal too
because<00:03:50.780> it<00:03:50.930> just<00:03:51.019> gives<00:03:51.170> you<00:03:51.290> a<00:03:51.350> little<00:03:51.500> bit

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
because it just gives you a little bit

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.500 
because it just gives you a little bit
of<00:03:51.769> extra<00:03:51.950> power<00:03:52.250> and<00:03:52.370> volume<00:03:53.090> when<00:03:53.359> it's

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
of extra power and volume when it's

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.870 
of extra power and volume when it's
really<00:03:53.630> light
