00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
built that I've been trying to work on I

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.179 
built that I've been trying to work on I
set<00:00:06.990> myself<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.350> challenge<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.890> build<00:00:08.010> myself

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
set myself the challenge to build myself

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.580 
set myself the challenge to build myself
a<00:00:08.519> very<00:00:08.760> well<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.150> more<00:00:09.480> original<00:00:09.870> deck<00:00:10.080> using

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
a very well a more original deck using

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.080 
a very well a more original deck using
some<00:00:10.889> different<00:00:11.070> arc<00:00:11.400> types<00:00:11.639> from<00:00:11.820> what<00:00:12.000> I'm

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
some different arc types from what I'm

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.509 
some different arc types from what I'm
used<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.420> so<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.230> chose<00:00:13.500> machines<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.460> they

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
used to so I chose machines and they

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.939 
used to so I chose machines and they
chose<00:00:14.700> roids<00:00:15.150> so<00:00:15.630> I've<00:00:16.379> been<00:00:16.500> trying<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.800> sound

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
chose roids so I've been trying to sound

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.170 
chose roids so I've been trying to sound
to<00:00:17.100> all<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.250> network<00:00:17.520> it's<00:00:17.730> capable<00:00:17.880> of

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
to all the network it's capable of

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.849 
to all the network it's capable of
willing<00:00:18.480> winning<00:00:19.140> it's<00:00:19.350> not<00:00:19.470> gonna<00:00:19.590> be<00:00:19.710> top

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
willing winning it's not gonna be top

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.529 
willing winning it's not gonna be top
tier<00:00:20.070> but<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.670> thought<00:00:20.789> I'd<00:00:20.910> profile<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.420> with

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
tier but I thought I'd profile it with

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.320 
tier but I thought I'd profile it with
you<00:00:21.630> guys<00:00:22.400> let<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.730> know<00:00:23.820> let<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.090> know<00:00:24.210> my

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
you guys let you know let you know my

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.849 
you guys let you know let you know my
thoughts<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.930> wanted<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.230> see<00:00:25.350> what<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.619> think

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
of it see what I can change in it but

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.380 
of it see what I can change in it but
yeah<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.470> my<00:00:28.800> machine<00:00:28.949> arroyo<00:00:29.550> build<00:00:29.910> and

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
yeah this is my machine arroyo build and

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.880 
yeah this is my machine arroyo build and
I'll<00:00:30.510> explain<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.900> few<00:00:31.080> things<00:00:31.320> as<00:00:31.439> we<00:00:31.560> got<00:00:31.740> on

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
I'll explain a few things as we got on

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.250 
I'll explain a few things as we got on
so<00:00:32.759> first<00:00:33.030> up<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.210> first<00:00:33.510> three<00:00:33.690> cards<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.079> use

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
so first up the first three cards I use

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
so first up the first three cards I use
in<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.820> expressroid<00:00:36.500> this<00:00:37.500> card<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.860> essential

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
in it expressroid this card is essential

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.459 
in it expressroid this card is essential
for<00:00:38.430> its<00:00:38.719> recycling<00:00:39.719> roids<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.290> deck

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
for its recycling roids and this deck

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.500 
for its recycling roids and this deck
it's<00:00:40.620> also<00:00:40.770> useful<00:00:41.010> for<00:00:41.270> machine<00:00:42.270> duplication

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
it's also useful for machine duplication

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.920 
it's also useful for machine duplication
combos<00:00:43.320> which<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.649> use<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> lot<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> stack<00:00:44.930> it

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
combos which I use a lot in the stack it

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.990 
combos which I use a lot in the stack it
sprays<00:00:46.260> basically<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.890> key<00:00:47.100> recycler<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
sprays basically the key recycler of the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.500 
sprays basically the key recycler of the
deck<00:00:48.350> helping<00:00:49.350> with<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.530> combo<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.340> run<00:00:51.120> three

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
deck helping with that combo I run three

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.029 
deck helping with that combo I run three
ambulance<00:00:52.199> right<00:00:52.350> again<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.680> machine

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
ambulance right again a machine

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.400 
ambulance right again a machine
duplication<00:00:53.219> target<00:00:53.969> also<00:00:54.750> when<00:00:55.050> they<00:00:55.199> use

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
duplication target also when they use

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.840 
duplication target also when they use
Express<00:00:55.800> word<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.100> add<00:00:56.219> stuff<00:00:56.399> back<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.760> my

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
Express word to add stuff back to my

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.639 
Express word to add stuff back to my
hand<00:00:57.059> if<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.539> ambulance<00:00:57.989> ride<00:00:58.199> out<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.500> can

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
hand if I have ambulance ride out I can

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.380 
hand if I have ambulance ride out I can
special<00:00:58.949> summon<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.340> instead<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.149> with
