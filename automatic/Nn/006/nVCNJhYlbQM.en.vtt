00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:12.939 
in the filter options pane I want to

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.480 
in the filter options pane I want to
adjust<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.450> strength<00:02:13.870> we<00:02:14.379> need<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.680> intense

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
adjust the strength we need to intense

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.760 
adjust the strength we need to intense
this<00:02:15.760> purple<00:02:16.240> to<00:02:16.630> make<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:16.870> even<00:02:17.140> brighter<00:02:17.530> and

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
this purple to make it even brighter and

this purple to make it even brighter and
stronger<00:02:18.270> so<00:02:19.270> move<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.990> strength<00:02:20.260> slider

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
stronger so move the strength slider

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.210 
stronger so move the strength slider
over<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.070> right<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:22.590> then<00:02:23.590> down<00:02:23.860> at<00:02:24.160> the

bottom the last thing that we need to

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.650 
bottom the last thing that we need to
change<00:02:26.590> is<00:02:26.860> our<00:02:27.130> mode<00:02:27.430> this<00:02:27.850> is<00:02:28.060> how<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.300> photo

that<00:02:36.610> we're<00:02:36.910> going<00:02:36.940> for<00:02:37.150> so<00:02:37.870> go<00:02:38.050> ahead<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:38.260> try

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
that we're going for so go ahead and try

that we're going for so go ahead and try
the<00:02:38.560> other<00:02:38.740> three<00:02:39.100> will<00:02:39.670> select<00:02:40.060> strong<00:02:41.280> this

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
the other three will select strong this

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.810 
the other three will select strong this
is<00:02:42.430> much<00:02:42.730> better<00:02:43.110> we'll<00:02:44.110> try<00:02:44.350> subtle<00:02:44.890> this<00:02:45.670> is

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
is much better we'll try subtle this is

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.640 
is much better we'll try subtle this is
a<00:02:45.850> little<00:02:46.180> bit<00:02:46.300> less<00:02:46.480> intense<00:02:47.020> than<00:02:47.320> the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
a little bit less intense than the

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.220 
a little bit less intense than the
strong<00:02:48.070> version<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.670> then<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.510> one<00:02:49.690> that<00:02:50.080> I

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
strong version and then the one that I

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.100 
strong version and then the one that I
typically<00:02:50.740> use<00:02:50.890> is<00:02:51.280> clean<00:02:51.850> highlights<00:02:52.570> this

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
typically use is clean highlights this

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.380 
typically use is clean highlights this
is<00:02:53.290> one<00:02:53.440> of<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.680> best<00:02:54.040> for<00:02:54.520> applying<00:02:54.850> a<00:02:55.060> new

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
is one of the best for applying a new

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.900 
is one of the best for applying a new
color<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:56.260> areas<00:02:56.590> like<00:02:56.620> lips<00:02:57.160> eyes<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.630> cheeks

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
color to areas like lips eyes and cheeks

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.100 
color to areas like lips eyes and cheeks
the<00:03:00.910> last<00:03:01.120> option<00:03:01.300> that<00:03:01.600> I<00:03:01.630> find<00:03:01.900> extremely

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
the last option that I find extremely

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.590 
the last option that I find extremely
useful<00:03:02.530> in<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.010> photo<00:03:03.190> filter<00:03:03.610> pane<00:03:03.820> is<00:03:04.030> the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
useful in the photo filter pane is the

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.230 
useful in the photo filter pane is the
polarizer<00:03:05.230> it's<00:03:05.890> a<00:03:05.980> great<00:03:06.190> way<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.430> simulate<00:03:07.060> a

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
polarizer it's a great way to simulate a

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.270 
polarizer it's a great way to simulate a
polarizer<00:03:07.750> filter<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.530> can<00:03:08.800> increase

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
polarizer filter and can increase

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.390 
polarizer filter and can increase
contrast<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.840> help<00:03:11.350> maintain<00:03:11.650> some<00:03:12.160> of<00:03:12.280> the

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
contrast and help maintain some of the

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.910 
contrast and help maintain some of the
natural<00:03:12.610> tones<00:03:13.180> underneath<00:03:13.510> our<00:03:14.290> new<00:03:14.500> filter

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
natural tones underneath our new filter

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.390 
natural tones underneath our new filter
by<00:03:15.790> moving<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.180> over<00:03:16.300> to<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.660> right<00:03:17.400> you're

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
by moving it over to the right you're

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.470 
by moving it over to the right you're
not<00:03:18.550> going<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.760> notice<00:03:18.940> a<00:03:19.150> huge<00:03:19.390> difference

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
not going to notice a huge difference

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.260 
not going to notice a huge difference
but<00:03:20.380> it<00:03:20.410> will<00:03:20.710> make<00:03:20.740> a<00:03:20.980> very<00:03:21.370> large<00:03:21.670> one<00:03:21.910> in<00:03:22.120> the

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
but it will make a very large one in the

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.170 
but it will make a very large one in the
end<00:03:22.890> now<00:03:23.890> we<00:03:23.950> need<00:03:24.250> to<00:03:24.280> go<00:03:24.460> through<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:24.970> select

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
end now we need to go through and select

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.970 
end now we need to go through and select
which<00:03:25.630> parts<00:03:25.990> of<00:03:26.080> our<00:03:26.200> image<00:03:26.500> we<00:03:26.680> want<00:03:26.860> to

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
which parts of our image we want to

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.490 
which parts of our image we want to
apply<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.370> color<00:03:27.670> to<00:03:28.060> as<00:03:28.300> you<00:03:29.020> can<00:03:29.170> see<00:03:29.350> it's

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
apply the color to as you can see it's

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.380 
apply the color to as you can see it's
Universal<00:03:30.040> across<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.520> entire<00:03:30.760> photo<00:03:31.120> and

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
Universal across the entire photo and

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.170 
Universal across the entire photo and
that's<00:03:31.540> not<00:03:31.720> what<00:03:31.870> we're<00:03:32.050> going<00:03:32.230> for<00:03:32.640> so<00:03:33.640> up<00:03:33.880> on

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
that's not what we're going for so up on

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.360 
that's not what we're going for so up on
the<00:03:34.480> top<00:03:34.690> left<00:03:35.020> hand<00:03:35.140> corner<00:03:35.320> of<00:03:35.710> your<00:03:35.800> preview

you're going to select your masking
