some friends and see who can beat you
now<00:01:24.090> like<00:01:24.300> I<00:01:24.420> said<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.810> games<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.290> are

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
now like I said the games on this are

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.780 
now like I said the games on this are
just<00:01:25.680> like<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.979> arcade<00:01:26.280> games<00:01:26.550> but

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
just like the arcade games but

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.580 
just like the arcade games but
controlling<00:01:27.270> them<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.720> be<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.900> bit<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.380> pain

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
controlling them can be a bit of a pain

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.740 
controlling them can be a bit of a pain
when<00:01:28.619> using<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.130> d-pad<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:30.330> just<00:01:30.479> feels<00:01:30.690> a

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
when using the d-pad it just feels a

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.330 
when using the d-pad it just feels a
little<00:01:30.930> bit<00:01:31.020> strange<00:01:31.410> especially<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.220> games

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
little bit strange especially in games

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.310 
little bit strange especially in games
like<00:01:32.550> asteroids<00:01:33.090> where<00:01:33.450> momentum<00:01:33.930> picks<00:01:34.110> up

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
like asteroids where momentum picks up

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.900 
like asteroids where momentum picks up
and<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.830> is<00:01:34.950> even<00:01:35.190> harder<00:01:35.520> if<00:01:35.640> you're<00:01:35.790> using

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
and this is even harder if you're using

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.730 
and this is even harder if you're using
the<00:01:36.119> Gameboy<00:01:36.420> player<00:01:36.660> for<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> bigger<00:01:37.380> screen

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
the Gameboy player for a bigger screen

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.290 
the Gameboy player for a bigger screen
like<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.100> was<00:01:38.310> since<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.729> gives<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> really

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
like I was since it gives you a really

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.630 
like I was since it gives you a really
small<00:01:39.509> delay<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.649> issue<00:01:40.890> isn't<00:01:41.130> present<00:01:41.580> on

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
small delay this issue isn't present on

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.410 
small delay this issue isn't present on
every<00:01:41.850> game<00:01:42.030> though

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
every game though

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.240 
every game though
Tampa's<00:01:43.140> centipede<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.619> battle<00:01:44.009> zones

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
Tampa's centipede and battle zones

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.980 
Tampa's centipede and battle zones
probably<00:01:44.910> made<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.149> best<00:01:45.360> transition<00:01:45.899> to

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
probably made the best transition to

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.810 
probably made the best transition to
this<00:01:46.110> control<00:01:46.440> setup<00:01:46.800> while<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.430> worst<00:01:47.610> by

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
this control setup while the worst by

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.030 
this control setup while the worst by
far<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.270> super<00:01:48.570> breakout<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.470> game<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.800> almost

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
far is super breakout the game is almost

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.070 
far is super breakout the game is almost
impossible<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.940> play<00:01:51.149> with<00:01:51.390> either<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.780> d-pad

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
impossible to play with either the d-pad

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.900 
impossible to play with either the d-pad
or<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.470> GameCube<00:01:52.860> analog<00:01:53.220> stick<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.729> it's

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
or the GameCube analog stick and it's

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.520 
or the GameCube analog stick and it's
really<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.300> shame<00:01:54.360> considering<00:01:55.140> how<00:01:55.320> well

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
really a shame considering how well

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.800 
really a shame considering how well
liked<00:01:55.800> it<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.149> Missile<00:01:57.149> Command<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.509> actually

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
liked it is Missile Command is actually

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.300 
liked it is Missile Command is actually
really<00:01:57.960> suited<00:01:58.350> for<00:01:58.440> the<00:01:58.530> GBA<00:01:58.860> controls

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
