00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.130
 according to pps, Brazil should invest in the coming years about 274 billion 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.629
 of real 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.360
 in projects for electric power telephony ports 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.839
 if it were railroads 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.640
 hardly despite the concession enters the second half of 2010 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.750
 to understand a little more about attitude strategic positioning 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.219
 businessman should have moment like this 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.210
 the sting brother so far the concrete show 2010 são paulo to show the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.399
 example of a company that adapts itself to the period in which the country 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.730
 through 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.730
 as soon as we noticed the arrival of this wave of growth 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:58.360
 investments in major infrastructure projects 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.880
 sh fôrmas started a process of study and search for innovative solutions 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.160
 for your industry 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.990
 with this guy is not from today rest post-crisis period not many until 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.280
 even from the crisis 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.210
 sh invests a lot in training then 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.970
 we hired many engineers at chemical site 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.330
 and are not premiere equipment of other 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.370
 many countries and we bring the technology if we bring 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.290
 a lot of manpower 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.250
 market, because it is not only a matter of 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.020
 It's a question of what you're giving support to the builders so they 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.220
 I can work with the equipment the strong recital even if the people 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.260
 consider the equipment agent manufactures bring technology 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.820
 he denies staff 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.549
 so this one was really strong 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.210
 now to what is bringing we had a policeman despite all 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.970
 the problems that 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.560
 we wanted to try to get here people have not been able to 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.510
 in bauru this year we were there we saw 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.620
 some news brought here at the fair always has one that did not have bad but 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.270
 visiting the fair visit far out 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.549
 there will be some with some news 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.570
 has some highlights we have in the form of aluminum 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.829
 who will be here we believe that now 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:15.739
 some projects are coming out some approvals 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.070
 connections that 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.750
 I was a little stuck on some organs, they consume everything here 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.789
 end of year 

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:23.399
 in this sector 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:26.299
 very driven by my house my life 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.870
 will actually go out of print and demand for this kind of form will be very 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.930
 large we have a class of cargo also with capacity sixteen tons with 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.930
 a pole is mounted with the with the poll kg 

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:42.089
 It does not become a kombi with one hand a novelty but it is a use 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:45.529
 different from the equipment we already had 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:48.529
 we have another crewmember this development not only 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:51.549
 the way that it rises by 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.059
 by means of rails 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:54.259
 we have there 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:57.259
 to adapt to the Brazilian reality, the company went abroad 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:01.309
 examples of techniques and equipment to be contracted this data 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.690
 sh fôrmas took advantage of the concrete show 2010 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.330
 to present the latest results of these studies emissions 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.289
 mysterious 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:16.559
 because we'll see what I'm going to show you now 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:18.409
 the auto crew system 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.809
 in fact if the first concrete but the high tripodi system that wants 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:24.769
 the system that does not depend on gluttony 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.419
 To stop to make the patisseries. 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:28.839
 so he is a 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:31.719
 the equipment that alone can move 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:35.269
 so here we can see the equipment as a whole that the mission 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.449
 It's the commander. 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:38.799
 some sets 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.199
 the cart he advances record 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.529
 As you go full you advance phase 

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:46.509
 that form a circle 

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:48.099
 the insects 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.529
 there completing so little 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:54.119
 We can go back 

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:55.739
 after the concrete people 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.499
 We put the st 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:59.649
 and will serve as a guide rail 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:00.930
 do not worry 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.299
 that is put as it is shown there 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:04.799
 this system 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.449
 when it starts the assembly 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:09.449
 there are some security locks so that this profile does not fall 

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:13.799
 This is a high piece ishiguro winch that held 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.069
 Lisicki, who's going? 

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:20.279
 henrique grandson of this structure and basically it works this way 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.460
 is an alert carving 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.879
 historical all set 

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:28.879
 Then, no later you withdraw. 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.740
 resort now you think it's a concrete 

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:36.319
 basically system is like this 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:37.550
 and an av thing 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.349
 I have the applicability of this technique and this material 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:43.749
 you can be part of this you can do 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:47.300
 Concrete can be suffered by any country that you can not get here 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.610
 one form on the other side a fable of sound 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.159
 What you do not need from you, you want to get the healing operation. 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:57.340
 is perhaps even replacing a 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.120
 an area as a way of selecting the tip you can use the player said to have 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.469
 request of the author that you have 

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:05.879
 on Sunday the element exposes what you want to complete 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:07.539
 He'll have to make the bill. 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.589
 whether the crane is viable or not 

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:12.589
 he needs to account for speed with apimec sp 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.610
 then all and all all these factors impact on the navigability the new 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.610
 equipment but as it practically 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.400
 it is an evil that crew members alone it works the saints requires a lot of resource 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.639
 the absence of external elements 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:29.100
 and ends up going out cheaper 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.270
 that one 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.759
 and titans deliver high productivity 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:36.229
 I had an evening to specialize. 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:40.050
 due to the structure of the 2010 concrete show if the burning of products offered 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.160
 by sh forms 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.569
 not everything can be shown here far 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:47.389
 check out the news of the company's website blind date because the computer
