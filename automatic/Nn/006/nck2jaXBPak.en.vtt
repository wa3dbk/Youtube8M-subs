00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 today I'm going to talk to you about this 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.350
 mascara called volume seduction 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.420
 bourgeois masia but then what are you 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.730
 I'll tell you about this mascara and 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.139
 not another 35 billion who list 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.179
 well because as you can 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.789
 see here there was a small 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.699
 accessory called the accessory 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.050
 eyelash curler 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.510
 so it's not a knot like that 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.119
 this is an accessory you put 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.119
 like his college on the eyelid and like that 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.120
 you can karate mass to death you 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.210
 will never have small traces of 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.300
 mascara under magical maginot eyelid 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.100
 magic so how does it work so already 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.590
 you are trying to take off your little 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.200
 accessory and it's quite complicated 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.170
 as you can see so you 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.090
 you break 4 nails you weigh yourself 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.949
 ask your case to help you this is 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.829
 horror but that in the end after a 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:01.460
 moment the scotch samba so here it is 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.379
 how is the little accessory 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.360
 which I think is you make 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.610
 pretty cute way you see it's 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.010
 a little do not see it and you have them 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.500
 small in the gold ptt like the wines 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.130
 from small dogs to minots that go 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.600
 so go to google to see if that 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.220
 walk really see I have absolutely 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.240
 nothing put on my eyelid can without 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.710
 can not say no but that's 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.290
 make-up makes a trace of mascara that 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.100
 is too naive but there is nothing even 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.400
 no two small strokes of black pencil 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:36.540
 nothing nothing nothing so we go it's gone 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.920
 we put the little accessory date if 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.000
 you see what is a little bit 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.030
 pity it is not the eye 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.570
 law 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.159
 I have a little curved eye and that's good 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.010
 not really to it's a pure go to my 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.369
 taste but well we will not formalize it 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.860
 will say that I have the eye a little straight 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.190
 it's not easy a witness what we 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.800
 could think what is enough 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.790
 disastrous even so I ask no it does not 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:10.890
 not go wells there are two things 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:10.890
 so that's it so it does not work 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:22.480
 like that so it goes from a small disaster 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.880
 did he actually have any 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.440
 you see the pose like that but a 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.170
 thickness so that I can not 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.019
 flatten it and so the brush does not arrive 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.790
 never on the site ah if the blood can 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:43.290
 see on the tip but suddenly 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.810
 ba hoku in this case how god it is 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.719
 a little pity so in phase i with 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:53.819
 the other ambidextrous attention of mascara 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:57.140
 so I put it here and take the path 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.140
 it's not practical at all 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.260
 here I will not be able to do better 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.970
 so it's a little down I confess I 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.650
 think that when we really have taken 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.980
 hand technique already that's a little 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.510
 easier but honestly 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:26.640
 I can do the same thing or a lot 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:28.950
 better without the small the little accessory 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:34.140
 in combat so so then normally we 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:37.739
 We boasts a volume x 10 c doubtful 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.690
 I think we're not there at all and 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.170
 especially there is an incredible thickness 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:46.829
 of the stuff 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:48.480
 finally the ump did it basically you 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.810
 do not have to take the base of the eyelashes 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:57.120
 which is a little the essential that 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:04:01.079
 would allow husband to have a real volume 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:04.829
 is there actually that it blocks so small 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:07.380
 very happy opinion we'll say it's 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:10.950
 cute we can believe it we are in fact 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:14.510
 down it does not work and well here and go 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.510
 Now it's your turn
