00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.820
 the track was not a game for a long time 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.039
 practice is there any concern with this 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.189
 about how we will feel on 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.809
 field in the team for me injury 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.239
 it's like new and 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.269
 special did not get so really 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.910
 how not afraid of it all thinking will join in 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:43.910
 gaming tone without problems would be better 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.400
 if now you had a friend 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.800
 games and had the opportunity to prepare 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.019
 so here are these important games or 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.239
 in principle, nothing bad is that 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:56.059
 Immediately got such important games after 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.720
 resumption of the season game with the leader 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.760
 building I think all the guys understand this 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.739
 what importance will this game fit 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.260
 everything is in optimal shape and 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.700
 what will be comrade the game will not be this 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.700
 mega sc difference especially 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.159
 recently began to speak in 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.100
 Russian Championship 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:31.210
 national team began to call me more 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.720
 more often therefore this time too 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.790
 caused as it is always nice when you 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.140
 causes 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.440
 national team as far as 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.229
 different are your roles on the field team 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.880
 Ivan is whether there is any difference in the 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:51.659
 where you are used by mentors but 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.300
 now we have the coaching staff changed 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.310
 the national team therefore do not know how it will be now 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.920
 familiar with what position I will be 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.890
 to speak before this he became a coach 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.060
 saw me more in the reference area 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.060
 rather than him 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.650
 server you have to play for 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.530
 Russian national team in qualifying match 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.170
 European Championship team meets 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.690
 with teams of Denmark and Sandra challenge 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.360
 national team he did not catch you off guard 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.310
 expected that he will do and do not regret that 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.390
 will have to miss 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.690
 near Moscow collecting the same connection with the fact that 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:38.100
 teams are driving off I'm not waiting 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.530
 cause a gasp as if hoping that the challenges 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.670
 what causes the team is good here I 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.010
 I think it is not bad 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.130
 the fact that I miss even the collection will go collection 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.250
 All the more such important games 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.090
 building win but try what was 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.090
 more likely to be 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.560
 Madonna called you into the national team of Niger and 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.000
