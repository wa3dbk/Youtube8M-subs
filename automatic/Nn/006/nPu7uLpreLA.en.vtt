00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:10.860
 tells crowd some people asked 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:14.370
 People, to the globe, is to talk what was with 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:22.439
 problem and also realize that in the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:26.279
 game here in the game space 2 when it arrived 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:31.939
 in part in chapter 6 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.939
 the best is in chapter 7 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.989
 Chapter 7 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:45.110
 but exactly in that part 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:49.379
 he fought and I managed to solve found 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.269
 the updated ace on the Internet back 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.079
 making available to you there in 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.079
 decision of the second 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:02.510
 in case we are here in Chapter 7 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.510
 found the solar panel 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.549
 and that door that gives access to the area 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.850
 outside of the ship to fix the 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:18.610
 solar panel is the one here in chapter 7 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.180
 So when I got here to open 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.780
 this port occurs locking the game 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.780
 a closed game 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:34.500
 then after much research observes 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:37.720
 I had a khaki, I'm not mistaken, it was 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:44.560
 I do not know very well about dengue fever but 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:50.710
 I found the crack is on the net and in 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:54.960
 update of the original star who came 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.960
 in this game in case my game 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:08.119
 can say that the treatment does not 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.119
 there is more 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.540
 so who has this problem 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:20.510
 in the game live space 2 chapter 7 in 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:25.879
 part that goes to is to fix the panel 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:29.709
 solar is not the tip for you guys 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.709

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.250
