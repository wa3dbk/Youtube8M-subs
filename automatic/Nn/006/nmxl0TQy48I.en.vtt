very anal with my security I could also

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.359 
very anal with my security I could also
use<00:01:43.360> my<00:01:43.869> Carell<00:01:45.300> fetch<00:01:46.300> of<00:01:46.509> my<00:01:46.630> proof<00:01:46.929> block

00:01:51.580 --> 00:02:05.359 
very heavy weight I'll show you how it
gets<00:01:51.700> on<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:59.130> there<00:02:00.130> you<00:02:00.190> go<00:02:01.830> even<00:02:02.830> mobilised

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
gets on and there you go even mobilised

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:17.280 
gets on and there you go even mobilised
so<00:02:05.969> disk<00:02:06.689> lock<00:02:07.970> massive<00:02:08.970> lot

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:25.240 

and<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:21.140> alarm

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.250 

I<00:02:25.340> don't<00:02:26.060> think<00:02:26.120> anyone<00:02:26.510> would<00:02:26.570> want<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:26.840> steal

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
I don't think anyone would want to steal

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.080 
I don't think anyone would want to steal
that<00:02:29.440> if<00:02:30.440> something<00:02:30.800> moves<00:02:30.950> that<00:02:31.190> will<00:02:31.370> blow

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
that if something moves that will blow

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.930 
that if something moves that will blow
off<00:02:32.210> I<00:02:32.890> guess<00:02:33.890> if<00:02:34.070> you<00:02:34.220> added<00:02:34.520> all<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.730> alarms

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
off I guess if you added all the alarms

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.240 
off I guess if you added all the alarms
together<00:02:35.620> it'd<00:02:36.620> be<00:02:36.830> over<00:02:37.130> 300<00:02:37.760> decibel<00:02:39.250> we

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
together it'd be over 300 decibel we

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:51.600 
together it'd be over 300 decibel we
don't<00:02:40.370> want<00:02:40.490> to<00:02:40.550> mess<00:02:40.700> with<00:02:40.850> that

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.670
