00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.670 
what you're seeing here can and probably
will<00:00:38.520> change<00:00:38.550> quite<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.420> bit<00:00:39.480> before<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.500> game

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
will change quite a bit before the game

launches<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.430> few<00:00:41.700> weeks<00:00:41.970> so<00:00:42.210> keep<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.690> in

indicative of the final quality of the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.760 
indicative of the final quality of the

game so keep that in mind and let's get

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.950 
game so keep that in mind and let's get
into<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.159> what<00:01:30.150> you'll<00:01:30.330> notice<00:01:30.450> right<00:01:30.720> away<00:01:30.780> is

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
into it what you'll notice right away is

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.290 
into it what you'll notice right away is
the<00:01:31.350> game<00:01:31.500> sort<00:01:31.800> of<00:01:31.860> throwback<00:01:32.520> visual<00:01:33.030> style

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
the game sort of throwback visual style

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.390 
the game sort of throwback visual style
it's<00:01:33.630> very<00:01:33.720> reminiscent<00:01:34.440> of<00:01:34.740> games<00:01:35.190> like

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
it's very reminiscent of games like

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.180 
it's very reminiscent of games like
radiant<00:01:35.850> Silvergun<00:01:36.270> or<00:01:36.659> right<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.290> its<00:01:37.860> that

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
radiant Silvergun or right in its that

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.810 
radiant Silvergun or right in its that
top-down<00:01:39.260> classic<00:01:40.260> take<00:01:40.620> on<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
top-down classic take on the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.940 
top-down classic take on the
shoot-'em-up<00:01:42.270> genre<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.170> one<00:01:43.530> key

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
shoot-'em-up genre the one key

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.670 
shoot-'em-up genre the one key
difference<00:01:44.250> here<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.870> isn't<00:01:46.080> linear

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
difference here is that it isn't linear

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.750 
difference here is that it isn't linear
so<00:01:47.400> the<00:01:48.120> screen<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.600> not<00:01:49.170> forcing<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.040> forward

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
so the screen is not forcing you forward

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.840 
so the screen is not forcing you forward
in<00:01:51.000> any<00:01:51.210> way<00:01:51.510> you<00:01:52.470> can<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:53.010> can<00:01:53.159> really<00:01:53.580> go

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
in any way you can you can really go

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.100 
in any way you can you can really go
wherever<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.600> want

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
wherever you want

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.310 
wherever you want
throughout<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:56.130> giant<00:01:56.729> map<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:57.810> three

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
throughout this giant map you have three

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.080 
throughout this giant map you have three
weapons<00:01:58.500> at<00:01:58.890> your<00:01:59.010> disposal<00:01:59.070> throughout<00:01:59.970> your

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
weapons at your disposal throughout your

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.399 
weapons at your disposal throughout your
time<00:02:00.330> with<00:02:00.540> project<00:02:00.960> Groot

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
time with project Groot

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.440 
time with project Groot
the<00:02:01.710> first<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> ground<00:02:02.760> attack<00:02:02.970> which<00:02:03.420> is

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
the first is a ground attack which is

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.960 
the first is a ground attack which is
useful<00:02:04.110> for<00:02:04.530> taking<00:02:04.710> out<00:02:05.010> tanks<00:02:05.310> turrets

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
useful for taking out tanks turrets

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.930 
useful for taking out tanks turrets
things<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.380> second<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.069> more<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.819> a

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
things like that the second is more of a

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.539 
things like that the second is more of a
standard<00:02:09.299> energy<00:02:09.840> cannon<00:02:10.560> which<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.190> useful

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
standard energy cannon which is useful

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.179 
standard energy cannon which is useful
for<00:02:11.760> taking<00:02:12.239> out<00:02:12.329> flying<00:02:12.779> enemies<00:02:13.200> ships<00:02:14.010> that

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.189 
for taking out flying enemies ships that

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:15.670 
for taking out flying enemies ships that
are<00:02:14.310> in<00:02:14.400> front<00:02:14.579> of<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:14.849> or<00:02:14.969> behind<00:02:14.999> you

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
are in front of you or behind you

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.380 
are in front of you or behind you
finally<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.889> have<00:02:17.099> a

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
finally you have a

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.600 
finally you have a
third<00:02:17.630> special<00:02:18.260> weapon<00:02:18.830> now<00:02:18.980> you<00:02:19.040> can<00:02:19.340> gain

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
third special weapon now you can gain

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.430 
third special weapon now you can gain
these<00:02:19.880> special<00:02:20.420> weapons<00:02:20.540> by<00:02:20.960> picking<00:02:21.319> up

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
these special weapons by picking up

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.860 
these special weapons by picking up
power-ups<00:02:21.950> that<00:02:22.069> enemies<00:02:22.610> drop<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.540> the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
power-ups that enemies drop and the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.990 
power-ups that enemies drop and the
power-ups<00:02:24.440> are<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:24.709> little<00:02:25.069> bit<00:02:25.160> different<00:02:25.520> so

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
power-ups are a little bit different so

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.790 
power-ups are a little bit different so
you'll<00:02:26.270> have<00:02:26.480> one<00:02:26.840> that<00:02:27.080> maybe<00:02:27.260> shoots<00:02:27.620> out<00:02:27.740> a

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
you'll have one that maybe shoots out a

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.820 
you'll have one that maybe shoots out a
cluster<00:02:28.700> of<00:02:28.870> dozens<00:02:29.870> of<00:02:30.020> missiles<00:02:30.440> or<00:02:30.709> you'll

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
cluster of dozens of missiles or you'll

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.860 
cluster of dozens of missiles or you'll
have<00:02:31.010> another<00:02:31.310> very<00:02:31.640> powerful<00:02:31.850> energy<00:02:32.390> beam

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
have another very powerful energy beam

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.080 
have another very powerful energy beam
and<00:02:33.140> weapon<00:02:33.920> choice<00:02:34.100> is<00:02:34.310> really<00:02:34.580> dependent<00:02:35.000> on

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
and weapon choice is really dependent on

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.960 
and weapon choice is really dependent on
the<00:02:35.570> situation<00:02:36.050> that<00:02:36.140> you<00:02:36.230> find<00:02:36.380> yourself<00:02:36.500> in

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
the situation that you find yourself in

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.850 
the situation that you find yourself in
because<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.150> game<00:02:38.360> isn't<00:02:38.930> linear<00:02:39.170> in<00:02:39.620> its

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
because the game isn't linear in its

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.680 
because the game isn't linear in its
level<00:02:40.250> design<00:02:40.280> it's<00:02:40.880> a<00:02:40.940> little<00:02:41.240> bit<00:02:41.330> more<00:02:41.540> of

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
level design it's a little bit more of

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.410 
level design it's a little bit more of
an<00:02:41.810> open<00:02:42.140> world<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:43.280> developer<00:02:43.790> has<00:02:43.970> a<00:02:44.000> little

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
an open world the developer has a little

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.180 
an open world the developer has a little
bit<00:02:44.510> more<00:02:44.570> leeway<00:02:44.989> when<00:02:45.290> it<00:02:45.410> comes<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.830> mission

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
bit more leeway when it comes to mission

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.340 
bit more leeway when it comes to mission
structure<00:02:46.580> so<00:02:46.790> it's<00:02:46.940> not<00:02:47.090> all<00:02:47.810> about<00:02:47.870> getting

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
structure so it's not all about getting

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.770 
structure so it's not all about getting
from<00:02:48.650> point<00:02:48.890> A<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:49.069> point<00:02:49.250> B<00:02:49.520> completing<00:02:50.510> the

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
from point A to point B completing the

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.220 
from point A to point B completing the
stage<00:02:51.110> there<00:02:51.830> are<00:02:52.070> specific<00:02:53.230> different

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
stage there are specific different

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.199 
stage there are specific different
missions<00:02:54.500> within<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:55.370> requirements<00:02:56.000> to

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
missions within and requirements to

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.570 
missions within and requirements to
complete<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:56.780> stage<00:02:57.019> so<00:02:57.410> you<00:02:58.040> have<00:02:58.250> primary

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
complete the stage so you have primary

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.790 
complete the stage so you have primary
and<00:02:58.850> then<00:02:59.000> secondary<00:02:59.660> mission<00:03:00.080> objectives

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
and then secondary mission objectives

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.500 
and then secondary mission objectives
the<00:03:01.070> first<00:03:01.370> objective<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:02.090> primary

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
the first objective the primary

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.630 
the first objective the primary
objective<00:03:02.989> is<00:03:03.170> typically<00:03:03.890> things<00:03:04.280> like

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
objective is typically things like

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.880 
objective is typically things like
disable<00:03:05.420> this<00:03:05.630> force<00:03:05.900> field<00:03:05.989> and<00:03:06.560> move<00:03:06.650> on<00:03:06.860> or

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
disable this force field and move on or

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.850 
disable this force field and move on or
destroy<00:03:07.670> this<00:03:07.940> communication<00:03:08.480> array<00:03:09.050> the

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
destroy this communication array the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.920 
destroy this communication array the
things<00:03:10.070> like<00:03:10.280> that<00:03:10.519> there<00:03:10.790> are<00:03:10.940> also<00:03:11.209> a<00:03:11.420> few

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
things like that there are also a few

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.290 
things like that there are also a few
escort<00:03:12.440> missions<00:03:12.800> too<00:03:13.070> so<00:03:13.400> sometimes<00:03:14.090> you'll

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
escort missions too so sometimes you'll

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.840 
escort missions too so sometimes you'll
have<00:03:14.390> to<00:03:14.570> escort<00:03:15.080> somebody<00:03:15.650> on<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.100> ground<00:03:16.489> as

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
have to escort somebody on the ground as

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.790 
have to escort somebody on the ground as
they<00:03:17.570> make<00:03:17.750> their<00:03:17.959> way<00:03:17.989> from<00:03:18.170> point<00:03:18.560> A<00:03:18.769> to

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
they make their way from point A to

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.130 
they make their way from point A to
point<00:03:18.950> B<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:20.209> secondary<00:03:20.660> missions<00:03:20.989> are

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
point B the secondary missions are

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.229 
point B the secondary missions are
completely<00:03:21.590> optional<00:03:21.829> you<00:03:22.340> can<00:03:22.489> choose<00:03:22.880> to

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
completely optional you can choose to

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.120 
completely optional you can choose to
partake<00:03:23.810> in<00:03:23.870> those<00:03:24.170> you<00:03:24.380> can<00:03:24.530> bypass<00:03:24.650> them

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
partake in those you can bypass them

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.699 
partake in those you can bypass them
entirely<00:03:25.519> and<00:03:26.150> typically<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:27.230> mission

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
entirely and typically the mission

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.370 
entirely and typically the mission
structure<00:03:28.070> of<00:03:28.400> those<00:03:28.730> mirrors<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:29.900> structure

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
structure of those mirrors the structure

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.830 
structure of those mirrors the structure
of<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.920> main<00:03:31.160> missions<00:03:31.370> so<00:03:32.150> for<00:03:32.329> example<00:03:32.690> in<00:03:32.780> a

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
of the main missions so for example in a

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.120 
of the main missions so for example in a
later<00:03:33.049> level<00:03:33.410> one<00:03:33.560> of<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.769> secondary

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
later level one of the secondary

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.360 
later level one of the secondary
objectives<00:03:34.760> is<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.690> destroy<00:03:36.530> a<00:03:36.560> number<00:03:37.010> of

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
objectives is to destroy a number of

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.280 
objectives is to destroy a number of
patrol<00:03:37.880> boats<00:03:38.120> that<00:03:38.720> should<00:03:39.019> give<00:03:39.140> you<00:03:39.230> a

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
patrol boats that should give you a

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.170 
patrol boats that should give you a
pretty<00:03:39.350> good<00:03:39.590> idea<00:03:39.709> of<00:03:40.040> what<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.790> side

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
pretty good idea of what the side

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.199 
pretty good idea of what the side
missions<00:03:41.480> actually<00:03:42.200> are<00:03:42.519> there<00:03:43.519> is<00:03:43.700> a<00:03:43.730> story

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
missions actually are there is a story

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.600 
missions actually are there is a story
here<00:03:44.269> and<00:03:44.630> typically<00:03:45.530> that's<00:03:45.769> delivered<00:03:46.340> one

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
here and typically that's delivered one

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.360 
here and typically that's delivered one
of<00:03:46.640> two<00:03:46.910> ways<00:03:47.150> either<00:03:47.600> in<00:03:48.370> dialogue

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
of two ways either in dialogue

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.310 
of two ways either in dialogue
pre-mission<00:03:50.000> so<00:03:50.510> before<00:03:50.810> you<00:03:50.900> jump<00:03:51.110> into<00:03:51.230> a

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
pre-mission so before you jump into a

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.710 
pre-mission so before you jump into a
mission<00:03:51.650> there<00:03:51.829> will<00:03:51.920> be<00:03:51.950> a<00:03:52.519> few<00:03:53.030> static

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
mission there will be a few static

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.110 
mission there will be a few static
photos<00:03:54.110> with<00:03:54.440> dialogue<00:03:55.040> written<00:03:55.310> underneath

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
photos with dialogue written underneath

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.509 
photos with dialogue written underneath
that<00:03:56.630> give<00:03:56.989> you<00:03:57.079> an<00:03:57.200> idea<00:03:57.290> of<00:03:57.709> what<00:03:58.310> you're

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
that give you an idea of what you're

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.340 
that give you an idea of what you're
actually<00:03:58.790> going<00:03:59.120> into<00:03:59.360> the<00:03:59.540> level<00:03:59.840> to<00:03:59.959> do<00:04:00.110> and

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
actually going into the level to do and

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.380 
actually going into the level to do and
then<00:04:00.769> while<00:04:01.370> you're<00:04:01.519> in<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:01.880> mission<00:04:02.209> you'll

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
then while you're in the mission you'll

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.800 
then while you're in the mission you'll
also<00:04:02.570> get<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:03.110> small<00:04:03.620> little<00:04:04.209> dialog<00:04:05.209> prompts

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
so wish there's also a basic leveling

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.180 
so wish there's also a basic leveling
system<00:04:13.970> in<00:04:14.209> play<00:04:14.480> and<00:04:14.630> project<00:04:15.079> route<00:04:15.320> and<00:04:15.650> you

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
system in play and project route and you

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.560 
system in play and project route and you
can<00:04:16.340> see<00:04:16.489> in<00:04:16.579> the<00:04:16.669> upper<00:04:16.910> left-hand<00:04:17.180> corner

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570

meter one is a blue meter the blue meter
is<00:04:21.829> the<00:04:22.520> meter<00:04:22.760> showing<00:04:23.090> your<00:04:23.390> experience<00:04:24.169> and

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
is the meter showing your experience and

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.650 
is the meter showing your experience and
the<00:04:24.830> progress<00:04:25.130> towards<00:04:25.760> that<00:04:25.820> next<00:04:26.270> level

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
the progress towards that next level

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.450 
the progress towards that next level
when<00:04:27.080> you<00:04:27.200> achieve<00:04:27.620> a<00:04:27.860> new<00:04:28.099> level<00:04:28.430> you

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
when you achieve a new level you

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.670 
when you achieve a new level you
typically<00:04:29.090> get<00:04:29.300> a<00:04:29.330> number<00:04:29.810> of<00:04:29.990> experience

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
typically get a number of experience

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.420 
typically get a number of experience
point

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
point

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.220 
point
those<00:04:31.670> experience<00:04:32.210> points<00:04:32.270> can<00:04:32.690> then<00:04:32.870> be<00:04:33.020> used

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
those experience points can then be used

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.590 
those experience points can then be used
to<00:04:33.620> level<00:04:33.980> up<00:04:34.100> your<00:04:34.160> ship<00:04:34.700> in<00:04:34.880> a<00:04:35.090> persistent

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
to level up your ship in a persistent

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.110 
to level up your ship in a persistent
way<00:04:35.990> which<00:04:36.740> carries<00:04:37.130> over<00:04:37.280> from<00:04:37.640> mission<00:04:37.940> to

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
way which carries over from mission to

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.690 
way which carries over from mission to
Mission<00:04:38.150> to<00:04:38.480> mission<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:39.560> stats<00:04:40.370> that<00:04:40.640> you

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
Mission to mission the stats that you

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.640 
Mission to mission the stats that you
can<00:04:40.940> upgrade<00:04:41.120> are<00:04:41.630> typically<00:04:42.140> things<00:04:42.380> like

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
can upgrade are typically things like

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.120 
can upgrade are typically things like
speed<00:04:43.220> defense<00:04:44.180> you<00:04:45.140> can<00:04:45.170> level<00:04:45.620> up<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:45.920> power

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
speed defense you can level up the power

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.340 
speed defense you can level up the power
of<00:04:46.490> your<00:04:46.760> special<00:04:47.120> missiles<00:04:47.540> of<00:04:47.870> your<00:04:48.050> normal

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
of your special missiles of your normal

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.330 
of your special missiles of your normal
missiles<00:04:48.950> so<00:04:49.550> you<00:04:49.640> have<00:04:49.910> a<00:04:49.940> few<00:04:50.210> options<00:04:50.480> their

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
missiles so you have a few options their

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.650 
missiles so you have a few options their
missions<00:04:52.340> are<00:04:52.490> pretty<00:04:52.700> long<00:04:52.940> with<00:04:53.330> some<00:04:53.540> of

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
missions are pretty long with some of

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.270 
missions are pretty long with some of
them<00:04:53.750> taking<00:04:54.080> upwards<00:04:54.290> of<00:04:54.710> thirty<00:04:55.010> five

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
them taking upwards of thirty five

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.190 
them taking upwards of thirty five
minutes<00:04:55.910> or<00:04:56.090> so<00:04:56.300> adding<00:04:56.810> to<00:04:56.930> the<00:04:57.020> game's

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
minutes or so adding to the game's

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.080 
minutes or so adding to the game's
difficulty<00:04:57.620> is<00:04:57.860> the<00:04:58.040> fact<00:04:58.070> that<00:04:58.310> if<00:04:58.520> you<00:04:58.820> die

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
difficulty is the fact that if you die

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.700 
difficulty is the fact that if you die
you<00:04:59.150> have<00:04:59.420> to<00:04:59.480> start<00:04:59.780> the<00:04:59.900> whole<00:05:00.080> mission<00:05:00.350> over

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
you have to start the whole mission over

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.150 
you have to start the whole mission over
so<00:05:01.190> you<00:05:01.250> could<00:05:01.730> in<00:05:02.150> essence<00:05:02.660> lose<00:05:02.990> 35<00:05:03.650> 40

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
so you could in essence lose 35 40

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.940 
so you could in essence lose 35 40
minutes<00:05:04.430> of<00:05:04.550> progress<00:05:05.120> if<00:05:06.080> you<00:05:06.290> die<00:05:06.530> and<00:05:06.770> then

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
minutes of progress if you die and then

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.330 
minutes of progress if you die and then
need<00:05:07.130> to<00:05:07.160> restart<00:05:07.730> there's<00:05:08.600> a<00:05:08.690> fair<00:05:08.990> bit<00:05:09.260> of

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
need to restart there's a fair bit of

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.220 
need to restart there's a fair bit of
environmental<00:05:10.340> variety<00:05:11.090> here<00:05:11.450> so<00:05:11.870> you'll

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
environmental variety here so you'll

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.800 
environmental variety here so you'll
play<00:05:12.770> in<00:05:13.160> levels<00:05:13.820> that<00:05:13.910> are<00:05:13.970> like<00:05:14.180> the<00:05:14.300> forest

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
play in levels that are like the forest

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.140 
play in levels that are like the forest
or<00:05:15.080> geothermal<00:05:15.410> levels<00:05:16.250> with<00:05:16.430> lava<00:05:16.700> flowing

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
or geothermal levels with lava flowing
