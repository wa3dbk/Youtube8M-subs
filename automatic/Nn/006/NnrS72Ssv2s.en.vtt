00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.400
 well hello dear friends 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.710
 swami skeletor and today we will play 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.820
 on mini games so i play on server 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.880
 cycle haben sie like 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.699
 Well, in general, the game tente game that is 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.230
 we just have to run and you will be 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.529
 crumble block we don't have to in general 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.570
 be done well 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.820
 explained let's start surviving now 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.829
 so to speak more precisely, and start playing 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.649
 Now people are recruited and all through 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.750
 ethics will also start like this 2 2 1 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.969
 all run up I'll be given time 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.590
 to pull away other players 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.750
 and all the blocks break 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.420
 I will not use back to me 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.120
 it seems silly yes here's the main task 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.730
 just resist and not fail in dice 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.890
 here everything and a few floors so 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.100
 not scary if you fail the episode can 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.680
 see that there are several floors 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.390
 so so important not to fall so we 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.729
 only upstairs leave that all 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.570
 already conducted well it will say we say 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.570
 not bad play 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.290
 although we honestly i need to fail so 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.330
 there is already little hope 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:28.900
 already failed already dropped so the counter is not 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.020
 fell if relics go first place 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.870
 let's take a total of 9 players left 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.350
 nine survivors okay just lucky 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.790
 just like me just luck 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.170
 although there are players with cheats before 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.210
 have met army already 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.550
 although as one might think that at the moment 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.600
 black sea land rover forever as will 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:52.510
 there may be cheaters 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:02:00.690
 and there are easy to reproach 4 everywhere they are 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:04.810
 okay me focus and drag so 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.290
 the devil is already a dead end and I have driven myself into a dead end 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.149
 people 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:13.600
 I fell through one floor and she was there 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:17.980
 there are a few more, but only on the map 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.690
 8 players left so to speak from one 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.580
 death we get coins and she these 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.410
 rings you can then buy you not to be 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.660
 a piece of skinny muse donat and 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.010
 i don't know drink double jump or something 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.850
 by the way i could use it 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:35.750
 exactly it on just forgot about it 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:39.260
 now need oh just fell before but 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:51.230
 circle saved me of I survived survived yes 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:55.040
 okay okay okay lucky and no damn 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.290

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:02.870
 the last so to speak the same as all 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:04.550
 mortals now they all fall into the same 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.090
 impossible to survive especially with others 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:11.930
 by the players so i'm already on silver up stayed 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:17.720
 another player already get out of here 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:21.710

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.230

 25th corner let's play here again 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.310
 here, too, everything is different as you can see already 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.260
 somehow dumb yes the fact that there are edges 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.220
 so I do not know here to play something on this 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.220
 I play the card for the first time 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.600
 perhaps as a cliff it is to break a friend 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:53.330

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.730

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.140
