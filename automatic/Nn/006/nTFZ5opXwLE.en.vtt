00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700
 good is bad though because he is 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.700
 I did not want to go into an ex arc 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.280
 I've for so little I trophies 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.570
 had somehow 1200 so should 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.130
 you can actually expect that 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.609
 because a little better then gets 1 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.600
 or what resources richer than opponents 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.630
 but then most of the time mostly people 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.029
 they have nothing here again 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.250
 Although war brings you 28 cups 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:37.890
 then nothing at all because I want one 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.910
 few exceptions look good at first 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.690
 at first sight but then 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.469
 not just too few gold and also 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.360
 110 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.520
 I can also do without Lucio 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.559
 not so it does not have to be 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.670
 be absolutely like that but at least one 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.300
 few resources, of course, then 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:01:00.750
 nevertheless have something for example the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:04.110
 good man has the air defense the the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.729
 bothers me a bit because he then 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.729
 that is quite strong then occupied 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:19.590
 can air defense three then still in the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.040
 middle that's shit here because what you 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.390
 stop it on it however extremely 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.390
 horny air defense the boy 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:39.070
 hd the really hard but 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:43.860
 the ball built almost everything and say 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.860
 what you want or just try 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.930
 a tempting one this time 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.770
 so could the lok tactics with which we 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.860
 maybe catch the barbarian king 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.860
 or 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.380
 The railway King is certainly already 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.429
 but sometimes many of them take too 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.429
 my barbarians themselves 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.580
 that you are happy not to go in the pants 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.670
 if that does not go in the pants I go 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.380
 definitely needs somehow 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.460
 somehow his air defense becomes that 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.460
 I think it will be hard enough 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.900
 okay but towards the front you idiot should 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.900
 the shit because 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.510
 so now I have to only the air defense 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.830
 thresh then I got it but then could 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.160
 maybe I still have the kites and e 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.430
 mail you always were king 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.100
 sacrifice or what will that in any case 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.670
 another hard fight is yet to come 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.670
 after 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.239
 so we'll see 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.629
 that is already almost out of now 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.640
 already impossible to do that 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.750
 then I have my two kites 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.299
 the users who believe then 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.330
 probably an age that was 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.409
 of course not a good attack from me 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:22.680
 I have to say that honestly but we do 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:24.239
 I wanted to try things for myself 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.980
 curious when the spruce starts but 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.290
 Flexit has an elixir stock still 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:33.510
 empty 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:37.680
 look how many are still in it 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.030
 Of course, stupid and made this power 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.530
 100 lager empty instead of you around the 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.730
 other side come where we get yes 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.730
 ok important places in any case 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.840
 why does not that shoot me 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.720
 but to me it air-defense I understand 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:56.910
 not now he is flattening the thing 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:04:01.549
 at least he cares, of course 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.549
 not about the archer tower 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.180
 I understand why the air has when I 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:11.450
 on me shoots important that the construction 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.450
 should 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.109
 but I want but now wait a 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.880
 Until the knowledge is up the air defense 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.930
 I'm bombarding but I'm not sure 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.800
 when that happens maybe 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.900
 he still gets 115 songs broken tesla 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.130
 okay the guy was really I think too 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.330
 strong for me i might too 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.820
 maybe more on it 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.690
 should 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.430
 maybe smarter so here 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.410
 attack and below where the 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.169
 Christmas tree is at least natural 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.610
 always smarter 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.370
 212,000 elixir is actually still like that 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:45.199
 but at least the costs are covered 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.199
 from the felix here 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.750
 so says matthias to write 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.840
 u 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:15.470
 short a moment already difficult so well 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.669
 know maybe not quite best 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:24.849
 attack and give oneself but look 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:24.849
 which has nothing new done it all four 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.949
 It's going to be such a good attack 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:31.880
 but I could be too 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:34.900
 not the boyfriend anymore 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.419
 things that are just too vulnerable 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.440
 kites have become too vulnerable 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:44.120
 maybe I have to do that again 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:49.400
 repair a few wall breakers 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:53.389
 need also to make the 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:57.340
 our magic still a little dudl dö 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:59.240
 dö dö look what I've done 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.880
 I will say even almost 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.380
 actually at the end of this episode except 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.789
 we can still wait until we 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.240
 maybe another one 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:09.320
 I would doubt it moment 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.900
 We let's see how much space as now 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.639
 Here are still 750 degrees in the camp 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.440
 Of course, that does not matter 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.389
 We will then continue next channel 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:21.080
 can 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:23.060
 seven hours is a cannon on level 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.009
 8 that's not quite so 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.039
 bad, which is okay on level 8 too 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:30.440
 which is at level 8 which is at level 7 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:33.190
 which are all too far a little bit because 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.190
 somehow I find 

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:40.340
 how do I always have to improve something here ? 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:45.020
 I think I do not know exactly how 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:47.090
 but that still bothers me here 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.849
 he of a division care of the 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:52.539
 defense somehow read already 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:54.229
 relatively many cannons together 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:07:00.500
 but you can not do that either 

00:06:54.229 --> 00:07:02.120
 Of course, this does not prevent it from happening here 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.289
 Maybe it's not that smart right now 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.580
 because where I do not look the times 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:17.240
 somehow I still do not do that somehow 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:19.550
 for the first time at moment the baua away the 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:26.599
 Army stock point number 1 after that 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:29.569
 Let's go and pack it like this 

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:31.009
 I'll take it because I have 

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:32.750
 schütz i have a masterplan 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:34.430
 developed for this for this 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:38.029
 Scenario so easy to follow 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:42.289
 the little friend pack the one after 

00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:44.750
 there and moments moore problem solved and 

00:07:42.289 --> 00:07:46.129
 three more of our mouse parts free 

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.539
 I still have something to do there 

00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:49.839
 Case a few in reserve for example 

00:07:47.539 --> 00:07:49.839
 that here
