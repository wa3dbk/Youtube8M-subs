 almost molecules are those that get yes then 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.759
 I have to go here on the side we go 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.560

 only what did not score me and are true 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.530
 efficient so when you see you where 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.890

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.119
 of course that's not our best 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.310

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.170

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.470
 there are also plenty of opportunities for rest 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.470
 team 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.610
