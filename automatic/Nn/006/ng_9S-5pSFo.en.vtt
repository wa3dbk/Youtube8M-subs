as far as my skin you always hear about

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.380 
as far as my skin you always hear about
people<00:02:35.010> talking<00:02:35.160> about<00:02:35.490> how<00:02:35.640> smooth<00:02:36.120> their

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
people talking about how smooth their

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.590 
people talking about how smooth their
skin<00:02:36.690> gets<00:02:36.959> when<00:02:37.740> they<00:02:37.770> start<00:02:38.100> hormones<00:02:38.430> me<00:02:39.239> I

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
skin gets when they start hormones me I

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.500 
skin gets when they start hormones me I
don't<00:02:40.080> know<00:02:40.230> maybe<00:02:40.860> it's<00:02:41.130> skinning<00:02:41.510> maybe

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
don't know maybe it's skinning maybe

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.890 
don't know maybe it's skinning maybe
it's<00:02:42.690> getting<00:02:42.810> softer<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:44.390> thinner<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.690> don't

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
it's getting softer and thinner I don't

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.130 
it's getting softer and thinner I don't
know<00:02:46.020> but<00:02:46.500> for<00:02:47.250> me<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.580> can't<00:02:47.910> get<00:02:48.060> past<00:02:48.360> this

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
know but for me I can't get past this

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.040 
know but for me I can't get past this
and<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:50.220> guess<00:02:50.430> it<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:50.790> getting<00:02:51.239> more<00:02:51.570> sensitive

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
and I guess it is getting more sensitive

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.810 
and I guess it is getting more sensitive
because<00:02:52.380> I'm<00:02:52.530> cutting<00:02:52.890> myself<00:02:53.070> more<00:02:53.610> when<00:02:53.790> I

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
because I'm cutting myself more when I

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.750 
because I'm cutting myself more when I
shave<00:02:54.180> so<00:02:54.959> hopefully<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.739> can<00:02:55.830> go<00:02:56.250> on<00:02:56.340> ahead<00:02:56.430> and

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
shave so hopefully I can go on ahead and

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.820 
shave so hopefully I can go on ahead and
get<00:02:56.970> laser<00:02:57.390> hair<00:02:57.750> removal<00:02:57.870> or<00:02:59.720> electrolysis
