00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:06.460
 the gg 320 stand out in the streets of cork this prototype of death 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.570
 attributed to what six years ago the firm not the roles being indeed in 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.809
 traffic until early November 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.789
 the craft seems at first sight strongly to foolish yet these are 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.960
 the same difficulties as with another articulated bus this German wizard has 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.960
 same leads that 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.599
 only remorse for a lot harder than me when I was 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.310
 at term for example at the exit of the tank young children same period 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.940
 I do not see why it would require more specialized drivers for everything 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.140
 the world to be able to ride with the public 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.220
 mobile 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.080
 this bus will allow the company t it to save money on the costs of 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.960
 operation 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.860
 indeed 200 people can take place in this tribe themselves and not a single 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.600
 the driver is mobilized remains that some problems could be 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.840
 to train on the route of the bus the longest of cork 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.980
 all you need is a car with poor roadwork to limit the journey 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.960
 tribes 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.850
 the cost of such a gear are more or less 13 million we have 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.090
 currently a bus commented 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.390
 with a particular crissier face is the line 48 th in front of 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.720
 carry a significant number of travelers the female students 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.060
 Arabic two periods of the day in the morning and to ride them to the 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.100
 certainly 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.830
 and in the evening when the audience comes out 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.740
 after already reporting it's happy cadence we still have a 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.700
 overload 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.020
 it seemed to us that this vehicle is to support a solution to diminish 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.840
 this problem of overload 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.549
 the purchase of a tribe is part of a particular 13 pc order 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.259
 the advantage of this new model is that he was at the table for example 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.299
 during the holidays 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.560
 we can remove the central part and turn it into a simple accordion bus 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.770
 the despair transport company put tribute its service during the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.880
 next academic year 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.229
 regulars on line 48 will welcome the arrival on the bus 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.499
 with so much space
