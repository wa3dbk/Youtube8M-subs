00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.950
 hello to you with alexander projector and 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.799
 today i would like to talk about 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.990
 updated rio hd textures history 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.230
 from the nexus for the game 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.080
 block story so let's see what of 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.750
 represents the texture pack as we see 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.869
 the sand became pretty realistic 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.289
 grass and the main quality textures are all 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.969
 it became so clear that now even 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.590
 nicer to play interface buttons also 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:40.230
 changed to more such 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.420
 attractive just such subjects 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:48.570
 games and so we go around the world a little 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:52.170
 let's see what is beautiful there is also 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.829
 the sky has become much better now 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.309
 such more clearly and the sun at night is common 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.609
 the moon is shining just falling away so I have a game 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.450
 something under the braked game by the way I have 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.369
 on the maximum graph now so 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.080
 say texture pack requires a little 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.900
 more resources as it is better 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.509
 so let's go now let's find some 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.150
 look at the house how the stones look but 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.270
 this temple just looks now 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.460
 so real and cool i will leave 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.030
 this texture pack will now write 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.600
 flysplay only with him if nobody 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.450
 against if anyone against write in 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.780
 comments how awesome looks now 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:44.250
 these leaves all look like leaves well 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.549
 just dude done great 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.649
 textures pack play nice more 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:56.790
 understandable of course the original is good too 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:02:00.659
 but how would it be a matter of habit this texture pack 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.270
 definitely more beautiful here is grass now 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.110
 It looks like grass thing like 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.580
 clarity itself is generally generally cool 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.720
 done so 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:18.760
 I have here in the door see 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:26.380
 how does she look here look like 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:33.940
 pretty clear door at all very 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:37.270
 cool take her back so she is not here 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.360
 leave also see trees in general 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:48.280
 generally fucking tree bark looks 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:51.190
 straight well in general the shaft here it started to rain 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.400
 we advise everyone not to bet everyone 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:03:00.880
 I advise you to put a look 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:04.950
 on this miracle it's just generally a buzz so 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.950
 see the mill 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:14.690
 mill began to look well, no comment 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:18.560
 You can immediately recognize her from the habit but 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.870
 she looks like a mill steel bricks 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.370
 as bricks well, in general, what can I say 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.220
 about this texture pack 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.520
 everything looks cool really important 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:34.610
 Clearly windows look like windows doors like 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:40.490
 doors in general, all cool place not 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:46.010
 Parite in general shaft at night shines 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:48.680
 pretty quality that moon 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.310
 it feels like it's really on 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:57.620
 Comp play a toy so all 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:04.130
 clearly cool done and do not want to 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:08.320
 getting out of the game is just a bailout in general 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:12.140
 I advise everyone to like texture pack 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:16.130
 I will be shooting next years already with 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.090
 it means it will be more beautiful and letplay 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.669
 more interesting 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.910
