00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
three together kind of make up for the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.179 
three together kind of make up for the
lack<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:47.970> milk<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.659> adds<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.990> lot<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.200> moisture

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
lack of milk it adds a lot of moisture

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.219 
lack of milk it adds a lot of moisture
and<00:01:50.220> then<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.880> know<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.210> egg<00:01:51.360> also<00:01:51.840> adds<00:01:52.049> some

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
and then you know the egg also adds some

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.859 
and then you know the egg also adds some
moisture<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.549> makes<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.000> cornbread<00:01:54.479> so

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
moisture so it makes the cornbread so

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.959 
moisture so it makes the cornbread so
much<00:01:55.049> more<00:01:55.259> flavorful<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.280> how<00:01:56.549> my<00:01:56.759> mom
