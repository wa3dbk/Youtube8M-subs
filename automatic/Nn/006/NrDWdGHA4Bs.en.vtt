 As you can see, I am going to teach you how to do 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.520
 waves of the hairstyle of Valencian is a 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.140
 Tiny harder than doing it to another 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.630
 person but I hope that in this video 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.640
 find tricks that are useful and 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.110
 that you make it good america as you see 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.059
 I already made the three stripes you know that 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.130
 you have another tutorial where you can 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:33.660
 see how to make the three stripes 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.340
 you yourself and now let's start 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.040
 already with the waves the first thing I'm going to 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.550
 do is reinforce with a little bowler hat 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.070
 to the whole top of the waves and 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.780
 then also around here I'm going to 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.999
 take a little gel and I'm going to 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.649
 take to the wave area that I'm going to 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:51.899
 do first it's going to be the wave 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.860
 right I'm going to put the coil by the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.470
 top part 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.000
 I will lift the hair with the comb a 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.320
 bit 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.040
 I'm going to put some gel for the part 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.940
 hundred 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.740
 for lowered a little bit to this part 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.649
 and now 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.330
 I'm going to comb everything down 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.790
 well pegadito and well disentangled 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.560
 Well now we can start going 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.230
 to catch this comb in the part that 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.270
 have the tines closer together I'll start 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:28.080
 I'm going to work a little lift 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.840
 the hair in front of me took it towards 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.820
 behind the comb itself is stepping on this 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.130
 bit of hair I'm going to put the finger 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.720
 before the stripes as if it were a 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.570
 pin 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.100
 and this hair I 'm going to take 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.270
 down 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.620
 I have combed back and down and 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.830
 I'm going to untangle it 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.780
 next bits 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.810
 I drag all the hair I have here 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.480
 when I reach the finger I lift what 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.090
 I put in front of the comb and this 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.280
 I 'm here, I'm going to untangle everything 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.979
 well down 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.009
 the same thing in this part took him towards 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.970
 back to the trail when I touch the finger 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.680
 I lift forward 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.319
 and brought it down 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.120
 and the last bit of the temple already 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:23.760
 led back 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:28.230
 I touch the finger I lift step ahead 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.700
 and down and we would have the first 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.920
 meeting 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.629
 we need to fix it to dry 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.290
 with the correct form and we are going to put 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:42.420
 a clamp on the part of the curvita of 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:45.569
 up and let's put another clip right 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.209
 in the part of thirst embroidered that the 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.970
 tweezers have to have the springs 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.650
 up with this part of hair that 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.190
 we have left over we will deprive him towards 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.670
 down 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:01.000
 we passed it over the ear in 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.940
 flat and once we pass the ear we give 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.270
 a little spin and we're going to put a 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.400
 hook clip of the locks 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.800
 this wave is a bit more complicated than 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.510
 the other basically because of the position in 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.700
 we have to put your hand and hawes 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.580
 that to make this wave we have put the 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.890
 hand in this way and to make the one 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.460
 on the left we will move on from this 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:28.000
 shape to this form let's click the 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.890
 finger with the hand in this same position 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.770
 what we have done in the first wave now 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.020
 I will reinforce with a little bit of hair 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.000
 with the top part and all the 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.890
 inside 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.250
 it got a little hair 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.160
 top of the front we are going to take 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.900
 backward 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.270
 let's put your finger as I have 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.010
 explained before 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.320
 and what we have left over we're going to 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.620
 carry it down and let's untangle 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.620
 all right 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.280
 we drag the hair that we have below 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.760
 when we touch the finger we pass it by 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:07.720
 and unravels over mos 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.900
 everything we have here 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.630
 we keep looking back we play 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.079
 the finger we raise and use 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.690
 down 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:22.980
 and the last bit of 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:25.380
 we look back and go with the finger 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.050
 be it low 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.060
 Well, we would have this wave done 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.760
 I'm going to raise my hand and it's that 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.190
 we have formica and now we have 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.340
 done before let's put a clamp on 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.569
 the curvita above 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.789
 and by the middle of the wave 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:47.020
 and it would be in this area of â€‹â€‹the feel 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.020
 it is always the most exhausted 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:53.820
 Now let's comb the hair down 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.120
 above the ear as we have done 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:00.430
 before 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.430
 let's fix with a hair clip 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:08.299
 good when we notice that the waves are already 

00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:11.110
 they have dried a little bit we are going to remove 

00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:11.110
 the tweezers 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:22.809
 to remove the marquita we can go back to 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:25.820
 put it here in the area of â€‹â€‹the brand 

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:28.760
 we passed the little finger 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.570
 so it was said it comes right in the other 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.570
 side same 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.350
 and finish off and masters with a product of 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.350
 brightness 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:45.639
 and something we wanted 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:50.770
 ah
