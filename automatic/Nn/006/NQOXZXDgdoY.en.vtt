thrown out from the operation or perhaps

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.990 
thrown out from the operation or perhaps
there<00:02:50.170> may<00:02:50.290> be<00:02:50.319> some<00:02:50.650> intermittent<00:02:51.130> noise<00:02:51.549> in

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359 
these types of cases it may not be just

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.150 
these types of cases it may not be just
