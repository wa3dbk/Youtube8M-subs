00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
is which I'm going to play the original

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.129 
is which I'm going to play the original
video<00:00:07.950> so<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:08.880> can<00:00:09.000> see<00:00:09.210> where<00:00:09.599> my<00:00:09.780> hands<00:00:10.019> are

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
video so you can see where my hands are

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.530 
video so you can see where my hands are
going<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.650> which<00:00:11.309> hand<00:00:11.550> is<00:00:11.670> playing<00:00:11.940> which

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
going and which hand is playing which

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.509 
going and which hand is playing which
instrument<00:00:13.019> all<00:00:13.679> right<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:13.980> ready<00:00:14.070> here<00:00:14.400> we

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
instrument all right you ready here we

00:00:14.519 --> 00:03:45.740 
instrument all right you ready here we
go

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.960 

so<00:03:46.750> did<00:03:46.930> you<00:03:47.020> guess<00:03:47.170> right<00:03:47.550> so<00:03:48.550> the<00:03:48.640> tricky

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
so did you guess right so the tricky

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:49.490 
so did you guess right so the tricky
isn't<00:03:49.120> it

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
isn't it

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.020 
isn't it
they've<00:03:50.500> gotten<00:03:50.830> so<00:03:50.980> close<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.520> technology's

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
they've gotten so close the technology's

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.840 
they've gotten so close the technology's
gotten<00:03:52.330> so<00:03:52.450> good<00:03:52.690> that<00:03:52.930> there's<00:03:53.560> only<00:03:53.850> slight

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
gotten so good that there's only slight

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.430 
gotten so good that there's only slight
difference<00:03:55.240> between<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:55.570> two<00:03:55.660> it's<00:03:56.020> kind<00:03:56.320> of

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
difference between the two it's kind of

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.410 
difference between the two it's kind of
the<00:03:57.340> difference<00:03:57.670> between<00:03:57.850> two<00:03:58.270> different

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
the difference between two different

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.840 
the difference between two different
Hammond<00:03:59.260> tone<00:03:59.440> wheel<00:03:59.650> organs<00:04:00.040> if<00:04:00.280> you<00:04:00.400> play<00:04:00.610> a

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
Hammond tone wheel organs if you play a

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.540 
Hammond tone wheel organs if you play a

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
C 2 and a B 3 they're going to sound

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.500 
C 2 and a B 3 they're going to sound
quite<00:04:03.790> different<00:04:04.090> from<00:04:04.180> each<00:04:04.300> other

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
quite different from each other

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
quite different from each other
especially<00:04:04.690> if<00:04:05.020> they're<00:04:05.170> from<00:04:05.200> different

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
especially if they're from different

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.820 
especially if they're from different
eras<00:04:06.450> because<00:04:07.450> Hammond<00:04:07.810> changed<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.470> design

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
eras because Hammond changed the design

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.440 
eras because Hammond changed the design
they<00:04:09.070> changed<00:04:09.520> the<00:04:09.700> placement<00:04:10.150> of<00:04:10.240> certain

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
they changed the placement of certain

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.960 
they changed the placement of certain
components<00:04:10.890> certain<00:04:11.890> tone<00:04:12.070> wheels<00:04:12.310> the

capacitors<00:04:13.600> they<00:04:13.840> changed<00:04:14.140> all<00:04:14.290> those<00:04:14.410> things

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
capacitors they changed all those things

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.500 
capacitors they changed all those things
over<00:04:14.890> the<00:04:14.980> years<00:04:15.010> to<00:04:15.430> try<00:04:15.610> to<00:04:15.640> tweak<00:04:15.940> the

over the years to try to tweak the
invention<00:04:16.959> and<00:04:17.049> make<00:04:17.200> it<00:04:17.320> a<00:04:17.380> bit<00:04:17.500> better<00:04:18.840> we

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
invention and make it a bit better we

invention and make it a bit better we
live<00:04:19.989> in<00:04:20.080> a<00:04:20.140> great<00:04:20.260> time<00:04:20.590> where<00:04:21.459> you<00:04:21.609> can<00:04:21.790> all

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
live in a great time where you can all

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.360 
live in a great time where you can all
around<00:04:22.240> a<00:04:22.330> 35-pound<00:04:23.050> instrument<00:04:23.740> instead<00:04:24.250> of

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
around a 35-pound instrument instead of

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.640 
around a 35-pound instrument instead of
a<00:04:24.460> 400-pound<00:04:25.270> instrument<00:04:25.750> and<00:04:26.110> get<00:04:26.350> the<00:04:26.470> same

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
a 400-pound instrument and get the same

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.070 
a 400-pound instrument and get the same
sound<00:04:26.920> it's<00:04:27.190> pretty<00:04:27.400> amazing<00:04:27.810> you<00:04:28.810> might<00:04:28.960> have

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
sound it's pretty amazing you might have

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.600 
sound it's pretty amazing you might have
noticed<00:04:29.350> that<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.680> sound<00:04:29.950> was<00:04:30.160> just<00:04:30.400> raw

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
noticed that the sound was just raw

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.120 
noticed that the sound was just raw
straight<00:04:31.600> off<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:31.900> preamp<00:04:32.230> from<00:04:32.410> the<00:04:32.500> c2<00:04:32.830> and

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
straight off the preamp from the c2 and

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.250 
straight off the preamp from the c2 and
straight<00:04:33.460> out<00:04:33.490> of<00:04:33.700> the<00:04:33.970> sk<00:04:34.600> ii<00:04:34.660> without<00:04:35.080> any

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
straight out of the sk ii without any

straight out of the sk ii without any
effects<00:04:35.950> or<00:04:36.130> leslie<00:04:36.520> or<00:04:36.610> anything<00:04:36.760> so<00:04:37.660> that

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
effects or leslie or anything so that

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.420 
effects or leslie or anything so that
gives<00:04:37.930> you<00:04:38.020> kind<00:04:38.050> of<00:04:38.230> an<00:04:38.350> idea<00:04:38.440> of<00:04:38.770> what<00:04:38.890> it's

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
gives you kind of an idea of what it's

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.220 
gives you kind of an idea of what it's
going<00:04:39.460> to<00:04:39.610> sound<00:04:39.760> like<00:04:39.910> when<00:04:40.150> you<00:04:40.300> run<00:04:40.870> it<00:04:40.990> into

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
going to sound like when you run it into

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.520 
going to sound like when you run it into
a<00:04:41.260> Leslie<00:04:41.710> or<00:04:41.890> a<00:04:42.880> Leslie<00:04:43.540> simulator<00:04:43.780> pedal<00:04:44.350> or

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530
