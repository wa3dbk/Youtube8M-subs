00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 we are with mister walter mazzarri eve 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.580
 of this inter- valued that game 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.250
 second of three games in five days 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.809
 this is the menu that awaits and I think 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.330
 that in light of this also the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.800
 management of resource men ti 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.109
 will take it into account 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.970
 if indeed or probably I will change now 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.660
 I have yet to decide on training but 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.340
 no need to change at least 45 hours 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.359
 we also see based on certain logics 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.790
 ours will behave accordingly 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.430
 hot signs after chelsea 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.079
 inter were positive at a distance of 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.540
 a few hours reviewing the videos and 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.860
 reviewing continue on that pattern 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.020
 of reading key 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.640
 surely you have seen it always says 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.620
 you have to look where wrong for not 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.570
 repeat but also positive things for 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.520
 Instead, repeat them, but today I did 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.079
 just a meeting with the boys 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.640
 I wanted to show him beyond a few 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.329
 We have made a mistake and we must not 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.559
 try to do it more 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.719
 I showed him just things 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.640
 what good we did the game that 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.500
 we expressed against a team of 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.439
 very high level 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.510
 I saw the boys that they always are 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.760
 more aware of what we are 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.210
 so doing this for a coach 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.040
 is the most comforting and I repeat I have 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.220
 showed that we expressed a nice 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.880
 soccer we created 4 5 goal balls e 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.060
 then now the things to be corrected dictate it 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.310
 them not in the case of saying but I repeat 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.520
 all very positive even mind 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.979
 cold I can say that after very few 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.100
 days I have this team in hand I have 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.079
 seen things that are superior to mine 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.750
 more optimistic expectations 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.159
 I tell the truth there will be no country 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.990
 against the specific value of this one 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.460
 expulsion talking about it after the race with jose 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.350
 mourinho dc have the coaches in 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.549
 these games need no expulsion 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.899
 because we don't need it we don't need it 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.479
 the opponent has games you don't have to 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.280
 win you need to be able to work there 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.630
 it would perhaps be better to oblige 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.860
 replacing that player who has 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.509
 did something he should not do but 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.700
 continue eleven against eleven 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.409
 may be just the August football on 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.729
 period in which we saw the time out 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.819
 in the middle of the first half 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.750
 introduce these small variations like 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.960
 I said 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.820
 I saw very very positive way 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.740
 time out what we did against 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.810
 I believe that this too can 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:23.640
 be a good idea 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.280
 we are coaches and if you see that 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.870
 a nervous player or at least risks 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.440
 expulsion is sufficient for the referee to do so 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.180
 nod let's raise it give us the 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.730
 time to take it off there I didn't have it 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.260
 the time and what he did then 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.690
 very well up until that point he did 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.310
 an entrance a little heavy 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.739
 beyond dress ratings 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.380
 who could decide differently from 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.480
 it is enough just that it should be addressed 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.720
 to us we would have high short right 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.550
 so you have to prepare the teams in 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.050
 this period the result as we have 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.950
 always said we too is the last thing 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.600
 that counts is right to try eleven against 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.489
 eleven what we have to try 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.140
 one last thing to the valencia 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.390
 compared to hamburg and compared to chelsea 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.010
 which were ahead of preparation a 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.510
 a work path very similar to 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.670
 our 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.400
 yes valentia will be a very hard school 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.600
 to face Spanish football 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.519
 we know very well they do not give points to 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.959
 reference not an organized team 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.970
 even in the passive phase it can have some 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.190
 difficulty and this is another verification 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.760
 important part of this path 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.049
 three important games here are those where 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.340
 there will be points 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.480
 and that's where we need to get prepared 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.519
 we need these matches for 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.140
 limit all and all the defects that in 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.630
 this time we can still have it 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.280
