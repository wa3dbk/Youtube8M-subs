00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.550
 But what is this 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:13.690
 we will not have light of the crazy 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.400
 also exists since 1660 this is not 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.660
 is more modern to the first tie 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.850
 you 're really not going to call this 1660 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.039
 you know there are several types of knots 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.380
 of tie so clear is the knot 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.990
 simple like you the double knot like javi 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.580
 there is also the windsor knot depends on 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.600
 the chance as you knot another you 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.309
 you know how to make the knot of the tie 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.309
 man the truth is 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.510
 it is very difficult very difficult you have to be 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.100
 prepared for according to what occasions the 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.809
 people are prepared on the street to 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.910
 these etiquette rules when you have 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.110
 to go to a company dinner or a place 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.090
 a little elegant people are prepared 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.940
 we went out to check it 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.070
 if people know get a knot 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.960
 test tube or we will not see the result 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.370
 Now you know how to knot yourself 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.370
 try on tie 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.690
 he has not left 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.540
 too but not only takes 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.159
 we are using people who do know do 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.920
 the tie knot 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.600
 I have a tie first that goes by 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.000
 good city road or not 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.610
 learn a lot look so perfect already 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.300
 we have a person who if at the moment 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.120
 it fits well 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.900
 to this to this now yes now if not 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.010
 you have got no idea no no 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.870
 you want to try everything that is 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.870
 complicated for me besides going 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.340
 good good 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:53.750
 you are that no no 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.549
 to the French the new tie yes 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:02.490
 forward do not cut yourself now as if nothing 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:06.030
 actually the 70 years of 12 here what 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.619
 has a person very well more than if I 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.629
 like the tie 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.250
 for now tied at 33 that yes that 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.280
 know how to do is the new tie 3 that 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.549
 not decisive moments on the street who 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.549
 will win 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.019
 very well 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.800
 the best start has won the yes 43 there 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.350
 is 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.630
 surely the snake would go first 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:45.340
 Probably if whatever slides 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.340
 the program is pulling 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.360
 we have here points coming out this 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.040
 should be below that's not why the 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.360
 people believe that this must be done 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.440
 messing around but it's true that 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.630
 trying to do it really and going 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.950
 leaving this here is here is now 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.950
