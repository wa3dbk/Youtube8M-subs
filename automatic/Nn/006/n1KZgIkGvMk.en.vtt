00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.100 

I<00:01:29.590> guess<00:01:30.280> when<00:01:30.490> sweet<00:01:30.820> Sargam<00:01:31.180> first<00:01:31.750> came<00:01:31.990> to

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
I guess when sweet Sargam first came to

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.750 
I guess when sweet Sargam first came to
the<00:01:32.200> United<00:01:32.410> States<00:01:32.590> was<00:01:33.040> probably<00:01:33.340> sent<00:01:33.610> more

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
the United States was probably sent more

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.400 
the United States was probably sent more
around<00:01:34.060> eight<00:01:34.360> early<00:01:34.660> 1850s<00:01:36.210> they<00:01:37.210> would<00:01:37.420> they

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
around eight early 1850s they would they

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.530 
around eight early 1850s they would they
had<00:01:38.560> a<00:01:38.590> little<00:01:38.950> small<00:01:39.640> meal<00:01:39.910> some<00:01:40.300> of<00:01:40.390> them<00:01:40.480> are

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
had a little small meal some of them are

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.240 
had a little small meal some of them are
actually<00:01:40.630> made<00:01:40.930> out<00:01:41.080> of<00:01:41.110> wood<00:01:41.230> some<00:01:42.010> of<00:01:42.100> them

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
actually made out of wood some of them

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.390 
actually made out of wood some of them
of<00:01:42.370> course<00:01:42.520> a<00:01:42.820> little<00:01:43.030> three-rotor<00:01:43.450> meal<00:01:43.750> that

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
of course a little three-rotor meal that

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.790 
of course a little three-rotor meal that
that<00:01:45.400> the<00:01:45.550> Mules<00:01:45.790> would<00:01:46.290> go<00:01:47.290> around<00:01:47.620> in

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
that the Mules would go around in

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.130 
that the Mules would go around in
circles<00:01:47.830> and<00:01:48.510> that<00:01:49.510> you<00:01:49.660> would<00:01:49.810> feed<00:01:49.990> the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
circles and that you would feed the

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.480 
circles and that you would feed the
stouts<00:01:50.410> that<00:01:50.620> came<00:01:50.830> in<00:01:51.040> between<00:01:51.160> those

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
stouts that came in between those

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.550 
stouts that came in between those
rollers<00:01:51.820> and<00:01:51.970> squeeze<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.390> juice<00:01:52.420> out<00:01:52.810> most

rollers and squeeze the juice out most

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.760 
rollers and squeeze the juice out most
time<00:01:53.740> they<00:01:53.860> would<00:01:54.010> have<00:01:54.130> a<00:01:54.160> little<00:01:54.660> small

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
is good seed and then we actually

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.599 
is good seed and then we actually
transplant<00:02:56.840> some<00:02:57.079> in<00:02:57.470> early<00:02:57.769> a<00:02:57.799> latter<00:02:58.310> part
