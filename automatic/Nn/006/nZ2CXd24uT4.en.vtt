 ricardo fort in a little what brings us 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.469
 beyond doubt in the part of lamb of sheet metal 

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:13.949

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:14.939
 I believe side 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:16.309
 It was what I think 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.369
 Sisyphus of Schaaf has suffered 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.859
 well basically p we cut the peace 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:23.240
 to do or not true 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.579
 one of them 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:26.149
 the black precedent 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:28.189
 after the vowel marked 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.499
 but alludes to being considerable was also cut 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:33.610
 In addition to the ceased employment 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.699
 eti ball richard badiel liz ante 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:37.850
 and by sevilla 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.060
 the lobatÃ³n sleepings locked 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.040
 for clement the csc sector that would serve for stairs 20 for 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.210
 exterior 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.640
 race every corporation spiral staircase and staircase this one also 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.120
 normal for outdoor 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.059
 good that 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.500
 after three hours of 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.690
 he agreed not to be deployed 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.860
 but not only will it give after being assisted up to 10 millimeters 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.820
 and what kind of happiness for you fall in love with a woman 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.010
 the revelations that cc metal carpentry 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.020
 usually 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.230
 vicious for another side 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.340
 other market needs are missing 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.690
 well for that 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.350
 blacksmith who are in your special care of your fingers doing really 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.830
 well we have learned work 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.299
 marcelino churches 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:27.710
 with that name 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.080
 I give an example that every time they in San Juan their body can be followed 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.400
 for refined metal carpentry shortly in nothing 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.500
 structures 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.970
 metal 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.080
 and talking about it the size of 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.050
 of the piece lost since December where it starts to come out until this 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.549
 morning 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.150
 let's say it minimum and maximum 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.700
 well that we do not have a minimum and a maximum 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.890
 makes nine very simple thing of 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.150
 very small 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.590
 up a structure for 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.630
 is going to be a bridge crane as heraldry 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.670
 this has a large part sheet metal cement columns 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:09.990
 you have pressure 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.990
 yes we have done the series 

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:16.559
 low and that raises brain jury 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.729
 within the plans and the French and Russians 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:23.999
 we are not going to talk about it on another motorcycle so they remodel part also make 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:29.169
 and opening for all this by type of decision of square meters 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.010
 it was expected of us we were born 7 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:37.749
 the manufacturer of the arturo carpenter emeterio 1 ricky is called hours 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:41.359
 Libya can little cousin implementing the machinery to 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.459
 to be able to have a greater 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.329
 percent quality of 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.019
 rossi hood quality and best price trying to series was good with the 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:51.789
 weather 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:54.649
 it was expanding that well many validated 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:56.199
 I must stop him 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:57.759
 for third parties 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:01.650

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.480
 adepa recre has material to be a boiler 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.999
 how long will it take in the third 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:08.690
 within 24 hours 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.159
