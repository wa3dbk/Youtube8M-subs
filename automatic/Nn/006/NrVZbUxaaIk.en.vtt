gym so luckily we have something here at
that<00:01:03.270> kind<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.539> mimics<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:05.010> then<00:01:05.220> we

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
that kind of mimics and that and then we

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.300

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
guess I messed up on it but here we have

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.839 
guess I messed up on it but here we have
the<00:03:11.590> reverse<00:03:11.920> lunges<00:03:12.430> that<00:03:12.609> I<00:03:12.639> was<00:03:12.760> talking

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
the reverse lunges that I was talking

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.729 
the reverse lunges that I was talking
about<00:03:12.970> with<00:03:13.269> the<00:03:13.389> front<00:03:13.660> foot<00:03:13.810> elevated<00:03:14.290> and

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
about with the front foot elevated and

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.110 
about with the front foot elevated and
these<00:03:15.130> are<00:03:15.250> kind<00:03:15.400> of<00:03:15.430> awesome<00:03:15.790> good<00:03:15.880> to<00:03:16.000> get

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
these are kind of awesome good to get

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.059 
these are kind of awesome good to get
balanced<00:03:16.599> but<00:03:17.139> what<00:03:17.319> you<00:03:17.440> do<00:03:17.620> is<00:03:17.769> you<00:03:17.859> get<00:03:17.980> that

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
balanced but what you do is you get that

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.430 
balanced but what you do is you get that
depth<00:03:18.489> that<00:03:18.760> you<00:03:19.120> get<00:03:19.359> in<00:03:19.569> regular<00:03:20.019> lunges

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
depth that you get in regular lunges

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.680 
depth that you get in regular lunges
that<00:03:21.430> you<00:03:21.549> don't<00:03:21.700> normally<00:03:21.970> get<00:03:22.389> by<00:03:22.630> doing

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
that you don't normally get by doing

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.629 
that you don't normally get by doing
walking<00:03:23.139> lunges<00:03:23.560> or<00:03:23.799> step<00:03:24.010> ups<00:03:24.190> or<00:03:24.310> that<00:03:24.459> type

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
walking lunges or step ups or that type

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.009 
walking lunges or step ups or that type
of<00:03:24.669> stuff<00:03:24.970> well<00:03:25.269> I<00:03:25.299> guess<00:03:25.540> you<00:03:25.630> can<00:03:25.750> get<00:03:25.840> the

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
of stuff well I guess you can get the

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.080 
of stuff well I guess you can get the
kind<00:03:26.290> of<00:03:26.349> range<00:03:26.530> of<00:03:26.620> motion<00:03:26.889> in<00:03:27.010> step<00:03:27.220> ups<00:03:27.430> but

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
kind of range of motion in step ups but

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.349 
kind of range of motion in step ups but
not<00:03:28.359> really<00:03:29.519> reverse<00:03:30.519> lunges<00:03:30.819> or<00:03:30.940> walking

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
not really reverse lunges or walking

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:35.430 
not really reverse lunges or walking
lunges<00:03:32.489> here<00:03:33.489> comes<00:03:33.849> next<00:03:34.329> the<00:03:34.780> glute<00:03:35.260> and

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
lunges here comes next the glute and

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.400 
lunges here comes next the glute and
raises<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:37.139> unfortunately<00:03:38.139> don't<00:03:38.230> have<00:03:38.319> a

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
raises so unfortunately don't have a

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.020 
raises so unfortunately don't have a
blue<00:03:38.590> hand<00:03:38.829> raised<00:03:39.040> machine<00:03:39.459> but<00:03:39.849> you<00:03:39.880> can

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
blue hand raised machine but you can

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.069 
blue hand raised machine but you can
kind<00:03:40.209> of<00:03:40.239> see<00:03:40.389> how<00:03:40.540> this<00:03:40.739> contraption<00:03:41.760> thing

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
kind of see how this contraption thing

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.420 
kind of see how this contraption thing
really<00:03:44.079> works<00:03:44.349> out<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.739> our<00:03:44.859> advantage<00:03:44.919> that

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
really works out to our advantage that

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.740 
really works out to our advantage that
we<00:03:45.489> just<00:03:45.730> put<00:03:45.849> our<00:03:45.940> feet<00:03:46.090> under<00:03:46.269> those<00:03:46.450> pads

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
we just put our feet under those pads

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.800 
we just put our feet under those pads
and<00:03:47.310> we<00:03:48.310> have<00:03:48.459> something<00:03:48.849> to<00:03:49.090> anchor<00:03:49.419> us

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
and we have something to anchor us

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.979 
and we have something to anchor us
downward<00:03:50.349> and<00:03:50.769> as<00:03:51.549> also<00:03:51.880> as<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:52.120> can<00:03:52.150> see<00:03:52.269> I'm

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
downward and as also as you can see I'm

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.449 
downward and as also as you can see I'm
not<00:03:53.139> very<00:03:53.200> good<00:03:53.620> at<00:03:53.739> these<00:03:53.889> haven't<00:03:54.340> done

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
not very good at these haven't done

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.940 
not very good at these haven't done
things<00:03:54.549> very<00:03:54.819> much<00:03:55.049> but<00:03:56.049> my<00:03:56.380> hands<00:03:56.650> Ranger

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
things very much but my hands Ranger

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.409 
things very much but my hands Ranger
really<00:03:57.220> work<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.489> next<00:03:57.609> day<00:03:57.760> and<00:03:58.030> really<00:03:58.209> felt

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
really work the next day and really felt

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.320 
really work the next day and really felt
sore<00:03:58.690> and<00:03:59.079> I<00:03:59.650> think<00:03:59.799> it's<00:03:59.889> just

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
sore and I think it's just

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.880 
sore and I think it's just
movement<00:04:00.750> because<00:04:01.410> you<00:04:01.590> know<00:04:01.680> there's<00:04:01.830> only

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
movement because you know there's only

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.440 
movement because you know there's only
so<00:04:02.100> many<00:04:02.190> hamstrung<00:04:02.730> movements<00:04:03.150> that<00:04:03.210> you<00:04:03.330> can

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
so many hamstrung movements that you can

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.410 
so many hamstrung movements that you can
do<00:04:03.630> that<00:04:04.200> elongate<00:04:04.980> your<00:04:05.250> hamstrings<00:04:06.030> such<00:04:06.240> as

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
do that elongate your hamstrings such as

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.980 
do that elongate your hamstrings such as
stiff<00:04:06.660> leg<00:04:06.840> dead<00:04:07.020> lifts<00:04:08.420> and<00:04:09.420> stiff<00:04:09.690> leg<00:04:09.870> down

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
stiff leg dead lifts and stiff leg down

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.840 
stiff leg dead lifts and stiff leg down
their<00:04:10.140> variations<00:04:10.830> other<00:04:11.490> than<00:04:11.640> that<00:04:11.730> you

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
their variations other than that you

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.700 
their variations other than that you
have<00:04:11.970> like<00:04:12.150> things<00:04:12.330> like<00:04:12.420> hamstring<00:04:12.960> curl<00:04:13.260> and

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
have like things like hamstring curl and

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.900 
have like things like hamstring curl and
you<00:04:14.130> know<00:04:14.220> there's<00:04:14.400> so<00:04:14.460> many<00:04:14.520> curling

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
you know there's so many curling

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.100 
you know there's so many curling
movements<00:04:15.240> and<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.630> hamstrings<00:04:15.930> are<00:04:16.080> really

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.110 
movements and the hamstrings are really

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.690 
movements and the hamstrings are really
pretty<00:04:16.470> short<00:04:16.920> for<00:04:17.160> most<00:04:17.310> people<00:04:17.549> especially

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
pretty short for most people especially

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.259 
pretty short for most people especially
people<00:04:18.060> who<00:04:18.720> have<00:04:18.870> jobs<00:04:19.140> at<00:04:19.350> desks<00:04:19.830> that

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
people who have jobs at desks that

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.490 
people who have jobs at desks that
elongating<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.359> muscle<00:04:21.660> really<00:04:22.019> helps<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.320> lot

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
elongating the muscle really helps a lot

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.350 
elongating the muscle really helps a lot
in<00:04:22.770> alleviating<00:04:23.550> a<00:04:23.610> lot<00:04:23.730> of<00:04:23.880> lower<00:04:24.090> back<00:04:24.300> pain

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
in alleviating a lot of lower back pain

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.230 
in alleviating a lot of lower back pain
and<00:04:24.630> just<00:04:24.810> keeping<00:04:25.140> your<00:04:25.260> body<00:04:25.410> balanced<00:04:26.240> for

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
and just keeping your body balanced for

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.190 
and just keeping your body balanced for
the<00:04:27.300> last<00:04:27.450> exercise<00:04:27.840> again<00:04:28.440> as<00:04:28.800> I<00:04:29.010> said<00:04:29.070> before

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
the last exercise again as I said before

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.710 
the last exercise again as I said before
no<00:04:31.200> ABS<00:04:31.440> but<00:04:32.400> we<00:04:32.640> decided<00:04:32.820> Duke<00:04:33.090> as<00:04:33.240> instead

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
no ABS but we decided Duke as instead

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.570 
no ABS but we decided Duke as instead
this<00:04:34.530> would<00:04:34.650> really<00:04:34.770> give<00:04:34.920> you<00:04:35.010> an<00:04:35.070> angle<00:04:35.280> for

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
this would really give you an angle for

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.340 
this would really give you an angle for
my<00:04:35.700> calves

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
my calves

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.810 
my calves
unfortunately<00:04:37.350> they<00:04:37.470> actually<00:04:38.010> are<00:04:38.580> really

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
unfortunately they actually are really

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.200 
unfortunately they actually are really
small<00:04:39.210> looking<00:04:39.600> with<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:39.990> rest<00:04:40.170> of<00:04:40.290> my<00:04:40.380> body

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
small looking with the rest of my body

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.640 
small looking with the rest of my body
so<00:04:42.210> that<00:04:42.480> brings<00:04:42.630> me<00:04:42.810> kind<00:04:43.020> of<00:04:43.140> to<00:04:43.230> my<00:04:43.350> last

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
so that brings me kind of to my last

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.580 
so that brings me kind of to my last
point<00:04:44.000> this<00:04:45.000> is<00:04:45.150> going<00:04:45.180> to<00:04:45.390> be<00:04:45.480> the<00:04:45.570> end<00:04:45.750> of<00:04:46.050> the
