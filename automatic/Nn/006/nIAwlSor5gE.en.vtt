00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.860
 today I bring you a fruit 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:17.449
 let's use cucumber grated jicama 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.220
 grated carrot grated amounts not 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.010
 I give them to you because you are going to decide 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.400
 how much do they want to do? 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:28.180
 a mold of thread previously with 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.180
 Adhesive plastic 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.609
 a little grenetine 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.100
 lemon juice 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.290
 is love 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.530
 let's start 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.070
 adding a little bit of chamoy in the 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.070
 background 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.829
 the plastic is going to be so that we 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:59.300
 make it easier to take off our thread 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.300
 then we are going to add 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.239
 the cucumber 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.900
 this cucumber I bought it grated 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.510
 if you like this, you can scratch it at home 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.229
 try to make it 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.229
 well distributed 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.370
 and we are going to postpone a little 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.460
 well already after we did this what 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.530
 we crush very well 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.340
 let's grab a little bit of the 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.020
 grenetina and we are going to sprinkle 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.680
 try to stay in the middle in the 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.950
 shores 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.950
 a little nothing and then 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.380
 let's add a little bit more 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.380
 Chamorro 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.140
 and here to see lemon 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.290
 we're going and we're going to go let's go 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.290
 putting up 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.769
 to help us with the grenetina 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:31.080
 then we go with the jicama and 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.080
 we do the same 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.910
 you also have to crush it very well 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.060
 so that it is the shape of the rice that 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.060
 we want 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.190
 and we add again 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.620
 on the sides for what 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.880
 that is to say when it comes to dismantling 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.900
 let's add a little chomÃ³n 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.290
 and the lemon juice 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.760
 I'm not going to tell you how much the lemon 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.069
 you decide how much lemon you want 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.609
 because many do not like it and others 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.609
 love 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.510
 I was dying after this 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.860
 we go with the carrot 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.860
 we do the same thing 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.410
 you have to crush very well 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.660
 good since it remains like this 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:38.020
 let's do the same 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.470
 sprinkle the grenetina for everyone 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.470

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.760
 and the lemon 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:12.200
 we're going to put the refrigerator for two 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:14.910
 hours 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:18.590
 we will cover it with 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.590
 with yellow plastic 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.360
 we are going to do very well here in the 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:27.069
 shores so you do not see 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.069
 the shape of the thread 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:33.680
 you have to put it in the refrigerator 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.110

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:55.460
 the plastic and the fruit and let's start 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.460
 to dismantle 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:05.030
 and what we are going to do is put the plate 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.030
 over 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.919
