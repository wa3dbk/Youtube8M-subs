00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
I think we've one more correction let's

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.569 
I think we've one more correction let's
go<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.600> yes<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.380> see<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> full<00:01:59.040> shot<00:01:59.280> she

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
go to that yes you see a full shot she

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.980 
go to that yes you see a full shot she
looks<00:01:59.729> really<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.270> there<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.689> little

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
looks really like there it's a little

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.959 
looks really like there it's a little
bit<00:02:01.140> longer<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.619> top<00:02:01.649> but<00:02:02.219> still<00:02:02.430> very<00:02:02.460> short

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
bit longer on top but still very short

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.330 
bit longer on top but still very short
on<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.240> sides<00:02:03.270> uh<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.829> certainly<00:02:05.130> seems

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
on the sides uh and it certainly seems

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.730 
on the sides uh and it certainly seems
to<00:02:05.430> suit<00:02:05.700> her<00:02:05.939> shape<00:02:06.180> yeah<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.780> think<00:02:06.960> like<00:02:07.350> that

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
to suit her shape yeah I think like that

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.960 
to suit her shape yeah I think like that
you<00:02:07.890> have<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.129> do<00:02:08.429> though<00:02:08.610> if<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.300> want

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
you have to do though if you want

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.790 
you have to do though if you want
have<00:02:10.149> this<00:02:10.360> haircut<00:02:10.570> but<00:02:10.899> still<00:02:11.170> be<00:02:11.290> feminine

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
that subreddit she had just gotten the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.320 
that subreddit she had just gotten the
haircut<00:02:32.560> is<00:02:32.590> their<00:02:32.830> first<00:02:33.010> time<00:02:33.220> going<00:02:33.280> out<00:02:33.700> or

suits her head and you can compare it

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:41.880 
suits her head and you can compare it

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
my friend Jane's online about it because

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.350 
my friend Jane's online about it because
he<00:03:18.370> thinks<00:03:18.519> that<00:03:18.670> she<00:03:18.910> looks<00:03:19.060> much<00:03:19.209> better

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.520

than<00:03:19.540> just<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.690> regular<00:03:19.840> long<00:03:20.170> hair<00:03:20.350> but<00:03:20.500> I

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
than just the regular long hair but I

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.830 
than just the regular long hair but I
think<00:03:20.830> like<00:03:21.370> if<00:03:21.519> you<00:03:21.700> have<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.000> fairly<00:03:22.540> delicate

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
think like if you have a fairly delicate

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.110 
think like if you have a fairly delicate
facial<00:03:23.260> structure<00:03:23.860> like<00:03:24.100> your<00:03:24.580> ears<00:03:24.760> have<00:03:25.000> to

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
facial structure like your ears have to

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.690 
facial structure like your ears have to
be<00:03:25.209> fairly<00:03:25.480> like<00:03:25.810> small<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:26.830> I've<00:03:27.310> read<00:03:27.550> that

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
be fairly like small and I've read that

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.090 
be fairly like small and I've read that
your<00:03:27.850> face<00:03:28.060> can't<00:03:28.330> be<00:03:28.390> very<00:03:28.600> long<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:29.709> can<00:03:29.830> look

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
your face can't be very long it can look

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.590 
your face can't be very long it can look
really<00:03:30.430> good<00:03:30.550> so<00:03:30.730> what<00:03:30.910> do<00:03:30.970> you<00:03:31.060> think<00:03:31.269> overall

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
really good so what do you think overall

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.750 
really good so what do you think overall
do<00:03:31.959> you<00:03:32.050> think<00:03:32.290> that<00:03:32.470> it<00:03:32.709> should<00:03:33.100> spread<00:03:33.519> like

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
do you think that it should spread like

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.460 
do you think that it should spread like
more<00:03:33.940> girls<00:03:34.150> should<00:03:34.300> consider<00:03:34.660> it<00:03:34.810> I<00:03:34.989> think<00:03:35.380> so

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
more girls should consider it I think so

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.830 
more girls should consider it I think so
I<00:03:35.500> think<00:03:35.590> it's<00:03:35.920> so<00:03:36.250> common<00:03:37.209> for<00:03:37.239> people<00:03:37.630> think

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
I think it's so common for people think

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.140 
I think it's so common for people think
like<00:03:37.959> oh<00:03:37.989> well<00:03:38.380> you<00:03:38.799> look<00:03:39.250> hotter<00:03:39.489> with<00:03:39.790> longer

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
like oh well you look hotter with longer

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.390 
like oh well you look hotter with longer
hair<00:03:40.180> but<00:03:41.019> I<00:03:41.049> think<00:03:41.290> I'm<00:03:41.680> seeing<00:03:42.100> more<00:03:42.250> and

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
hair but I think I'm seeing more and

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.800 
hair but I think I'm seeing more and
more<00:03:42.519> women<00:03:42.730> getting<00:03:43.090> these<00:03:43.180> haircuts<00:03:43.600> and<00:03:43.720> I

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
more women getting these haircuts and I

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.150 
more women getting these haircuts and I
think<00:03:44.019> they<00:03:44.110> look<00:03:44.260> great<00:03:44.500> on<00:03:44.530> a<00:03:44.739> lot<00:03:44.950> of<00:03:44.980> women

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
thing about that is like you don't

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.090 
thing about that is like you don't
really<00:04:04.750> know<00:04:04.959> your<00:04:05.200> own<00:04:05.320> head<00:04:05.590> shape<00:04:05.860> until

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.170 
you don't have any hair on it and that
could<00:04:08.799> look<00:04:09.070> awful<00:04:09.580> and<00:04:09.730> then<00:04:09.880> it's<00:04:10.060> gonna

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
could look awful and then it's gonna

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.780 
could look awful and then it's gonna
take<00:04:10.480> years<00:04:11.019> to<00:04:11.799> grow<00:04:11.980> back<00:04:12.190> so<00:04:12.220> it's<00:04:12.580> just

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
take years to grow back so it's just

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.820

it's<00:04:13.330> just<00:04:13.420> scary<00:04:13.989> and<00:04:14.200> I<00:04:14.260> think<00:04:14.440> that's<00:04:14.590> why<00:04:14.799> a

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
it's just scary and I think that's why a

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.620 
it's just scary and I think that's why a
lot<00:04:14.950> of<00:04:15.100> women<00:04:15.220> don't<00:04:15.519> do<00:04:15.730> it<00:04:15.880> yeah<00:04:16.209> freshman
