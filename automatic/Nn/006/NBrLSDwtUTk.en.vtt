00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:11.489
 in the development of Zubkov surprises bargaining 

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:14.489
 how early it all starts 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:17.169
 this is my embryo just six 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:19.659
 weeks but the epithelium of his lower jaw 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:21.909
 already thickening preparing for what 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.810
 will happen 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.820
 with his height 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.910
 these goals and creates an island of cells 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.910
 which is a germ 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.130
 but here are the words 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.430
 this is special may plastic and where are you 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.550
 proceed unbearable 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.240
 potential 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.490
 and if we give in closer we will see 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.450
 other key players 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.010
 parodying our dentition 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.040
 riverman or provide 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.300
 support the development of tissues and blood vessels 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.420
 vessels helping to form already 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.110
 emerging germ zubkov 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.240
 by this moment forgetting the record 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.390
 turns into a tooth germ 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.400
 epithelial cells undergo 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.120
 small changes however with growth 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.110
 embryo they begin to form coca cola in 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.140
 blood pressure response 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.720
 vessels 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.840
 and sealing occurs lower 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.180
 if Khimki cells 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.040
 at this point you can already distinguish 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.360
 cells that will form in the future 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.320
 mature tooth tissue 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.409
 m and the left of the mound consists of cells 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.290
 battered real heads exactly one 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.290
 generating Maltsev 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.940
 Dzharty mesenchymal 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.540
 cells in the future will form pectin and 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.060
 bullet they are called shame given tzos 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.780
 points 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.080
 and made only ats local scheme 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.110
 ram will develop home bag 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.710
 and collectively these cells are known as 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.710
 germ sound 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.720
 while we saw only the rudiment and observed 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.649
 beyond the stage of development of the goiter head the third and 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.860
 the most dramatic is the stage 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.430
 domes 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.730
 as soon as the bud of the soup begins to grow 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.730
 cell division occurs 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.729
 now clearly visible stars are reading these 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.310
 culinary tissue 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.160
 consisting of star-shaped cells 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.659
 separated by fluid suppression 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:13.209
 it separates the internal and external 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.099
 St. Petersburg where is mother 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.310
 visible only smoothed area 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.649
 cell called intermediate layer 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:23.099
 we can also see the connection 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.619
 internal and external epithelium 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:25.809
 enamel 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:27.719
 this action cam loop 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.449
 is important for tooth formation 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:32.479
 and what will learn soon 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:34.829
 by the time the tooth separates from 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.009
 dental plate at the end of the dome stage 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:39.409
 internal enamel St. Petersburg will roll 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.409
 its shape future crowns 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.529
 builders of the western world set about 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:48.789
 the work is even sharper than the exact word 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:51.169
 inner cells these goals have turned 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:53.699
 conquer and conquer neighboring cells in 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.079
 his daddy's papa turned here 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.099
 he is a layer 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.379
 now they move to the center 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.909
 papillae leaving behind a thin tube 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.159
 cytoplasm deferred 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.439
 and now they are starting to move. 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.989
 layer rising above the hardest tissue 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.499
 enamels about 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:15.459
 resulting expert 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.169
 stone crown of enamel and dentin 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:19.709
 represents a wonderful world 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.399
 cell engineering however these engineers 

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:24.119
 have not finished your work 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:26.019
 cervical loop extension 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.469
 form the collar called and 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:31.059
 five real shell core next arteka 

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:33.109
 which set in motion others from from 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.069
 regional to form 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:35.689
 Trentino Corr 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:37.749
 same time the court starts moving 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:40.619
 like a sweeping biological rocket 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:42.629
 and in the oral cavity appears completely 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.939
 formed dairy month 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:47.379
 his new owner is of course just in 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.419
 delighted
