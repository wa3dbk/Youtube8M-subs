mean<00:00:14.639> bridge<00:00:15.030> area<00:00:15.330> here<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:17.119> what<00:00:18.119> I'm<00:00:18.240> going

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
mean bridge area here and what I'm going

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.929 
mean bridge area here and what I'm going
to<00:00:18.510> do<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:20.960> right<00:00:21.960> here<00:00:22.490> where<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.609> bridge

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
to do is right here where the bridge

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.370 
to do is right here where the bridge
abutments<00:00:24.449> are<00:00:24.510> going<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.720> be<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:24.869> mean<00:00:25.199> there's

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
abutments are going to be I mean there's

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.670 
abutments are going to be I mean there's
gonna<00:00:25.500> be<00:00:25.680> some<00:00:25.859> square<00:00:27.199> totally<00:00:28.199> square<00:00:28.500> but

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
gonna be some square totally square but

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.200 
gonna be some square totally square but
blocks<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.160> foam<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.550> place<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.090> will

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
blocks a foam in place and that will

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.580 
blocks a foam in place and that will
support<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.750> end<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.080> bridge<00:00:31.289> on<00:00:31.470> either

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
support the end of the bridge on either

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.639 
support the end of the bridge on either
side<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:32.219> see<00:00:32.250> how<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:34.640> notched<00:00:36.649> things

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
side you can see how I notched things

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.340 
side you can see how I notched things
out<00:00:37.860> here<00:00:38.309> where<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.390> tracks<00:00:39.660> are<00:00:39.870> going<00:00:40.020> so

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
out here where the tracks are going so

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.080 
out here where the tracks are going so
that's<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.710> little<00:00:40.860> bit<00:00:41.010> more<00:00:41.190> square<00:00:41.700> there

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
that's a little bit more square there

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.510 
that's a little bit more square there
and<00:00:42.390> actually<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.200> blocks<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.680> foam<00:00:43.890> will

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
and actually the blocks of foam will

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.709 
and actually the blocks of foam will
support<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.719> end<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.640> each<00:00:47.640> bridge<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.420> what

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
support the end of each bridge and what

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.090 
support the end of each bridge and what
I'll<00:00:48.840> probably<00:00:49.170> do<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:51.620> kind<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.680> shave<00:00:52.920> these

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
I'll probably do is kind of shave these

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.250 
I'll probably do is kind of shave these
down<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.579> size<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.329> there<00:00:54.539> will<00:00:54.899> shave

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
down to size so that there will shave

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.689 
down to size so that there will shave
them<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.680> they're<00:00:55.829> more<00:00:56.010> or<00:00:56.129> less<00:00:56.280> square

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
them so that they're more or less square

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.740 
them so that they're more or less square
and<00:00:56.879> then<00:00:57.000> wrap<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.600> outside<00:00:58.140> with<00:00:59.750> probably

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
and then wrap the outside with probably

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.529 
and then wrap the outside with probably
a<00:01:00.840> plaster<00:01:01.289> casting<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.280> I'll<00:01:02.430> do<00:01:02.640> I'll<00:01:03.390> make

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
a plaster casting that I'll do I'll make

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.230 
a plaster casting that I'll do I'll make
my<00:01:03.690> own<00:01:04.339> rubber<00:01:05.339> mold<00:01:05.640> out<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.780> gauze<00:01:07.500> and

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
my own rubber mold out of gauze and

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.060 
my own rubber mold out of gauze and
silicone<00:01:09.240> rubber<00:01:09.479> from<00:01:10.140> Woodland<00:01:10.680> Scenic's

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
silicone rubber from Woodland Scenic's

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.940 
silicone rubber from Woodland Scenic's
and<00:01:11.780> Cassie's<00:01:12.780> maybe<00:01:13.380> quarter-inch<00:01:13.860> thick

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
and Cassie's maybe quarter-inch thick

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.090 
and Cassie's maybe quarter-inch thick
panels<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.229> basically<00:01:16.229> wrap<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.590> outside<00:01:17.009> of

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
panels and basically wrap the outside of

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.560 
panels and basically wrap the outside of
the<00:01:17.189> phone<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.640> make<00:01:17.759> sure<00:01:17.820> me<00:01:18.270> no<00:01:18.330> make<00:01:18.540> it

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
the phone to make sure me no make it

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.570 
the phone to make sure me no make it
look<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.170> basically<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.369> bridge

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
look like the basically the bridge

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.609 
look like the basically the bridge
abutment<00:01:20.820> was<00:01:21.119> cast<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:22.070> concrete<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:24.590> for<00:01:25.590> a

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
abutment was cast and concrete and for a

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.850 
abutment was cast and concrete and for a
little<00:01:25.830> digression<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:28.850> fortunately<00:01:30.860> don't

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
little digression here fortunately don't

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.399 
little digression here fortunately don't
have<00:01:32.130> any<00:01:32.310> live<00:01:32.729> video<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.509> how<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.840> made<00:01:34.170> these

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
have any live video of how I made these

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.990 
have any live video of how I made these
things<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.979> didn't<00:01:35.250> think<00:01:35.310> about<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.820> when<00:01:35.970> I

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
things I didn't think about it when I

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.789 
things I didn't think about it when I
first<00:01:36.299> made<00:01:36.479> these<00:01:36.659> about<00:01:36.900> five<00:01:37.229> years<00:01:37.439> ago

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
first made these about five years ago

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.370 
first made these about five years ago
but<00:01:38.540> I'll<00:01:39.540> probably<00:01:39.869> be<00:01:40.740> doing<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:42.380> bridge

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
but I'll probably be doing the bridge

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.429 
but I'll probably be doing the bridge
abutment<00:01:43.649> panels<00:01:44.310> as<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.149> cast<00:01:45.630> mold<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.290> but

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
abutment panels as a cast mold and but

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.020 
abutment panels as a cast mold and but
anyway<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.040> kind<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.430> quick<00:01:47.700> overview

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
anyway just to kind of a quick overview

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.910 
anyway just to kind of a quick overview
of<00:01:48.180> how<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.450> did<00:01:48.659> these<00:01:48.930> bridge<00:01:49.229> piers<00:01:49.649> these

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
of how I did these bridge piers these

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.889 
of how I did these bridge piers these
are<00:01:50.070> not<00:01:50.189> commercial<00:01:51.229> bridge<00:01:52.229> piers<00:01:53.630> but<00:01:54.630> I

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
are not commercial bridge piers but I

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.289 
are not commercial bridge piers but I
got<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.320> idea<00:01:55.700> for<00:01:56.700> doing<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:57.000> because<00:01:57.090> I

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
got the idea for doing this because I

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.940 
got the idea for doing this because I
had<00:01:57.540> actually<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.920> started<00:01:59.430> off<00:01:59.549> with<00:02:00.950> making

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
had actually I started off with making

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.490 
had actually I started off with making
these<00:02:02.299> bridge<00:02:03.299> piers<00:02:03.630> first<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.259> this<00:02:04.350> will

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
these bridge piers first and this will

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.249 
these bridge piers first and this will
be<00:02:04.590> more<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:05.240> guess<00:02:06.240> will<00:02:06.390> be<00:02:06.420> an<00:02:06.570> old<00:02:06.719> fashioned

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
be more I guess will be an old fashioned

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.440 
be more I guess will be an old fashioned
older<00:02:07.799> style<00:02:08.129> bridge<00:02:08.580> pier<00:02:08.879> made<00:02:09.209> out<00:02:09.360> of

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
older style bridge pier made out of

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.580 
older style bridge pier made out of
giant<00:02:10.190> blocks<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:12.150> way<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.480> did<00:02:12.840> this

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
giant blocks and the way I did this

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.180 
giant blocks and the way I did this
was<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:14.160> took<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:15.530> commercial<00:02:16.530> bridge<00:02:16.860> bear<00:02:17.160> I

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
was I took a commercial bridge bear I

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.790 
was I took a commercial bridge bear I
can't<00:02:17.459> remember<00:02:17.580> who<00:02:18.440> made<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.590> whether<00:02:19.739> it

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
can't remember who made it whether it

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.009 
can't remember who made it whether it
was<00:02:19.920> Atlas<00:02:20.370> or<00:02:20.610> lifelike<00:02:21.239> or<00:02:21.480> something<00:02:21.840> like

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
was Atlas or lifelike or something like

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.360 
was Atlas or lifelike or something like
that<00:02:22.230> anyway<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.970> made<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.000> mold<00:02:24.470> using<00:02:25.470> gauze

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
that anyway I made a mold using gauze

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.339 
that anyway I made a mold using gauze
and<00:02:28.250> silicon<00:02:29.250> rubber<00:02:29.940> using<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.989> combination

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
and silicon rubber using a combination

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.610 
and silicon rubber using a combination
of<00:02:31.769> that<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.220> it's<00:02:33.030> pretty<00:02:33.239> easy<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.750> do<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.590> I

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
of that and it's pretty easy to do and I

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.839 
of that and it's pretty easy to do and I
just<00:02:34.650> took<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.129> pier<00:02:35.580> itself<00:02:35.879> and<00:02:36.510> lightly

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
just took the pier itself and lightly

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:43.190 
just took the pier itself and lightly
first<00:02:38.849> coated<00:02:39.269> it<00:02:39.390> with<00:02:39.420> some<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:42.200> rubber

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
first coated it with some that rubber

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.530 
first coated it with some that rubber
latex<00:02:43.769> rubber<00:02:43.980> compound<00:02:44.640> then<00:02:45.060> wrapped<00:02:45.330> it

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
latex rubber compound then wrapped it

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.960 
latex rubber compound then wrapped it
with<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:46.200> thin<00:02:46.470> layer<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.709> gauze<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.519> then<00:02:47.670> just

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
with a thin layer of gauze and then just

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.970 
with a thin layer of gauze and then just
kept<00:02:48.150> doing<00:02:48.329> several<00:02:49.049> layers<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.349> gauze<00:02:49.650> and

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
kept doing several layers of gauze and

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.550 
kept doing several layers of gauze and
then<00:02:50.099> silicon<00:02:50.640> rubber<00:02:50.760> compound<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:52.290> get<00:02:52.440> this

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
then silicon rubber compound to get this

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.280 
then silicon rubber compound to get this
little<00:02:52.799> mold<00:02:53.010> here<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.579> then<00:02:54.200> pour<00:02:55.200> the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
little mold here and then pour the

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.350 
little mold here and then pour the
plaster<00:02:55.440> in<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.900> with<00:02:59.239> something<00:03:00.239> that

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
plaster in and and with something that

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.059 
plaster in and and with something that
looks<00:03:00.480> like<00:03:00.540> that<00:03:00.660> that<00:03:01.620> looks<00:03:01.890> all<00:03:02.040> pretty

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
looks like that that looks all pretty

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.300 
looks like that that looks all pretty
rough<00:03:02.849> as<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.180> is<00:03:03.450> but<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.890> then<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.040> took<00:03:05.220> an

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
rough as it is but and then I took an

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.140 
rough as it is but and then I took an
exacto<00:03:05.819> knife<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.360> just<00:03:07.700> started<00:03:08.700> scoring

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
exacto knife and just started scoring

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.039 
exacto knife and just started scoring
lines<00:03:09.540> in<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:10.430> horizontal<00:03:11.430> lines<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.970> make<00:03:12.390> all

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
lines in it horizontal lines to make all

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.369 
lines in it horizontal lines to make all
the<00:03:13.230> brick<00:03:13.410> blocks<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.720> be<00:03:15.720> honest<00:03:16.079> this<00:03:16.230> is

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
the brick blocks and be honest this is

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.210 
the brick blocks and be honest this is
probably<00:03:17.010> not<00:03:17.900> to<00:03:18.900> n<00:03:19.049> scale<00:03:19.560> but<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:20.040> has<00:03:20.190> a

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
probably not to n scale but it has a

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.729 
probably not to n scale but it has a
really<00:03:20.609> the<00:03:21.600> proper<00:03:21.930> scale<00:03:22.200> I'm<00:03:22.319> using<00:03:22.590> n

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
really the proper scale I'm using n

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.650 
really the proper scale I'm using n
scale<00:03:23.040> these<00:03:23.250> blocks<00:03:23.579> may<00:03:24.000> be<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.180> bit<00:03:24.420> on<00:03:24.540> the

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
scale these blocks may be a bit on the

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.370 
scale these blocks may be a bit on the
big<00:03:24.840> side<00:03:24.900> though<00:03:25.829> they<00:03:25.980> probably<00:03:26.160> are<00:03:26.549> but<00:03:27.380> I

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
big side though they probably are but I

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.530 
big side though they probably are but I
think<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.280> was<00:03:29.400> going<00:03:29.489> for<00:03:29.790> an<00:03:29.849> overall<00:03:30.090> effect

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
think I was going for an overall effect

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.710 
think I was going for an overall effect
and<00:03:30.840> never<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.170> N<00:03:31.709> for<00:03:32.180> scale<00:03:33.180> correctness

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
and never the N for scale correctness

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.809 
and never the N for scale correctness
and<00:03:34.139> so<00:03:34.319> what<00:03:34.680> I<00:03:34.709> did<00:03:34.920> was<00:03:35.130> I<00:03:35.280> scored<00:03:35.670> these

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
and so what I did was I scored these

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.210 
and so what I did was I scored these
lines<00:03:36.440> using<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.560> exacto<00:03:38.040> knife

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
lines using the exacto knife

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.199 
lines using the exacto knife
horizontally<00:03:38.840> then<00:03:39.840> started<00:03:41.209> cutting

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
horizontally then started cutting

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.110 
horizontally then started cutting
vertically<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:43.109> make<00:03:43.260> individual<00:03:43.739> bricks<00:03:44.120> and

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
vertically to make individual bricks and

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.080 
vertically to make individual bricks and
I<00:03:45.599> took<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.930> whole<00:03:46.109> piece<00:03:46.799> and<00:03:47.220> then<00:03:47.459> dipped

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
I took the whole piece and then dipped

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.479 
I took the whole piece and then dipped
it<00:03:48.269> in<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:50.120> an<00:03:51.120> acrylic<00:03:51.450> wash<00:03:51.840> of<00:03:52.319> I<00:03:52.950> think<00:03:53.190> was<00:03:53.459> a

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
it in a an acrylic wash of I think was a

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.390 
it in a an acrylic wash of I think was a
birth<00:03:54.329> Sienna<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:54.930> red<00:03:55.079> ochre<00:03:55.530> I<00:03:55.950> mean<00:03:56.190> just

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
birth Sienna and red ochre I mean just

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.599 
birth Sienna and red ochre I mean just
uh<00:03:56.549> some<00:03:57.180> water<00:03:57.450> and<00:03:57.750> some<00:03:58.650> acrylic<00:03:58.829> paint<00:03:59.040> and

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
uh some water and some acrylic paint and

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.009 
uh some water and some acrylic paint and
I<00:03:59.700> think<00:03:59.910> it<00:03:59.970> was<00:04:00.060> you<00:04:00.209> know<00:04:00.329> a<00:04:00.359> few<00:04:00.599> drops<00:04:00.870> of

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
I think it was you know a few drops of

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.930 
I think it was you know a few drops of
each<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.650> give<00:04:01.829> it<00:04:01.919> a<00:04:01.980> brown<00:04:02.220> color<00:04:02.579> then<00:04:02.700> I

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
each to give it a brown color then I

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.710 
each to give it a brown color then I
took<00:04:03.000> some<00:04:04.250> artist<00:04:05.250> chalk<00:04:05.519> some<00:04:06.090> Brown<00:04:06.299> artist

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
took some artist chalk some Brown artist

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.319 
took some artist chalk some Brown artist
chalk<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.200> then<00:04:07.609> colored<00:04:08.609> in<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.790> rest<00:04:09.030> give

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
chalk and then colored in the rest give

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.030 
chalk and then colored in the rest give
us<00:04:09.510> a<00:04:09.599> little<00:04:09.810> dusting<00:04:10.230> so<00:04:10.440> that's<00:04:10.620> how<00:04:10.769> I<00:04:10.799> did

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
us a little dusting so that's how I did

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.089 
us a little dusting so that's how I did
these<00:04:11.190> bridge<00:04:12.120> piers<00:04:12.620> and<00:04:13.620> now<00:04:13.769> for<00:04:14.010> these

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
these bridge piers and now for these

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:20.659 
these bridge piers and now for these
other<00:04:14.430> ones<00:04:14.790> that<00:04:16.789> have<00:04:17.789> this<00:04:18.030> nice<00:04:19.459> point<00:04:20.459> to

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
other ones that have this nice point to

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.909 
other ones that have this nice point to
him<00:04:20.789> that<00:04:21.209> you<00:04:21.299> see<00:04:21.479> in<00:04:21.570> modern<00:04:22.049> bridges<00:04:22.680> to

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
him that you see in modern bridges to

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.490 
him that you see in modern bridges to
divert<00:04:23.190> water<00:04:23.430> flow<00:04:23.849> he<00:04:24.630> did<00:04:24.930> something<00:04:25.469> a

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
divert water flow he did something a

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.089 
divert water flow he did something a
little<00:04:25.530> bit<00:04:25.740> different

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:27.099 
little bit different

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:33.510 
little bit different
I<00:04:27.130> also<00:04:28.530> went<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:29.800> gauze<00:04:30.729> and<00:04:32.069> silicon<00:04:33.069> rubber

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
I also went the gauze and silicon rubber

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.059 
I also went the gauze and silicon rubber
route<00:04:34.090> and<00:04:34.830> what<00:04:35.830> I<00:04:35.860> did<00:04:36.069> was<00:04:36.220> for<00:04:36.250> my<00:04:36.610> mold<00:04:37.120> I

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:38.069 
route and what I did was for my mold I

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:43.290 
route and what I did was for my mold I
made<00:04:39.069> it<00:04:39.220> out<00:04:39.370> of<00:04:40.020> quarter-inch<00:04:41.020> plywood<00:04:42.300> yeah

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
made it out of quarter-inch plywood yeah

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.300 
made it out of quarter-inch plywood yeah
I<00:04:43.479> I<00:04:43.569> sketched<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.139> bed<00:04:44.289> Routh<00:04:44.500> basic<00:04:44.889> outline

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
I I sketched the bed Routh basic outline

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.370 
I I sketched the bed Routh basic outline
on<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:46.180> block<00:04:46.479> of<00:04:46.690> wood<00:04:46.810> that<00:04:46.990> I<00:04:47.020> glued

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
on the block of wood that I glued

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.219 
on the block of wood that I glued
together<00:04:47.560> and<00:04:48.130> then<00:04:49.060> used<00:04:49.240> a<00:04:49.360> belt<00:04:49.539> sander<00:04:49.840> to

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
together and then used a belt sander to

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:55.620 
together and then used a belt sander to
sand<00:04:52.319> this<00:04:53.319> little<00:04:53.940> mold<00:04:54.940> or<00:04:55.210> this<00:04:55.360> little

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
sand this little mold or this little

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.900 
sand this little mold or this little
what<00:04:56.349> would<00:04:56.440> you<00:04:56.530> call<00:04:56.680> it<00:04:56.740> die<00:04:57.069> I<00:04:57.400> think<00:04:57.849> it

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
what would you call it die I think it

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.100 
what would you call it die I think it
says<00:04:58.030> I<00:04:58.120> think<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:58.360> correct<00:04:58.569> term<00:04:58.810> is<00:04:58.840> a<00:04:58.960> die

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
says I think the correct term is a die

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.010 
says I think the correct term is a die
for<00:05:02.110> making<00:05:02.409> the<00:05:02.500> mold<00:05:02.710> and<00:05:03.870> sanding<00:05:04.870> it<00:05:04.960> down

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
for making the mold and sanding it down

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.659 
for making the mold and sanding it down
to<00:05:05.289> the<00:05:05.380> way<00:05:05.500> I<00:05:05.530> wanted<00:05:06.039> to<00:05:06.220> to<00:05:06.370> the<00:05:06.460> size

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
to the way I wanted to to the size

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:07.950 
to the way I wanted to to the size
proportion<00:05:07.300> these<00:05:07.419> are<00:05:07.539> actually<00:05:07.810> two

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
proportion these are actually two

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.990 
proportion these are actually two
separate<00:05:08.380> pieces<00:05:08.620> so<00:05:09.039> I<00:05:09.069> just<00:05:09.340> glued<00:05:09.550> once<00:05:09.880> I

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
separate pieces so I just glued once I

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.700 
separate pieces so I just glued once I
had<00:05:10.150> this<00:05:10.330> sanded<00:05:10.780> to<00:05:10.810> the<00:05:10.960> right<00:05:11.110> size<00:05:11.380> and

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
had this sanded to the right size and

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.350 
had this sanded to the right size and
this<00:05:11.800> sanded<00:05:12.190> the<00:05:12.280> right<00:05:12.490> size<00:05:12.729> I<00:05:12.759> just<00:05:13.120> glued

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
this sanded the right size I just glued

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.550 
this sanded the right size I just glued
one<00:05:13.810> on<00:05:13.990> top<00:05:14.169> of<00:05:14.349> the<00:05:14.409> other<00:05:14.620> and<00:05:15.330> then<00:05:16.530> what<00:05:17.530> I

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
one on top of the other and then what I

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.390 
one on top of the other and then what I
did<00:05:17.740> next<00:05:17.889> was<00:05:18.360> take<00:05:19.360> a<00:05:19.389> little<00:05:19.630> water<00:05:19.900> and<00:05:20.400> run

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
did next was take a little water and run

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.960 
did next was take a little water and run
it<00:05:21.550> over<00:05:22.199> the<00:05:23.199> side<00:05:23.440> to<00:05:24.099> raise<00:05:24.520> the<00:05:24.759> grain

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
it over the side to raise the grain

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.909 
it over the side to raise the grain
because<00:05:25.300> I<00:05:25.330> wanted<00:05:25.659> to<00:05:25.810> get<00:05:25.990> the<00:05:26.229> effect<00:05:26.770> on

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
because I wanted to get the effect on

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.790 
because I wanted to get the effect on
the<00:05:27.009> bridge<00:05:27.220> pier<00:05:27.580> that<00:05:27.909> it<00:05:28.030> was<00:05:28.409> cast<00:05:29.409> in<00:05:29.680> a

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
the bridge pier that it was cast in a

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.950 
the bridge pier that it was cast in a
wood<00:05:30.190> form<00:05:30.639> and<00:05:31.000> to<00:05:31.360> get<00:05:31.509> the<00:05:31.690> kind<00:05:31.840> of

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
wood form and to get the kind of

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.080 
wood form and to get the kind of
individual<00:05:32.560> board<00:05:33.250> effects<00:05:33.580> what<00:05:33.789> it<00:05:33.880> is<00:05:33.969> I

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
individual board effects what it is I

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.360 
individual board effects what it is I
rubbed<00:05:35.050> some<00:05:35.199> water<00:05:35.469> over<00:05:35.770> this<00:05:35.889> it<00:05:36.159> raised

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
rubbed some water over this it raised

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.149 
rubbed some water over this it raised
the<00:05:36.520> grain<00:05:36.789> and<00:05:37.120> then<00:05:37.270> I<00:05:37.419> after<00:05:38.409> dried<00:05:38.710> I

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
the grain and then I after dried I

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:40.860 
the grain and then I after dried I
sealed<00:05:39.729> it<00:05:39.849> off<00:05:39.969> with<00:05:40.210> a<00:05:40.240> couple<00:05:40.449> of<00:05:40.630> thin

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
sealed it off with a couple of thin

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.430 
sealed it off with a couple of thin
coats<00:05:41.139> of<00:05:41.409> I<00:05:41.860> think<00:05:42.370> was<00:05:42.490> urethane<00:05:43.259> just<00:05:44.259> so

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
coats of I think was urethane just so

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.140 
coats of I think was urethane just so
when<00:05:45.099> I<00:05:45.130> actually<00:05:45.449> put<00:05:46.449> the<00:05:47.380> rubber<00:05:48.150> silicon

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
when I actually put the rubber silicon

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.909 
when I actually put the rubber silicon
rubber<00:05:49.240> around<00:05:49.630> it<00:05:49.930> and<00:05:50.199> the<00:05:50.289> gauze<00:05:50.500> it

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
rubber around it and the gauze it

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:52.620 
rubber around it and the gauze it
wouldn't<00:05:51.190> soak<00:05:51.400> up<00:05:51.580> even<00:05:51.789> more<00:05:51.969> liquid<00:05:52.449> and

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
wouldn't soak up even more liquid and

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.390 
wouldn't soak up even more liquid and
get<00:05:52.930> too<00:05:54.240> too<00:05:55.240> grainy<00:05:55.539> so<00:05:55.930> to<00:05:55.990> speak<00:05:56.310> so<00:05:57.310> that

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
get too too grainy so to speak so that

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.559 
get too too grainy so to speak so that
it<00:05:57.490> wouldn't<00:05:57.639> warp<00:05:57.909> or<00:05:58.060> anything<00:05:58.270> like<00:05:58.509> that

00:05:58.559 --> 00:05:58.569 
it wouldn't warp or anything like that

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:00.209 
it wouldn't warp or anything like that
so<00:05:59.020> I<00:05:59.050> kind<00:05:59.319> of<00:05:59.349> put<00:05:59.560> that<00:05:59.740> around<00:05:59.830> there<00:06:00.159> to

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:00.219 
so I kind of put that around there to

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:03.709 
so I kind of put that around there to
protect<00:06:00.370> it<00:06:00.759> so<00:06:01.319> what<00:06:02.319> I<00:06:02.349> end<00:06:02.620> up<00:06:02.800> with<00:06:02.860> after<00:06:03.460> I

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:03.719 
protect it so what I end up with after I

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:10.520 
protect it so what I end up with after I
cast<00:06:04.719> it<00:06:04.990> is<00:06:05.849> this<00:06:06.849> and<00:06:07.650> as<00:06:08.650> you<00:06:08.710> can<00:06:08.919> see<00:06:09.069> the

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
cast it is this and as you can see the

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.339 
cast it is this and as you can see the
plywood<00:06:11.530> creates<00:06:11.889> a<00:06:12.039> nice<00:06:12.599> wood<00:06:13.599> grain<00:06:13.870> effect

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:14.349 
plywood creates a nice wood grain effect

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:19.620 
plywood creates a nice wood grain effect
as<00:06:14.830> though<00:06:15.039> this<00:06:15.340> had<00:06:15.520> been<00:06:18.449> created<00:06:19.449> using

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
as though this had been created using

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.860 
as though this had been created using
actual<00:06:20.319> wood<00:06:21.310> forms<00:06:21.849> so<00:06:22.210> that<00:06:22.449> was<00:06:22.569> the<00:06:22.690> kind

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
actual wood forms so that was the kind

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.370 
actual wood forms so that was the kind
of<00:06:22.930> effect<00:06:23.319> I<00:06:23.469> wanted<00:06:23.919> on<00:06:24.130> here<00:06:24.669> and<00:06:25.349> what<00:06:26.349> I

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
of effect I wanted on here and what I

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.950 
of effect I wanted on here and what I
did<00:06:26.650> was<00:06:26.830> it<00:06:27.009> made<00:06:27.039> it<00:06:27.490> oversize<00:06:28.210> so<00:06:28.690> I<00:06:28.719> have

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
did was it made it oversize so I have

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.350 
did was it made it oversize so I have
the<00:06:29.080> option<00:06:29.500> of<00:06:29.650> adjusting<00:06:30.190> the<00:06:30.610> height<00:06:30.880> by

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
the option of adjusting the height by

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.180 
the option of adjusting the height by
other<00:06:31.599> cutting<00:06:31.900> int<00:06:32.139> or<00:06:32.380> sanding<00:06:32.860> it<00:06:32.949> down<00:06:32.979> i

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
other cutting int or sanding it down i

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.279 
other cutting int or sanding it down i
shaking<00:06:33.880> it<00:06:34.090> off<00:06:34.210> the<00:06:34.389> top<00:06:34.599> or<00:06:34.810> taking<00:06:35.080> it<00:06:35.169> off

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:35.289 
shaking it off the top or taking it off

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:37.320 
shaking it off the top or taking it off
the<00:06:35.320> bottom<00:06:35.620> so<00:06:36.099> as<00:06:36.370> you<00:06:36.940> can<00:06:37.029> see<00:06:37.210> the

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
the bottom so as you can see the

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.909 
the bottom so as you can see the
difference<00:06:37.659> in<00:06:37.810> size<00:06:37.990> and<00:06:38.380> how<00:06:38.469> much<00:06:38.650> I<00:06:38.770> had<00:06:38.889> to

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 
difference in size and how much I had to

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:40.209 
difference in size and how much I had to
take<00:06:39.190> off

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:40.219 
take off

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:44.989 
take off
to<00:06:41.219> get<00:06:41.400> it<00:06:41.520> right<00:06:41.699> and<00:06:42.199> this<00:06:43.729> little<00:06:44.729> mold

00:06:44.989 --> 00:06:44.999 
to get it right and this little mold

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:46.969 
to get it right and this little mold
turned<00:06:45.569> out<00:06:45.689> to<00:06:45.810> be<00:06:45.900> a<00:06:45.930> bit<00:06:46.139> tricky<00:06:46.469> to<00:06:46.650> deal

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 
turned out to be a bit tricky to deal

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:50.869 
turned out to be a bit tricky to deal
with<00:06:47.249> I<00:06:47.490> found<00:06:47.819> that<00:06:48.180> if<00:06:48.840> I<00:06:49.469> tried<00:06:50.039> filling<00:06:50.610> it

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:50.879 
with I found that if I tried filling it

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:52.879 
with I found that if I tried filling it
with<00:06:50.909> plaster<00:06:51.629> and<00:06:51.870> left<00:06:52.080> unsupported<00:06:52.770> it

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:52.889 
with plaster and left unsupported it

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:09.689 
came up with an idea to give this mold

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:12.710 
came up with an idea to give this mold
some<00:07:10.229> support
