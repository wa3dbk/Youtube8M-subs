to<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.760> wise<00:01:27.910> is<00:01:28.240> you<00:01:28.510> need<00:01:28.720> to<00:01:28.810> be<00:01:28.900> careful

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
to the wise is you need to be careful

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.740 
to the wise is you need to be careful
with<00:01:29.650> how<00:01:29.770> much<00:01:29.830> auditing<00:01:30.430> you<00:01:30.550> do<00:01:30.750> because

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
with how much auditing you do because

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.420 
with how much auditing you do because
the<00:01:31.990> auditing<00:01:32.470> can<00:01:32.620> pile<00:01:32.770> up<00:01:32.800> very<00:01:33.130> quickly

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
the auditing can pile up very quickly

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.400 
the auditing can pile up very quickly
and<00:01:33.880> you<00:01:34.660> don't<00:01:34.780> want<00:01:34.900> to<00:01:34.960> wade<00:01:35.110> through<00:01:35.140> a

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
and you don't want to wade through a

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.900 
and you don't want to wade through a
bunch<00:01:35.620> of<00:01:35.740> logs<00:01:35.950> looking<00:01:36.400> for<00:01:36.580> the<00:01:36.730> one

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
bunch of logs looking for the one

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.110 
bunch of logs looking for the one
specific<00:01:37.420> event<00:01:37.720> that<00:01:37.840> you<00:01:38.050> want<00:01:38.200> to<00:01:38.260> do<00:01:38.350> it<00:01:38.440> on

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
specific event that you want to do it on

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.580 
specific event that you want to do it on
so<00:01:40.230> don't<00:01:41.230> do<00:01:41.440> it<00:01:41.470> domain<00:01:41.920> wide<00:01:43.410> unless<00:01:44.410> it's

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
so don't do it domain wide unless it's

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.320 
so don't do it domain wide unless it's
absolutely<00:01:44.770> necessary<00:01:45.190> unless<00:01:46.060> it's

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
absolutely necessary unless it's

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.290 
absolutely necessary unless it's
absolutely<00:01:46.479> necessary<00:01:47.790> then<00:01:48.790> you<00:01:48.910> can<00:01:49.030> do<00:01:49.150> it

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
absolutely necessary then you can do it

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.420 
absolutely necessary then you can do it
if<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:52.210> better<00:01:52.479> to<00:01:52.690> create<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:53.050> know<00:01:53.410> you<00:01:53.470> with

if it's better to create a know you with

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.370 
if it's better to create a know you with

are<00:05:20.259> several<00:05:20.470> here<00:05:21.750> generally<00:05:22.750> two<00:05:22.930> for<00:05:23.199> each

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
are several here generally two for each

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.409 
are several here generally two for each
one<00:05:23.500> that<00:05:23.620> I<00:05:23.680> logged<00:05:23.889> in<00:05:24.069> or<00:05:24.430> tried<00:05:24.909> to<00:05:25.150> and

then<00:05:26.110> there's<00:05:26.349> the<00:05:26.879> success<00:05:30.569> usually<00:05:31.569> I<00:05:31.599> think

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:31.719 
then there's the success usually I think

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:40.830 
then there's the success usually I think
that's<00:05:32.940> something<00:05:33.940> else
