00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:07.849 
actually growing a lot better than the

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.190 
actually growing a lot better than the
Basil's<00:00:08.849> that<00:00:09.030> were<00:00:09.210> sown<00:00:09.510> at<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.780> same<00:00:09.960> time

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
growing outside in soil you can see how

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.839 
growing outside in soil you can see how
well<00:00:13.019> it's<00:00:13.170> doing<00:00:13.320> slight<00:00:13.769> modification<00:00:14.610> this

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849

was the original system the cup was a
little<00:00:18.119> too<00:00:18.240> flimsy<00:00:18.539> for<00:00:18.930> my<00:00:19.250> preference<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:21.090> I

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
little too flimsy for my preference so I

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.040 
little too flimsy for my preference so I

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
moved to a care jar setup it's really

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.019 
moved to a care jar setup it's really

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
care jar the glass jars a lot heavier so

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.529 
care jar the glass jars a lot heavier so
it<00:00:58.399> withstands<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.460> lot<00:00:59.609> more<00:00:59.789> tossing<00:01:00.420> and

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
it withstands a lot more tossing and

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.410 
it withstands a lot more tossing and
turning<00:01:01.129> this<00:01:02.129> one<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.609> knocked<00:01:02.879> over<00:01:03.000> at<00:01:03.239> least

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
turning this one I knocked over at least

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.719 
turning this one I knocked over at least
three<00:01:03.750> times<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.769> know<00:01:04.890> playing<00:01:05.610> around

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
three times this you know playing around

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.750 
three times this you know playing around
with<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.860> basil<00:01:07.860> plant<00:01:08.100> while<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.340> was<00:01:08.430> drawing

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
with the basil plant while I was drawing

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.429 
with the basil plant while I was drawing
and<00:01:09.000> got<00:01:09.299> really<00:01:09.570> frustrating<00:01:10.170> when<00:01:10.290> these

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
and got really frustrating when these

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.880 
and got really frustrating when these
little<00:01:11.450> clay<00:01:12.450> beads<00:01:12.840> started<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.799> know

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
little clay beads started you know

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.789 
little clay beads started you know
scattering<00:01:14.790> across<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.240> floor<00:01:15.540> anyway<00:01:16.470> our

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
scattering across the floor anyway our

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.390 
scattering across the floor anyway our
same<00:01:17.009> air<00:01:17.189> pump<00:01:17.460> same<00:01:18.119> air<00:01:18.299> pump<00:01:19.159> connected<00:01:20.159> to

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
same air pump same air pump connected to

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.210 
same air pump same air pump connected to
a<00:01:20.780> reservoir<00:01:21.780> nutrient<00:01:22.590> reservoir<00:01:22.710> that's

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
a reservoir nutrient reservoir that's

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.460 
a reservoir nutrient reservoir that's
underneath<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:24.180> countertop<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.320> can

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
underneath the countertop so it can

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.090 
underneath the countertop so it can
drain<00:01:25.740> better<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.869> right<00:01:27.869> now<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.710> system's

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
drain better and right now the system's

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.219 
drain better and right now the system's
percolating<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.880> left<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.329> little<00:01:30.659> window<00:01:30.990> so

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
percolating I left this little window so

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.819 
percolating I left this little window so
we<00:01:31.320> can<00:01:31.350> see<00:01:31.500> what's<00:01:31.860> going<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:33.170> inside<00:01:34.170> and

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
we can see what's going on inside and

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.190 
we can see what's going on inside and
also<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.640> check<00:01:35.850> my<00:01:35.880> water<00:01:36.270> levels<00:01:36.750> to

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
also so I can check my water levels to

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.039 
also so I can check my water levels to
make<00:01:37.320> sure<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:38.159> it's<00:01:39.119> going<00:01:39.420> up<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.930> root

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
make sure that it's going up to the root

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.060 
make sure that it's going up to the root
cup<00:01:40.729> so<00:01:41.729> here<00:01:42.570> we<00:01:42.720> are<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:43.140> think<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.860> about

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
cup so here we are I think this is about

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.359 
cup so here we are I think this is about
the<00:01:44.250> fourth<00:01:44.490> week<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.950> we'll<00:01:46.950> update<00:01:47.100> this

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
the fourth week and we'll update this

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.600 
the fourth week and we'll update this
video<00:01:47.700> as<00:01:47.909> we<00:01:48.149> need<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:49.040> hopefully<00:01:50.040> next<00:01:50.490> time

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
video as we need to hopefully next time

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.469 
video as we need to hopefully next time
you<00:01:50.759> see<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.060> basil<00:01:51.600> plant<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.990> will<00:01:52.170> be<00:01:53.479> up

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
you see this basil plant it will be up

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.459 
you see this basil plant it will be up
to<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.100> window<00:01:56.100> at<00:01:56.460> least<00:01:57.049> okay<00:01:58.049> see<00:01:58.409> you

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
to that window at least okay see you

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.710 
to that window at least okay see you
later
