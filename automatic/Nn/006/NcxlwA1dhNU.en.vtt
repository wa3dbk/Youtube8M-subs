just<00:00:37.980> expose<00:00:38.390> the<00:00:39.390> entire<00:00:39.629> system<00:00:39.809> became

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
just expose the entire system became

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.410 
just expose the entire system became
fully<00:00:40.829> automatic<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.610> doesn't<00:00:41.969> require<00:00:42.120> any

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
fully automatic and doesn't require any

generate<00:00:47.309> Dark<00:00:47.879> Matter<00:00:48.090> automatically<00:00:48.780> and

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
generate Dark Matter automatically and

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.850 
generate Dark Matter automatically and
efficiently<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.600> why<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:52.079> because

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
efficiently and why is that is because

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.400 
efficiently and why is that is because
of<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.160> new<00:00:53.340> supplier<00:00:54.120> pipe<00:00:54.449> he<00:00:54.750> added<00:00:54.870> into

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
of the new supplier pipe he added into

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.260 
of the new supplier pipe he added into
the<00:00:56.059> big<00:00:57.059> game<00:00:57.239> what<00:00:57.960> does<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> flarup<00:00:58.500> I'm<00:00:58.680> does

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
the big game what does a flarup I'm does

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.270 
the big game what does a flarup I'm does
is<00:01:00.270> if<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.690> connect<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.050> chest<00:01:01.590> or<00:01:01.920> basically

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
is if you connect to chest or basically

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.759 
is if you connect to chest or basically
any<00:01:02.460> inventory<00:01:02.699> like<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.719> get<00:01:04.049> here<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.589> my

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
any inventory like I get here to my

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.440 
any inventory like I get here to my
chest<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:07.400> you<00:01:08.400> will<00:01:08.610> interact<00:01:08.820> with<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.240> with

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
chest and you will interact with it with

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.179 
chest and you will interact with it with
a<00:01:09.479> wrench<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:10.740> basically<00:01:10.950> can<00:01:11.990> get<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.920> new

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
a wrench you basically can get this new

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.810 
a wrench you basically can get this new
gy<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.680> items<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.799> keep<00:01:16.950> stopped<00:01:17.250> what<00:01:17.640> it

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
gy and items to keep stopped what it

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.660 
gy and items to keep stopped what it
does<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.450> basically<00:01:18.869> telling<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:20.250> no<00:01:20.520> matter

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
does is basically telling that no matter

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.440 
does is basically telling that no matter
what<00:01:20.909> at<00:01:21.119> all<00:01:21.240> times<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.900> want<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.159> at<00:01:23.400> least

the system is routed to using a provider
pipes<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:44.280> system<00:01:44.790> basically<00:01:45.000> will

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
pipes the system basically will

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.260 
pipes the system basically will
automatically<00:01:46.079> every<00:01:46.829> five<00:01:47.220> seconds<00:01:47.700> once

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
automatically every five seconds once

automatically every five seconds once
every<00:01:48.509> five<00:01:48.659> seconds<00:01:49.049> we'll<00:01:49.290> ask<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.189> entire

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
every five seconds we'll ask the entire

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.940 
every five seconds we'll ask the entire
system<00:01:50.759> quit<00:01:51.210> first<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.290> will<00:01:52.439> check<00:01:52.649> if<00:01:52.799> this

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
system quit first it will check if this

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.730 
system quit first it will check if this
computer<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:53.820> lacking<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.479> required<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.590> if

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
computer is lacking is required and if

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.850 
computer is lacking is required and if
it<00:01:55.890> does<00:01:56.040> do<00:01:56.490> quest<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.649> reciting<00:01:58.649> from<00:01:58.799> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
it does do quest and reciting from the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.330 
it does do quest and reciting from the
system<00:01:59.310> so<00:02:00.119> what<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.049> live<00:02:01.350> here<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.829> told<00:02:02.189> them

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
damage that are being transmuted into

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.630 
damage that are being transmuted into
dark<00:02:45.110> matter<00:02:45.350> are<00:02:45.740> connected<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.370> its<00:02:46.520> a

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
dark matter are connected to its a

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.720 
dark matter are connected to its a
firefight<00:02:47.560> supplying<00:02:48.560> always<00:02:49.130> at<00:02:49.310> least<00:02:49.459> five

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
firefight supplying always at least five

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.050 
firefight supplying always at least five
damage<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.270> chest<00:02:50.570> and<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:52.640> rest<00:02:52.820> of<00:02:52.970> the

damage to the chest and the rest of the

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.240 
damage to the chest and the rest of the
diamonds<00:02:53.510> are<00:02:53.690> going<00:02:54.140> down<00:02:54.380> here<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:55.070> another

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
diamonds are going down here to another

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.300 
diamonds are going down here to another
supply<00:02:55.730> pipe<00:02:56.260> basically<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.800> one<00:02:57.950> connected

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
supply pipe basically the one connected

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.510 
supply pipe basically the one connected
to<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.550> relay<00:02:59.000> which<00:02:59.180> burns<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.780> dance<00:02:59.989> down

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
to the relay which burns the dance down

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.430 
to the relay which burns the dance down
which<00:03:01.520> demand<00:03:01.940> at<00:03:02.060> least<00:03:02.300> six<00:03:02.720> damage<00:03:02.989> the

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
which demand at least six damage the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.680 
which demand at least six damage the
entire<00:03:03.680> time<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.850> difference<00:03:05.209> between<00:03:05.360> the

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
entire time the difference between the

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.740 
entire time the difference between the
two<00:03:05.810> pipes<00:03:06.080> is<00:03:06.550> intentional<00:03:07.550> because<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.630> way

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
two pipes is intentional because the way

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.620 
two pipes is intentional because the way
supply<00:03:09.110> pipes<00:03:09.410> work<00:03:09.770> is<00:03:10.300> they<00:03:11.300> will<00:03:11.420> only

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
supply pipes work is they will only

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.300 
supply pipes work is they will only
requesting<00:03:12.350> vettori<00:03:12.709> they're<00:03:12.890> connected<00:03:13.280> to

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
requesting vettori they're connected to

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.100 
requesting vettori they're connected to
whenever<00:03:13.730> they<00:03:14.000> can<00:03:14.150> supply<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.540> type<00:03:14.840> thing

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
whenever they can supply the type thing

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.830 
whenever they can supply the type thing
so<00:03:15.730> it's<00:03:16.730> more<00:03:16.910> important<00:03:17.360> that<00:03:17.390> you'll<00:03:17.690> have

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
so it's more important that you'll have

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.300 
so it's more important that you'll have
an<00:03:17.989> epidemic<00:03:18.410> difference<00:03:18.769> with<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.160> knee

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
an epidemic difference with the knee

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.550 
an epidemic difference with the knee
that<00:03:19.580> you<00:03:19.790> then<00:03:20.209> you<00:03:20.360> being<00:03:20.750> damaged<00:03:21.410> it

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
that you then you being damaged it

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.840 
that you then you being damaged it
you're<00:03:21.709> burning<00:03:22.070> interview<00:03:22.519> so<00:03:23.000> this<00:03:23.630> way

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
you're burning interview so this way

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.810 
you're burning interview so this way
everything<00:03:25.850> is<00:03:26.000> being<00:03:26.320> stopped<00:03:27.320> all<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.340> time

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
everything is being stopped all the time

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.039 
everything is being stopped all the time
and<00:03:29.110> basically<00:03:30.110> it's<00:03:31.030> self<00:03:32.030> sufficient<00:03:32.870> and

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
and basically it's self sufficient and

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.730 
and basically it's self sufficient and
that's<00:03:33.980> it<00:03:34.100> Thank<00:03:34.310> You<00:03:34.400> time
