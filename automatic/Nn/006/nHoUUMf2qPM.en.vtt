00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 I originally had podcast alex 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.529
 started to talk about topics that 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.410
 lying on my soul and I think 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.059
 that I'm best so personally with you 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.420
 I can talk about that 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.820
 feel that I am with one of my 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.800
 best friends under two eyes 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.310
 of course this is not the language 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.189
 case 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.519
 Of course, more than a pair of eyes looks 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.640
 Just to me but I believe if 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.009
 I this such a tight then you will 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.829
 We should have been honest and we were down in 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.989
 who can write comments 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.879
 what you say about this topic the first one 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.360
 theme what I am now new podcast 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.370
 i want to cut alex is stress 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.270
 you probably already have it in 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.660
 read the title and you have this topic 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.760
 I consciously choose myself if one 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.770
 person who gets stressed out very quickly 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.390
 I find it is currently very difficult 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.469
 to talk about it because I do not know if 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.870
 I can already talk about it and may 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.450
 that's why my stress level is currently so 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.040
 is high 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:14.490
 but it can be said that much 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.700
 I can tell you that every day 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.320
 Feel this stress and that's why 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.020
 of course my skin underneath 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.580
 that has probably suffered too 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:30.720
 cause that I was sick so often 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.850
 and that my body someday all 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.720
 Warning signals he could only sent 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.280
 has that I have to change something what would have 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.200
 you made, of course, you would have 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.020
 At first ignored it would have thought okay 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.640
 good but completely honest, what would you have 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.030
 what did you do? 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.280
 I'm interested in that, I'll tell you now 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.640
 just what I did without 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.320
 first to name what happened or 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.890
 what still happens changes 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:03.630
 Of course I tried that 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.880
 tries with the situation itself differently 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.929
 tried to handle 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.000
 we say one interest and co everything 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.930
 to provide first in the background 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.519
 so that this problem can be solved 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.540
 I went to an open conversation and it 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.930
 nothing has changed 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.760
 it will not change that became me 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.830
 to be aware of the feeling nobody has 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.630
 in this situation with an over 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.670
 this problem can talk 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:41.250
 that is extremely crushing and 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.790
 pull down so I in recent times 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.610
 have also made less youtube videos 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.599
 just because I enjoy everything 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.310
 has passed 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:56.730
 I've started everything now 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:00.959
 change the situation completely 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.510
 if stress levels are as low as it gets 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.700
 hold and we have several 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.340
 things helped the first i got in 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.930
 my favorites showed that was a 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.390
 I can do this book here once 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.430
 link quickly 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.819
 this is manufacturer wars the woman is 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:21.540
 incredibly strong and has me 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:25.739
 Unbelievable with the problem helped me 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:28.170
 again lust and motivation a bit 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.600
 breathe in action 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.870
 I missed that a lot and I have 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.459
 An app loaded on my phone 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.790
 this is almost autogenic training 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:42.269
 means head pace means breathe easy 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.370
 make a good start feel good 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.139
 to do yoga I started myself 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.799
 to exchange with people and I have 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:51.630
 started small steps to go around 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:55.500
 my situation and a stress level too 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.239
 which will probably change everything someday 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.010
 will come again really want 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.799
 I just say with this podcast that you 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.799
 your stress level thus keeping rich else 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.810
 how it goes 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:11.489
 you are the most important thing that must be me 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:14.280
 be aware and you have every you 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.560
 day in the head call no matter how full yours 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.670
 head is write it down writes down 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.770
 a sheet of paper 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.210
 Relax in the head for ten minutes 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:26.050
 the work can be over 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:30.370
 the work can lie first if you 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:35.890
 happy with him and you are happy 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:38.920
 well then everything is great if that 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:43.480
 not the case, you have to change that 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:46.210
 and that is my contribution to the topic 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.790
 Stress minimizes the Ketscher rest 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.050
 trying to ask you why am I doing 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.860
 me just such a stress 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:57.190
 This is absolutely unnecessary because stress is 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:01.600
 absolutely unnecessary and I have the 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:04.240
 have to learn last months and that 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.780
 I also try to help you on the way 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.900
 give 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.690
 yes then I just really only 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.610
 accept 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.990
 Write me another comment what you 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.360
 maybe you still have some of that 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.490
 ask me and I'm looking forward to it 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.260
 the next podcast with you 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.670
 however, and until then 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.050
