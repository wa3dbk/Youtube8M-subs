00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.429
 upset and there is the man who can 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.430
 out that Van Mieghem 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:30.800
 van liessum with first action 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.800
 good sides of telstar 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:49.070

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.070
 violation was made on sariro 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.940
 denswil and pig fisherman not immediately 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.260
 tight but that was allowed because of the 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.260
 rest no young ajax is around 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.580
 veltman not this is like the shot 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.580
 from buzzy 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.990

 and kicking the thing from 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.410
 pig fishermen may still be disappointed 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:35.060
 but at least it is the bar and 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:37.720
 so no hit for how they post 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.720
 with some space 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.840

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.270

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:48.990
 so a is free so get started and lucas 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.530

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.530
 lesly de sa 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.180

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:15.050
 van cillessen cat then and then the shot 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.050
 from the second line of kevin van essen 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:32.220
 here combination with different and how they 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:36.530
 stood at the base of the 2nd savrij 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:40.220
 lesly de sa itself or for giving classes 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.220
 resit via the saab 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.040

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.040
 between 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.280
 but telstar is under threat 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.150
 be walked by the boy vanguard 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.150
 of the Amsterdammers 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.210
 veltman can display the entire field again 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.860
 crossing all what a nice action but 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.780
 then that ball is just a bit too far from the 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.730
 jumped but what an action 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.850
 this right central defender of 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.850
 Ajax 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.360
 this is a roadie take on from it 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.090
 koeman on the outside is different and 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.410
 he makes his third this tonight 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.410
 he tells him how they how 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.800
 not he should do more 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.590
 Classes differently and how they walk yes that is 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.330
 a good ball no offside 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.330
 danny covers danny covers no 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.669

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:57.139
 the bar and ball high over 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.139
 and this one too could have liked the best 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.249
 Young Ajax wins the first match in the 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:04.310
