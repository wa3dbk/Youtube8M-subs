that we made it stuck so grab this and
then<00:01:55.680> we'll<00:01:55.770> test<00:01:56.070> out<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:56.969> sort<00:01:57.240> of

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
then we'll test out this this is sort of

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.230

place I don't need am off that just not

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.349 
place I don't need am off that just not
if<00:02:32.069> that<00:02:32.099> idea<00:02:32.579> of<00:02:32.609> any<00:02:32.819> arm<00:02:32.909> up<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.180> that's

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
if that idea of any arm up and that's

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.449 
if that idea of any arm up and that's
the<00:02:33.450> way<00:02:33.659> so<00:02:34.200> maybe<00:02:34.319> that's<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.829> bit<00:02:35.040> book<00:02:35.310> I'm

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
the way so maybe that's a bit book I'm

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.339 
the way so maybe that's a bit book I'm
not<00:02:35.609> really<00:02:35.790> sure<00:02:35.879> so<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.659> was<00:02:36.780> similar<00:02:37.019> to<00:02:37.200> the

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
not really sure so it was similar to the

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.099 
not really sure so it was similar to the
lapis<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.799> recharge<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:38.760> then<00:02:38.959> let<00:02:39.959> them

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
lapis you recharge it and then let them

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:41.869 
lapis you recharge it and then let them
it's<00:02:40.260> away<00:02:40.500> where<00:02:40.829> is<00:02:40.889> it<00:02:41.010> or<00:02:41.129> get<00:02:41.489> right<00:02:41.669> I've

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
it's away where is it or get right I've

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.520 
it's away where is it or get right I've
got<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.299> work<00:02:42.450> somewhere<00:02:42.930> but<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.319> weren't

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
got it to work somewhere but you weren't

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.140 
got it to work somewhere but you weren't
working<00:02:43.950> now<00:02:44.159> right<00:02:44.459> so<00:02:44.669> you<00:02:44.760> can<00:02:44.849> see<00:02:44.999> it's

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
working now right so you can see it's

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.550 
working now right so you can see it's
like<00:02:45.269> sort<00:02:45.659> of<00:02:45.689> shake<00:02:45.989> it<00:02:46.139> in<00:02:46.230> my<00:02:46.290> hand<00:02:46.500> that

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
like sort of shake it in my hand that

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.890 
like sort of shake it in my hand that
means<00:02:46.859> it's<00:02:47.099> recharged<00:02:47.609> it<00:02:48.480> shut<00:02:48.719> like<00:02:48.750> a

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
means it's recharged it shut like a

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.959 
means it's recharged it shut like a
malden<00:02:49.290> shift<00:02:49.530> but<00:02:49.709> not<00:02:49.919> but<00:02:50.129> account<00:02:50.400> one

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:50.969 
malden shift but not but account one

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:53.240 
malden shift but not but account one
wrong<00:02:51.719> so<00:02:52.079> if<00:02:52.169> I<00:02:52.260> just<00:02:52.409> let<00:02:52.530> go<00:02:52.709> right<00:02:52.919> things

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
wrong so if I just let go right things

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.149 
wrong so if I just let go right things
that<00:02:53.489> will<00:02:53.639> fire<00:02:53.879> you<00:02:54.629> know<00:02:54.799> one<00:02:55.799> of<00:02:55.829> the<00:02:56.010> wrong

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
that will fire you know one of the wrong

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.099 
that will fire you know one of the wrong
flesh<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.639> think<00:02:56.849> it<00:02:56.969> depends<00:02:57.329> on<00:02:57.510> M&amp;E<00:02:57.959> you

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
flesh I think it depends on M&amp;E you

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.720 
flesh I think it depends on M&amp;E you
actually<00:02:58.469> have<00:02:58.709> in<00:02:58.919> your<00:02:59.040> inventory<00:02:59.549> not

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
really sure this works but I can I got

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.759 
really sure this works but I can I got
it<00:03:02.519> do<00:03:02.639> it<00:03:02.790> with<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.180> got<00:03:03.359> you<00:03:03.599> just<00:03:03.810> keep<00:03:04.590> that

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
clicking there we go right so it's

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.569 
clicking there we go right so it's
recharged<00:03:06.659> now<00:03:06.719> let<00:03:07.590> go<00:03:07.739> you<00:03:07.799> should<00:03:07.949> see<00:03:08.310> like

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:35.759 
one shot and you recharge it like this

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:38.659 
one shot and you recharge it like this
and<00:03:35.970> it's<00:03:36.239> pretty<00:03:36.870> epic<00:03:37.139> so<00:03:37.919> see<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.459> end

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669

and it's pretty epic so see the end
estoy<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.659> does<00:03:39.840> got<00:03:40.049> quite<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.500> long<00:03:40.799> way<00:03:40.979> just

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280

so probably just fire it anything for
you<00:03:47.220> just<00:03:47.479> watch<00:03:48.500> for<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.590> anyway<00:03:49.799> that's

these these ones so it crap this with a

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.510 
these these ones so it crap this with a
never<00:04:54.020> start<00:04:54.289> now<00:04:54.470> this<00:04:54.680> does<00:04:54.919> look<00:04:55.100> pretty
