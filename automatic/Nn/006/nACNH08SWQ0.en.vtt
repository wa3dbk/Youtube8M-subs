00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.170 
a big idea of making a costume and at
that<00:03:12.350> stage<00:03:12.470> my<00:03:12.800> brother<00:03:13.070> was<00:03:13.460> the<00:03:13.670> front<00:03:13.940> half

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
that stage my brother was the front half

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.910 
that stage my brother was the front half
and<00:03:14.360> I<00:03:14.390> was<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.630> back<00:03:14.810> half<00:03:15.020> which<00:03:15.380> was<00:03:15.620> good

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
and I was the back half which was good

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.910 
and I was the back half which was good
because<00:03:16.100> no<00:03:16.310> one<00:03:16.460> got<00:03:16.580> to<00:03:16.670> see<00:03:16.880> me<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:17.920> we've

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
because no one got to see me and we've

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.770 
because no one got to see me and we've
done<00:03:19.100> done<00:03:19.550> the<00:03:19.640> performance<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.300> it<00:03:20.360> was<00:03:20.540> it

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
done done the performance and it was it

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.500 
done done the performance and it was it
was<00:03:20.930> quite<00:03:21.200> popular<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:22.040> then<00:03:22.730> my<00:03:23.240> brother

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
was quite popular and then my brother

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.020 
was quite popular and then my brother
very<00:03:24.500> rudely<00:03:24.950> decided<00:03:25.580> to<00:03:25.640> move<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:25.910> America

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
very rudely decided to move to America

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.140 
very rudely decided to move to America
to<00:03:26.420> love<00:03:26.630> and<00:03:26.980> lift<00:03:27.980> me<00:03:28.160> to<00:03:28.459> be<00:03:28.580> the<00:03:28.700> front<00:03:28.940> half

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
to love and lift me to be the front half

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.760 
to love and lift me to be the front half
and<00:03:29.480> I've<00:03:29.990> been<00:03:30.140> through<00:03:30.290> a<00:03:30.320> few<00:03:30.470> different

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
and I've been through a few different

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.230 
and I've been through a few different
back<00:03:30.890> ends<00:03:31.070> since<00:03:31.280> then<00:03:31.520> it's<00:03:32.090> pretty

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
back ends since then it's pretty

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.699 
back ends since then it's pretty
unforgiving<00:03:32.630> task<00:03:33.020> I<00:03:33.200> don't<00:03:33.350> really<00:03:33.500> tend<00:03:33.650> to

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
unforgiving task I don't really tend to

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.300 
unforgiving task I don't really tend to
stick<00:03:33.950> around<00:03:34.420> so<00:03:35.420> it<00:03:36.010> became<00:03:37.010> a<00:03:37.070> lot<00:03:37.250> more

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
stick around so it became a lot more

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.800
