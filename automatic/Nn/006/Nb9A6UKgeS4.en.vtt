suffering through disaster after

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.609 
suffering through disaster after
disaster<00:00:14.549> here<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:16.970> Malaysia<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:19.320> control

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
disaster here and Malaysia is in control

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.170 
disaster here and Malaysia is in control
of<00:00:21.170> AirAsia<00:00:22.400> the<00:00:23.400> flight<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:24.029> now

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
of AirAsia the flight that is now

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.150 
of AirAsia the flight that is now
missing<00:00:25.460> now<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.849> think<00:00:27.750> it's<00:00:28.199> kind<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.800> odd

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
missing now I think it's kind of odd

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.190 
missing now I think it's kind of odd
that<00:00:31.309> right<00:00:32.309> exactly<00:00:32.940> as<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.480> whole<00:00:33.780> event

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
that right exactly as this whole event

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.610 
that right exactly as this whole event
happens<00:00:35.719> connected<00:00:36.719> back<00:00:36.960> once<00:00:37.260> again<00:00:37.440> to

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
happens connected back once again to

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.130 
happens connected back once again to
Malaysia<00:00:39.829> that<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.010> p.m.<00:00:41.460> just<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.719> happens

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
Malaysia that the p.m. just so happens

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:52.880 
Malaysia that the p.m. just so happens
to<00:00:43.230> be<00:00:43.320> golfing<00:00:44.070> with<00:00:45.059> Obama

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.780 

maybe<00:00:53.430> nothing<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:54.829> I<00:00:55.829> think<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.250> timing<00:00:56.520> is

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
maybe nothing but I think the timing is

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.850 
maybe nothing but I think the timing is
rather<00:00:57.030> odd<00:00:57.920> like<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.100> said<00:00:59.370> as<00:01:00.170> his<00:01:01.170> country<00:01:01.440> is

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
rather odd like I said as his country is

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:10.130 
rather odd like I said as his country is
absolutely<00:01:02.480> inundated<00:01:06.740> in<00:01:07.940> this<00:01:08.940> disaster<00:01:09.509> he

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
absolutely inundated in this disaster he

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.780 
absolutely inundated in this disaster he
is<00:01:10.229> sitting<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> golf<00:01:10.950> course<00:01:11.220> with

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
is sitting on the golf course with

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.850 
is sitting on the golf course with

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
Barack Obama he has since left and went

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.710 
Barack Obama he has since left and went
to<00:01:13.950> Malaysia<00:01:14.310> but<00:01:14.820> he<00:01:14.940> is<00:01:15.060> coming<00:01:15.360> under<00:01:15.690> fire

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
to Malaysia but he is coming under fire

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.600 
to Malaysia but he is coming under fire
because<00:01:16.140> as<00:01:16.560> all<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.550> went<00:01:17.850> down
