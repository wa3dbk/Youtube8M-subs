00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.600
 this is one of many new ones 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.080
 small cars that are here at the show 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.290
 paris the skoda fabia that inside 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.849
 especially to many components of 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.619
 upper category of the group 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.850
 volkswagen like golf 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.289
 tell us to see it here you see that 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.380
 that I told you these levers, for example 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.990
 are those that you also find on golf 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.260
 and then there's the new infotainment that 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.780
 it improves the standard we are at 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.880
 accustomed to this category of machines 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.190
 who continue to call themselves utilitarians 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.920
 but they have become cars that can 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.500
 really be used as one 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.590
 Auto excuse the repetition space 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.910
 there are also improved finishes 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.510
 they are a bit of rigid plastics 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.780
 but in short, the qualitative leap that 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.219
 they are doing these cars is remarkable 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.109
 all this talk 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.600
 in the small car that you can use 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.019
 always as you are behind enough 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.619
 well now I pulled back a little 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.189
 seat to undermine we say the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.780
 machine see your knees I'm there 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.600
 enough below there is plenty of room for 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.009
 feet and backrest is not too much 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.220
 vertical space that feeling 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.909
 so I would say that all that remains is to see the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.530
 trunk 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.390
 obviously you have already noticed that the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.540
 very particular green coloring 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.220
 skoda will not be the most sold however me 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.320
 liked to show you this 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.820
 particularity returning to serious things 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.060
 the trunk is very deep there 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.130
 this step but I believe there are 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.439
 of the optional ones to have the double 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.780
 flat then the flat bottom from 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.380
 mochetti of lining is good there is not 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.110
 here on the side however the compartment is 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.910
 large enough for a car 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.880
 who continue to define as small as 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.510
 they used to tell me about the style 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.890
 judge you very skoda squared 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.550
 modern elegant now family feeling e 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.530
 that of octavia the prices of the new 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.350
 fabia have not yet been defined 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.130
 but here at the show there is also the new one 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.320
 station wagon version you see are rare 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.970
 family members in this category 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.670
 so it might be interesting to 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.990
 who needs space but doesn't want to 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.990
 exaggerate with the external dimensions 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.760
 let's see then the trunk 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.820
 obviously it's even bigger 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:37.220
 regular compared to the sedan 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.220
 so if I need practicality 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.280
 this is one of the few small stations 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.120
 follow all the news on our 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.120
 special paris
