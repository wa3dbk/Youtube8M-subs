all<00:00:04.890> right<00:00:05.009> so<00:00:05.100> we're<00:00:05.190> going<00:00:05.279> to<00:00:05.339> talk<00:00:05.430> about

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
all right so we're going to talk about

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.220 
all right so we're going to talk about
adjusting<00:00:06.240> brakes<00:00:06.420> these<00:00:06.690> are<00:00:06.779> V<00:00:07.020> brakes

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
adjusting brakes these are V brakes

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.160 
adjusting brakes these are V brakes
these<00:00:08.220> are<00:00:08.309> pretty<00:00:08.429> common<00:00:08.639> on<00:00:08.820> either<00:00:09.750> hybrid

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
these are pretty common on either hybrid

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.660 
these are pretty common on either hybrid
bikes<00:00:10.500> city<00:00:11.250> bikes<00:00:11.429> or<00:00:12.290> mountain<00:00:13.290> bikes<00:00:13.670> but

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
bikes city bikes or mountain bikes but

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.099 
bikes city bikes or mountain bikes but
the<00:00:14.759> kind<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.030> concept<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.719> adjusting

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
the kind of the concept of adjusting

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.420 
the kind of the concept of adjusting
them<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.350> pretty<00:00:16.470> much<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.770> same<00:00:16.980> for<00:00:17.250> all<00:00:17.340> the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
them is pretty much the same for all the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.660 
them is pretty much the same for all the
other<00:00:17.520> brakes<00:00:17.789> too<00:00:18.779> minor<00:00:18.930> changes<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.369> lot

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
other brakes too minor changes so a lot

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.769 
other brakes too minor changes so a lot
of<00:00:20.730> people<00:00:20.880> have<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> lot<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.210> problems<00:00:21.510> with

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
of people have a lot of problems with

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.070 
of people have a lot of problems with
their<00:00:22.439> brakes<00:00:22.680> squeaking<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.720> that's<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.810> very

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
their brakes squeaking and that's a very

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.560 
their brakes squeaking and that's a very
easy<00:00:25.289> adjustment<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.490> fix<00:00:26.730> basically<00:00:27.480> what

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
easy adjustment to to fix basically what

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.150 
easy adjustment to to fix basically what
it<00:00:27.660> means<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.170> either<00:00:28.349> your<00:00:28.830> brakes<00:00:29.039> are

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
it means is either your brakes are

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.310 
it means is either your brakes are
pretty<00:00:29.310> worn<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.630> want<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.869> replace<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
pretty worn so you want to replace the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.709 
pretty worn so you want to replace the
pads<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.700> can<00:00:32.820> see<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.239> actual<00:00:33.360> pads

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
pads and you can see on the actual pads

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.319 
pads and you can see on the actual pads
that<00:00:34.350> there's<00:00:34.590> um<00:00:34.860> there's<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> wear<00:00:35.910> line<00:00:36.120> on

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
that there's um there's a wear line on

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.630 
that there's um there's a wear line on
most<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.780> them<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.530> if<00:00:37.649> it's<00:00:37.770> past<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.129> wear

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
most of them so if it's past the wear

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.700 
most of them so if it's past the wear
line<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:39.030> its<00:00:39.180> wearing<00:00:39.540> incorrectly<00:00:40.079> like<00:00:40.620> you

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
line of its wearing incorrectly like you

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.930 
line of its wearing incorrectly like you
can<00:00:40.829> actually<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> quick<00:00:41.820> release

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
can actually so this is a quick release

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.549 
can actually so this is a quick release
right<00:00:42.239> here<00:00:42.270> basically<00:00:42.960> going<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.140> push<00:00:43.350> these

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
right here basically going to push these

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.130 
right here basically going to push these
two<00:00:43.800> low<00:00:44.120> levers<00:00:45.120> together<00:00:45.390> push<00:00:45.840> down<00:00:46.110> on

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
two low levers together push down on

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.690 
two low levers together push down on
this<00:00:46.469> piece<00:00:46.680> right<00:00:46.829> here<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.190> open<00:00:47.520> them<00:00:47.610> up

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
this piece right here and open them up

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.910 
this piece right here and open them up
so<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.120> can<00:00:48.210> see<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.420> pads<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.899> see<00:00:49.800> how

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
so you can see the pads and see how

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.130 
so you can see the pads and see how
they're<00:00:50.070> worn<00:00:50.420> and<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.539> may<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:51.930> need<00:00:52.050> to

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
they're worn and you may just need to

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.090 
they're worn and you may just need to
replace<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.559> they're<00:00:52.739> pretty<00:00:52.920> inexpensive

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
replace and they're pretty inexpensive

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.840 
replace and they're pretty inexpensive
they<00:00:53.820> go<00:00:53.910> anywhere<00:00:54.210> from<00:00:54.379> four<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.850> fifteen

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
they go anywhere from four to fifteen

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.180 
they go anywhere from four to fifteen
dollars<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.420> pair<00:00:57.739> so<00:00:58.739> it's<00:00:58.829> definitely<00:00:59.070> worth

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
dollars a pair so it's definitely worth

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.770 
dollars a pair so it's definitely worth
replacing<00:00:59.550> them<00:00:59.879> it's<00:01:00.090> definitely<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.480> big

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
replacing them it's definitely a big

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.460 
replacing them it's definitely a big
safety<00:01:01.050> issue<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.760> correct<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.470> squeaking

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
safety issue so to correct the squeaking

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.039 
safety issue so to correct the squeaking
if<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.799> if<00:01:05.010> they<00:01:05.129> are<00:01:05.250> new<00:01:05.430> brakes<00:01:06.049> what

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
if it if they are new brakes what

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.750 
if it if they are new brakes what
basically<00:01:07.439> we<00:01:07.560> have<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.770> do<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.159> brakes<00:01:08.549> aren't

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
basically we have to do is brakes aren't

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.090 
basically we have to do is brakes aren't
meant<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.240> hit<00:01:09.600> completely<00:01:10.049> flat<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.590> a

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
meant to hit completely flat on a

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.190 
meant to hit completely flat on a
bicycle<00:01:11.340> rim<00:01:11.790> that's<00:01:12.600> what<00:01:12.810> creates<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
bicycle rim that's what creates the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.010 
bicycle rim that's what creates the
squealing<00:01:13.830> usually<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:15.450> basically<00:01:15.840> what

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
squealing usually so basically what

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.940 
squealing usually so basically what
you're<00:01:16.110> what<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.439> need<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.619> do<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.860> need

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
you're what you need to do is you need

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.859 
you're what you need to do is you need
to<00:01:17.009> tow<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> brakes<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:17.970> just<00:01:18.689> imagine

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
to tow in the brakes so just imagine

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.560 
to tow in the brakes so just imagine
like<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.580> squeaky<00:01:20.790> noise<00:01:21.060> comes<00:01:21.299> from

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
like if so the squeaky noise comes from

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.570 
like if so the squeaky noise comes from
when<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.869> brakes<00:01:22.020> hit<00:01:22.320> completely<00:01:22.770> flat<00:01:22.979> so

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
when the brakes hit completely flat so

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.280 
when the brakes hit completely flat so
toeing<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.210> basically<00:01:24.479> just<00:01:24.720> imagine<00:01:25.200> your

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
toeing in basically just imagine your

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.390 
toeing in basically just imagine your
toes<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.890> in

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
toes going in

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.340 
toes going in
so<00:01:27.060> basically<00:01:27.299> when<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.570> brake<00:01:27.750> hits<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.259> is

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
so basically when the brake hits this is

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.569 
so basically when the brake hits this is
very<00:01:28.530> dramatic<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:29.009> when<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.250> brake<00:01:29.400> hits

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
very dramatic but when the brake hits

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.510 
very dramatic but when the brake hits
the<00:01:30.180> one<00:01:30.329> side<00:01:30.590> hits<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.829> goes<00:01:31.979> down<00:01:32.189> and

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
the one side hits and goes down and

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.609 
the one side hits and goes down and
eventually<00:01:33.479> hits<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> whole<00:01:34.350> thing<00:01:34.500> they

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
eventually hits the whole thing they

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.420 
eventually hits the whole thing they
flex<00:01:35.299> so<00:01:36.439> you<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.560> kind<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.799> hear<00:01:37.979> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
flex so you can kind of hear the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.420 
flex so you can kind of hear the
squeaking<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.860> because<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.070> brake<00:01:41.220> pads

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
squeaking on this because the brake pads

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.109 
squeaking on this because the brake pads
are<00:01:41.579> completely

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.450 

are<00:01:45.630> completely<00:01:45.810> flat<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:47.039> basically<00:01:47.250> we're

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
are completely flat so basically we're

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.099 
are completely flat so basically we're
going<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.609> do<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.939> just<00:01:48.090> take<00:01:48.329> your<00:01:48.840> five

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:49.109 
going to do is you just take your five

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.300 
going to do is you just take your five
millimeter<00:01:49.649> allen<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:51.920> unscrew<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.130> break

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
millimeter allen and unscrew the break

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.889 
millimeter allen and unscrew the break
and<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:54.000> can<00:01:54.119> see<00:01:54.210> how<00:01:54.299> kind<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.539> shifts<00:01:54.810> all

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
and you can see how kind of shifts all

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.599 
and you can see how kind of shifts all
over<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.079> place<00:01:55.200> goes<00:01:55.350> up<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.649> down<00:01:55.710> side<00:01:56.579> to

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:56.609 
over the place goes up and down side to

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:59.330 
over the place goes up and down side to
side<00:01:56.759> all<00:01:57.270> over<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.479> place<00:01:58.069> basically<00:01:59.069> has<00:01:59.280> a

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
side all over the place basically has a

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.910 
side all over the place basically has a
bunch<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.670> it<00:02:00.000> basically<00:02:00.420> pivots<00:02:00.840> on<00:02:01.740> these

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
bunch of it basically pivots on these

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.800 
bunch of it basically pivots on these
washers<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:03.060> you're<00:02:03.240> going<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.390> toe<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:03.750> the

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
washers so you're going to toe in the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.240 
washers so you're going to toe in the
break<00:02:06.229> it<00:02:07.229> does<00:02:07.319> not<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.560> be<00:02:07.590> really<00:02:07.799> drastic

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
break it does not to be really drastic

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.130 
break it does not to be really drastic
it<00:02:08.310> doesn't<00:02:08.489> have<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.729> like<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.049> but<00:02:10.049> just

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
it doesn't have to be like that but just

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.900 
it doesn't have to be like that but just
you<00:02:10.319> know<00:02:10.349> just<00:02:11.190> just<00:02:11.489> enough<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:11.819> you're

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
you know just just enough so you're

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.640 
you know just just enough so you're
going<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.060> get<00:02:12.209> rid<00:02:12.299> of<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.420> squeaking<00:02:12.629> and<00:02:12.870> so

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
going to get rid of the squeaking and so

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.610 
going to get rid of the squeaking and so
that<00:02:13.769> it<00:02:13.860> breaks<00:02:13.980> properly<00:02:15.379> make<00:02:16.379> sure<00:02:16.500> it's

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
that it breaks properly make sure it's

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.039 
that it breaks properly make sure it's
hitting<00:02:16.799> the<00:02:16.980> rim<00:02:17.450> really<00:02:18.450> nice<00:02:18.599> so<00:02:18.810> basically

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
hitting the rim really nice so basically

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.229 
hitting the rim really nice so basically
make<00:02:19.260> sure<00:02:19.290> it's<00:02:19.500> nice<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.620> level<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.060> rim

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
make sure it's nice and level to the rim

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.270 
make sure it's nice and level to the rim
also<00:02:21.840> make<00:02:21.959> sure<00:02:22.049> it's<00:02:22.170> not<00:02:22.260> too<00:02:22.440> low<00:02:22.680> make

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
also make sure it's not too low make

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.559 
also make sure it's not too low make
sure<00:02:23.400> it's<00:02:23.489> not<00:02:23.549> too<00:02:23.700> high<00:02:23.849> if<00:02:24.030> it's<00:02:24.180> too<00:02:24.360> high

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
sure it's not too high if it's too high

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.069 
sure it's not too high if it's too high
it's<00:02:25.230> going<00:02:25.349> to<00:02:25.410> hit<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:26.209> tire<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.930> could

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
it's going to hit the tire and it could

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.569 
it's going to hit the tire and it could
actually<00:02:28.110> potentially<00:02:28.590> blow<00:02:29.040> out<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.340> tire

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
actually potentially blow out the tire

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.160 
actually potentially blow out the tire
just<00:02:30.150> from<00:02:30.299> all<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.390> friction<00:02:30.660> in<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.959> heat

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
just from all the friction in the heat

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.170 
just from all the friction in the heat
it's<00:02:32.069> too<00:02:32.370> low<00:02:32.579> which<00:02:32.760> it's<00:02:32.879> not<00:02:32.970> going<00:02:33.120> to

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
it's too low which it's not going to

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.569 
it's too low which it's not going to
break<00:02:33.360> on<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.930> surface<00:02:34.260> properly<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.860> you're

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
break on the surface properly and you're

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.550 
break on the surface properly and you're
you're<00:02:36.299> not<00:02:36.450> going<00:02:36.569> to<00:02:36.629> be<00:02:36.690> able<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.930> stop

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
you're not going to be able to stop

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.800 
you're not going to be able to stop
quickly<00:02:37.890> enough<00:02:38.099> so<00:02:38.340> let<00:02:39.269> me<00:02:39.360> adjust<00:02:39.420> both<00:02:39.690> of

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
quickly enough so let me adjust both of

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.030 
quickly enough so let me adjust both of
these<00:02:39.870> pads<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.970> then<00:02:42.150> it'll<00:02:42.299> see<00:02:42.920> if<00:02:43.920> it

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
these pads and then it'll see if it

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.490 
these pads and then it'll see if it
makes<00:02:44.190> any<00:02:44.310> noise<00:02:44.989> so<00:02:45.989> now<00:02:46.110> it's<00:02:46.230> nice<00:02:46.349> and

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
makes any noise so now it's nice and

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.340 
makes any noise so now it's nice and
quiet<00:02:46.590> no<00:02:46.950> more<00:02:47.069> squeaking<00:02:48.049> it's<00:02:49.049> also<00:02:49.200> going

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
quiet no more squeaking it's also going

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.140 
quiet no more squeaking it's also going
to<00:02:49.410> break<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.650> little<00:02:50.010> better<00:02:50.190> but<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.760> can<00:02:50.790> you

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
to break a little better but you can you

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.479 
to break a little better but you can you
can<00:02:51.269> see<00:02:51.480> how<00:02:51.510> if<00:02:51.959> I<00:02:52.709> spin<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.010> wheel<00:02:53.130> slowly

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
can see how if I spin the wheel slowly

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.970 
can see how if I spin the wheel slowly
it<00:02:53.700> stops<00:02:54.269> so<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.380> reason<00:02:55.590> for<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.739> is<00:02:55.889> it

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
it stops so the reason for that is it

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.039 
it stops so the reason for that is it
could<00:02:56.130> be<00:02:56.250> either<00:02:56.370> too<00:02:56.609> tight<00:02:56.850> or<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.720> could<00:02:57.900> be

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
could be either too tight or it could be

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.859 
could be either too tight or it could be
miss<00:02:58.590> Augusta
