00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
months to 36 months and all I can think

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.080 
months to 36 months and all I can think
is<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.840> somebody<00:00:19.260> used<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.250> pop<00:00:20.460> pennies<00:00:20.910> on

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
is that somebody used to pop pennies on

is that somebody used to pop pennies on
their<00:00:21.300> sneakers<00:00:21.539> when<00:00:21.900> they<00:00:22.050> were<00:00:22.109> younger

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
their sneakers when they were younger

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.460 
their sneakers when they were younger
and<00:00:23.300> designed<00:00:24.300> this<00:00:24.600> which<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.260> actually

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
and designed this which is actually

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.450 
and designed this which is actually
pretty<00:00:25.800> cool<00:00:26.180> so<00:00:28.070> it's<00:00:29.070> got<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> little

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
pretty cool so it's got a little

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.139

fisher-price says on the box that it's

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.549 
fisher-price says on the box that it's
supposed<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.760> improve<00:01:03.559> hand-eye

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
supposed to improve hand-eye

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.490 
supposed to improve hand-eye
coordination<00:01:06.020> those<00:01:07.020> motor<00:01:07.380> skills<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.299> the

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
coordination those motor skills and the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.660 
coordination those motor skills and the
relationship<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.740> brain<00:01:11.010> between<00:01:11.280> cause

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
relationship in the brain between cause

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.200 
relationship in the brain between cause
and<00:01:11.700> effect<00:01:11.970> which<00:01:12.680> I<00:01:13.680> can<00:01:14.280> see<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.610> that

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
and effect which I can see that that

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.420 
and effect which I can see that that
makes<00:01:15.420> sense<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.840> me<00:01:16.040> that's<00:01:17.040> got<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.280> little

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
makes sense to me that's got a little

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.300 
makes sense to me that's got a little
thing<00:01:17.700> here<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> frontal<00:01:18.630> anyway<00:01:19.040> and<00:01:20.040> I

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
thing here on the frontal anyway and I

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.219 
thing here on the frontal anyway and I
honestly<00:01:20.759> don't<00:01:20.939> know<00:01:21.060> if<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.479> activates<00:01:22.020> it

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
honestly don't know if that activates it

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.719 
honestly don't know if that activates it
or<00:01:22.350> not<00:01:24.590> but<00:01:25.590> honestly<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.159> gotta<00:01:26.430> say<00:01:26.610> this

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
or not but honestly I gotta say this

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:27.740 
or not but honestly I gotta say this
thing's<00:01:27.000> pretty<00:01:27.180> cool

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
thing's pretty cool

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
in here and they pop around funny so I

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.890 
in here and they pop around funny so I
can<00:01:34.110> see<00:01:34.290> there's<00:01:34.439> be<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> lot<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.040> fun<00:01:35.270> as<00:01:36.270> far

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
can see there's be a lot of fun as far

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.260 
can see there's be a lot of fun as far
as<00:01:37.579> the<00:01:38.579> overall<00:01:38.750> mechanics<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:41.270> balls

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
as the overall mechanics of it a balls

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.850 
as the overall mechanics of it a balls
go<00:01:42.509> through<00:01:42.720> there<00:01:43.049> makes<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.560> interesting

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
go through there makes it interesting

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.270 
go through there makes it interesting
for<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> kids<00:01:44.720> there's<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.899> dual<00:01:46.710> volume

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
for the kids there's a dual volume

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.670 
for the kids there's a dual volume
setting<00:01:47.729> which<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.060> always<00:01:48.360> nice<00:01:48.780> ah

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.690 

it<00:01:53.040> takes<00:01:53.369> batteries<00:01:53.960> obviously<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:56.460> is

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
it takes batteries obviously and this is

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.090 
it takes batteries obviously and this is
made<00:01:56.909> out<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.270> fabric<00:01:57.570> which<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.350> nice<00:01:58.770> because

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
made out of fabric which is nice because

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.830 
made out of fabric which is nice because
it's<00:01:59.430> kind<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.759> like<00:01:59.820> spandex<00:02:01.250> so<00:02:02.659> it's<00:02:03.659> going

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
it's kind of like spandex so it's going

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.120 
it's kind of like spandex so it's going
to<00:02:03.899> be<00:02:03.990> kind<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.350> hard<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.560> puncture<00:02:05.009> this

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
to be kind of hard to puncture this

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.709 
to be kind of hard to puncture this
thing<00:02:05.399> it's<00:02:05.640> not<00:02:05.820> like<00:02:06.030> made<00:02:06.299> out<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.509> rubber

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
thing it's not like made out of rubber

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.199 
thing it's not like made out of rubber
and<00:02:07.140> it's<00:02:07.259> going<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.530> start<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.920> tear<00:02:08.160> but<00:02:09.030> I'm

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
and it's going to start to tear but I'm

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.650 
and it's going to start to tear but I'm
sure<00:02:09.450> eventually<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.989> will<00:02:10.140> wear<00:02:10.379> out

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
sure eventually it will wear out

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.940 
sure eventually it will wear out
but<00:02:11.960> honestly<00:02:12.350> overall<00:02:13.060> for<00:02:14.590> toy<00:02:15.590> for<00:02:15.920> a

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
but honestly overall for toy for a

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.300 
but honestly overall for toy for a
six-month-old<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:17.660> might<00:02:17.990> be<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.440> little<00:02:18.950> bit

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
six-month-old it might be a little bit

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.340 
six-month-old it might be a little bit
tough<00:02:19.670> for<00:02:19.700> them<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.120> figure<00:02:20.300> out<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:20.900> don't

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
tough for them to figure out I don't

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.550 
tough for them to figure out I don't
think<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:22.010> maybe<00:02:22.310> some<00:02:22.610> won't<00:02:23.560> for

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
think so maybe some won't for

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.020 
think so maybe some won't for
one-year-old<00:02:25.100> I<00:02:25.280> could<00:02:25.430> see<00:02:25.580> this<00:02:25.700> being<00:02:25.760> a

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
one-year-old I could see this being a
