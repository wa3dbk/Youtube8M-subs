figure is pretty good however it keeps
wanting<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.560> keeps<00:01:16.830> leaning<00:01:17.400> forward<00:01:18.060> like

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
wanting it keeps leaning forward like

some kind of deranged hunchback I can't
every<00:01:21.810> time<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.020> try<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.680> him<00:01:22.890> look

every time I try to have him look
straight<00:01:23.580> I'll<00:01:23.970> turn<00:01:24.240> around<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.780> then<00:01:25.200> he'll

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
straight I'll turn around and then he'll

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.560 
straight I'll turn around and then he'll
be<00:01:25.619> leaning<00:01:25.860> forward<00:01:26.009> again<00:01:26.700> looking<00:01:27.299> at<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
in addition is the I should say omission

piping<00:01:36.509> for<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.780> figure<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.950> figure<00:01:38.220> now

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
piping for the figure so the figure now

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.880 
piping for the figure so the figure now
has<00:01:38.700> painted<00:01:39.270> eyes<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.409> middle<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.770> his

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
has painted eyes in the middle of his

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.069 
has painted eyes in the middle of his
head<00:01:41.159> I'll<00:01:41.610> do<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.850> close-up<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.570> second

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
head I'll do a close-up in a second

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.749 
head I'll do a close-up in a second
overall<00:01:43.710> though<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:43.920> think<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.280> robot<00:01:44.579> mode

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
overall though I think the robot mode

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.219 
overall though I think the robot mode
looks<00:01:45.030> good<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.540> still<00:01:45.990> has<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.340> same

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
looks good it still has this the same

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.510 
looks good it still has this the same
transformation<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.009> mold<00:01:50.310> has<00:01:50.640> and

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
transformation that this mold has and

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.410 
transformation that this mold has and
love<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.729> or<00:01:53.850> hate<00:01:53.909> it

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
love it or hate it

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.380 
love it or hate it
it's<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:55.110> done<00:01:55.619> well<00:01:55.920> with<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.610> particular

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
it's it's done well with this particular

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.179 
it's it's done well with this particular
figure<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:58.020> like<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.560> fact<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.829> he's<00:01:59.009> holding

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
figure I like the fact that he's holding

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.060 
figure I like the fact that he's holding
missiles<00:01:59.700> on<00:01:59.850> his<00:01:59.969> back<00:02:00.149> as<00:02:00.360> well

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
missiles on his back as well

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.200 
missiles on his back as well
unfortunately<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.280> problems<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:03.060> this

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
unfortunately the problems that this

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.620 
unfortunately the problems that this
mold<00:02:03.659> had<00:02:04.020> are<00:02:04.409> still<00:02:04.799> present<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.820> shoulders

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
mold had are still present the shoulders

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.660 
mold had are still present the shoulders
don't<00:02:06.930> go<00:02:07.140> all<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.530> way<00:02:07.560> back<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.099> on<00:02:08.459> my

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
don't go all the way back and on my

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.589 
don't go all the way back and on my
figure<00:02:09.000> specifically<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.259> right<00:02:10.739> arm<00:02:11.009> is

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
figure specifically the right arm is

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.790 
figure specifically the right arm is
incredibly<00:02:12.599> loose<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.230> no<00:02:13.440> matter

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
incredibly loose so no matter

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.120 
incredibly loose so no matter
what<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.040> do<00:02:14.390> unless<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.750> jam<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:16.410> up<00:02:16.740> it's

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
what you do unless you jam it up it's

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.000 
what you do unless you jam it up it's
the<00:02:17.970> arm<00:02:18.450> will<00:02:18.810> fall<00:02:19.050> down<00:02:19.260> as<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.650> just<00:02:19.830> saw

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
the arm will fall down as you just saw

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.880 
the arm will fall down as you just saw
he<00:02:20.550> does<00:02:20.760> come<00:02:21.000> with<00:02:21.180> his<00:02:21.330> two<00:02:21.890> stereotypical

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
he does come with his two stereotypical

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.220 
he does come with his two stereotypical
blasters<00:02:23.370> which<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:24.060> can<00:02:24.330> stack<00:02:24.750> them<00:02:24.960> eight

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
blasters which you can stack them eight

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.430 
blasters which you can stack them eight
high<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.890> did<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.450> but<00:02:27.450> he<00:02:27.660> also<00:02:27.840> comes<00:02:28.260> with

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
high I did it but he also comes with

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.800 
high I did it but he also comes with
what<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:28.890> like<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.340> call<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.880> biggest<00:02:30.240> crossbow

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
what I like to call the biggest crossbow

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.700 
what I like to call the biggest crossbow
of<00:02:30.990> doom<00:02:31.230> ever<00:02:31.590> now<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.400> can<00:02:32.700> fold<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.120> up<00:02:33.240> too

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
of doom ever now you can fold it up too

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.980 
of doom ever now you can fold it up too
so<00:02:34.710> that<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.300> parts<00:02:36.300> of<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.450> crossbow<00:02:36.870> were

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
so that the parts of the crossbow were

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.050 
so that the parts of the crossbow were
folded<00:02:37.380> back<00:02:37.530> behind<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.250> but<00:02:38.670> then<00:02:38.820> you<00:02:38.940> could

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
folded back behind it but then you could

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.640 
folded back behind it but then you could
fold<00:02:39.300> them<00:02:39.480> for<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:39.900> they<00:02:39.990> do<00:02:40.050> click<00:02:40.410> into

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
fold them for it and they do click into

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.120 
fold them for it and they do click into
place

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
place

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.030

interesting I mean look at the

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.199 
interesting I mean look at the
difference<00:03:37.410> in<00:03:37.530> those<00:03:37.680> head<00:03:37.920> scopes<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.550> is

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
difference in those head scopes that is

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.180

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
to get into the transformation it is

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.290

and I like the fact that he looks like
he's<00:06:25.550> getting<00:06:25.819> ready<00:06:26.150> to<00:06:26.560> that<00:06:27.560> he's<00:06:28.009> grumpy
