00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.179 
are good to us so like you said we've
been<00:05:46.020> running<00:05:46.289> good<00:05:46.529> we<00:05:46.650> just<00:05:46.680> had<00:05:46.949> bad<00:05:47.159> luck

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:47.189 
been running good we just had bad luck

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:50.570 
been running good we just had bad luck
so<00:05:47.699> there's<00:05:48.150> I<00:05:48.449> find<00:05:49.050> it<00:05:49.199> very<00:05:49.580> highly

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
so there's I find it very highly

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.980 
so there's I find it very highly
unlikely<00:05:51.059> that<00:05:51.270> we're<00:05:51.539> going<00:05:51.629> to<00:05:51.689> have<00:05:51.870> that

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
unlikely that we're going to have that

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.420 
unlikely that we're going to have that
kind<00:05:52.139> of<00:05:52.259> bad<00:05:52.439> luck<00:05:52.680> for<00:05:52.889> the<00:05:52.949> next<00:05:53.099> six<00:05:53.370> weeks

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
kind of bad luck for the next six weeks

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.639 
kind of bad luck for the next six weeks
in<00:05:53.759> a<00:05:53.819> row<00:05:53.969> so<00:05:54.270> we<00:05:54.990> just<00:05:55.169> got<00:05:55.289> to<00:05:55.349> go<00:05:55.409> out<00:05:55.439> and<00:05:55.589> do

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:55.649 
in a row so we just got to go out and do

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:56.869 
in a row so we just got to go out and do
what<00:05:55.740> we<00:05:55.800> normally<00:05:55.919> do<00:05:56.189> and<00:05:56.520> he<00:05:56.610> has<00:05:56.699> a<00:05:56.729> good
