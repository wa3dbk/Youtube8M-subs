00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
all right here I just want to talk about

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.470 
all right here I just want to talk about
an<00:00:04.440> issue<00:00:04.560> i'm<00:00:05.250> having<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.850> 2k14<00:00:06.799> with<00:00:07.799> the

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 
an issue i'm having and 2k14 with the

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.759 
an issue i'm having and 2k14 with the
the<00:00:09.480> Catchings<00:00:10.080> shoot<00:00:10.679> situations<00:00:12.230> like<00:00:13.230> like

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
the Catchings shoot situations like like

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.660 
the Catchings shoot situations like like
on<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:13.950> screen<00:00:14.519> like<00:00:14.849> here<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.780> have<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.619> have<00:00:17.490> a

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
on a screen like here I have a I have a

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.460 
on a screen like here I have a I have a
player<00:00:17.940> coming<00:00:18.210> off<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.570> screen<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.260> see

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
player coming off the screen and you see

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.550 
player coming off the screen and you see
what<00:00:19.590> happens<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.689> when<00:00:21.689> he<00:00:21.779> catches<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.230> ball

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
what happens is when he catches the ball

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.560 
what happens is when he catches the ball
and<00:00:23.000> he<00:00:24.000> turns<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.570> shoot<00:00:25.670> the<00:00:26.670> shot<00:00:26.939> animation

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
and he turns to shoot the shot animation

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.189 
and he turns to shoot the shot animation
kind<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.869> makes<00:00:28.050> him<00:00:28.199> step<00:00:28.710> forward<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:30.199> turn

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
kind of makes him step forward and turn

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.700 
kind of makes him step forward and turn
in<00:00:32.090> kind<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.180> towards<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.780> defender<00:00:33.989> which

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
in kind of towards the defender which

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.069 
in kind of towards the defender which
which<00:00:35.100> allows<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.640> defender<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.120> kind<00:00:37.050> of

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
which allows the defender to kind of

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.819 
which allows the defender to kind of
close<00:00:37.350> out<00:00:37.649> on<00:00:38.360> but<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.780> wasn't<00:00:40.050> an<00:00:40.290> issue<00:00:40.469> in

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
close out on but this wasn't an issue in

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.560 
close out on but this wasn't an issue in
2k13<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.540> gay<00:00:42.719> 13<00:00:43.079> what<00:00:43.290> happened<00:00:43.739> was<00:00:43.950> he

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
2k13 and to gay 13 what happened was he

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.090 
2k13 and to gay 13 what happened was he
kind<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.660> would<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:46.020> would<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.559> continued

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
kind of would have would have continued

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.200 
kind of would have would have continued
out<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.640> direction<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:50.550> animation

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
out in this direction and the animation

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.470 
out in this direction and the animation
would<00:00:51.390> have<00:00:51.480> kind<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.780> led<00:00:52.110> him<00:00:52.379> out<00:00:53.210> this<00:00:54.210> way

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
would have kind of led him out this way

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.680 
would have kind of led him out this way
rather<00:00:54.870> than<00:00:55.050> having<00:00:55.920> him<00:00:56.039> kind<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:56.969> sharply

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
rather than having him kind of sharply

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.240 
rather than having him kind of sharply
turn<00:00:58.050> inward<00:00:58.590> like<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.129> and<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:01.680> problem<00:01:01.890> I

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
turn inward like that and the problem I

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.830 
turn inward like that and the problem I
have<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:04.530> CPU<00:01:05.390> doesn't<00:01:06.390> shoot<00:01:06.570> like

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
have is that the CPU doesn't shoot like

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.640 
have is that the CPU doesn't shoot like
this<00:01:06.869> when<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.439> CPU<00:01:07.979> does<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.340> play<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:08.820> this

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
this when the CPU does it play like this

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.859 
this when the CPU does it play like this
the<00:01:10.650> CPUs<00:01:11.369> player<00:01:11.850> will<00:01:12.119> run<00:01:12.390> all<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.720> way<00:01:12.750> out

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
the CPUs player will run all the way out

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.679 
the CPUs player will run all the way out
here<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.979> past<00:01:14.549> will<00:01:14.790> kind<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.090> lead<00:01:15.420> them

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
here and the past will kind of lead them

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.929 
here and the past will kind of lead them
out<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.400> direction<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.640> they're

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
out in the direction that they're

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.760 
out in the direction that they're
already<00:01:18.180> cutting<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.960> they<00:01:19.080> can<00:01:19.229> kind<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.530> keep

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
already cutting so they can kind of keep

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.999 
already cutting so they can kind of keep
more<00:01:20.280> space<00:01:20.700> between<00:01:20.970> them<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.470> defender

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
more space between them and the defender

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.990 
more space between them and the defender
so<00:01:23.939> I'll<00:01:24.570> show<00:01:24.630> an<00:01:25.439> example<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.130> CPU<00:01:26.700> doing

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
so I'll show an example of the CPU doing

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.270 
so I'll show an example of the CPU doing
the<00:01:27.119> same<00:01:27.330> play<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.110> you'll<00:01:28.770> see<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
the same play and you'll see that the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.270 
the same play and you'll see that the
shot<00:01:29.549> animation<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:31.380> bid<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:31.950> catch

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
shot animation is a bid to catch

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.280 
shot animation is a bid to catch
animation<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.270> shadow<00:01:33.509> animation<00:01:34.110> are

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
animation and the shadow animation are

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:42.940 
animation and the shadow animation are
different<00:01:34.939> when<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.060> CPU<00:01:36.600> does<00:01:36.840> this

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.940 

okay<00:01:43.729> so<00:01:43.789> here<00:01:44.360> I'm<00:01:44.570> going<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:44.840> show<00:01:45.079> what

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
okay so here I'm going to show what

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.090 
okay so here I'm going to show what
happens<00:01:46.130> when<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.640> CPU<00:01:47.329> does<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.380> same<00:01:48.680> play

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
happens when the CPU does the same play

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.580 
happens when the CPU does the same play
this<00:01:49.789> is<00:01:50.000> a<00:01:50.030> cpu<00:01:50.659> running<00:01:50.840> this<00:01:51.140> play<00:01:51.439> and

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
this is a cpu running this play and

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.590 
this is a cpu running this play and
you'll<00:01:51.740> see<00:01:51.950> what<00:01:52.100> happens<00:01:52.490> is<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:53.329> catch

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
you'll see what happens is the catch

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.419 
you'll see what happens is the catch
animation<00:01:54.429> leads<00:01:55.429> the<00:01:55.729> CPU<00:01:56.299> shooter<00:01:57.429> out

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
animation leads the CPU shooter out

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.319 
animation leads the CPU shooter out
farther<00:01:59.060> behind<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.840> three-point<00:02:00.350> line<00:02:00.470> and

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
farther behind the three-point line and

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.419 
farther behind the three-point line and
it<00:02:02.329> kind<00:02:02.539> of<00:02:02.600> blends<00:02:03.110> into<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.649> cat<00:02:03.979> into<00:02:04.399> the

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
it kind of blends into the cat into the

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.870 
it kind of blends into the cat into the
chute<00:02:04.759> animation<00:02:05.450> so<00:02:05.689> that<00:02:06.640> he<00:02:07.640> doesn't

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
chute animation so that he doesn't

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.419 
chute animation so that he doesn't
really<00:02:08.149> take<00:02:08.660> that<00:02:08.690> sharp<00:02:09.410> inward<00:02:10.009> turn

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
really take that sharp inward turn

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.720 
really take that sharp inward turn
towards<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.299> hoop<00:02:11.510> he<00:02:12.200> kind<00:02:12.440> of<00:02:12.530> his<00:02:12.980> momentum

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
towards the hoop he kind of his momentum

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.080 
towards the hoop he kind of his momentum
kind<00:02:14.090> of<00:02:14.180> carries<00:02:14.690> him<00:02:14.930> out<00:02:15.400> farther<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.849> he

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
kind of carries him out farther and he

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.550 
kind of carries him out farther and he
kind<00:02:17.299> of<00:02:17.360> plants<00:02:17.870> his<00:02:17.989> feet<00:02:18.940> into<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:19.970> shot<00:02:20.560> so

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
kind of plants his feet into the shot so

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.650 
kind of plants his feet into the shot so
the<00:02:21.680> shot<00:02:21.950> animation<00:02:22.549> kind<00:02:22.790> of<00:02:22.910> kind<00:02:23.540> of

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
the shot animation kind of kind of

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.110 
the shot animation kind of kind of
carries<00:02:24.170> him<00:02:24.380> out<00:02:24.560> farther<00:02:24.980> this<00:02:25.400> way<00:02:25.459> in

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
carries him out farther this way in

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.440 
carries him out farther this way in
order<00:02:26.810> to<00:02:27.079> keep<00:02:27.349> more<00:02:27.650> space<00:02:28.130> between<00:02:28.910> him<00:02:29.269> and

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
order to keep more space between him and

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.400 
order to keep more space between him and
his<00:02:29.510> defender<00:02:30.079> here<00:02:30.579> so<00:02:31.579> I<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.989> know<00:02:33.019> what<00:02:33.290> the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
his defender here so I you know what the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.960 
his defender here so I you know what the
problem<00:02:33.829> is<00:02:33.980> is<00:02:34.160> that<00:02:34.190> in<00:02:34.519> 2k13<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:37.670> user

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
problem is is that in 2k13 the user

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.449 
problem is is that in 2k13 the user
could<00:02:38.299> do<00:02:38.510> these<00:02:38.720> kind<00:02:39.049> of<00:02:39.170> kind<00:02:39.860> of<00:02:40.040> animation

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
could do these kind of kind of animation

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.319 
could do these kind of kind of animation
shot<00:02:40.730> animations<00:02:41.360> off<00:02:41.630> of<00:02:41.840> caches<00:02:42.489> where<00:02:43.489> the

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
shot animations off of caches where the

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.569 
shot animations off of caches where the
catch<00:02:44.660> animation<00:02:45.349> would<00:02:45.530> kind<00:02:45.769> of<00:02:45.829> blend<00:02:46.280> into

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
catch animation would kind of blend into

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.300 
catch animation would kind of blend into
the<00:02:46.790> shot<00:02:47.060> animation<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:47.900> allow<00:02:48.769> the<00:02:48.829> player

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
the shot animation and allow the player

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.890 
the shot animation and allow the player
to<00:02:49.340> kind<00:02:49.880> of<00:02:51.280> kind<00:02:52.280> of<00:02:52.430> move<00:02:52.819> out<00:02:53.150> towards<00:02:53.630> the

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
to kind of kind of move out towards the

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.680 
to kind of kind of move out towards the
direction<00:02:54.170> they're<00:02:54.650> cutting<00:02:55.100> as<00:02:55.269> they<00:02:56.269> shoot

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
direction they're cutting as they shoot

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.940 
direction they're cutting as they shoot
and<00:02:56.989> catch<00:02:58.660> so<00:02:59.660> that<00:02:59.840> you<00:02:59.959> keep<00:03:00.200> more<00:03:00.470> space

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
and catch so that you keep more space

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.120 
and catch so that you keep more space
between<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:02.090> defender<00:03:02.569> and<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.810> shooter<00:03:03.230> but

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
between the defender and the shooter but

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.530 
between the defender and the shooter but
for<00:03:04.340> some<00:03:04.579> reason<00:03:04.940> in<00:03:05.060> 2k14<00:03:06.430> only<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.609> CPU<00:03:08.299> can

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
for some reason in 2k14 only the CPU can

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.449 
for some reason in 2k14 only the CPU can
do<00:03:08.720> these<00:03:08.930> kind<00:03:09.230> of<00:03:09.350> catch<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:09.829> shoot<00:03:10.100> shots

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
do these kind of catch and shoot shots

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.180 
do these kind of catch and shoot shots
these<00:03:11.150> momentum<00:03:11.750> catch<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:12.709> shoot<00:03:12.769> shots

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
these momentum catch and shoot shots

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.330 
these momentum catch and shoot shots
where<00:03:13.489> as<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:14.780> user<00:03:15.109> like<00:03:15.799> I<00:03:15.920> should<00:03:16.160> in<00:03:16.250> the

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
where as the user like I should in the

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.789 
where as the user like I should in the
previous<00:03:16.639> video<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.239> user<00:03:17.569> kind<00:03:18.019> of<00:03:18.139> when

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
previous video the user kind of when

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.220 
previous video the user kind of when
they<00:03:18.920> do<00:03:18.980> it<00:03:19.310> that<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.850> player<00:03:20.150> will<00:03:20.389> stop<00:03:20.870> and

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
they do it that the player will stop and

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.069 
they do it that the player will stop and
kind<00:03:21.440> of<00:03:21.530> step<00:03:22.130> in<00:03:22.370> word<00:03:22.639> like<00:03:23.299> I<00:03:23.450> like<00:03:23.720> you<00:03:23.870> saw

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
kind of step in word like I like you saw

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.470 
kind of step in word like I like you saw
in<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.260> first<00:03:24.500> video<00:03:24.849> so<00:03:25.849> you<00:03:25.940> can<00:03:26.120> see<00:03:26.329> the

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
in the first video so you can see the

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.050 
in the first video so you can see the
difference<00:03:26.870> here<00:03:26.959> when<00:03:27.739> i<00:03:27.769> when<00:03:28.250> i<00:03:28.280> when<00:03:29.030> the

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
difference here when i when i when the

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.190 
difference here when i when i when the
cpu<00:03:29.359> runs<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:30.049> same<00:03:30.319> play<00:03:31.720> their<00:03:32.720> catch<00:03:32.989> and

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
cpu runs the same play their catch and

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.650 
cpu runs the same play their catch and
shoot<00:03:33.440> animation<00:03:34.099> is<00:03:34.340> much<00:03:34.819> more<00:03:35.060> effective

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
shoot animation is much more effective

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.589 
shoot animation is much more effective
and<00:03:35.920> doesn't<00:03:36.920> have<00:03:37.099> that<00:03:37.340> that<00:03:37.700> forward<00:03:38.269> that

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
and doesn't have that that forward that

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.280 
and doesn't have that that forward that
inward<00:03:38.810> step<00:03:39.470> you<00:03:40.310> know<00:03:40.569> you<00:03:41.569> can<00:03:41.750> see<00:03:41.959> he<00:03:42.109> kind

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
inward step you know you can see he kind

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.610 
inward step you know you can see he kind
of<00:03:42.470> hops<00:03:42.799> into<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.430> shot<00:03:43.819> as<00:03:44.150> he<00:03:44.590> catches<00:03:45.590> the

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
of hops into the shot as he catches the

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.659 
of hops into the shot as he catches the
ball<00:03:46.120> he<00:03:47.120> kind<00:03:47.359> of<00:03:47.419> plants<00:03:47.930> his<00:03:48.049> feet<00:03:48.549> into<00:03:49.549> the

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:49.669 
ball he kind of plants his feet into the

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.330 
ball he kind of plants his feet into the
shot<00:03:49.940> so<00:03:50.299> that<00:03:50.450> the<00:03:50.630> catch<00:03:51.349> animation<00:03:52.069> and<00:03:52.280> the

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
shot so that the catch animation and the

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.440 
shot so that the catch animation and the
shot<00:03:52.610> animation

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
shot animation

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:02.559 
shot animation
blend<00:03:53.900> into<00:03:54.140> each<00:03:54.260> other<00:03:55.120> with<00:03:56.120> momentum<00:04:01.569> okay

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
blend into each other with momentum okay

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.059 
blend into each other with momentum okay
so<00:04:02.660> here<00:04:02.959> again<00:04:02.989> I'm<00:04:03.290> just<00:04:03.410> going<00:04:03.620> to<00:04:03.650> show<00:04:03.739> the

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
so here again I'm just going to show the

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.759 
so here again I'm just going to show the
play<00:04:04.310> again<00:04:04.489> when<00:04:05.390> I<00:04:05.450> ran<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:06.080> play<00:04:06.319> as<00:04:06.590> the

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
play again when I ran the play as the

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.690 
play again when I ran the play as the
user<00:04:07.069> you<00:04:07.430> can<00:04:07.940> see<00:04:08.269> the<00:04:08.420> difference<00:04:09.640> how<00:04:10.640> he

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
user you can see the difference how he

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.830 
user you can see the difference how he
steps<00:04:11.420> in<00:04:11.750> word<00:04:12.050> as<00:04:12.319> he<00:04:13.190> catches<00:04:13.819> the<00:04:14.030> pass<00:04:14.780> and

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
steps in word as he catches the pass and

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.060 
steps in word as he catches the pass and
shoots<00:04:16.450> it's<00:04:17.450> a<00:04:17.630> it's<00:04:17.840> a<00:04:17.989> different<00:04:18.410> catch<00:04:18.650> and

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
shoots it's a it's a different catch and

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.810 
shoots it's a it's a different catch and
a<00:04:19.340> different<00:04:19.729> shot<00:04:20.030> that<00:04:20.450> the<00:04:20.630> animations<00:04:21.820> the

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
a different shot that the animations the

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.150 
a different shot that the animations the
shot<00:04:23.330> animation<00:04:23.900> doesn't<00:04:24.380> really<00:04:24.560> carry<00:04:24.950> his

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
shot animation doesn't really carry his

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.400 
shot animation doesn't really carry his
momentum<00:04:25.760> out<00:04:25.940> in<00:04:26.150> this<00:04:26.270> direction<00:04:26.510> like<00:04:27.169> it

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
momentum out in this direction like it

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.700 
momentum out in this direction like it
did<00:04:27.680> when<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.550> cpu<00:04:28.790> did<00:04:29.389> it<00:04:29.570> so<00:04:30.320> you<00:04:30.380> see

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
did when the cpu did it so you see

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.490 
did when the cpu did it so you see
because<00:04:31.100> he<00:04:31.550> had<00:04:31.790> because<00:04:32.570> he<00:04:32.750> kind<00:04:32.870> of<00:04:32.990> curled

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
because he had because he kind of curled

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.190 
because he had because he kind of curled
in<00:04:33.800> word<00:04:34.010> like<00:04:34.280> this<00:04:34.720> see<00:04:35.720> how<00:04:35.840> he<00:04:35.900> kind<00:04:36.139> of

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
in word like this see how he kind of

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.420 
in word like this see how he kind of
stops<00:04:37.240> he<00:04:38.240> stops<00:04:38.720> kind<00:04:39.139> of<00:04:39.229> short<00:04:39.620> and<00:04:39.889> curls

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
stops he stops kind of short and curls

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.570 
stops he stops kind of short and curls
in<00:04:40.669> word<00:04:40.880> like<00:04:41.180> way<00:04:41.419> sooner<00:04:42.020> and<00:04:42.200> he<00:04:42.860> turns<00:04:43.220> in

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
in word like way sooner and he turns in

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.930 
in word like way sooner and he turns in
much<00:04:43.850> farther<00:04:44.210> and<00:04:44.600> as<00:04:45.560> a<00:04:45.590> result<00:04:45.940> the

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
much farther and as a result the

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.469 
much farther and as a result the
defender<00:04:47.510> can<00:04:48.080> get<00:04:48.260> right<00:04:48.470> up<00:04:48.620> on<00:04:48.800> him<00:04:49.479> whereas

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
defender can get right up on him whereas

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.110 
defender can get right up on him whereas
if<00:04:50.690> he<00:04:50.900> if<00:04:51.110> he<00:04:51.350> had<00:04:51.470> done<00:04:52.070> the<00:04:52.250> same<00:04:52.460> catch<00:04:52.850> and

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
if he if he had done the same catch and

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.409 
if he if he had done the same catch and
shoot<00:04:53.360> animation<00:04:53.900> as<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.290> CPU<00:04:55.120> he<00:04:56.120> would<00:04:56.270> be

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
shoot animation as the CPU he would be

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.500 
shoot animation as the CPU he would be
like<00:04:56.600> way<00:04:56.840> out<00:04:57.020> here<00:04:57.500> and<00:04:57.860> you<00:04:58.669> could<00:04:59.150> have<00:04:59.270> so

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
like way out here and you could have so

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.510 
like way out here and you could have so
much<00:04:59.660> more<00:04:59.870> space<00:05:00.260> there<00:05:00.620> so<00:05:00.979> for<00:05:01.280> some<00:05:01.490> reason

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
much more space there so for some reason

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.580 
much more space there so for some reason
in<00:05:01.970> 2k14<00:05:03.669> the<00:05:04.669> user<00:05:05.000> does<00:05:05.330> not<00:05:05.360> have<00:05:05.539> access<00:05:06.110> to

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
in 2k14 the user does not have access to

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.969 
in 2k14 the user does not have access to
those<00:05:06.770> those<00:05:07.520> momentum<00:05:08.380> Catchings<00:05:09.380> shoot

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 
those those momentum Catchings shoot

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.800 
those those momentum Catchings shoot
shots<00:05:10.930> I<00:05:11.930> don't<00:05:12.590> know<00:05:12.680> why<00:05:12.860> but<00:05:13.510> so<00:05:14.510> you<00:05:14.570> can

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
shots I don't know why but so you can

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.379 
shots I don't know why but so you can
see<00:05:14.990> the<00:05:15.110> difference<00:05:15.470> here<00:05:15.580> he<00:05:16.580> turns<00:05:16.940> inward

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
see the difference here he turns inward

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:27.860 
see the difference here he turns inward
and<00:05:17.720> stops<00:05:18.169> much<00:05:18.669> much<00:05:19.669> earlier

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.080 

okay<00:05:28.620> so<00:05:28.680> here<00:05:28.980> one<00:05:29.160> last<00:05:29.430> time<00:05:29.670> I'm<00:05:29.880> just

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
okay so here one last time I'm just

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.630 
okay so here one last time I'm just
going<00:05:30.210> to<00:05:30.240> show<00:05:30.450> the<00:05:30.660> comparison<00:05:31.310> you<00:05:32.310> see<00:05:32.520> the

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
going to show the comparison you see the

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.780 
going to show the comparison you see the
difference<00:05:32.790> this<00:05:33.210> is<00:05:33.420> the<00:05:33.570> CPU<00:05:34.170> and<00:05:34.790> their

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
difference this is the CPU and their

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.740 
difference this is the CPU and their
catch<00:05:36.090> and<00:05:36.210> shoot<00:05:36.480> animation<00:05:37.140> see<00:05:38.070> I<00:05:38.750> just

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
catch and shoot animation see I just

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:40.850 
catch and shoot animation see I just
want<00:05:39.990> I<00:05:40.050> just<00:05:40.080> wanted<00:05:40.470> to<00:05:40.500> show<00:05:40.710> the

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
want I just wanted to show the

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.570 
want I just wanted to show the
comparison<00:05:41.040> one<00:05:41.760> last<00:05:42.000> time<00:05:43.250> it's<00:05:44.250> like<00:05:44.430> the

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
comparison one last time it's like the

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.230 
comparison one last time it's like the
catch<00:05:44.850> animation<00:05:45.980> basically<00:05:47.090> kind<00:05:48.090> of

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
catch animation basically kind of

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.600 
catch animation basically kind of
carries<00:05:48.810> his<00:05:49.020> momentum<00:05:49.590> farther<00:05:50.130> out<00:05:51.380> and<00:05:52.610> you

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
carries his momentum farther out and you

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.940 
carries his momentum farther out and you
can<00:05:53.760> see<00:05:53.970> it's<00:05:54.780> like<00:05:54.960> his<00:05:55.170> momentum<00:05:55.320> and<00:05:55.830> his

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
can see it's like his momentum and his

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.930 
can see it's like his momentum and his
foot<00:05:56.220> planning<00:05:57.740> are<00:05:58.740> totally<00:05:59.250> different<00:05:59.430> and

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
foot planning are totally different and

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.340 
foot planning are totally different and
it<00:06:00.270> kind<00:06:00.480> of<00:06:00.570> blends<00:06:00.990> into<00:06:01.320> the<00:06:01.470> shot<00:06:01.860> better

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
it kind of blends into the shot better

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.660 
it kind of blends into the shot better
because<00:06:04.350> you<00:06:04.410> can<00:06:04.530> see<00:06:04.680> he's<00:06:04.860> kind<00:06:05.070> of<00:06:05.160> leaning

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
because you can see he's kind of leaning

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.990 
because you can see he's kind of leaning
forward<00:06:06.270> and<00:06:06.480> he<00:06:07.200> kind<00:06:07.440> of<00:06:07.470> hops<00:06:07.830> he<00:06:08.760> kind<00:06:08.970> of

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
forward and he kind of hops he kind of

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.010 
forward and he kind of hops he kind of
hops<00:06:09.270> into<00:06:09.660> the<00:06:09.840> shot<00:06:11.000> so<00:06:12.000> it's<00:06:12.330> a<00:06:12.450> much<00:06:12.630> better

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
hops into the shot so it's a much better

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:23.300 
hops into the shot so it's a much better
catch<00:06:13.890> and<00:06:14.130> shoot<00:06:14.310> animation<00:06:15.050> for<00:06:16.050> the<00:06:16.200> CPU

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.540 

he<00:06:23.850> doesn't<00:06:24.240> like<00:06:24.360> turn<00:06:24.690> inward<00:06:25.340> with<00:06:26.340> that

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
he doesn't like turn inward with that

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.880 
he doesn't like turn inward with that
sharp<00:06:27.000> inward<00:06:27.600> turn<00:06:27.930> like<00:06:28.290> that<00:06:28.320> like<00:06:28.770> the

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890 
sharp inward turn like that like the

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.120 
sharp inward turn like that like the
user<00:06:29.160> animation<00:06:29.850> head
