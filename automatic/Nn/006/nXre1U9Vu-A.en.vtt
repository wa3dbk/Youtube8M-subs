00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.410
 our mission 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.910
 we are pushing the frustration 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.049
 "This memory will 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.049
 Dr

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:22.960
 Israel 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.749
 at 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:26.599
 I was on earth 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.749
 as the court spokesman continues 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.749
 These things we did silly 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.230
 Torgefahr 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.960
 Of course it is too easy in the first step 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.960
 the responsibility blame at the state festival 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.850
 ghost 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.980
 Norbert 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.620
 the hackers called over a certain area 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.670
 the first one is now 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.629
 Franzens comes here to use many innovations 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.550
 You have to be a dealer first 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.690
 this one 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.950
 in the light 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.950

 due to language problems r 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:22.840
 Dr 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.300
 more that means it works 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.300
 certain problems that we simply can not fly 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.330
 Henry Arma was 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.310
 but in the long term, it makes sense 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.890
 also an ad that is certainly not the target 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.940
 because that gives us the certainty that we are looking at things in the long term as well 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.370
 even in the hand have to change 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.630
 the people are protecting five 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.680
 Frithjof satisfaction 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.490

 l and Emil Jula employee costs 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.940

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.090
 yes I 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.560
 susceptible to interference 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.400
 under no circumstance 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.139
 or was that 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.079
 There is also strong team 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.520

 Verhoeven

 we have in the club 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:51.940
 we found out 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.019
 What makes people happy is to be in control

 and at the beginning for a while 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.769
 we have that in practice 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:09.909
