of<00:00:57.980> fennel<00:01:00.020> we<00:01:01.020> don't<00:01:01.230> cook<00:01:01.410> vegetables<00:01:02.070> in

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
of fennel we don't cook vegetables in

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.690 
of fennel we don't cook vegetables in
water<00:01:02.460> because<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.629> believe<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.260> all<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
water because I believe that all the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.490 
water because I believe that all the
flavors<00:01:08.210> are<00:01:09.210> gonna<00:01:09.390> exchange<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.260> you're

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
flavors are gonna exchange so you're

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.750 
flavors are gonna exchange so you're
gonna<00:01:10.619> get<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> flavor<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> water<00:01:11.610> in

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
gonna get the flavor of the water in

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.490 
gonna get the flavor of the water in
your<00:01:11.790> vegetables<00:01:12.450> and

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
your vegetables and

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.200 
your vegetables and
favor<00:01:14.950> of<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.220> vegetables<00:01:15.730> into<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:15.940> water

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
favor of the vegetables into the water

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.290 
favor of the vegetables into the water
so<00:01:16.420> what<00:01:16.510> we<00:01:16.660> do<00:01:16.810> is<00:01:16.990> we<00:01:17.200> cryovac<00:01:17.830> them<00:01:18.070> and<00:01:18.300> we

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
so what we do is we cryovac them and we

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.440 
so what we do is we cryovac them and we
cook<00:01:19.480> our<00:01:19.630> vegetables<00:01:19.780> at<00:01:20.410> 80<00:01:20.650> degrees<00:01:21.450> at

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
cook our vegetables at 80 degrees at

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
flavor capacity these are very young

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.090 
flavor capacity these are very young
phenols<00:01:33.190> that<00:01:33.460> we<00:01:33.610> cooked<00:01:34.740> again<00:01:35.740> at<00:01:35.890> a<00:01:35.920> low
