12<00:06:16.360> days<00:06:16.630> ago<00:06:17.370> who's<00:06:18.370> all<00:06:18.610> of<00:06:18.640> this<00:06:18.789> but<00:06:19.720> at<00:06:19.810> the

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
12 days ago who's all of this but at the

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.659 
12 days ago who's all of this but at the
same<00:06:20.110> time<00:06:20.320> I<00:06:20.380> know<00:06:20.590> that<00:06:20.890> underneath<00:06:21.220> real

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
same time I know that underneath real

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:24.270 
same time I know that underneath real
hair<00:06:21.970> will<00:06:22.240> grow<00:06:22.450> back<00:06:22.539> in<00:06:23.050> the<00:06:23.560> same<00:06:23.800> position

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
hair will grow back in the same position

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.600 
hair will grow back in the same position
so<00:06:24.630> probably<00:06:25.630> around<00:06:25.780> four<00:06:26.260> months<00:06:26.830> time<00:06:27.220> new

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
so probably around four months time new

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.960 
so probably around four months time new
hair<00:06:27.850> will<00:06:28.240> start<00:06:28.660> to<00:06:28.840> grow<00:06:29.080> and<00:06:29.820> once<00:06:30.820> he

hair will start to grow and once he

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:36.180 
hair will start to grow and once he
grows<00:06:31.180> it<00:06:31.240> grows<00:06:31.419> that<00:06:31.900> will<00:06:32.110> be<00:06:32.260> my<00:06:32.440> hair

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.190 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.880 

I<00:06:36.720> didn't<00:06:37.720> have<00:06:38.070> pain<00:06:39.180> the<00:06:40.180> recovery<00:06:41.170> was<00:06:41.380> easy

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:41.890 
I didn't have pain the recovery was easy

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.770

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.870 
for a couple of days after the procedure
is<00:06:52.320> is<00:06:53.320> well<00:06:53.620> worth<00:06:53.860> that<00:06:54.130> when<00:06:54.310> you<00:06:54.430> start<00:06:54.730> to

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 
is is well worth that when you start to

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.730 
is is well worth that when you start to
see<00:06:55.090> new<00:06:55.510> hair<00:06:55.810> coming<00:06:56.200> in<00:06:56.350> where<00:06:56.590> there

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.270 
wasn't any hair before so I

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.770
