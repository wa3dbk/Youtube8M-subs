needed was to wrap this piece of wood

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.250 
needed was to wrap this piece of wood
earlier<00:00:30.720> which<00:00:31.820> turned<00:00:32.820> out<00:00:32.910> bad<00:00:33.149> but<00:00:34.079> that's

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
earlier which turned out bad but that's

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.900 
earlier which turned out bad but that's
a<00:00:34.469> whole<00:00:34.680> different<00:00:34.710> story<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.550> wrong<00:00:35.670> size

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
a whole different story the wrong size

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.549 
a whole different story the wrong size
anyways<00:00:36.270> ah<00:00:36.860> so<00:00:37.910> with<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.170> this<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.379> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
anyways ah so with that this is the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.440 
anyways ah so with that this is the
router<00:00:41.010> typical<00:00:41.579> router<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:41.969> see<00:00:42.239> at<00:00:42.360> a

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
router typical router that you see at a

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.470 
router typical router that you see at a
store<00:00:42.920> that's<00:00:43.920> nothing<00:00:44.610> fancy<00:00:44.969> just<00:00:45.120> a

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
store that's nothing fancy just a

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.630 
store that's nothing fancy just a
regular<00:00:45.930> one<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.890> what<00:00:47.070> I'm<00:00:47.160> going<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.309> do<00:00:47.430> is

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
regular one so what I'm going to do is

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.209 
regular one so what I'm going to do is
show<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.850> how<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.239> set<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.690> 0<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.500> how<00:00:50.160> to

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
show you how to set this 0 and how to

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.799 
show you how to set this 0 and how to
use<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.969> gauge<00:00:51.199> down<00:00:52.199> below<00:00:53.120> so<00:00:54.120> right<00:00:54.690> now

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
use the gauge down below so right now

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.330 
use the gauge down below so right now
the<00:00:54.870> current<00:00:55.260> configuration<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.160> is

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
the current configuration that this is

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.010 
the current configuration that this is
set<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.989> for<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:59.100> table<00:00:59.460> mounting<00:00:59.930> but<00:01:00.930> if

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
set in is for the table mounting but if

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.049 
set in is for the table mounting but if
you<00:01:01.079> flip<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.379> upside<00:01:01.680> down<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.789> will<00:01:02.910> be

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
you flip it upside down this is will be

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.789 
you flip it upside down this is will be
the<00:01:03.090> traditional<00:01:03.539> way<00:01:03.960> most<00:01:04.199> people<00:01:04.500> hold<00:01:04.619> it

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the traditional way most people hold it

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.039 
the traditional way most people hold it
so<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.909> will<00:01:06.000> go<00:01:06.210> ahead<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.420> explain<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
so I will go ahead and explain the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.920 
so I will go ahead and explain the
traditional<00:01:07.650> way<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.360> use<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.570> method

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
traditional way and use that method

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.780 
traditional way and use that method
instead<00:01:10.100> so<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.220> first<00:01:11.430> thing<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.610> want<00:01:11.760> to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
instead so the first thing you want to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.330 
instead so the first thing you want to
do<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.210> as<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.930> can<00:01:12.990> see<00:01:13.200> my<00:01:13.350> pieces<00:01:13.590> are<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> my

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
do is as you can see my pieces are a my

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.749 
do is as you can see my pieces are a my
router<00:01:14.790> bit<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.060> already<00:01:15.509> installed<00:01:16.759> I'm

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
router bit is already installed I'm

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.640 
router bit is already installed I'm
going<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.119> go<00:01:18.540> ahead<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.780> back<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.140> up<00:01:19.290> how

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
going to go ahead and back that up how

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.530 
going to go ahead and back that up how
first<00:01:20.040> thing<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.460> there's<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.970> locking<00:01:21.360> and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
first thing is there's a locking and

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.310 
first thing is there's a locking and
unlocking<00:01:21.650> mechanism<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.490> back<00:01:24.320> what

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
unlocking mechanism and the back what

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.870 
unlocking mechanism and the back what
you<00:01:25.409> want<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.650> do<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.890> take<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.430> unlock

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
you want to do is take it to the unlock

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.240 
you want to do is take it to the unlock
position<00:01:26.909> which<00:01:27.570> it's<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.900> right<00:01:28.049> now<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:29.070> go

you want to do is take this
draw<00:01:36.170> a<00:01:36.550> imaginary<00:01:37.550> plane<00:01:38.150> surface<00:01:38.630> right

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
draw a imaginary plane surface right

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.050 
draw a imaginary plane surface right
here<00:01:38.930> and<00:01:39.140> you<00:01:39.200> want<00:01:39.290> to<00:01:39.410> back<00:01:39.620> this<00:01:39.830> up<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:41.000> you

here so you can see inside what's going
on<00:02:04.150> right<00:02:05.150> now<00:02:05.210> it's<00:02:05.570> contacting<00:02:06.260> surface

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
on right now it's contacting surface

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.840 
on right now it's contacting surface
what<00:02:06.890> I<00:02:06.950> want<00:02:07.130> to<00:02:07.190> do<00:02:07.280> is<00:02:07.340> just<00:02:07.490> keep<00:02:07.670> backing

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
what I want to do is just keep backing

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.699 
what I want to do is just keep backing
it<00:02:08.090> up

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.690 

right<00:02:13.709> now<00:02:13.829> it's<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.040> little<00:02:14.159> bit<00:02:14.310> off<00:02:14.489> the

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
right now it's a little bit off the

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.390 
right now it's a little bit off the
surface<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.769> want<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.040> do<00:02:17.159> is<00:02:17.400> take<00:02:17.939> it

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
surface and I want to do is take it

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.089 
surface and I want to do is take it
press<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.430> right<00:02:20.730> against<00:02:21.359> the<00:02:21.510> surface<00:02:22.099> right

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
press it right against the surface right

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.399 
press it right against the surface right
their<00:02:23.310> heads<00:02:23.519> flush<00:02:23.909> with<00:02:24.329> it<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:25.200> what<00:02:25.379> you

Machine around see what's going on up

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.569 
Machine around see what's going on up
here<00:02:30.170> up<00:02:31.170> here<00:02:31.439> on<00:02:31.620> this<00:02:31.769> ring<00:02:34.459> there's<00:02:35.459> a

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
here up here on this ring there's a

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:40.009 
here up here on this ring there's a
bunch<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:37.310> gauges<00:02:38.310> or<00:02:38.459> sizes<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.720> what<00:02:39.900> you

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
bunch of gauges or sizes and what you

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.199 
bunch of gauges or sizes and what you
need<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.260> do<00:02:40.379> is<00:02:40.560> align<00:02:40.829> this<00:02:41.129> arrow<00:02:41.459> which<00:02:42.060> is

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
need to do is align this arrow which is

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.619 
need to do is align this arrow which is
right<00:02:42.359> here<00:02:42.560> which<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.590> right<00:02:43.889> here<00:02:44.189> right

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
right here which is right here right

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.280 
right here which is right here right
here

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
here

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.039 
here
you<00:02:46.709> got<00:02:46.859> that<00:02:46.980> in<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.159> video<00:02:47.400> yeah<00:02:47.730> okay<00:02:48.299> you

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
you got that in the video yeah okay you

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.409 
you got that in the video yeah okay you
gotta<00:02:49.200> take<00:02:49.379> this<00:02:49.530> arrow<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.280> line<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.209> up

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:51.419 
gotta take this arrow and line it up

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:56.119 
gotta take this arrow and line it up
with<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:52.260> zero<00:02:53.120> now<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.180> issue<00:02:54.510> is<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:55.200> they

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
with the zero now the issue is that they

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.039 
with the zero now the issue is that they
don't<00:02:56.250> explain<00:02:56.579> in<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.819> manual<00:02:57.090> is<00:02:57.269> how<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.840> get

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
don't explain in a manual is how to get

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.720 
don't explain in a manual is how to get
to<00:02:58.079> zero<00:02:58.349> well<00:02:58.680> this<00:02:58.980> is<00:02:59.099> what<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.340> need<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.549> do

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
to zero well this is what you need to do

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.309 
to zero well this is what you need to do
is<00:03:00.180> hold<00:03:00.569> this<00:03:00.840> black<00:03:01.319> ring<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:02.239> spin<00:03:03.319> which

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
is hold this black ring and spin which

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.229 
is hold this black ring and spin which
doesn't<00:03:04.709> spin<00:03:04.919> freely<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.900> spin<00:03:07.189> the<00:03:08.239> orange

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
doesn't spin freely and spin the orange

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.789 
doesn't spin freely and spin the orange
gauge<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:10.439> zero

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
gauge to zero

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.210 
gauge to zero
and<00:03:11.700> then<00:03:11.849> you<00:03:12.000> go<00:03:12.120> back<00:03:12.269> over<00:03:12.599> here<00:03:13.220> ensure

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
and then you go back over here ensure

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.569 
and then you go back over here ensure
that<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:16.530> router<00:03:16.739> bit<00:03:16.949> is<00:03:17.099> not<00:03:17.280> touching

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
that the the router bit is not touching

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.240 
that the the router bit is not touching
the<00:03:17.760> wood<00:03:18.239> but<00:03:18.510> it's<00:03:18.690> just<00:03:18.930> right<00:03:19.139> above<00:03:19.379> it<00:03:19.530> so

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
the wood but it's just right above it so

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.059 
the wood but it's just right above it so
therefore<00:03:20.669> now<00:03:20.940> it's<00:03:21.180> set<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.569> zero<00:03:22.290> once

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
therefore now it's set to zero once

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.039 
therefore now it's set to zero once
you're<00:03:23.220> complete<00:03:23.430> you<00:03:24.150> go<00:03:24.299> ahead<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.690> lock<00:03:24.840> it

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
you're complete you go ahead and lock it

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.070 
you're complete you go ahead and lock it
in<00:03:25.139> the<00:03:25.260> back

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.550 

go<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.130> up<00:03:29.340> which<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:29.970> lock<00:03:30.260> it's<00:03:31.260> locked

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
go to the up which is a lock it's locked

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.310 
go to the up which is a lock it's locked
into<00:03:31.950> position<00:03:32.190> now<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:32.820> are<00:03:33.150> set<00:03:33.450> for

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
into position now you are set for

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.080 
into position now you are set for
routing<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.570> different<00:03:37.140> depths<00:03:37.820> now<00:03:38.820> as

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
routing and the different depths now as

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.380 
routing and the different depths now as
far<00:03:39.330> as<00:03:39.560> how<00:03:40.560> deep<00:03:40.920> does<00:03:41.340> it<00:03:41.400> go<00:03:41.550> after<00:03:41.820> a<00:03:42.000> full

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
far as how deep does it go after a full

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.090 
far as how deep does it go after a full
rotation<00:03:44.360> that<00:03:45.360> is<00:03:45.600> a<00:03:46.260> quarter<00:03:46.710> of<00:03:46.800> an<00:03:46.860> inch

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
rotation that is a quarter of an inch

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.520 
rotation that is a quarter of an inch
every<00:03:47.430> time<00:03:47.910> that<00:03:48.240> it<00:03:48.390> rotates<00:03:48.750> all<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.440> way

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
every time that it rotates all the way

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.720 
every time that it rotates all the way
through<00:03:49.800> is<00:03:49.980> a<00:03:50.040> quarter<00:03:50.580> of<00:03:50.670> an<00:03:50.730> edge<00:03:51.200> so

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
through is a quarter of an edge so

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.160 
through is a quarter of an edge so
that's<00:03:53.730> how<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.120> do<00:03:54.420> that<00:03:54.570> now<00:03:54.990> the<00:03:55.050> next

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
that's how you do that now the next

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.600 
that's how you do that now the next
thing<00:03:55.410> I<00:03:55.530> will<00:03:55.620> show<00:03:55.770> you<00:03:55.830> is<00:03:56.010> how<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.220> mount<00:03:56.400> it

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
thing I will show you is how to mount it

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.970 
thing I will show you is how to mount it
on<00:03:56.760> a<00:03:56.840> table<00:03:57.840> which<00:03:58.470> is<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.650> little<00:03:58.890> bit

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
on a table which is a little bit

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.880 
on a table which is a little bit
different<00:03:59.310> similar<00:03:59.670> but<00:03:59.880> different<00:04:00.890> and

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
different similar but different and

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.860 
different similar but different and
you'll<00:04:02.430> see<00:04:02.640> you<00:04:02.820> in<00:04:02.880> a<00:04:02.940> second<00:04:03.330> so<00:04:03.720> I'm<00:04:03.780> gonna

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
you'll see you in a second so I'm gonna

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:17.410 
you'll see you in a second so I'm gonna
go<00:04:03.990> ahead<00:04:04.020> and<00:04:04.430> mount<00:04:05.430> this<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:08.640> bottom

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.080 

it's<00:04:18.420> got<00:04:18.570> three<00:04:18.810> holes<00:04:19.049> three<00:04:19.500> screws<00:04:20.090> even

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
it's got three holes three screws even

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.540 
it's got three holes three screws even
though<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.299> surface<00:04:21.660> shows<00:04:21.900> four<00:04:22.550> there's

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
though the surface shows four there's

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.040 
though the surface shows four there's
only<00:04:23.700> three<00:04:24.030> places<00:04:24.240> you<00:04:24.450> can<00:04:24.570> put<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.780> screws

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
only three places you can put the screws

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.620 
only three places you can put the screws
therefore<00:04:25.530> you<00:04:25.650> can't<00:04:25.860> put<00:04:26.040> it<00:04:26.130> in<00:04:26.220> backwards

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
therefore you can't put it in backwards

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:39.200 
therefore you can't put it in backwards
it's<00:04:27.630> pretty<00:04:27.930> smart<00:04:28.080> design
