and<00:03:20.720> my<00:03:20.810> teammate<00:03:21.200> is<00:03:21.350> miles<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:22.489> miles<00:03:22.760> ahead

at<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.269> top<00:03:23.420> of<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.600> grid<00:03:23.780> I<00:03:23.810> think<00:03:23.989> he's

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
at the top of the grid I think he's

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.479 
at the top of the grid I think he's
second<00:03:24.500> or<00:03:24.650> third<00:03:24.889> at<00:03:25.069> the<00:03:25.130> moment<00:03:25.340> but<00:03:25.430> that's

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
second or third at the moment but that's

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.580 
second or third at the moment but that's
not<00:03:25.850> really<00:03:26.209> important<00:03:27.049> then<00:03:27.170> Lonzo<00:03:27.470> is

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
not really important then Lonzo is

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.530 
not really important then Lonzo is
leaving<00:03:27.799> the<00:03:27.889> race<00:03:28.040> but<00:03:28.340> we<00:03:29.120> are<00:03:29.269> in<00:03:29.420> the

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.509 
leaving the race but we are in the

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519

the<00:03:31.639> points<00:03:31.940> but<00:03:32.090> how<00:03:32.269> much<00:03:32.420> further<00:03:32.690> can<00:03:32.840> we

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109
