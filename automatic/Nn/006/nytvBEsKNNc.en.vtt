00:00:21.196 --> 00:00:23.785
 matches of the Polish Superleague always give a thrill 

00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:27.558
 that's why today, during the meeting "Vive Targi Kielce" - "Orlen Wisła Płock" 

00:00:27.558 --> 00:00:33.554
 We would like to show you the behind-the-scenes work of people, thanks to whom these emotions from the Legions' Hall reach your homes 

00:00:46.748 --> 00:00:51.434
 There are eight service cameras, but actually about 10 cameras take part in the entire implementation - up to 11. 

00:00:54.975 --> 00:00:58.261
 it is a number of about 35 to 40 people. 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.072
 the publisher is really the head of the broadcast 

00:01:03.202 --> 00:01:07.109
 the vision realizer is responsible for the cameras, production manager for the entire crew and the editor for the editorial office. 

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:12.707
 that is, the publisher must actually write the so-called szpigiel. 

00:01:12.707 --> 00:01:17.053
 this is broadcasting every minute. It decides from the moment you enter the antenna 

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:21.668
 until the end of transmission as this transmission will look substantive 

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:30.667
 [Radek - not jealousy] 

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:36.229
 no, I'm not jealous ... I do not want glass 

00:01:42.796 --> 00:01:44.120
 I welcome everyone here, Michał Jurecki and ... 

00:01:44.115 --> 00:01:45.630
 Artur Siódmiak 

00:01:45.634 --> 00:01:49.430
 Michał: Where do these questions come from because sometimes they are not related to sport at all? 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:55.560
 Artur: I invent them, and besides, my knowledge of you ... i.e. players and club leaders 

00:01:55.555 --> 00:01:59.590
 they allow me some looseness and such non-bothering questions. 

00:02:00.065 --> 00:02:03.620
 Michał: For sure. Because we played a lot together not only in the squad but also in the club 

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:09.160
 you certainly know me well and not just me because most Poles 

00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:13.100
 but you know this foreign group slowly now 

00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:21.430
 Artur: Actually. A Balkan mafia has gathered here (laughs) 

00:02:21.432 --> 00:02:26.970
 I think that you are a cool collective as a club and I am always happy to come here 

00:02:27.215 --> 00:02:30.180
 I greet the fans from Kielce and not only from Kielce but everyone in Poland 

00:02:30.748 --> 00:02:33.870
 and today I will ask you about a few other things 

00:02:33.868 --> 00:02:37.310
 Michał: No, no, no. Today I am asking you and not me. 

00:02:37.311 --> 00:02:39.770
 Artur: For now !, because you see what is written here - "Vive Targi Kielce TV" 

00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:42.820
 and I will question you with this other cube here 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.070
 Michał: I do not know if I agree, because I have to prepare for the match 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.540
 a little stretch, practice to make this match look very good on our part 

00:02:51.542 --> 00:02:55.150
 Artur: and that's exactly what I want to ask you today because I know it and you know it 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:58.580
 how it looks in the locker room and not everyone knows it, also fans 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:03.340
 and, for example, you will say what you are doing - the first how you tie your shoes, what you are doing 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.350
 or what was wrong with you when you prepared for the match 

00:03:07.736 --> 00:03:08.230
 Michał: what I ate of course ... 

00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:12.900
 Artur: and there ... what you ate I know - solid ..., macaroon. 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.100
 Michał: of course ... and you see how Artur knows me well. He knows that on the day of the match I always eat pasta 

00:03:17.102 --> 00:03:22.800
 Artur: and I will ask you for a few other things also wait for me ... for a hail of questions. 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:23.690
 Michał: thank you very much and to hear! 

00:03:34.215 --> 00:03:36.960
 The most recent injury is Manu's injury. 

00:03:37.618 --> 00:03:41.100
 fortunately, it is not as serious as it appeared at the beginning 

00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:45.110
 and I think that's our biggest pain for now 

00:03:46.824 --> 00:03:51.020
 the rest of the boys are recovering. Krzysiek Lijewski and Musa. 

00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:52.500
 [Musa where are you going?] 

00:03:53.693 --> 00:03:58.750
 I'm going through Świętokrzyskie ... quickly, quickly ... 

00:03:58.751 --> 00:03:59.570
 [by Świętokrzyskie?] 

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.170
 Yes Yes! 

00:04:01.173 --> 00:04:05.780
 there is a pump! I invite you to the gym, we go to do the pump ... biceps, triceps 

00:04:05.784 --> 00:04:09.020
 I'm going to compete in the Tour de Kielce right away .. 

00:04:10.134 --> 00:04:12.580
 oh ..., I'm worried about Ziggi! If you see him, say goodbye to Ziggi and say that I'm worried 

00:04:12.576 --> 00:04:16.840
 for his throat. I hope everything is ok, Ziggi! Greetings .. schöne grüße! 

00:04:36.934 --> 00:04:38.930
 [he took up the challenge] 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.720
 about kur..de 

00:04:51.596 --> 00:04:55.300
 it's very good, but the law does not go ... (laughs) 

00:04:56.948 --> 00:04:58.140
 but I said - zero filming 

00:04:59.854 --> 00:05:01.230
 Come on now, we'll cuddle ... 

00:05:12.475 --> 00:05:18.030
 A sunny day always improves the team's morale 

00:05:18.622 --> 00:05:20.940
 but the weather is the same for both teams. 

00:05:23.982 --> 00:05:25.980
 [oi we have Kamil Syprzek ... how are you? ] 

00:05:26.702 --> 00:05:27.230
 very good 

00:05:27.231 --> 00:05:28.530
 [how the trip passed, how day?] 

00:05:29.181 --> 00:05:31.650
 sunny day and the trip quickly. 

00:05:32.153 --> 00:05:34.460
 [you listen to Red Hotów ... is your favorite band?] 

00:05:35.133 --> 00:05:36.170
 one of the favorites 

00:05:50.544 --> 00:05:53.780
 These are the two best teams in Poland 

00:05:55.373 --> 00:05:58.790
 and this is also a great battle when they play against each other
