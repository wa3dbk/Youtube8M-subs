00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.840 
there unfortunately the normal size tile
doesn't<00:03:53.079> have<00:03:53.410> any<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:53.980> message<00:03:54.340> previewing

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
and it doesn't flip over which it's

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.830 
and it doesn't flip over which it's
actually<00:03:57.400> lagging<00:03:57.760> behind<00:03:57.850> facebook<00:03:58.329> said

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
actually lagging behind facebook said

actually lagging behind facebook said
you<00:03:58.930> can<00:03:59.079> see<00:03:59.260> facebook<00:03:59.470> flips<00:04:00.010> over<00:04:00.250> there

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
you can see facebook flips over there

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.300 
you can see facebook flips over there
and<00:04:00.760> tells<00:04:01.600> you<00:04:01.780> about<00:04:01.930> your<00:04:02.230> notification<00:04:02.920> so

and tells you about your notification so

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.949 
and tells you about your notification so
that's<00:04:03.910> actually<00:04:04.299> lagging<00:04:04.660> a<00:04:04.720> little<00:04:04.750> behind

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
that's actually lagging a little behind

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.979 
that's actually lagging a little behind
but<00:04:05.620> that<00:04:06.310> also<00:04:06.700> does<00:04:07.000> have<00:04:07.239> lock<00:04:07.660> screen

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989

too<00:05:23.590> so<00:05:24.310> it's<00:05:24.820> doing<00:05:24.970> a<00:05:25.060> lot<00:05:25.180> of<00:05:25.240> work<00:05:25.480> there

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
too so it's doing a lot of work there

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.500 
too so it's doing a lot of work there
and<00:05:26.140> it's<00:05:26.890> just<00:05:27.280> a<00:05:27.490> really<00:05:27.790> good<00:05:28.000> example<00:05:28.480> of

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
and it's just a really good example of

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.750 
and it's just a really good example of
well-designed<00:05:29.080> Windows<00:05:29.620> Phone<00:05:29.800> out<00:05:30.010> like<00:05:30.640> I

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
well-designed Windows Phone out like I

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.150 
well-designed Windows Phone out like I
said<00:05:30.820> there's<00:05:31.150> a<00:05:31.210> very<00:05:31.560> few<00:05:32.560> nitpicky<00:05:33.130> things

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
said there's a very few nitpicky things

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.790 
said there's a very few nitpicky things
about<00:05:33.640> the<00:05:33.820> app<00:05:33.940> that's<00:05:34.330> not<00:05:34.540> perfect<00:05:35.200> like<00:05:35.500> I

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
about the app that's not perfect like I

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.310 
about the app that's not perfect like I
think<00:05:36.720> conversations<00:05:37.720> view<00:05:37.960> it<00:05:38.110> should

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
think conversations view it should

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.940 
think conversations view it should
actually<00:05:39.310> preview<00:05:39.970> the<00:05:40.150> message<00:05:40.510> as<00:05:40.950> in

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
actually preview the message as in

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.420 
actually preview the message as in
Windows<00:05:42.550> Phone<00:05:42.790> style<00:05:43.750> like<00:05:44.650> your<00:05:45.070> normal

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
Windows Phone style like your normal

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.030 
Windows Phone style like your normal
text<00:05:45.910> messages<00:05:46.060> how<00:05:46.600> it<00:05:46.720> previews<00:05:47.170> them<00:05:47.380> so<00:05:47.950> it

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
text messages how it previews them so it

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.590 
text messages how it previews them so it
doesn't<00:05:48.280> really<00:05:48.340> follow<00:05:48.580> that<00:05:48.850> design<00:05:49.180> and<00:05:49.510> it

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
doesn't really follow that design and it

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.990 
doesn't really follow that design and it
could<00:05:49.810> do<00:05:49.900> that<00:05:50.050> better<00:05:50.320> and<00:05:50.650> it<00:05:51.340> could<00:05:51.490> do<00:05:51.640> few

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
could do that better and it could do few

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.330 
could do that better and it could do few
little<00:05:52.330> things<00:05:52.360> better<00:05:52.810> but<00:05:53.200> overall<00:05:54.160> it's

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
little things better but overall it's

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.830 
little things better but overall it's
looking<00:05:54.580> really<00:05:54.700> good<00:05:54.880> and<00:05:55.120> oh<00:05:55.330> one

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
not find out if you go to the settings

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.620 
not find out if you go to the settings
and<00:06:01.800> application<00:06:02.800> settings<00:06:03.040> if<00:06:03.340> you<00:06:04.210> find<00:06:04.480> the

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
and application settings if you find the

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.660 
and application settings if you find the
text<00:06:05.170> keyboards<00:06:05.860> be<00:06:06.040> really<00:06:06.400> annoying

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:06.670 
text keyboards be really annoying

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.000 
text keyboards be really annoying
because<00:06:07.120> it<00:06:07.540> doesn't<00:06:07.810> auto<00:06:07.960> correct<00:06:08.080> you<00:06:08.830> can

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.010 
because it doesn't auto correct you can

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.800 
because it doesn't auto correct you can
actually<00:06:09.160> set<00:06:09.490> that<00:06:09.700> and<00:06:09.910> switch<00:06:10.330> between<00:06:10.360> the

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
actually set that and switch between the

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.440 
actually set that and switch between the
chat<00:06:11.050> or<00:06:11.290> text<00:06:11.560> or<00:06:11.950> even<00:06:12.490> default<00:06:12.910> which<00:06:13.060> is<00:06:13.210> no

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
chat or text or even default which is no

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.210 
chat or text or even default which is no
auto<00:06:13.720> correct<00:06:14.110> so<00:06:14.680> that's<00:06:14.800> really<00:06:15.100> nice

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
auto correct so that's really nice

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.880 
auto correct so that's really nice
because<00:06:15.460> i<00:06:15.610> hated<00:06:15.970> the<00:06:16.270> default<00:06:16.750> chat<00:06:17.260> one

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
because i hated the default chat one

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.590 
because i hated the default chat one
because<00:06:18.700> they<00:06:18.820> would<00:06:18.940> never<00:06:19.120> correct

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
because they would never correct

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.440 
because they would never correct
anything<00:06:19.840> and<00:06:20.830> I<00:06:21.160> realized<00:06:21.580> how<00:06:21.790> terrible<00:06:22.390> my

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.450 
anything and I realized how terrible my

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.570 
anything and I realized how terrible my
typing<00:06:22.990> was<00:06:23.170> without<00:06:23.530> the<00:06:23.710> auto<00:06:23.860> correct<00:06:24.250> so

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
typing was without the auto correct so

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.730 
typing was without the auto correct so
really<00:06:25.450> awesome<00:06:25.840> that<00:06:25.870> you<00:06:26.110> can<00:06:26.260> change<00:06:26.470> that

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
really awesome that you can change that

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.630 
really awesome that you can change that
now<00:06:26.980> so<00:06:27.880> overall<00:06:28.810> it's<00:06:29.110> a<00:06:29.260> good<00:06:29.830> app<00:06:30.010> and<00:06:30.250> if
