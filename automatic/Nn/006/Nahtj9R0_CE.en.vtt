00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:23.619
 of course, the drivers cd in addition 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:26.320

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.270
 an adapter what you put that from the 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.490
 to switch off euro the housing and the 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.090
 hardware led on the mainboard 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.680
 relieved is quite practical and here 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.070
 of course, the blind for the 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.720
 Connections to the housing afterwards 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.030
 attaching we come now to the mainboard 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.710
 itself as external connections offers that 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.090
 mainboard six usb 2.0 2 usb 3.0 the 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.550
 marked as blue 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.220
 a hdmi connection a dvi connection 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.009
 even a VGA connection 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.340
 Gigabit ethernet ports and the standard 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.110
 Connections such as sound and microphone to the 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.450
 interna connections belong to the socket l 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.570
 550 intended for Intel processors 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.660
 It is supported by core i3 to core 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.220
 i7 processors are still four dimm 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.470
 slots installed for yours 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.880
 Memory of up to 32 gigabytes 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.250
 is expandable 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.519
 he supports the maximum 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.079
 speed of 2,600 megahertz 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.380
 Of course, you should pay attention to how 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:28.720
 supports a lot of new cpu 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.769
 There are three pci slots installed

 graphics cards 4 x sata 2 that is now 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.530
 intended for hard drives and drives 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.140
 and two sata 3 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.370
 which should be used for your ssds 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.470
 so you get the full performance 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.880
