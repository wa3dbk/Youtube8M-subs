00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 nine people wants to come his new one 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.350
 tutorial today sometimes something built this 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.139
 already have some of me 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.330
 desired and that one fireballs 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.830
 i have nice weather i want you 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.740
 the running shoes are irrelevant faster 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.250
 am from the last video of yesterday or 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.369
 the day before yesterday 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.050
 I do not remember exactly lakers 1 and 2 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.890
 the fireballs are so far 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.980
 pretty pointless 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.390
 The contacts of grass are celebrated 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.640
 or be stretched by command long 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.990
 until now that the player built the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.349
 just use it can shoot with it 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.010
 can 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.710
 should i do it here are goals 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.450
 are distributed 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.820
 Frames with yellow glass in there maybe 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.340
 you can see that a bit 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.500
 probably not 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.000
 and probably this year 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.200
 that I met, though 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.579
 asked people to zero that it 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.440
 otherwise it can only be broken 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.640
 realize that I'm meeting and doing it 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.879
 following me with the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.859
 crosshairs exactly on the yellow on the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.260
 then frame a lot of money then glass 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.539
 I push cow throws you away from one 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.430
 and the skis are simple or accurate 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.049
 The thing here is the frame is now 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.890
 empty 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.729
 At least that works all 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.390
 directions i can still go here 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.520
 throw shooting sight directly on it 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.770
 and shoot 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.420
 if we broke the thing that thing 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.549
 I can now again make yes 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:30.670
 not quite hit 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:32.289
 targeted so this is to aim and away 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.939
 then simply throw the item out with q 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:42.909
 then the bullet spurs you right in front of you 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:44.289
 and me you and for the idea of 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.399
 have mothers or say we know how 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.739
 complicated so what can one 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.630
 they already realized it's difficult 

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:50.950
 because i always have this bullet in it 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.299
 look direction spawn that was the 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.159
 difficulty and the special 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.750
 this tutorial today 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:00.069
 I hope not that easy for her I 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.840
 probably have the bullet if you have 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:06.789
 as always strained in the direction 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:11.039
 where I look that bond it bond 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.039
 James Bond 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:30.090
 yes I'll try playing knows it now 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.090
 take a look at the lobby 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.819
 has often met yes like the whole 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.819
 is working 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:48.500
 We see that now after my death anal 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:52.239
 epic katja and there we are too 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.129
 again fireballs respectively 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.870
 Celebrating archer centers when you open it 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.909
 English says I have the even 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.900
 even think that I'm taking time just in 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:06.650
 came out and that 's the last one to that 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.690
 bit for this is that so little is back 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.700
 I can find a lot here clear 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:16.030
 works well you are here 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.560
 completely eight pieces next to each other and 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.040
 play the main role here so completely 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.280
 just when an item is there we look 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.099
 whether winning is celebrated just has to be here 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.040
 shows since killing and me here 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:33.230
 life is simple but that special 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.919
 this is my direction spoken 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.090
 you will see her turn 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:44.750
 then they will all gradually 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:48.620
 Activates or deactivates as always 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.269
 where I reactivated and that we were with 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.949
 this command and have now also to 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.269
 For the first time I tried it right away 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:57.739
 complicated how does it look different and 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:02.389
 though we have test for epilepsy lawn 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:06.669
 is - 22 11 22 we'll remember first 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:13.930
 that he is important ypsilantis yet 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:17.239
 rx but if we press three now then 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:24.380
 we see here at this point where now 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:27.380
 singles 32 numbers - 6842 currently so that 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.150
 first that's the y 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.430
 the second is the ixs you have to go 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.039
 Remember that y describes the direction 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.419
 where I look and the xlsx we leave 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:35.900
 times completely ignored is trying out the 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.460
 direction 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.389
 earlier you could have installed as well 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.190
 too slow but a bit 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:46.700
 complicated 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:50.180
 so now here's -22 it's y / y m 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:54.890
 that is minimum is 22 so that's it 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.670
 gives a tick of 22 is - 22 so 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.770
 actually it should have done differently 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:02.330
 but can at least pay the first of 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:08.180
 22 -23 then we are looking for nothing 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:09.680
 22 this is about 22 now and go now 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.030
 We turn right around until they join us 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:17.420
 minus 22 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:20.300
 because in the middle of the dunes that is here 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.920
 that in the area where we are long 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.080
 fans are there that is all activated and 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.400
 in this area does not speak now 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.470
 under cook must be exactly that 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:33.770
 activities yes and once that's over 22 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:37.040
 is that changing so that's the trick 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.100
 I always have seven eighths of that 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.150
 range soma animals therefore made about 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:44.900
 now I have calculated and then 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:48.020
 purely here you can see that and 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.570
 Accordingly, only one out when 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.010
 I throw in the team then it works 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:56.710
 Here is a brief note to the torch 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:59.210
 and all these repeaters are going out too 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.520
 and then that's why one of 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:08.750
 I am capable of these things the first one 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:11.330
 windrad show can we say here 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.070
 if this is out and here too short 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.300
 out is one of these command 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.640
 blocks for a moment not at all 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.890
 built as the are so consistently from 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.590
 built here and always seven from here 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.690
 built and once I get a ball advertising 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:26.120
 you have seen is very short 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.040
 went out and this command glock 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.050
 it was not built at all for a very short time 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.910
 but was tried again immediately afterwards 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.800
 and then directly the firebirds 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.850
 gisborne and this pony has always been relative 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.850
 to the direction 

00:06:39.329 --> 00:06:44.349
 yes that's all the magic 

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:46.059
 so you can do it with the 

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:49.749
 just stop watching 

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:53.139
 that goes from minus 90 90 there you have it 

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:54.699
 also with minimum and so yes and 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:56.589
 That's the whole thing 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:59.309
 if you do not have a minimum one time it is 

00:06:56.589 --> 00:07:02.049
 automatically 0 so do not be surprised 

00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:05.019
 I hope I can not help and me 

00:07:02.049 --> 00:07:07.389
 If you find the personality you are the one and the 

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:10.329
 Meeting always has exactly what you need 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:16.439
 right now is exactly the point as 

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:16.439
 they get their forces as in the crosshairs so 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:23.279
 then I'll meet him too, I hope so 

00:07:20.619 --> 00:07:23.279
 you liked it
